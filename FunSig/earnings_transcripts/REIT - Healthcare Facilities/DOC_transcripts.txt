===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Healthpeak Properties, Inc.’s First Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Johns, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Johns: Welcome to Healthpeak’s fourth quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Today’s conference call contains certain forward-looking statements. Although we believe expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. A discussion of risks and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. In an exhibit to the 8-K we furnished to the SEC yesterday, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance to Reg G. The exhibit is also available on our website at healthpeak.com. I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Brinker.
Scott Brinker: Thanks Andrew, and welcome to Healthpeak’s first quarter earnings call. We are excited to introduce Kelvin Moses as our new CFO, who will be an outstanding partner for me and the senior team. When I took this role in October of 2022, I talked about getting Healthpeak closer to our real estate, immersing ourselves in the underlying business of our tenants to drive better capital allocation decisions. The merger with Physicians accelerated our transformation and Kelvin's promotion moves us further in that direction. His well-rounded experience includes healthcare, operations, portfolio management, transactions and development. Kelvin has been with Healthpeak for seven years and excelled at every role we've given him. As I reflected on what the role of the CFO should be at Healthpeak, we have had the luxury of outstanding in-place leadership in accounting, finance, capital markets and investor relations. This allows Kelvin to be more of a strategic and operational CFO and we expect a seamless transition. Our existing strategy around leveraging the balance sheet will not change. Today our executive team is 45 years old on average with an average tenure of 10 years at Healthpeak. Every one of us was internally promoted to our current position. This points to a strong culture, deep bench and thoughtful succession planning. Thank you to our entire team for another quarter of excellence and execution, one of the we care core values that define our culture. Execution is important in any environment, but particularly in this backdrop. This team has worked diligently to meet or exceed expectations, including earnings, leasing and merger synergies. Kelvin will cover guidance in more detail, but I want to comment that maintaining guidance against this market backdrop is a testament to our diversified high quality portfolio. Strong results in Outpatient Medical and Senior Housing are offsetting weakness in our lab business caused by actions and comments from Washington that impacted biotech capital raising and I'll come back to this topic. We produced another strong quarter in Outpatient Medical, our largest business segment. Across the outpatient sector demand is outpacing new supply, a trend we expect will remain in our favor due to the high cost of new construction. Our decision to internalize property management has been an overwhelming success strategically and financially. We completed an additional 4.5 million square feet since January 1 with additional markets in the pipeline. Outpatient Medical is one of the very few sectors in all of real estate with positive NOI growth every year for the past two decades. We expect that portfolio to outperform other sectors if the economy slows down and we foresee de minimis impact from tariffs. Our Senior Housing portfolio had another strong quarter of occupancy and rental rate growth driving positive 16% same-store growth. With occupancy at 86% we still have plenty of upside to capture and I'm very happy with the strategic and tactical decisions we've made to grow NOI in these properties. Moving to our Lab business, which represents approximately 35% of our income, there's been a barrage of headlines, so consider these thoughts to be an alternative perspective. No doubt it's a bumpy road right now, but we do see some themes emerging that could be positive for our lab business over time. Most important is our government's focus on China, which has been making a big push to challenge America's leadership position in the biopharma sector. Our view is that policymakers in a bipartisan way have correctly identified U.S. based biopharma as being paramount to our national security and economic prosperity. We see very little chance that an America first agenda leaves behind the biopharma sector. For too long, innovation from the U.S. has subsidized medicines around the world and other countries have captured too much control of the supply chain. Washington's willingness to address these risks and inequities has the potential to be very positive for life science and real estate demand here in the U.S. This includes the push to onshore biomanufacturing and would logically include R&D as well. There appears to be support in Washington to address the profitability and complexity of PBMs and to eliminate the so called pill penalty in the Inflation Reduction Act, which would extend market exclusivity for small molecule drugs by four years. Both changes would improve biopharma return on investment and therefore demand for less space. A functional FDA is critical to the U.S. maintaining its leadership position in the sector. Today it takes at least 10 years and $1 billion to bring a drug to market in the U.S. It's in our national interest to look for ways to make that process more efficient. The recent job cuts at the FDA captured headlines, but did not impact the scientists or the reviewers. It is early, but the feedback today from our tenants suggests normal response times from the FDA with only isolated delays. Final drug approvals have continued at the FDA since the inauguration. New applications have been approved as well, including last week for one of our tenants to start Phase 1 trials for gene edited liver transplant. There's also discussion at the FDA of using technology to replace expensive vivarium [ph] work and a new conditional approval which could shorten the timeline for costly Phase 3 trials. The point is, there's some early evidence that the FDA is looking to encourage innovation and create faster timelines. Last point I'll make on this topic is that consumers also vote in elections and consumer demand for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics is not going away. In fact, demand is projected to accelerate to 8% per year through 2030. We expect voters to push their elected representatives to support medical innovation. Specific to our portfolio, we continue to focus on capturing market share with our high quality portfolio. We've signed 450,000 square feet of leases year-to-date and our pipeline is the largest it's been since last summer. It would not surprise us to see some tenants delay final leasing decisions given the environment, but we see this as demand getting pushed back, not eliminated. Finally, we've even more confidence today that new supply in the sector will essentially go to zero for many years to come. This is obviously a great foundation for recovery in our lab business. I want to comment on recent capital allocation by this team which puts our balance sheet and liquidity in an enviable position. First, we were early to shut down capital allocation to Life Science and we have not started a new development since 2021. Second, we executed the merger with Physicians Realty Trust which increased our allocation to the stable and attractive outpatient medical business to just over 50% while generating earnings accretion, improving our balance sheet and creating the best platform in the outpatient sector. Finally, we sold $1.4 billion of stabilized assets at a very attractive 6.3% cap rate and used the proceeds to fully fund our development pipeline, buy back almost $300 million of stock at an implied 8% cap rate and bring leverage down to the low 5s. We also reduced floating rate debt from 20% to almost zero. That brings us to today, our life science loan pipeline is active and we continue to see opportunity to position Healthpeak for the inevitable recovery. We still believe the best time to invest is when others are not. But as market uncertainty has increased, we stepped back to reassess the appropriate risk adjusted returns, which may be different than three to six months ago when certain transactions were negotiated. We chose to maintain our $500 million investment guidance this year, but we've now included stock buybacks in that line item to reflect our optionality. In any event, we intend to maintain leverage within our target range in the mid 5s. I'm happy to turn the call to Kelvin.
Kelvin Moses: Thank you, Scott for the warm introduction. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to grow within Healthpeak's leadership. In this role I'm excited to continue to help shape our business strategy and influence the outcomes that drive our operating results. The complement of my real estate and transactions mindset, alongside of this outstanding team, will allow us to continue to focus on discipline, capital allocation decisions that will deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Before we get started with the first quarter results, I wanted to share a brief update on our master plan development project in West Cambridge. I've spent the last five years working closely in the Boston market to help build our Lab portfolio, including our land assemblage and entitlement efforts for our Cambridge Point master plan. On behalf of the team, I'm pleased to announce that we've selected Hines to join as the development partner to advance the residential component of the project. Hines brings a depth of expertise in place making, multifamily construction and mixed use development which will allow us to commence this project once we are fully entitled late next year. We are extremely pleased with this outcome and the partnership with Hines advances our vision to establish a mixed use destination of scale and validates this generational opportunity that will be delivered over the next decade plus. Now turning to the first quarter financial and operating results, we reported FFOs adjusted of $0.46 per share, AFFO of $0.43 per share and total portfolio same-store growth of 7%. Moving to segment performance, in Outpatient Medical, we reported first quarter same-store growth of 5% driven by strong tenant retention, a positive rent mark to market of 4.1%, and the benefit from our continued internalization efforts. During the quarter we executed nearly 1 million square feet of leases, including 265,000 square feet of new leasing which was followed up by a strong and active pipeline as we head into the second quarter. Fundamentals for the outpatient business have never been stronger and our team is working hard to translate this favorable backdrop into higher occupancy, stronger rent mark to market and ultimately cash flow growth. Turning to Lab, we reported same-store growth of 7.7% which includes the positive impact from the expiration of pre-rent on two large leases in South San Francisco and a full quarter benefit of internalization. For the balance of the year we expect quarterly same-store growth to decelerate as the benefits of internalization and free rent normalize. Despite the challenging market backdrop, we continue to see strong demand for space within our portfolio and year-to-date through April we've signed 443,000 square feet of leases and have entered into LOIs on an additional 400,000 square feet. And finally CCRCs, we reported same-store growth of 15.9% driven by rate growth of approximately 6% and 100 basis point increase in occupancy. Shifting to the balance sheet, in February we issued $500 million unsecured notes at a rate of 5.375%, that is 102 basis points spread over the 10-year and this was also the tightest 10-year spread in the history of Healthpeak. We end the first quarter at 5.2 times net debt to EBITDA and $2.8 billion of available liquidity which further positions our balance sheet for long-term success. Ending with guidance. We are maintaining our FFO as adjusted guidance in the range of $1.81 per share to $1.87 per share. We are also maintaining our blended portfolio of same-store growth in the range of 3% to 4% which reflects the strong performance during this first quarter. The strength of this diversified portfolio reinforces our ability to maintain guidance and allows us to direct our business strategy towards initiatives that will provide the greatest long-term value to the company. With that operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Farrell Granath with Bank of America. Farrell, please go ahead.
Farrell Granath: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations Kelvin on the new position. My question is about you've made comments about weakness in life science and I appreciate all the comments that you made on the policy front. I'm curious kind of in a broader sense what would change you to a more positive expectation and performance perhaps in the back half of 2025 if there's any news or updates to be expected?
Kelvin Moses: Yes Farrell, good to hear from you this morning. I'll start with that. Scott Bohn probably has some comments as well. But I think important that we do have a diversified portfolio. Just to start with 65% is in industries with really strong fundamentals and across the entire portfolio. But life science in particular, very high quality assets and platform where I think we've been outperforming the market at large and I think that will continue. Obviously there's a lot of instability and uncertainty in certain sectors right now, if not most sectors. Biopharma is one of them, whether it's tariffs or capital raising or regulatory uncertainty. We think that does start to calm down over the balance of the year. Obviously certain things they've already backed away from pressure from Congress or just the American public and I do think that will benefit the sector and add some stability. But the first 90 days or 120 days of this quarter were not ideal from a capital raising standpoint. That's not new information in terms of what's happened with IPOs or venture capital or secondary funding. So we still see a lot of upside. Certainly the patent cliffs that the big pharma needs to fill that is not going away and biotech is the likely spot for them to look. There's a deal announced yesterday just as an example. So there are things that we can point to that we see as potential inflection points, but the first 120 days was not ideal from a capital raising standpoint.
Farrell Granath: Thank you. And also I guess then on you made comments about potential pushouts of releasing Indo [ph] life science, so I think if you could potentially quantify that with your current pipeline if that is what you're seeing are things getting pushed out by single quarters or longer term decision making?
Kelvin Moses: Yes, I mean we signed 250,000 feet plus of leases in the first quarter. Continued momentum into April, really strong LOI pipeline. And as I mentioned there's a pipeline beyond that tours, prospects, proposals that is the largest it's been since last summer. So we actually feel pretty good about the leasing that we're doing and we do have 400 to 500 basis points of leases that have been signed that are just not yet occupied and paying rent. But obviously those leases will commence in the coming quarters. So there's clearly some positives, so we feel good about that. Bohn, you should comment.
Scott Bohn: Hey, Ferrell its Scott Bohn. I mean, the thing I would add too is that the tenants that are in our LOI pipeline or active demand pipeline, those are tenants that are typically have raised capital or already have well capitalized balance sheets and aren't the groups who need to raise capital in the next six months. So groups who are executing on their business plan and can play through kind of some of this noise here.
Farrell Granath: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. John, please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Good morning. Thank you. I guess first question would be on the guide. The $500 million of investments. Were the share repurchases driven by the relative attractiveness of the stock or is that more due to the difficulty of underwriting lab here?
Scott Brinker: Oh it’s more the attractiveness of the stock. We have the luxury of a strong balance sheet that gives us optionality and flexibility. We bought back stock year-to-date, almost $100 million at a roughly 10% FFO yield for a really high quality portfolio, so that was the driver.
John Kilichowski: Okay. And I guess on, you know, in terms of underwriting Lab in an environment like this, how has it changed for you in terms of what you need to see maybe pre and post Liberation Day?
Scott Brinker: Yes, it's more just timelines for leasing. I don't know that rental rates are changing in any material way. It's just if we underwrote a two-year lease up six months ago, that might be a longer lease up today. There's just uncertainty. It may end up being less, let’s see. The headlines today change daily, if not hourly. But from where we sit today, we would be smart to underwrite a longer lease up than we would have six months ago.
Scott Bohn: Yes, I would also add it's less about kind of Liberation Day and the tariffs than it is about the -- just the uncertainty and instability to NIH funding and the FDA more so than tariffs that’s what we’re looking at.
John Kilichowski: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with Keybanc Capital Markets. Austin, please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. Scott Brinker, just going back to your comments about weakness in the lab business, I guess can you just provide an update about the health of the tenant base and more specifically the watch list and whether there's any signs of credit concerns emerging at this point?
Scott Brinker: Yes, we had a significant improvement in rent collections and bad debt in 2024 relative to 2023 on top of really strong leasing volumes. But at any point in time a number of our tenants are in the market actively raising capital and that it's just been a lot more difficult for the last three to four months. So there's a number that are still in process of trying to raise money, unclear if they'll make it or not. A lot depends on whether some of this regulatory uncertainty and market chaos stabilizes, in which case I think a good number of them will end up raising money and if not, obviously a number of them will not. So we still feel like the guidance range that we've reaffirmed by the way, so there's no change in guidance or same-store captures the potential upside and downside scenarios from where we sit today.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to your comment about risk adjusted returns and potentially moved here versus three to six months ago. I mean, how many of the parties that you're speaking with are in need of a solution in the near-term and could be price takers where you think maybe you can still get a deal done, particularly on sort of the loan investments that you've spoken to?
Scott Brinker: Yes, I think it's too early to speculate on that, Austin. We'll have more clarity in the coming weeks and months, but I hesitate to try to give precise feedback on a question like that. I appreciate the question itself, but we're just too early in that process.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald, please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, just going back to sort of the guidance and just a little bit more details, because presumably a lot of the decelerations coming from the lab side. Right? Because the MOBs and DCRCs seems pretty stable as you mentioned. Just is it all sort of free rent deceleration? Just what's the color on sort of the decel on the Lab side would be more helpful? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Well, yes Ron, even in the Outpatient and Senior Housing sector, our first quarter results were significantly ahead of the initial year guidance for those segments. So there could be some deceleration in all three segments. But I think you're right, the bigger drop is more likely to be in life science. We did have free rent that was supported our first quarter result, the benefit of internalization which we’ll no longer have that year over year benefit in life science. So that will have an impact as well. And then just the uncertainty that I mentioned earlier around the funding environment.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And just my follow-up would be, are any, do you think about sort of your three markets, San Diego, Boston, San Francisco, is there one that's better positioned or worse positioned from all these sort of funding environments and cuts so forth? Just trying to figure out what the ranking looks like in your minds. Thanks.
Scott Bohn: Yes, hey Ron, it's Scott Bohn. I think Boston overall relative to market size continues to be the slowest. We're fortunate to have several growth tenants there driving the demand within our portfolio and very little role. We're vacant space there. So we're in good shape in Boston, all things equal. But I would say from a demand perspective it's probably the slowest. San Diego has been pretty consistent over the past 12 to 18 months and in San Francisco, we clearly see the most demand there and part of that is due to our portfolio and our scale and we do a lot of deals that don't hit the active broker sheets, so that's the order I would rank them.
Ronald Kamdem: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Bergey with Citi. Seth, please go ahead.
Seth Bergey: Hi, thanks. Can you give some more color on the 2Q Lab leasing activity to date? Is that from the development pipeline and kind of what does the rents look like for that space?
Scott Bohn: Yes, for the 2Q numbers, I don't think we're going to get into the quantum of the LOIs. Most of the LOIs are in the operating portfolio. But the pipeline as Scott mentioned is as strong as it's been since last summer and there are certainly deals in that pipeline that do fall into that dev and re-dev bucket. But I don't think we're ready to get into the details of those deals just yet because it'll matter when they're executions versus pipeline.
Seth Bergey: Okay great. And then just for the follow-up for the $500 million of investments activity, how are you kind of thinking about capital allocation in terms of, you know, development or external growth vs buybacks today?
Scott Bohn: They will be flexible. It depends what happens with the stock price. It depends what happens with some of these opportunities we've been pursuing and what the potential new terms would look like, so hard to speculate. We've got optionality.
Seth Bergey: Thanks.
Operator:
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Rich, please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Thanks and good morning. Kelvin, congrats on the move up. Looking forward to working with you. Scott, you mentioned a lot about sort of the slowdown in leasing in life science. Understood, given all the chaos, which is the right word to use. Specific though, to sort of the marquee leasing that we've talked about in the past, Portside, Vantage, Director's Place, $60 million of NOI there potential. You've made some good progress getting through a lot of that. Maybe half of it is sort of locked up for future revenue recognition. But do you think that now if getting to $60 million was a three-year event to actually realize that cash, do you think it's significantly pushed back now based on what's happening, or do you think you're still on track with those three specific opportunities?
Scott Brinker: Rich, I think it just depends. I mean, if the next nine months look like the last three months, it might take a little bit longer. But we've seen that the market can shift pretty quickly based on one press release or comment, so it's hard to predict what the future holds. We do see, as I said in the prepared remarks, a lot of themes emerging that could be very helpful. But stability would be the most important thing in the near-term for us to answer your question on specific lease out timelines.
Rich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. And then follow-up is you talked about kind of reassessing required returns on your life science loan program. If memory serves, you were getting an 8-ish type number on that. The buyback was an 8% implied. So what's the appropriate premium to doing buybacks? Is it 100 basis points in your mind or is it more or less? I mean or is that sort of a TBD number that you're sort of addressing as you monitor the market? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yes, I mean, the 8% you mentioned was a really low loan-to-value first mortgage in Torrey Pines kind of premier submarket. Most of the life science investments that we had been pursuing were more distressed situations that the returns were substantially higher than 8%. I mean, way into the double digits. So it's a different investment profile than buying back our own stock.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And so that double digit isn't enough for you at this point, is that a fair statement?
Scott Brinker: Yes, that's why we stepped back. We're reassessing that pipeline. It's not going away, but we have stepped back to reassess.
Rich Anderson: Fair enough. Okay, thanks everyone.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram, please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first one on Life Sciences specifically, can you kind of talk about the components of same-store specifically, occupancy, how you see that trending for the balance of the year? And if there's some pressure then how much of that is known versus sort of just a placeholder for the uncertainty that you referenced?
Scott Brinker: Yes Vikram, we don't guide to occupancy, never have and we're certainly not going to start to an environment like this. It's possible that occupancy comes down a bit. I mentioned the offsets. We signed a ton of leases that will become rent-paying spaces in the next couple of quarters. We continue to sign leases here in the first quarter into April. Got a bunch of LOIs. The offset is we obviously have $600,000 of maturities this year, and we gave really good clarity in the supplemental about what's happening with each of those, whether they're going into redevelopment under LOI being negotiated or likely going vacant. So there's pretty good clarity there and the uncertainty element is what happens with regulatory policy and bad debt, and that's just too hard to speculate on in an environment like this. But most important is diversified portfolio, our earnings guidance hasn't changed, our same-store guidance hasn't changed and those are the numbers that we're focused on the aggregate company-wide metrics.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. But just to clarify, so will the overall same-store has not changed and the guide hasn't changed. I'm assuming you've -- the MOB side is doing better like you referenced so that’s probably gone up and the same-store NOI is for Life Sciences has gone down or decel, is that fair?
Scott Brinker: From where we sit today, that’s most likely, but again there is a quite bit of uncertainty to be too precise in Life Science in particular, but the Outpatient business is doing very well. Great portfolio platform, good fundamentals, so we do feel good about that sector.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, and then just the last thing, just to clarify, so the watch list sort of you referenced, I'm assuming that's a review you've done over the last, 30, 60 days. Given this uncertainty, can you kind of frame it for us a little bit like, compared to sort of two years ago when we were coming out of all this uncertainty during COVID too many companies had formed. Like how does the watch list compare today to that uncertainty maybe two, three years ago?
Kelvin Moses: Hey, Vik, this is Kelvin. We have a very robust tenant credit monitoring platform and I'd say that where we sit today, the composition of our watch list hasn't changed materially. So I don't think there's anything that we can speculate on right now. We still kind of need to wait and see, but the composition hasn't changed materially.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael, please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to quickly follow-up on the Life Science side. I know, Scott you kind of mentioned in the call that there's a lot of tenants or maybe a few tenants that are trying to raise capital and if they can't, then that could be a problem. I guess first, how many are we talking about here and what happens if they can't raise capital? Is it just kind of a general mixture of some could be bought out and others might default on their lease? I mean, what's the type of scenarios we should think about related to your earlier comments?
Scott Brinker: Yes, there's subtenants in some of the spaces, so each one is unique, but I won't speculate on the number. I just continue to say it. The guidance range that we reaffirmed captures the potential outcomes of what we foresee based on the very detailed credit monitoring that we do and Kelvin referenced it. It's qualitative, it's quantitative. Kind of looking at it from every angle, we’re obviously spending a lot of time with the companies that we think do need to raise capital to continue.
Michael Carroll: Good, okay. And then I guess congrats, Kelvin. And maybe can you talk a little bit about the Hines agreement that was announced? I know that their plan is to build apartments on this site, but how should we think about the benefits and the cash flow that could come from DOC related to this? I mean, is it related to like selling the land in the beginning and then you get some upside, or will this not really kind of hit your P&L until these buildings are completed? I guess. How should we think about the amount and the timeline of that?
Kelvin Moses: Yes, so I look at it as a phase takedown. The agreement we have with Hines is a for valuation on the land. And as they get ready to take down sites over time, including the first one that would take place within six to 12 months of entitlements late next year, we would be able to recapture those proceeds, so it will be over time.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan, please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Robin Hamlin [ph] on for Juan. Just curious if you can provide a bit more detail on the watch list profiles. Are these tenants in any particular sectors and is there any size you can share on the aggregate watch list pool as far as the total portfolio?
Kelvin Moses: Hey, Juan, this is Kelvin. I don't think we have granular detail to share. Again, I think the watch list composition is consistent with what it's looked like in the past, but we continue to monitor actively and as we get further along in the year, we'll have more color.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. You talked a lot about you stepping back in investments, but I imagine banks are also sidelined at this point, just curious if you can elaborate. What do you want to see to fill the void in lending and then on the purchase agreements tied to your loans, how willing are sellers to provide that as part of the deals?
Scott Brinker: Well, we have purchase options on everything we've done today, and we'd have options on everything that we would do in the future. I mean, that’s just fundamental to the strategy here would be a pathway to ownership on buildings that we want to own. What we need to change? Probably better security, potentially higher rate come to mind as things that are on our mind as we reassess the Life Science pipeline.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wesley Golladay with Baird. Wes, please go ahead.
Wesley Golladay: Good morning, everyone. Do you expect to see any distress opportunities from the Tier 1 locations for Lab if this goes on for another year?
Scott Brinker: Well, the answer is yes. I mean that's been the pipeline. Those are the things we're pursuing. So we do see significant opportunity coming out of this. I mean we've outperformed the sector the last couple of years and capital allocation decisions made in the past two to three years that position us well to take advantage of the stress. So we still see that opportunity. It's just a matter of when is the right time to invest and what are the right terms and that's what we're reassessing, but the answer to your question is yes, absolutely.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then when you look at your outpatient medical developments, do you have a higher hurdle for that and do you expect any impact from the tariffs on the development costs in a material way?
Scott Brinker: Do you want to comment on tariffs...?
Scott Bohn: Yes, sure. I can start with the tariffs. I mean, I think what we're seeing in the tariffs, if the tariffs are in place today continue, we'd probably see estimate of 2% to 6% increase in cost. But I think what's important on our active developments on the OM amount side, we're 100% of our GMP contracts and over 85% of our redoes under GMP. So that accounts for the building core and shell and any ongoing TIs. So we see little to no risk of cost increases to our active portfolio. But going forward, again, it's a little bit of a murky crystal ball, but probably in the 2% to 6% range. But we're also working very closely with our suppliers and GCs to ensure we drive those costs down as much as we possibly can.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And do you have a higher hurdle rate for future projects. At some point, you may want to maintain the relationships you have, but then also your cost may go up, so how you manage that?
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean, certainly, in a volatile environment, and we have to be thoughtful and flexible on capital deployment and what's the appropriate risk-adjusted return. So that's why you saw us scale back. The amount of the $500 million of investments that's going towards acquisitions or loans and increase the buyback. So the answer is yes, we're flexible and we adjust and allocate capital, we see the best risk-adjusted return.
Wesley Golladay: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. John, please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for the time. Kelvin, can you just spend a few minutes talking through the West Cambridge development? I don't have a good sense of what the total construction costs might be over time? What percentage of it is going to come through Healthpeak's balance sheet, time line. So would love an update on kind of the bigger master plan and the capital cost and the time to deploy the capital.
Kelvin Moses: Yes. So I might start with, we're not yet fully entitled on the project. We're working through the entitlements now, and we expect to be entitled at the end of 2026. The Hines partnership has been our focus really to accelerate the project, catalyze the project with residential, which is the highest in demand right now. So we don't have any construction cost exposure for the residential component Hines will be responsible for all of those expenses. And down the line, as the market improves, we'll evaluate when it's appropriate to get started and pursue the lab component. So we're really focused on Hines right now. We're happy to have them as a partner and being able to get started on the project.
John Pawlowski: I guess, I worry a little bit about the dynamic that while you're waiting to start lab in practice, you're going to be a committed to this deal. And so you're effectively committing to a big check today. So I guess, maybe any comments there would help given your stock is trading and just the total capital cost should -- how high of odds are there that you're going to start these lab developments in West Cambridge?
Kelvin Moses: I might point you back to investments we've made in West Cambridge specifically. Half of our $600-plus million has been -- is developable sites. The other half is actually leased today. So we have credit tenants occupying buildings that are paying us rent. So I don't think we have pressure per se to move quickly. But again, Hines is prepared to get started within 6 to 12 months on the residential component. And the economics there are actually beneficial. It's for value on the land and we get a share of the upside. So I think we're going to actually be able to pull in some economics from the Hines transaction.
John Pawlowski: Yes, thank you.
Scott Brinker: Yes, John independent -- I mean the multifamily and the lab are independent projects, and we're not allocating any capital to the multifamily at that time. So I just want to make sure you're clear on our capital commitment and material structure.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. Jim, please go ahead.
James Kammert: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Maybe a qualitative probe potentially on the development or redevelopment prospects. Would you say that the number of tenants you're having discussions with and their aggregate space needs is really kind of held together, it's just -- we can all appreciate that the decision-making has been on pause, but just trying to get a better sense of what that kind of looks like as an aggregate pool that your number of conversations and so on?
Scott Brinker: Yes. Hey Jim, it's Scott again. I would say go back to my comment I made earlier is the pipeline that we have today, both in the LOI pipeline and the active end pipeline, these are tenants that are well capitalized. They've already raised funds. They aren't looking to raise money in the next three to six months. So they've got their business plan and are looking to take either additional space, either whether they're renewing in place or moving typically if they're moving they’re looking to take additional space.
James Kammert: Okay. And then so a derivative of that question, you haven't seen to your knowledge, tenants you're speaking with jump ship and go somewhere else for a $10 cheaper rent. It's just not a price issue. It's really a total capital and visibility of their business issue making the decision to lease or not?
Scott Brinker: Yes, I think that's accurate. And I think that's why you continue to see the incumbent landlords when an outside share of the deal, right? I mean I think these are mission-critical facilities and they're going to make a decision for the long-term and want to know who their landlord is going to be for the duration of the lease. And it's one of the reasons we've outperformed the broader market.
James Kammert: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike, please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Yes. Hi first, I also want to pass on congrats to Kelvin. And for the two questions, First, it looks like ad rents may have helped your MOB growth this quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. Was that the case? And if so, how much? And for the second question, what do you see as full occupancy for the CCRCs?
Mark Theine: Yes, hey Mike, this is Mark Theine. I'll take the first one on the Medical City ad rent. We had a great start to the year there ahead of budget, as you mentioned, and ahead of schedule. It's a total of about $1 million in the quarter, which is about a 50-basis point impact on our same-store for the year-over-year and sequential.
Scott Brinker: And Mike, your senior housing question, we're roughly 86% today. There are a couple of properties that bring that average down. but there's upside. It's probably in the 300 to 400 basis point range would be a rough estimate just based on trajectory. The lead volume continues to be strong. So definitely some upside to capture.
Mike Mueller: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Omotayo, please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi, good morning, everyone. Kelvin, first of all, congratulations. I look forward to working with you. So my first question is just around, Scott, I mean, you've kind of given a very candid picture of life sciences, which I appreciate. But I take a look at your leasing volumes, and it sounds like things actually accelerating in 2Q relative to 1Q. I mean how should we be -- and this kind of sounds very much like last year as well, right, where the backdrop was tough, but you're leasing actually gotten better over the course of the year. Is that the same idea this year or are you really kind of cautioning that maybe we may not have that same kind of tempo this year?
Scott Brinker: First quarter is always a little weak. That was the case last year and were less than 200,000 feet, and we signed, I don't know, 800,000 feet in 2Q. So there is definitely an increase. And we have a good pipeline. I mean we keep saying that. So yes, I mean, the leasing pipeline is strong, whether it's what's signed in April, the LOIs and what comes behind that. As we've said a couple of times now, it's as strong as it's been since the summer. But we've also said it wouldn't surprise us if some of those lease executions get pushed back. That's just the reality of the market environment that we're in. There's a huge amount of uncertainty and we are giving you a candid view. We still love the sector. We have a great market position, high-quality real estate. But if you're expecting massive earnings growth and turnaround in 2Q. I mean that's going to be tougher. I mean I don't think that should be a surprise if you look at what's happened to biopharma capital raising in the start to the year.
Omotayo Okusanya: Fair enough. And then also for the new leases in the quarter, the weighted average lease term was like 58 months-or-so. That number is really almost double that. Anything unique there in regards to mix or just terms changing people wanting shorter leases because of the uncertainty?
Scott Bohn: No. It's Scott Bohn. I think that the new leases were on average about five years, which is not too far off where we were, I think, for full year 2024. And as we've talked about, when we talk about mark-to-market and other things in the Life Science portfolio, our deals tend to be pretty chunky. So looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis isn't necessarily the right way. I think you got to look at the full year or trailing 12 months. So I don't think there's anything specific in that quarter that is…
Omotayo Okusanya: That's helpful, okay. Then one more from me, if you don't mind. The redevelopment bucket for other redevelopment, that amount increased this quarter, I know you have 16 projects versus 12 last quarter. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what the additional projects were? What's being moved into redev? Is it like a building you have, a tenant moved out and moving into redev that? Just kind of trying to understand some of the movement there?
Scott Brinker: Yes, we added three projects to that bucket this quarter. Two lab buildings and one [indiscernible] building, all of them were 100% preleased, just some pretty large CI as well as base building work needed on those buildings. It's about 130,000 feet and about $40 million total in those. And the bulk of those, I think, are Q4 starts for the lease as opposed being for the next few quarters.
Omotayo Okusanya: And the current tenants have already moved out of those buildings?
Scott Brinker: Correct.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Rich, please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Thanks for the quick follow-up. When you think about maintaining guidance and perhaps ramping up buybacks and ramping down your life science loan business, is the net forced downward, but yet you're able to maintain guidance or would that be something, would that combination of those two observations actually help you to sustain, maintain guidance? I'm just curious how the math works in your mind? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean it depends obviously what price for buying back the stock and which investments either proceed or not. Some have higher returns than others. There's also the impact on leverage. And we didn't make the comment. In any event, we don't expect to take our leverage above 5.5x. And buybacks obviously are not helpful for leverage, whereas investments could potentially be high enough yielding that they would be beneficial to leverage. So there is an impact, but I'll come back to regardless of how we use the $500 million. And that could include just sitting on the cash and keeping leverage lower. We still feel like our guidance range captures the potential endpoints.
Rich Anderson: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Scott Brinker for any closing remarks.
Scott Brinker: Thanks for your time today. I look forward to seeing you in May, if not June, at the various events. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Healthpeak Properties, Inc.’s Fourth Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Johns, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Johns: Welcome to Healthpeak’s fourth quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Today’s conference call contains certain forward-looking statements. Although we believe expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. A discussion of risks and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. In an exhibit to the 8-K we furnished to the SEC yesterday, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance to Reg G requirements. The exhibit is also available on our website at healthpeak.com. I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Brinker.
Scott Brinker: Thanks, Andrew, and welcome to Healthpeak’s fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Our CFO, Peter Scott is here with me for prepared remarks and a senior team is available for Q&A. I would like to thank our entire team for a year of operational excellence, in particular with merger integration, internalization, leasing and senior housing operations. I'm confident that in 2024 we built the foundation for future outperformance with our improved capabilities, portfolio and balance sheet. We also continue to grow earnings. Over the past three years we've grown FFO per share by 12% and AFFO per share by 19%. Additional growth is implied in our 2025 guidance. Yesterday we announced an increase to our dividend. The increase was made possible by our earnings growth and is an important part of our total return to shareholders. Beginning in April, we'll pay the dividend on a monthly basis to match the cadence of our monthly rental income. Our AFFO payout ratio remains conservative, reserving free cash flow to reinvest into the business. We believe there are significant value and upside in our stock today when we look at our current multiple overlaid with our earnings growth and 6% dividend yield, not to mention the underlying value of our real estate and our proven competitive advantage in both life science and outpatient medical. The merger with Physicians Realty closed less than a year ago and has already proven to be highly successful. The merger was accretive to our earnings balance sheet and platform. It highlighted our ability to execute and to exceed expectations, for example, with merger synergies and the common spirit renewal. We'll build on that momentum in 2025 by continuing to internalize property management across our portfolio, which is both financially and strategically accretive. We also have a significant development pipeline from the health system relationships that came over with JT and his team. In 2024 we closed $1.3 billion of asset sales at a compelling cap rate of 6.4% primarily stabilized outpatient medical buildings where private market values have remained strong. Because of the asset sales, our balance sheet is currently under levered and we believe 2025 is an opportune time to go on offense. Particularly in life science, we're over building and a lack of liquidity is creating opportunities for us. There's a very small handful of owners in the life science sector with a competitive advantage and Healthpeak is certainly a on that list with our scale, track record and capabilities. For the past several years, we had a conservative near term outlook for the sector and chose not to commence any new development or to make any acquisitions. With new deliveries declining by 75% this year, new starts at nearly zero, and many new entrants and lenders feeling distress, we see this as a great time to put our platform and balance sheet to work. Private credit has exploded in popularity, but there's a vacuum in Life Science today and therefore an opportunity for Healthpeak. Our focus is loan investments that provide immediate accretion, more seniority in a capital stack, an attractive basis, and future acquisition rights of buildings in our core submarkets. The $75 million mortgage loan we announced yesterday is a good example of this targeted approach. The building is down the street from our existing 700,000 square foot campus in Torrey Pines, the premier submarket in San Diego. Our loan to cost is 60% with an 8% interest rate plus purchase option. In our outpatient medical business, our health system driven strategy generates sustainable internal and external growth. Our capabilities and relationships were built over the past two decades and continue to bring us proprietary opportunities. In the fourth quarter we originated a $36 million development loan with purchase option on a development that's 100% preleased to McKesson and adjacent to a Baylor Scott & White hospital in Dallas. Our current pipeline of similar highly pre-leased and accretive development projects exceeds $300 million. I'd like to make a few comments about our senior housing CCRC portfolio. Over the past several years we've executed a strategy to structure our entry fees so that less than 20% of those fees are refundable to the resident. This is a huge contrast from the typical CCRC where the entry fee is more than 80% refundable to the resident. This strategy around refundability allowed us to keep the entry fee low so that we could target a wider audience. The result has been record sales and record net cash collection. Also, from an ownership perspective, these properties are now more comparable to rental senior housing than to a traditional CCRC. From a resident standpoint, the properties remain highly differentiated and attractive with vast indoor and outdoor amenities and large units with full kitchen to attract independent seniors. We've periodically received inbound interest from potential buyers for the portfolio, but not at prices we found compelling. Our current expectation is that we'll own the portfolio for the foreseeable future while retaining complete control and flexibility. Finally, the leadership changes and promotions announced yesterday. We have thorough succession plans and a deep bench for all senior positions. Kelvin Moses has been promoted to the Executive team in recognition of his impact across the company since joining in 2018. Kelvin will be EVP of Investments and Portfolio Management. Tracy Porter has been a key member of our legal team since 2013 and will become EVP and General Counsel on March 1. She's been well trained by Jeff Miller, who I've had the privilege of working with for the past two decades as he set the highest bar for teamwork and mentorship. Also March 1, Mark Theine will report to me as leader of our outpatient medical business. Mark was a co-founder of Physicians Realty and has two decades of experience in the outpatient sector. He takes the reins from Tom Klaritch, who is one of the founding fathers of the outpatient real estate sector. Tom deserves enormous credit for the role he played in building a leading outpatient platform at Healthpeak over the past 25 years. Both Tom and Jeff have agreed to transition and consulting roles through year end to ensure a smooth handoff. On behalf of our team and board, I want to sincerely thank Tom and Jeff for their enormous impact and congratulate Tracy, Kelvin and Mark for their increased role at the company. They're committed to our core values and are eager to put in the work to build an industry leader together. Now Pete Scott will cover operating results guidance and the balance sheet.
Peter Scott: Thanks, Scott. We ended the year with strong momentum. For the fourth quarter, we reported FFOs adjusted $0.46 per share, AFFO of $0.40 per share and total portfolio same store growth of 5.4%. For the full year we reported FFOs adjusted of $1.81 per share, AFFO of $1.60 per share and total portfolio same store growth of 5.4%. We exceeded the midpoint of our original FFO as adjusted guidance by 5 pennies. Our outperformance was a team effort across the organization and included better results in all three segments, higher merger synergies, accretive share repurchases and the opportunistic early lease renewal with common spirit. Our balance sheet is in rock solid shape with a net debt to EBITDA of 5.2 times, providing us with ample dry powder to go on offense. Let me provide some highlights for each segment, starting with Outpatient Medical. Our year-over-year same store growth was 3.2%, well above the midpoint of our original outlook. We executed 6.2 million square feet of leases with a positive 7% rent mark-to-market on renewals. We ended the year at 92% occupancy and a tenant retention rate of 88%. Both metrics are well above industry averages. Turning to lab. Our year-over-year same store growth was 5%, far exceeding the high end of our original outlook. We executed 2 million square feet of leases with a positive 11% rent mark-to-market on renewals highlighted by a positive 30% rent mark-to-market in the fourth quarter. We far exceeded expectations in our lab segment driven by our unique competitive advantages including our scale best-in-class team, high quality portfolio in the right sub markets and the depth of our industry relationships. Finishing with CCRCs. Our year-over-year same store growth was 20.8%, smashing our original outlook driven by better than expected occupancy gains and entrance fees. Starting in the first quarter of 2025, we will report AFFO on our supplemental inclusive of entrance fee cash collections. We believe this change better reflects the cash flow generation of the business. Turning now to our 2025 guidance, we are forecasting FFO’s adjusted to range from $1.81 to $1.87 per share. Let me touch on some of the major items that underlie our guidance. We see total same store growth of 3% to 4%. The components of same store growth are outpatient medical ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%, lab ranging from 3% to 4% and CCRCs ranging from 4% to 8%. We have included $500 million of investments in our forecast, including the Lab loan in Torrey Pines we closed in January. We have a robust pipeline and are confident we can deploy at least this much capital in 2025. The weighted average yield of these investments is 8% plus. Interest expense is forecast to increase approximately $15 million or $0.02 a share as we refinance maturing bonds, fund investments and capital spend. Our current 10-year new issuance cost is approximately 5.5%. We have forecast capital spend of $600 million which is largely focused on development and redevelopment spend. As we have previously discussed, we see a near term ramp up of redevelopment projects in lab as we reposition older products for lease up, a strategy we've utilized with great success over the years. One important item before turning to Q&A. We have made significant progress capturing upside from the lease up of our marquee development and redevelopment projects. In 2024 and including January 2025, we signed over 370,000 square feet of leases bringing these projects to over 50% leased, representing approximately half of the $60 million of upside NOI we disclosed, however, there is a timing lag between when a tenant signs a lease and when earnings commence. Our 2025 guidance excludes four pennies of FFO from signed but not yet occupied leases. The benefit from these leases will be a tailwind to earnings beginning in late 2025. With that, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Pharrell Dranet [ph] with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious if, based on last quarter you made comments on sitting on significant dry powder of $500 million to $1 billion to fund accretive acquisitions. Curious if you can go through how this ties to your acquisition guidance, if anything has changed in how you're viewing the landscape of capital deployment.
Peter Scott: Yes, I can take that. It's Pete here. We typically don't guide to investments within our pipeline, but I think we're far enough along within that pipeline that we felt like we should include some amount of guidance for investment. So we went with 500 billion. It's kind of at the lower end of what we expect to deploy this year given that we have that balance sheet capacity. In addition, we did disclose the loan in Torrey Pines. We did. And then Scott talked about in the prepared remarks the loan that we did in Dallas for the McKesson asset, both kind of first mortgage or construction loans at 8%. So we feel pretty darn good about the 500 million. It's got a midyear time horizon associated with it within guidance as well. And again, we have more dry powder to do more than that to the extent that, our pipeline continues to fill up and hopefully we have more to disclose over the coming months. And there's a lot of industry activity. So we'd expect to provide more clarity on that pipeline as we actually get things across the goal line.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And also when it comes to increased M&A in the life science area, how are you seeing that either impact demand or are you seeing a different type of clientele coming in to look for buildings.
Scott Brinker: I mean, M&A has been. This is Scott speaking. M&A has been relatively quiet the last four years just because of the difficulty or perceived challenges with getting FTC approval. So there's going to be a significant change. It seems likely. Big M&A has been almost completely off the table. There's been some smaller transactions the past four years, but we would expect that to pick up. There's already been a couple of announcements here in January, but generally it's a positive thing, whether it's direct because of the tenant credit upgrade or just capital being recycled in the sector so that investors can monetize an investment in a smaller company and hopefully get a good return and put it back into the sector. So it's been a positive through the years for the sector and we expect that to continue here in 2025 moving forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Hi. I guess first question is just on lab leasing. I know you got a lot done executing on the LOIs you talked about previously. Can you just talk a little bit about how the pipeline is shaping up right now? And also specifically, if you could just talk to how to think about leasing progress still to be made at Portside, Director's Place, Vantage and Gateway. Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yes, I could take that. And Scott Bohn is here as well to add on. We did have a solid year last year in 2024 for lab leasing. We got over 2 million square feet done. We do have over 300,000 square feet under LOI, and we've got significant tours, proposals and other activity that goes beyond that as well. So we feel like we have pretty strong momentum. Most of the demand is really a direct result of capital raising, which was up significantly last year for biotech companies. As you think about the 60 million of cash upside, Nick, which I think is an important part of your question, at this point we've now signed leases for over 50% of that. Again, a lot of that won't actually benefit our earnings until the very end of this year and really be a tailwind as we look towards next year. But there's additional upside for us to capture as we get the balance of that upside, leased up. And like I said, we've got, strong progress. Nothing at this point in time that is at an LIO level where we would disclose it. But again, lots of tours and activity.
Nick Yulico: Okay, thanks. And then I guess, second question is just, maybe for Scott Brinker, just in terms of where you're at right now on the merger synergies and how much are assumed this year in terms of internalizing management for assets and how should you just think about how far along you are on that whole process and whether there's also some potential upside benefit there that could happen this year, similar to I think was a benefit that helped you beat guidance last year. Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yes. Hey, thanks, Nick. Yes. The merger added between $0.05 and $0.07 of earnings last year, 2024, and on a run rate basis as well. And we think there is more to capture. We internalized almost 20 million square feet of real estate last year. It was a big part of the $50 million of synergies. We've got another 8 million or so square feet that we plan to internalize in 2025. And we feel like the run rate total synergies coming out of this year should be more in the 65 million range. So not all of that additional synergy comes through in 2025. But on a run rate basis it's, it's really strong. I mean you're talking about $0.10 a share. So it's, it's significant.
Nick Yulico: Okay, thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just on the $500 million of investments anticipated for Plan 4 for 2025, could you just give us a sense of like, what is the breakdown between some of the MLB loans where you announced one with the results as well as kind of the lab, more distressed opportunities. And for the stuff that you announced, what's the term or duration of those two loans?
Scott Brinker: Yes, they're three to four year loans for the most part. One, the ones we announced, I mean the mix of sectors is fluid. I mean, there's a big pipeline in both. But as you noted, there's the big difference is that in the outpatient business, there's not distress. These are really development opportunities. Some will do on balance sheet, some will do through loans with an option to purchase. Each project is unique. In life science, they tend to be more in the distress category, but again, could be acquisition, could be loans. The one we announced in Torrey Pines is at the lower end of the risk spectrum, obviously with a 60% loan to cost and an even bigger discount to replacement cost. Others are higher LTC and therefore higher return in the pipeline. But it's significant. But until something actually closes, obviously we won't disclose the particulars.
Juan Sanabria: Great. And then just hoping to get a little bit more of the piece parts behind the lab same-store NOI at 3% to 4%. How should we think about occupancy through the year and kind of the mark to market of leases that are expiring versus, where they are relative to market at this point?
Peter Scott: Yes, hey, Juan, it's Pete. I'll give a little color on that. I think the main drivers of lab same store this year will be called the rent mark-to-market in that 5% to 10% range. And then within the same store pool, you're going to see kind of flattish occupancy. And we're at the very high levels of 97%, 98% within the same store pool. And I'll touch on that in a second. And then obviously we also have the escalators in the low three. So those are really the main drivers to the 3% to 4%. But that's just same store. We're focused on total occupancy. And really the upside opportunity for us is taking that total occupancy from the mid-to-high 80s back to the low 90s. And if you think about what's it going to take to get there, we've probably got around a million three square feet of available space that we could lease out. If we leased all of it tomorrow and it commenced tomorrow, we get back to 100%, that'd be great. But that's not our expectation. I mean our expectation is to probably lease up about half of that and get back up to that low 90% stabilized occupancy level. And perhaps if the market continues to improve, we could do better than that in the medium or long-term. But our near term goal is to get from that mid-to-high 80s into the low 90s. So there's same store but then there's really what's going to drive earnings and earnings growth going forward.
Juan Sanabria: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with Keybanc Capital Market. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks and good morning everybody. Just want to go back to the same store and maybe just understand a little bit of what's driving you from that 5 plus percent range growth in the fourth quarter, down to the mid 3% range in 2025. What's sort of, causing that deceleration, and were there any sort of one time benefits in the fourth quarter that we should be aware of?
Scott Brinker: Yes, obviously looking at it quarter-to-quarter there's different nuances. Maybe I'll just look at the full year of we finished at 5.4% last year and we're guiding to 3.5% this year. Obviously there's a little bit of cushion as you set guidance the beginning of the year and you hope to exceed it as the year progresses. But remember, last year we did get pretty significant benefits from internalization and then also on CCRCs we finished the year north of 20%. So right now we're guiding 4% to 8% within CCRCs. I love to do better than that, but I think we're going to come out the gates at that 4% to 8% what we came out of the gates with last year and significantly exceeded it. And then when you back out, the internalization benefit, we got through the course of last year with a decent amount of that in lab. We're guiding 3% to 4% in lab this year and 2.5% and 3.5% in outpatient medical which is pretty consistent growth with what we achieved when you back out some of those, one time benefits that we mentioned and then the CCRCs.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. And then just sticking a little bit with lab, pretty attractive mark-to-market this quarter. But it looks like some of the TIs and LC's were up relative to prior quarters. Can you just talk about how you're kind of expecting, that to trend to achieve that 5% to 10% mark-to-market that you highlighted is assumed in guidance. Thanks.
Scott Bohn: Yes, sure. It's Scott Bohn. I think that 5% to 10%. So how we view the portfolio, this quarter was a little bit higher, 30%, but it's going to jump around from quarter-to-quarter I think over the course of the year. We were at 3% in the first quarter, up all the way to 30% this quarter. There was one lease in San Diego that drove it a little bit higher. But even if you strip out that lease, we were in the mid-teens in the mark-to-market though, right in line with where we expect it to be this year as well as in 2025. Oh, and the TI's, there was one lease in San Francisco on a renewal that drove that a little bit higher and that was a tenant that's been in the portfolio in the space for 10 years. They're a $3 billion market cap company. Their global headquarter building, they had a shift in their business. Their existing space was heavily skewed towards office, pretty light labor. And this renewal, they need significantly more lab in that space. And so we were able to put that in for them, do a long term renewal both in San Francisco and San Diego with that tenant. So that's capital that we would spend if they were to vacate and go somewhere else, we'd be spending that capital to get that space to more of a 50:50 office lab anyway. So it's great to do it with a high quality tenant in tow. And we're also able to drive a 20%, 27% mark-to-market on that lease in San Francisco as well.
Austin Wurschmidt: Very helpful. Thanks for the time.
Scott Bohn: Thanks, Austin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here. Just sticking on the lab leasing. Are you starting to see bigger space takers looking for space or is it still that 20,000 to 40,000 square foot tenants?
Scott Bohn: Yes, I would say there's certainly some larger requirements out in the market in each of the three core markets. Those deals tend to take a lot longer to actually execute. But we have seen, as I mentioned it last quarter, that kind of barbell of demand that we spoke about for the past four or five quarters start to fill in significantly. If you look at our leasing for the fourth quarter, our average lease was in the low 40,000 square feet versus in the low 30s for the first three quarters of the year. So we're starting to see those larger deals come into the market.
Peter Scott: Yes. And Nick, I'm sure you're well aware of this and follow it closely, but the two large leases we did last quarter, one at Portside that was over 200,000 square feet and then we did one advantage which was over 60,000 square feet. So it's pretty hard to move the needle on the pre-leasing the way that we've done that within those larger projects without, you know, signing some pretty big deals.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. And then are you seeing traditional office users look at lab space at all?
Scott Bohn: Not much. I think if you look at the -- there was this article out today with the office user looking at a sublease in the seaport in Boston. But typically our pipeline is more full with lab users versus office.
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I want to ask a question about the guidance range 181 to 187. How much is the 181 associated with, sort of existing leverage ratios and how much is the 187 associated with higher leverage ratios on the view that you're talking about going more on offense with your balance sheet. I'm just wondering what you're sort of giving up at the higher end of that guidance when you think about specifically the balance sheet and whatever else might go into that the difference between the two ends of those of the guidance range. Thanks.
Peter Scott: Yes. So Rich, it's a really good question. I would say, the midpoint of our guidance.
Richard Anderson: Yes, yes.
Peter Scott: No, I appreciate it. By the way, I thought your note was great that you put out short and sweet. But if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, if we put the 500 million of capital to work now, some of it is dependent upon the yield that you get, right. With regards to how you think about net debt-to-EBITDA. But that would not get us back to, five and a half times from we're at 5.2 right now, so it's probably somewhere in between. I think if we got to the higher end of our guidance range, we'd be assuming getting back to target leverage ratios in the mid fives. We're going to be very careful though, going beyond that. I think with the interest rate volatility right now and other uncertainties, we want to make sure that we maintain our leverage at target levels or slightly below. And then I think the low end of guidance would assume we don't get any investments done. And I'm not saying investment is driving all of that. I'm just kind of giving you some directional thoughts on it because there's other things that would drive whether you hit the high or the low, but leverage at the high end would be kind of getting back to that mid 5.5 times.
Richard Anderson: Okay, perfect. And then second question on the commentary around CCRCs and you received some inbound interest, but it didn't pan -- wondering are we getting any closer to a bid ask spread that's, at least in the conversation, or is it still way off in terms of the offers you're getting? I'm wondering if they're, you mentioned about the low refundable component of your entrance fees. I'm wondering if we're getting if you feel a trend approaching that you may actually someday see a sale make sense. I'm just based on some of the offers that you've heard of in the past. That's the basic question. Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Hey, Rich, it's performing really well, and our expectation is that we're going to hold it for the foreseeable future.
Richard Anderson: But you can't comment about how the quality of the offers have been coming in. Have they been sort of associating it with a higher value of the business, sort of staying the same?
Scott Brinker: Yes. There's been no conversations recently, Rich.
Richard Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thanks. I wanted to touch on your structured Life Science investments that you've been pursuing. And I know with Life Science, the sponsor is pretty important to prospective tenants. So how active, I guess, does DOC plan on being managing properties where you make loans on? Will the new prospective tenant view DOC as an owner and kind of give that building credit for the scale that DOC has to lease up that property?
Scott Brinker: Mike, each one is a little unique. The loan we announced in Torrey Pines were completely passive. So I don't know that our involvement brings any credibility or anything else to the table or tenants. It obviously brings capital 60%, but the owner is the one at risk. Their name is on the domain, but our basis is less than $800 a foot in Torrey Pines when rents are, I don't know, $75 to $80. So we feel like our downside is pretty attractive. But our expectation is that over time the building gets leased up and we have a chance to buy it at a point in the cycle where cost of capital is a lot more attractive. In the interim, it's highly accretive, even for that really low risk investment. But like I said, a number of the things we're looking at are a little bit higher on the loan to cost or loan to value scale, and therefore much higher return.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great Scott. And then can you give us some details on that purchase option that you guys keep on referring to? I guess when does it become exercisable and is there a set price or cap rate that you could acquire it at?
Scott Brinker: Each one is unique. But in all cases, when we're making these loans, the building itself is located in a submarket that we have a presence in, in view as strategic and would want to own the asset. So that's been a fundamental part of all these discussions is that we'd have purchase options. In some cases they're at market, in some cases they're promotes or warrants or they're all. They're all different, Mike, depending on the circumstances.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
Scott Brinker: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the lineup. Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Yes, hi. I guess first apologize if I missed this, but what sort of development starts are you expecting for this year out of outpatient medical?
Scott Brinker: Yes, hey, Mike, we have a significant pipeline. I mean, we could easily start $200 million to $300 million of projects this year. All highly preleased, core markets, strong health systems. So this is a really attractive way to grow our business. Brand new assets, long term leases. We view it as highly strategic and accretive. So we are prioritizing having capital available to do these investments. We announced one here in the first quarter or in the fourth quarter. I apologize with McKesson and Dallas. And I would expect to have more to announce as the year progresses. Could easily be 5, 6, 7 projects this year that we would break ground on.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And then I guess for an investment follow up here, what sort of guidelines or how are you thinking about what the mix of incremental debt investments should, could be or should be relative to just kind of outright acquisitions?
Scott Brinker: Yes, we're looking at both. I think there will be some acquisitions this year in life science. It probably skews more towards loans with an option to purchase just given bid, ask spread. I'm not sure that sellers have completely capitulated on price. And when we look at the timeline and risk to stabilize some of these developments and the returns that would come with it at the required price, in many cases the loans look awfully compelling just from a risk adjusted standpoint.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jim Kammert: Thank you. Good morning. Could you just share maybe a little of the rationale regarding a little less granular information on the AFFO guide? Because I think sometimes the straight line and TI and CapEx components of that are kind of helpful. So if you could provide any context of why that may have shifted.
Peter Scott: Yes. Hey, Jim, it's Pete and I'm glad you brought it up. One, we think it's a simpler story now than it was a few years ago at Healthpeak, and we feel like we put out a pretty clean guide. So perhaps there's a little less information on our guidance page within the sop. But we do include the same store components in a footnote. I know before they used to be broken out, but we felt like it was taking up a little too much space on the sources and uses table. It's one number as opposed to a range. I mean, frankly, I just think that's simpler to look at versus a range. But to your AFFO question specifically, look, we did include it in guidance last year, and the rationale for that was we had so many gap merger adjustments that you lost track of the synergies within FFO, but you could see it within AFFO. So we did include it. Last year we did decide not to include it this year as we were an outlier. And I think if you do a little bit of research around other REITs, you'd see that we were a significant outlier from that perspective. We did also modify, the definition. We're including cash and reps as well. But just to demystify the whole thing, under the new definition, we think AFFO will be for 2025, right around $1.65 at the midpoint. And under the old definition, AFFO would be call it $1.60 within 2025. AFFO growth does differ from FFO growth. Scott mentioned some of the numbers in his prepared remarks. You got lumpier items like recurring CapEx, free rent. Now we've got cash and [Indiscernible] which we think will be strong, but we are forecasting it to decelerate a little bit just because it was so strong last year. So I just wanted to give you some of the rationale why we did not include it. But like I said, I was happy to give all the numbers and I just gave them. So hopefully that helps demystify it a little bit.
Jim Kammert: That's great and thank you. And then just maybe housekeeping. Obviously you had the Milton related charges for the fourth quarter. Is it safe to assume that insurance policies and whatnot you'll get, you feel pretty good that you won't be out of pocket, you'll get that 25 million change back or recover in some fashion?
Peter Scott: Yes, I mean, unfortunately that's actually the portion that we are going to have to incur the cost on. But there's probably a little bit of deferred maintenance that we'll do as well as we're replacing, roofs within the community. So hopefully our capital expenditures for those assets will go down in the future with the amount that we're spending. But the insurance market's tough. Right. If you ask any other REIT management team out there, they'll tell you it's pretty darn tough. And in states like Florida and California, it's even tougher. You've got pretty high deductibles for these named windstorms. So that's a cost we will eat. Now we did go above the deductible in certain assets and that will get recovered by insurance. But that's outside of the, charge that we took this quarter.
Jim Kammert: Appreciate the clarification. I missed that. But then that would be part of your, embedded in the whole 600 million of development, redevelopment and CapEx spend. Or you've kind of got that for the year.
Peter Scott: Yes.
Jim Kammert: Okay.
Peter Scott: Yes, it would be within that as well.
Jim Kammert: Appreciate your time. Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first one, if you can just expand give us a little bit more color about how you're thinking about these structured investments either whether they're preferred or more debt? But given sort of where the stock is trading close to a 7.5 cap versus this deal, can you just give us more flavor on the range or the type of deals and cap rates? And then just stepping back on that, the funnel, like how big is this opportunity if we look in terms of what you're initially looking at then whittling down to your $500 million?
Scott Brinker: Yes, Vikram, in all cases, we want to make investments where the asset is attractive to us from an ownership standpoint long term. So a lot of what's been built would not make it into our pipeline. So it has to be in a core submarket. But the opportunity set is significant. I mean, Pete said up to $1 billion. This year, a fair amount of that could be in Life Science. So the stock obviously has bounced around. It's been a volatile environment for everybody over the past three months. I mean the stock is at 22, 23, and then it's at 20. So we certainly have the balance sheet capacity to buy back stock if it reaches a certain price, and we would not hesitate to do that. We have authorization from the Board if the volatility works against us. But obviously, we're working hard to continue to grow earnings and build a compelling pipeline that we think is strategic and accretive.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And then just on that topic of just earnings. I think there's perhaps, I guess, questions or confusion around like the earnings power of DOC here, and I'm not asking for 2026 guidance, but is based on what you know, what's leased up, the deals you have in the pipeline that are very sure? Like how should we think about the cash flow AFFO growth trajectory? Is it like over time over the next 2 years, 3 years? Is it a low single-digit AFFO? Is it a mid-single like do we think about what all you're doing today to benefit 2026 and 2027?
Scott Brinker: I mean the last three years have been pretty challenging for us given interest rates and Life Science fundamentals and we grew FFO 12% and AFFO 19%. So when the macro works in our favor, I would expect the growth rate to be even stronger, and we've continued to grow earnings this year. And I think a pretty good track record of not just meeting but exceeding initial expectations. So that is our expectation. The investments, obviously, are just additional return on top of the same-store growth, and Pete talked about leasing up the development -- redevelopment portfolio, is probably the most significant source of internal growth that we have outside of same-store.
Peter Scott: Vik, you do get the award for the first person to ask us for 2026 guidance. So on the day we put out 2025 guidance.
Operator: So our next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street. Stroyeck, please go ahead.
Michael Stroyeck: Thanks, and good morning. Could you maybe just provide some additional color on the sizable lease that saw that 45% mark-to-market? Was that in line with the company's expectations when setting guidance earlier in the year? And if not, what's changed in recent months that allowed for such a healthy mark-to-market?
Peter Scott: Yes. I answer it directly, yes, that was in line with it. If you actually heard me last quarter, I said we're expecting the fourth quarter to be our strongest rent mark-to-market quarter. And we have a pretty good line of sight that this renewal was going to get done. That said, for the full year, we were a little bit above 10%, and we've been trying to say, be careful not to draw too many conclusions over a quarterly number. I think the full year numbers are a better way to look at what we think the true mark-to-market is because it can ebb and flow depending upon the size of the lease. But nevertheless, we're happy. We got that big mark-to-market. And as Scott said, we also got a pretty big one in South San Francisco as well with a really high-quality tenant. Yes, it came with more TIs. But as Scott said, we'd have to spend those TIs at the tenant vacated, and that's great, we got a renewal out of it. So no downtime.
Michael Stroyeck: Got it. That's helpful. And then one other, it looks like 7 properties rolled out at the operating portfolio into the readout bucket this past quarter. Can you just help frame the expected year-over-year earnings dilution in 2025 from redevelopment activity?
Peter Scott: Yes. I mean, look, redevelopment and development spend certainly is a little bit of a drag on our earnings this year. I think the two biggest drags we have, if you're looking at what's working in our favor versus what is a headwind. One is interest expense, right? The second is the development and redevelopment drag, but we did foreshadow that redevelopments were going to go up this year as we put out some disclosures in our investor deck late last year. We've had a lot of success on redevelopment. And I would just point out as well that it's not like all these redevelopments are 0%, at least some of them are 100% pre-leased at this point in time. And we did add the percent pre-leased within those redevs, which is new disclosure this quarter. I know there's a lot of focus on not including AFFO, we did also add some disclosures as well to sort of counterbalance that. And we'll continue to update that as we get leases across the goal line. Just point out that we've got great success leasing up the redevelopments, whether it's a port side or point grand or in our outpatient business where we've been doing redevelopments for 10 years. I mean the financial returns over time have been very compelling. Expect the same amount of these.
Michael Stroyeck: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi, yes good morning everyone. In the 2025 guidance, are there any additional merger-related synergies beyond the $50 million that's in that number or not?
Peter Scott: Yes, there are some. Scott mentioned it before, there's some additional internalizations we expect to get done through the course of this year. They're not all going to get done at the beginning of the year, which is why the run rate at the end of the year is more like $60 million to $65 million versus we finished last year at a run rate of around $50. I wouldn't expect to pick up all of that in earnings this year, but there certainly is a little bit of a benefit within our guidance this year, maybe up to a $0.01 benefit for additional merger synergies. But I'd expect, as we get to the end of this year that we will have achieved all the direct merger synergies. Obviously, there's more indirect merger synergies that we could benefit from, but we've never really like focused on that that could be increased rent mark-to-market, increase retention, all the things you would hope to achieve as you're out leasing.
Omotayo Okusanya: That's helpful. And then also, as you think about 2025, I think in January, you guys talked about the loan repayment that was happening. Anything else like any more repayments as we kind of think about the rest of the year that may be a drag on earnings this year just kind of given some of the high interest rates in some of those loans?
Peter Scott: The biggest loan we have outstanding right now. Obviously, that bucket could increase with some of the pipeline of activity that we're looking at. But as the seller financing we did on the large outpatient medical deal, I don't expect that to get repaid this year. At some point, we hope to get repaid. These were legacy senior housing loans that we put in place when we did sell our financings years ago when we sold out of most of our shop assets. There were some tougher assets within that collateral. So I would say, even though there was some dilution associated with getting repaid those loans, I could tell you, we were all -- each other when we finally got that loan repaid. Yes, it came with dilution, but there were certainly some questions through the years as to whether we get repaid at par. So we're quite happy we got that loan repaid at par. I wouldn't expect really any others of significance this year.
Omotayo Okusanya: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. John, please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Good morning. Thank you. Maybe if we could start of high level -- this administration has made a lot of moves in the first few weeks. So it would be helpful if you could remind us of what kind of exposure you have to NIH funding, given it was -- there was just a temporary hold put on the funding block? And then maybe beyond that, touch on how you're preparing for a potential RFK confirmation today and what he means for your business?
Scott Brinker: Yes, it sounds good. I mean, NIH funding is up 5%, 6% per year compounded over the last decade, funding in 2024 was around $50 billion, which just underscores the importance of the sector to the U.S., whether it's health national security, etcetera. So I wouldn't expect a significant change. Obviously, there's day-to-day headlines, but this administration has made it clear they want to focus on innovation. You haven't heard that word out of DC much in the last four years. So that's a positive for our business, and they want to focus on deregulation. And there are too many sectors, more regulated than health care and biotech in particular. So any changes there would certainly be a positive. I mean it takes 10 years to 15 years to get through the drug approval process in the U.S. right now. Anything that would shorten that timeline would be a massive win for the sector. So those are all positives. In terms of the potential impact of RFK, I think we're more focused on who's in charge of CMS, NIH, CDC, FTC, FDA, I mean, the list goes on and on. And a lot of the appointments for those positions are more traditional candidates that I think are quite favorable to the business. So there's plenty of headline risk around RFK Jr. hopefully, that we think it ends up being upside opportunity for us because I think the reality is that this administration will be positive for our business.
John Kilichowski: Got it. And then maybe if we could kind of jump back to your guidance on lab. It sounds like you've seen some stability in street rates here. I'm just curious at what availability rates do you expect to start getting pricing power back, even if you kind of adjust for maybe some of that noncompetitive supply?
Peter Scott: Yes. And maybe I'll take a quick stab at it, and Scott Bohn can jump in as well. But I think with our portfolio being in the mid-to-high 80% occupied or leased, I should say, at this point in time, not necessarily occupied because some of these leases haven't commenced. I mean we feel like we're starting to gain some more pricing power within the market. Remember, a lot of our deals are done with existing tenants as well and tenants that typically have existing lease term, which gives us some additional pricing power as well. So we've laid out all the competitive advantages that we see in our portfolio and with our platform versus peers out there. Some of the peers compete a lot more with us and some just don't compete and will never compete with us. But we feel like we've got an opportunity to start maybe pushing rates a little bit more within our portfolio. But obviously, we recognize that there's a lot of availability out there. I don't know, Scott Bohn, if you want to add anything to that?
Scott Bohn: Yes. I think the availability and the new supply out there is the same new supply we've competed against for the last -- past 18 months to 24 months. And we compete very well. I think we've been able to drive economics based on what Pete said is our portfolio of scale. And a lot of our leasing comes from within our own campuses. 83% of our ABR customer campuses that are 400,000 square meters greater, right? So we're oftentimes growing those tenants within those campuses, which gives us the ability to push economics higher than it would be in an otherwise broadly marketed deal.
Scott Brinker: One follow-up on your NIH question. We do not lease any space directly to the NIH. A lot of that funding goes to university-based research, which is not really not really our portfolio. They tend to be early stage basic science that hopefully is successful and gets commercialized 5 years, 10 years down the line, and those tend to be the tenants that we target and enter our portfolio.
Operator: Alright, our next question comes from the line of Mason Guell with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mason Guell: Thanks, good morning everyone. Have you seen any difference in recent demand pre and post-election? And which market they're standing on either positively or negatively?
Scott Brinker: Yes, this is Scott. I wouldn't say there's a difference pre and post-election. I think that the overall sentiment will improve. A lot of people were kind of kicking the can a little bit to see how the election turned out. And I think now that you've got that, you've got the appointments taking place, it's just going to continue to allow people kind of line of sight into where we're going here. Your second question was?
Mason Guell: [indiscernible]
Scott Bohn: Yes, sorry. I would say by market, Boston, in my view, is probably the slowest today. Thankfully, we don't have a lot of virtually no roll over there in the next 18 months to 24 months in very little vacant space. San Diego has been pretty consistent, and we've done some nice leasing down there, bringing our Gateway development up to 44%, has some large renewals in the more renewals in the pipeline down there as well as some new deals we're working on. So we feel good about the activity in San Diego. San Francisco, again, our portfolio scale allows us to do a lot of deals there that never hit the broader market or the broker sheets. So we're very happy with the demand in our pipeline in San [ph] Francisco as well.
Mason Guell: Great. And then on the lab demand, how much of this is being driven by the new tenant versus the expansion of existing tenants?
Scott Bohn: Yes. So I mean it's a mix, right? If you look at the leasing we did over the course of the year, about 1.1 million square feet of that was with tenants who were expanding. And of that 1.1 million square feet, about 400,000 square feet of that was expansion space. So when you're looking at tenants expanding in the portfolio, the average for the year, right, was 60% growth of those tenants.
Mason Guell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our final question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey a couple of quick ones. Just looking at sort of the development, I see some of the initial occupancy dates have been pushed back a little bit. And also that, at least on the redevelopment projects, it doesn't look like the CapEx or the leasing is included for unleased space. Maybe can you just talk a little bit more about that, just on the development and the redevelopment front, sort of what's happening on the ground and thoughts on sort of CapEx on the unleased space not being included? Thanks.
Peter Scott: Yes, I'll take the CapEx one and the timing, maybe just quickly, too. That's really TI related as we price out the TI packages and start to understand the various time lines and that's associated large lease that we did at Portside is one of the ones that you are referencing, and it got pushed back just a little bit, but it's 100% pre-leased at this point in time, and it's just a matter of how quickly we think we can actually get the capital spend. I will say with that tenant, they have an existing lease in place that will offset any of that pushback. They're going to continue to pay us rent on the existing space that they have. So that lease expiration will get pushed out as well. So there's a little bit of a buffer on that. I think on the TI side, all -- not all the projects are the same. So I'd say on the extreme case from a TI perspective, you could be $300 to $350 a foot, right? But in other cases, it could be significantly less than, I'll call it, $100 to $200 a foot. And it's hard to know until you dig in and understand what each individual lease is or the tenant is seeking. So that's why we don't include the TIs necessarily upfront, but I've given you the range of what we think it would be. But in addition, and most importantly, NTI we give we're expecting to get a return on top of that as well. And as we've talked about the 9% to 12% cash-on-cash returns, we feel like we've done quite well relative to that. In fact, we think we could do closer to the high end on some of these, just given the fact that we haven't invested capital in a while, but we feel like we can get a nice rate on that product.
Scott Bohn: And the pushback on one of the development deals, that's really just related to a delay in the tenants on the TI side. We're not completing the core and shell on time, and we'll collect cash rents based on that when the rent starts. So it's more of a timing from an FFO and GAAP perspective there.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then just my last one was just coming back to sort of lab leasing and sort of the state of the market. I guess the messaging is you're going back on offense and lab. And I guess my question is, is it a call on saying, hey, there's distressed opportunities or really unique opportunities that we can capitalize on? Or is it more of a call on like the market is getting better? Or does the market not -- the overall lab market doesn't really need to get better for you guys to be opportunistic? I just -- I can't tell if you're just more bullish on lab? Or is just -- this is just more opportunistic how things are coming in your purview?
Scott Brinker: Well, we signed more than 2 million square feet of leasing in Life Science in 2024. It's one of the best years we've ever had. It was a mix of new and renewal. So clearly, we're capturing market share, but we're also seeing significant distress, and we're picking and choosing which projects are most compelling, and there's a lot that would not fit our criteria, but we feel like the loans that we're making are compelling in that we have very little downside risk given the seniority in the loan to cost versus replacement cost, etcetera and compelling returns on day one with the right to buy in the future. We do think fundamentals will start to get better. I said in the prepared remarks that new deliveries in 2025 are going to be down 75%. And there's essentially no new starts. So we do see the supply picture improving dramatically this year as we look into 2026 and 2027 as well, and we think the demand will improve alongside of that.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And we have another question from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
James Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the call. So I just think in big picture, markets seem to be stabilizing. The debt market seems to be in a much better place than it's been Blackstone's poking around in office. What's your -- has just started their fund business. So what's your appetite? Or as you guys think about it amongst yourselves, what's your appetite to do something much bigger, maybe with third-party capital, given where we are in the cycle and what could be coming in the next 5 years, 10 years in your businesses?
Peter Scott: Yes. We have a couple of important limited partners in the portfolio today that are big institutions that had appetite to do more. So that's certainly on the table. There's pluses and minuses, joint ventures and LPs. Obviously, it can be a compelling additional source of capital for the right opportunities, but it also comes with a loss of complete control and flexibility. So you just have to weigh that trade-off. But we've used it historically with success for the right circumstances and have those conversations all the time, Jamie. Most of what we're looking at today is more on balance sheet.
James Feldman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call -- I would like to turn the conference back over to Scott Brinker for any closing remarks.
Scott Brinker: Okay. Well, thanks for your time today and congrats to our team on another strong quarter, driving earnings growth. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Healthpeak Properties, Inc.’s Third Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Johns, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Johns: Welcome to Healthpeak’s third quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Today’s conference call contains certain forward-looking statements. Although we believe expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. A discussion of risks and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. In an exhibit to the 8-K we furnished to the SEC yesterday, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance to Reg G. The exhibit is also available on our website at healthpeak.com. I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Brinker.
Scott Brinker: Thanks, Andrew, and welcome to Healthpeak’s third quarter earnings call. Joining me today for prepared remarks is our CFO, Peter Scott, and the senior team is available for Q&A. Congrats to the entire Healthpeak team for another quarter of excellence in execution. Our high-quality portfolio and platform continue to drive earnings growth. Last evening, we increased guidance for the third time this year, driven by outperformance in leasing, same-store operations and merger synergies. We still see significant value and upside in our stock when we look at where our multiple sits versus the earnings growth we have produced and expect to continue producing. We’re also paying a 5%-plus dividend with a conservative payout ratio that leaves nearly $300 million of annual free cash flow to reinvest in the business. Let me provide some color on the four levers across our platform that should drive future earnings growth. First is the merger we closed on March 1st. Year one synergies are now tracking to be $50 million, which is 25% above our initial forecast and we have additional synergies to capture in the next year or two. Most of that outperformance is driven by internalization, which has proven to be a great move, both financially and strategically, as it’s brought us closer to our real estate, one of the strategic goals I communicated when I took this position two years ago. Because of the internalization, our 50 million square foot portfolio is increasingly being operated with the same process, procedure and technology, allowing us to better capitalize on our scale. Our G&A is now 25% more efficient as a result of the merger. Also, our balance sheet improved with the merger and has never been stronger. The second area of earnings growth is leasing momentum in our lab business. Since July 1, we’ve signed more than 700,000 square feet of leases, with positive 10% cash re-leasing spreads in the third quarter. That activity includes more than 300,000-feet of new leasing at our high-priority campuses, Vantage, Portside, and Director’s Gateway. South San Francisco continues to be our strongest market, with activity in a range of suite sizes and price points. We’re uniquely positioned to capture demand with our market-leading footprint and relationships. Just one example is the life science tenant who signed a lease at Portside last week. That same company has now grown with us four times since entering the portfolio six years ago, each time within walking distance, in the same sub-market and with a gradual improvement in building quality to the Class A space they will soon occupy. A couple broader comments on life science. We’re seeing gradual but clearly positive momentum on all the key metrics. Employment in the sector increased year over year and is up 4% in the past 18 months. There were seven IPOs in September and 2024 is on pace to be more than 50% above last year’s total. R&D spending from Big Pharma is on pace for another record year, as those companies have no choice but to continually search for innovative new products to backfill their patent expirations. Venture capital fundraising is on pace for an all-time high in 2024. Also, fundraising is significantly higher than cash deployment, meaning there’s a growing stockpile of capital to invest in a new company formation. One of our tenants in South San Francisco recently became the first $1 billion Series A capital raise in the sector. The co-founder was recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which is one of the few accomplishments more remarkable than a $1 billion Series A. The third area of earnings growth is our outpatient medical business. Industry fundamentals are favorable as demand exceeds supply. Our high quality portfolio is capturing record re-leasing spreads and we’re routinely moving the rent escalator up to 3% on new leases. Across the sector, demand is growing as health systems and consumers prioritize cost-effective and convenient outpatient care. Equally important, new supply will remain low because of the cost of new construction. And finally, a few comments on capital allocation, which is the fourth driver of future earnings growth. First, we like the portfolio we own today, so any future dispositions would be small numbers or opportunistic. Our balance sheet is currently under-levered, so we can fund our current pipeline with debt. While several companies went big when life science was at a peak, our last development start was three years ago in 2021 and that project is now 70% leased. With the market starting to recover and new starts going to nearly zero, we see a compelling window to begin allocating capital to life sciences again, primarily through structured investments that provide immediate accretion and more seniority in the capital stack. We’re also building a pipeline of new outpatient development projects, highly pre-leased to leading health systems with yields that are accretive to earnings. That opportunity set could easily get to a couple hundred million dollars per year. Most recently, we commenced a $37 million project that’s 100% pre-leased to HCA. In summary, we’ve grown earnings per share by mid-double digits the last three years and we have four levers to accelerate that growth moving forward. And now Pete Scott will cover operating results, guidance and the balance sheet.
Peter Scott: Thanks, Scott. We had an excellent third quarter. We reported FFOs adjusted a $0.45 per share, AFFO of $0.41 per share, and total portfolio same-store growth of 4.1%. Let me briefly touch on segment performance. Starting with lab, our scale, portfolio quality, depth of tenant relationships, competitive positioning, and importantly, our best-in-class team are driving out performance. This is clearly evident in our leasing activity as we posted a second straight quarter of elevated lease execution and we have a robust pipeline to back this up. A few important highlights from the third quarter. Occupancy increased 30 basis points sequentially to 95.9%. The cash rent mark-to-market was 10%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 10% opportunity we see in our portfolio. Tenant retention was 83%, driven by an increase in early renewals across the portfolio. And same-store growth was 2.8%. Year-to-date, our same-store growth is 3.1%, above the high end of our expectations when we set guidance earlier in the year. Turning to outpatient medical, our results this quarter once again underscore the strength of the long-term demand drivers, combined with our unmatched and superior platform. We have executed over 5 million square feet of leases year-to-date and are on pace to have our strongest leasing year in the history of Healthpeak. A few important highlights from the third quarter. The cash rent mark-to-market was 10%, which is the strongest rent mark-to-market we have reported in 60 quarters. Tenant retention was 89%, above our historical average. And same-store growth was 3.4%. Year-to-date, our same-store growth is 3.3%, which is at the high end of expectations when we set guidance earlier in the year. Finishing with CCRCs. We reported another strong quarter with same-store growth of 14.2%. This was driven by occupancy and rate growth, coupled with moderating expense growth. Year-to-date, our same-store growth is approximately 20%, which is well ahead of the expectations we set earlier in the year. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1 times and $3 billion of liquidity, with our revolver being completely undrawn. We are sitting on significant dry powder in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, which could fund accretive acquisitions. And our recurring CapEx needs are modest, with over 85% of our FFO translating to AFFO, which combined with an AFFO dividend payout ratio trending toward 75%, provides us with approximately $250 million to $300 million of retained earnings annually. Finishing now with guidance. We are revising upwards for the third time this year. We are increasing our FFO as adjusted guidance by $0.01 to $1.79 to $1.81. We are increasing our AFFO guidance by $0.01 to $1.56 to $1.58. Our guidance increase is primarily driven by two items. First, we increased and tightened same-store guidance by 50 basis points to 3.5% to 4.5%. Second, we are now trending to $50 million of merger synergies in 2024. We continue to execute with excellence, having increased the midpoint of our FFO and AFFO guidance by $0.04 each in 2024 and having increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 100 basis points. One last item to note. In advance of upcoming investor meetings, we plan to publish an investor presentation in early November. The focus of the presentation will be on our competitive positioning and key growth drivers of both labs and outpatient medical. The presentation will highlight the strong momentum we see as we finish 2024 and head into 2025. With that, Operator, let’s open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning. So, nice to see the leasing getting done at Gateway, Vantage, Portside. Can you just quantify a couple things there? First, as we think about the commencement of that NOI, I know you gave timing, but an average rent to and then also specifying the square footage of the existing tenant base associated with that in the portfolio and how we should think about that as some level of offset versus the new leasing.
Peter Scott: Yeah. Hey, Nick. It’s Pete. I’ll take this one. When you aggregate all of the new lease deals at Portside, Vantage and Gateway, the total square footage is around 340,000 square feet. The existing tenant footprint that underlies that is about 100,000 square feet. So, we’re increasing by around 240,000 square feet, which is a lot of net absorption within the portfolio. And then as you asked your question around the lease commencements, we did add some commentary in the earnings release on it, but to give some specifics around that. Of the $60 million of NOI upside, we’ve now executed leases to capture a little more than $30 million of that $60 million. You won’t see all of that flow into our numbers in 2025. Probably about a third of that will hit in 2025 with a big chunk of the balance hitting in 2026 and then a little bit more in 2027. But certainly we’re trending in the right direction with regards to development earning and pretty pleased to get the leases done that we’ve gotten done.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks for that. And just to be clear, that $30 million you talked about, is that including the negative offset for the existing square footage, which I’m assuming these tenants are going to be giving up or how should we think about that?
Peter Scott: No. That doesn’t include the negative offset on that. But those leases will stay in place up until the commencements begin on that. So I was just speaking to the gross amount that we would expect to get, Nick.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. And then just second question is on the broader lab market. You are seeing, I think, some examples in your portfolio of funding, picking up, creating leasing demand. Perhaps if you could just talk a little bit more broadly about that trend and how you think it could impact leasing going forward here.
Scott Bohn: Hey, Nick. It’s Scott Bohn. I think we have seen some good funding. The IPO market’s been slow generally, but we have seen 2026 done this year, which is already more than 2023 in total. We just had a South San Francisco tenant go public today, Septerna, who had an outsized IPO at, I think, $288 million. So those will certainly turn into demand on the IPO side. The VC market, when you look at fundraising, has been a record year. And the fund deployment, which has lagged over the past 12 months, is continuing to pick up in new company formation. And then from Pharma, you’ve got a lot of M&A. They’re sitting there with $200 billion of revenues coming off patents between now and 2023 -- 2030, excuse me. So they’re continuing to funnel money into biotech, which will continue to increase the tenant demand and the leasing demand. So I think we’re happy with where the demand is today. I think it will continue to grow over the next few quarters.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys. Scott, I wanted to explore your comments on, because you’re looking at structured investments as a way to kind of deploy capital. What kind of opportunities are you seeing and what is it that you like about this versus maybe just buy buildings outright?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. I mean, there may be situations where we do buy a building outright. At the end of the day, our balance sheet’s in great shape. We have all the key variables that tenants look to when they’re signing leases, whether it’s the footprint, the credibility, the balance sheet, the team. We have all those things. So I think we’re going to be as successful as anyone in getting buildings leased up. There are a lot of opportunities right now. All the new supply that’s not leasing up, while Scott and the team do a great job of leasing up what limited development we do have, not everyone is so fortunate. So we are seeing quite a bit of opportunities, some in our key submarkets where we’d like to grow and have a competitive advantage. Clearly, the sector is improving, but it’s not doing a hockey stick back up. So the structured investments, in our view, would buy us some time to completely lease up buildings. It’s not a six-month turnaround. This could take a couple of years and the structured investments would just buy us more time, as well as immediate accretion in a longer term growth pipeline. So each deal is a little bit different, but I think the majority would be structured accretive day one type investments. But I can’t tell you we’ll get home on any of them, but we are looking at a lot of things right now.
Joshua Dennerlein: Interesting. And then it looks like you increased the synergies post-merger. Is that kind of new synergies you’re finding or maybe just a pull forward of stuff that would have maybe hit in 2025 or beyond?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. I mean, we’ll give the 2025 guidance in early February, but across the Board, the merger has been a catalyst in a number of ways, culturally and financially. Financially, I mean, there were some just traditional G&A synergies, but the vast majority of what we accomplished and still have to accomplish are at the property level and the internalization has really been a huge impact on the company and that’s most of the upside that we’ve seen in 2024. I’d say the profit margins are a little bit better than we had underwritten. The rollout’s been more aggressive and successful than we had anticipated. So that’s a big part of the $50 million and $10 million of improvement in 2024 is really property level earnings. So really a great outcome. A lot of hard work, but a great outcome.
Joshua Dennerlein: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just going back to the lab theme, there are various puts and takes, I guess, in the leasing next year with some of the tenant relocations. But with that, it sounds like you’ve made a lot of progress as well on the 2025, addressing some of the 2025 lease expirations. So I’m just wondering if at a high level, you could provide or characterize kind of how the trend line and lab growth should look from here. Really just trying to get a sense if there’s any disruption from the tenant relocations or free rent that goes along with that?
Peter Scott: Hey, Austin. It’s Pete here. And we almost got the highly coveted five green thumbs up. We’ve got four out of five, but we’ll keep trying to get that highly coveted one, one of these quarters. We did add an additional footnote disclosure on our 2025 lease expirations and that was really put in there to just help with forecasting. I think it tells actually a pretty good story. Nearly 40% of the expirations we have, which are quite small at a little less than 800,000 square feet are either under LOI or were in advanced discussions. We did note that there will be some redevelopment space and actually a big chunk of that is some of the giveback space as tenants have grown with us. So just to be clear, it’s not tenants vacating the portfolio, it’s tenants upsizing within the portfolio. And the other thing I just wanted to mention as I focus on that redev amount, I think three points that are really important. One, it’s leased for the majority of 2025, so there is a very, very limited near-term impact. I think the other thing to mention, the in-place rents are in the high 50s, so we actually see a pretty good mark-to-market on that when we do re-let those buildings. And then the third thing is it’s spread over multiple buildings, and primarily in South San Francisco and in Torrey Pines. So we actually feel pretty good about our prospects on re-leasing those. It’s multiple buildings, great locations. They’re just a little bit older and need some capital. But again, we wanted to put that information in there to help with forecasting.
Austin Wurschmidt: No. That’s helpful. Call it a green-thumb answer. So I appreciate the detail there. And then maybe, Scott Brinker, going back to the structured investment opportunities. I mean, how much capital are you willing to allocate to these investments? What are the returns you’d target for these deals? And are you most focused on deals that you’d ultimately like to own or would you kind of cast a wider net on the structured investment side? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Yeah. Most, if not all, would have a pathway to ownership.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay.
Scott Brinker: I think a lot of the projects that got either built or converted would not be in our sweet spot that we would consider strategic and want to own long-term. We like the sub-markets that we’re in. There’s a few others that could be interesting, but having scale has proven to be a competitive advantage and we wouldn’t change that philosophy. In terms of quantum, I mean, Pete talked about $500 million and more of just balance sheet capacity. Given we’re under levered today, hopefully the stock continues to perform. I think it should. I think it will. That would obviously give us potential capacity to increase that amount. But we’ve got a big outpatient development pipeline as well that’s highly attractive, so we’ll have to balance that. But it could easily be several hundred million dollars, based on the things we’re looking at. The returns, they would all be accretive on day one, but obviously the risk profile would impact the rate of return as well. So I probably won’t say anything more than that at this point.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah. Appreciate the detail. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. This is George Young [ph] from Vikram. Thank you for taking my question. Can you just walk us through how much of the leasing is from existing tenants and can you just talk about the type of tenants that are driving the demand?
Scott Bohn: Hey, George. It’s Scott Bohn. I can start with that one. On the 733,000 square feet in the quarter and subsequent, it was about 71% existing tenants in the portfolio. And from the new demand driver perspective, it really is a great cross-section of the life science industry. I mean, we’ve got everything from Series A tenants that we did deals with this quarter up through mega cap pharmaceutical companies. So it really runs the gamut across the spectrum there.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. And George, you just add to your first part of the question, I mean, from a square footage perspective, tenants are increasing if they had existing footprint within the portfolio over 3X.
Scott Bohn: Yeah.
Scott Brinker: So they’re growing over 3 times. So pretty significant. It’s not like we’re just trading the same amount of square footage for different square footage in other buildings. We are actually increasing net absorption pretty significantly in the portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. That’s helpful. And just a follow-up, can you just comment on the TI packages, and if you have seen any signs of moderation, or they continue to remain elevated?
Peter Scott: Yeah. I would say, I mean, we’re still looking at turnkey TIs on a lot of these fields, on the new development or some of the major redevs. And we talked about that for several quarters now, in those TI packages in the $300 a foot range. But that’s not every deal. If you look at where we’ve been year-to-date on new deals, we’ve averaged right around $85 a foot on new deals and sub $40 a foot on renewal deals. So we have talked about those elevated TIs, which have leveled off, but those are not -- certainly not on every single deal.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Just hoping to follow up a little bit on the merger synergies. It sounded like you’re outperforming on the margins in terms of internalizing some of the property management. So does that mean that there could be upside to the $60 million initially targeted in the longer term?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Probably, Juan, it’s Scott. But like I said, we’ll give guidance in 2025. We’re still working through exactly which markets we internalize in 2025 and the timeline. So a lot of that is still under discussion. But we feel great about the numbers we put out in March, if not last October, versus what we’re actually executing.
Juan Sanabria: Great. And then just on the CCRC, just curious on the latest thoughts about that business and wanting to own that longer term. It’s been a great performer year-to-date, performing initial expectations. You’re just curious if there’s any opportunities to sell out near-term or how you’re thinking about that?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. It’s really been a great performer for 15 years since we bought it. It’s outperformed rental senior housing in virtually every year. In those 15 years, steady growth. Even during the overbuilding that occurred in the kind of 2015 to 2020-time period, we had strong growth and that’s continued. So we have a really strong portfolio, great operating partner in LCS and a team that manages it very, very effectively. So it’s performed. It’s not exactly strategic to our overall platform. There aren’t a total a ton of synergies with life science and outpatient medical. And as we’ve said in the past, it’s a great business, but if public investors want access to senior housing, they have other great companies they can turn to. So if and when the price made sense, we would look to recycle capital out of it, but we’re also in no hurry. The dynamic today is the public market investors are a lot more excited about that segment than the private market. So that’s not a great time to sell. If that dynamic ever reversed, we would obviously consider transacting. But for right now, we’re fully focused on growing NOI, which we have been.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
John Kilichowski: All right. Thank you. Maybe I’ll just start on lab. Another quarter of acceleration here on the rent mark-to-market at 10% and then also occupancy picked up in the quarter after several quarters consecutively of decline. Just kind of curious about the cadence here moving forward. If you expect this to be a steady climb or if you see volatility over the next 12 months? And maybe part two of that, if you could just talk about like from a fully diluted occupancy perspective, where you think you are today and where you think that number can get over the next 12 months?
Peter Scott: Yeah. Hey, John. It’s Pete. Maybe I’ll start with the last question first. Heading into this call, we were probably around 85% on a fully diluted basis from an occupancy perspective. With some of the new leasing we’ve gotten done, it’s probably ticked up a couple hundred basis points. And as we look at where we’d like to get in the next 12 months to 18 months, I mean, we don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to get to a low 90% stabilized occupancy level. I know that’s a bit lower than where we were 100% a couple of years ago. I think 100% is probably going to take a really long time to get back to and I think we feel really comfortable with stabilized occupancies in the call it low 90% area and I think the pathway is there for us to achieve that. And then on the rent mark-to-market question, look, it’ll be lumpy sometimes. In fact, I think the fourth quarter and what we see in our pipeline could actually be the best rent mark to market quarter if we get a lot of those leases across the goal line that we will put up for 2024. That said, we’ve been pretty clear that it’s basically a 5% to 10% rent mark-to-market opportunity. It’s probably closer to 10% than it is to 5% based upon leases that we’re getting done and we see that as a pretty good number if you’re forecasting going forward.
Scott Brinker: Pete, I add one thing on the occupancy. There’s kind of the operating portfolio and then there’s the total portfolio. And we’ve just had a period of time here where we have some big campuses that needed to be redeveloped and some development projects that were in lease up. So although the operating portfolio is at 95%, our total portfolio is more like 85% and that’s obviously what drives earnings is the total portfolio. So we do see pretty significant upside from where we sit today and I think that’s what Pete’s referring to when you talk about what’s a go forward occupancy number. Hopefully that’s for the entire portfolio. In the actual like stabilized operating portfolio could be even higher than that in part because we have a lot of single tenant buildings. It’s just that the frictional vacancy is lower in life science than it would be in a business like outpatient medical.
John Kilichowski: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just a similar question on outpatient medical. We put up a 10% number there as well, but it has the previously communicated CommonSpirit deal. Could you maybe parse that apart and give us what the rest of that or those leases were mark-to-market at and then kind of the expectation of how you think the next 12 months will look for that space?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. I can quickly take that. And then if others have some thoughts, they can jump in. But yeah, we were up 10%. That’s on the 3 million square feet of lease executions we got done last quarter. If you back out CommonSpirit, which was $2 million, up 13%-ish, we were probably up 3% to 4%, right, which is still pretty darn strong. And I think we’ve been averaging probably close to that 3% to 5%, maybe a little bit higher in some quarters. And I think that’s the trend that’s here to stay, right? Between that as well as the lease escalators no longer being 2.5% but really pushing those at 3%. As we’ve been saying, we think the fundamentals in outpatient medical are as strong as they’ve ever been. And we think we feel great about maintaining that occupancy in the 92%, 93% range. I don’t know, Tom Klaritch, anything you want to add to that?
Tom Klaritch: I think you covered it. That’s exactly what we’re looking for…
Scott Brinker: Yeah.
John Kilichowski: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So on the internalizations, $50 million now, I assume that still means $25 million G&A. I think you said, Scott, that the incremental has been at the property level. But beyond that, and I know it also applies to your life science portfolio, would you say internalization, like what is not being internalized? I just want to sort of definitionally what you mean by internalization and what, if there’s anything, after all this is said and done, that there’s another leg up of synergies that isn’t a part of the quote-unquote internalization process today that might be in the future?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Fair question, Rich. When we talk about internalization, we’re speaking to the onsite property manager, as well as in most cases, the property level accountants. So that’s the personnel that we’ve brought in house. And for the most part, it’s simply been a matter of taking the existing third-party team and bringing them onto the Healthpeak team. So the execution risk has been really low and we’ve had near 100% success rate bringing people over. So I think that’s one reason we’ve been able to roll it out faster than we anticipated without a whole lot of hiccups, but again, with a lot of hard work by our team. The leasing, there are times when we do internal leasing, particularly on big renewals, especially in the outpatient medical space. In life science, Scott and the team end up doing a lot of the negotiation, but it’s critical to have really strong broker relationships. So that’s not a function that we’ve quote-unquote internalized. We still utilize third-party brokers to help canvass the market and give us the broadest possible exposure for our portfolio. Does that help…
Rich Anderson: Yeah. That’s great…
Scott Brinker: … Rich.
Rich Anderson: Okay, so…
Scott Brinker: Okay.
Rich Anderson: … there’s no…
Scott Brinker: All right. Thanks.
Rich Anderson: … thought about bringing in the brokerage function internal, that that’s something you see you need long-term generally?
Scott Brinker: Not beyond what I mentioned with outpatient medical, we were doing some big renewals in-house.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Second question, looking at your disclosure, about $900 million of development underway, total cost. That’s call it 3.5%, 4% of your enterprise value. You mentioned you haven’t done a new development start since 2021 and sort of you’re sort of teasing us into thinking that perhaps that day is coming even, despite the structure finance and structure investments that you’re talking about for life science. What is your sort of ceiling in terms of size of development relative to the totality of the company, so that you don’t kind of get into the situation where you have the market goes against you and you’re having trouble financing it for some period of time? Like where are you comfortable allowing development get to in terms of the size of the organization? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I mean, we do have a threshold that we talk about with the Board. It’s generally been in the 5% of total balance sheet, but I’d also point out that outpatient development is vastly different than life science development. They tend to be 18-month type projects. They’re oftentimes 70% or more pre-leased. So the risk profile there is obviously different. You don’t have the lease up risk. You just have the timing risk and what happens with cost of capital and cap rates in the interim 18 months. So that would have an impact as well as we think about our maximum exposure, but as well as our balance sheet. But today it’s never been stronger.
Rich Anderson: It used to be that your life science was the overwhelming part of the development pipeline. That’s not the case anymore. Do you think that there’ll be more of a balanced longer term despite what you’re saying about the risk profile of medical office development?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. That’s probably right. But for the next year or two, at least I would expect the development pipeline to be focused on the outpatient business where there’s some really exciting opportunities. I mean, best-in-class health systems, highly pre-released, beautiful new buildings, good yields. That’s really our emphasis for development in the near-term.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi Group. Your line is open.
Michael Griffin: Thanks. I wanted to go back to the Portside lease in South San Francisco and if you can give us a sense, if this deal was more broadly marketed to the brokerage community, did you mainly work on it in-house so you kind of had a leg up on the competition? And if you have a sense, maybe not just in South SF, but your other markets, if there have been larger space requirements that have been popping up?
Peter Scott: Yeah. I think maybe I’ll start and Scott Bohn can jump in. It’s Pete. I mean, that deal was not marketed whatsoever. So I know Scott Bohn’s gotten a lot of communications and I’m sure there’s other landlords out there trying to figure out why they didn’t get a shot at that deal. That’s a tenant that’s been in the portfolio for quite some time and never spoke to another landlord about potentially leaving our portfolio and has actually told us that they will never do a deal with another landlord other than Healthpeak. So I think we feel pretty well positioned with that. And I think the other thing to just mention with your questions and I know we’ve said it a lot the last couple of quarters, but it’s a great example of our competitive advantage that we have in labs. We’re in the best markets and best submarkets. Our brand is exceptional. We have a best-in-class team led by, Scott Bohn, and our extensive tenant relationships are going to continue to fuel our leasing pipeline. So I appreciate you bringing that up because it’s actually a great point that I wanted to expand on. I don’t know, Scott, if there’s anything else you wanted to...
Scott Bohn: Yeah. Hey, Griff. On the demand side part of your question, we’ve talked for the past several quarters about kind of that barbell of demand with a lot of the demand leaning towards the smaller kind of sub-30,000-square-foot range and then some large deals out there. So I think it still probably skews towards the smaller deals, but we’ve started to see that, you call it the handle of the barbell, start to fill in there. Of the deals we did this past quarter, eight of them were greater than 35,000-square-feet. So it’s really good to see that, tenants of that size range coming back into the market and transacting on deals. And there are some larger requirements out in the market that have been out in the market. Those take a long time to actually transact and take place, but there are a few.
Michael Griffin: Great. Appreciate the color there. And then just maybe one on MOBs. It seemed like a strong quarter from a renewal standpoint, but just given the more favorable supply-demand backdrop we’ve seen this year, have you seen a greater ability to push rents either through cash-releasing spreads or maybe larger lease escalators? And are tenants willing to commit to longer-term leases, just given kind of the positive backdrop you’re seeing in the industry?
Tom Klaritch: Yeah. This is Tom. I think when you look at it, we’ve been pretty successful over the past three or four years getting 3% escalators. You can see our average has jumped up to 2.7% overall. We actually have been pushing the past couple of quarters, 3.25%, so hopefully we can get more of those pushed in there and the mark-to-markets Pete mentioned, 3% to 5%. We’ve been absent the CommonSpirit lease. That’s kind of where we’ve been falling out all year. And you’ll tend to see leases, 80% of them are going to be in that 3% to 4% range and then you get an outlier group on either end of that that drives what the total is. But overall, the 3% to 4% or 5% is kind of where we’ve been running.
Michael Griffin: Great. That’s it for me. Thanks so much for the time.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Michael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I know DOC announced a few life science leadership changes and specifically, I think you added a Boston leader. I mean, should we think about DOC positioning itself to be more active on the investment side with these additions or is this just partly driven by winding down some of your external partnerships to kind of manage some of these assets?
Scott Brinker: It could be a combination of both. Part of it is rewarding really strong performance for some of our existing employees. Obviously, Scott Bohn has dramatically increased his seniority at the company, and Natalia has always been his number two and had tremendous success. So we have to reward our best internal people. There’s been a real emphasis on that. The new hire in Boston, we’re super excited about. She’s a long-time fixture in that marketplace, which is important just given the dynamics in Boston. We did buy out our primary joint venture partner in Boston earlier this year, so there was a need to step up. So that certainly had an impact, but we would like to grow in Boston. It’s a hugely important market. We’re up to roughly 3 million square feet, but we see a lot of opportunity and stress in that market in particular that could be interesting. So it’s all of those factors, Mike.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then, because I know you provided some on the leasing that you completed this quarter and some of the new leasing and the developments kind of gave us some commencement times, and I understand Portside’s a little bit more elongated, but the new leases signed this quarter, I mean, is there a rough timeline of when you think that those leases could commence? Is it over the next few quarters or is it longer than that?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. On the renewals, I mean, a lot of those will just commence immediately once we sign them. And then obviously the Portside lease has a longer lease-up time associated with it because it’s a much larger lease. I’d say the balance of it is probably mid-2025. We’ve got to build out some TI space, and I think that the ones that are in San Diego and at Gateway will probably be more mid-ish 2025, and then the lease at Vantage will probably be kind of second half of 2025. That’s probably the best way to characterize the commencement for those.
Michael Carroll: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Scott Brinker: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Derrick Metzler: Hi. Good morning. This is Derrick Metzler on for Ron. Yes. My question is about the lab portfolio development pipeline. Given positive leasing trends and these positive absorption trends, are you getting any closer, you think to putting the pipeline into play and are the hurdles to starting new projects now more about occupancy in your existing lease-up properties or more about cost of capital? And if there are not starts in the near future, then is there kind of other optionality or alternative uses that you would consider for that land bank? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Happy to take that one. We do control upon full entitlement almost 5 million square feet of potential life science development in core submarkets where we already have a presence and competitive advantage and a tenant base. So from that standpoint, we feel great about the land bank. The economics today, when you look at construction costs, which is up very dramatically in the past couple of years, including the term TTI, as well as where rents are relative to cost of capital, it’s going to be difficult for life science landlords to start anything new in the foreseeable future. The economics are just tight. That won’t last forever. That will obviously benefit our existing portfolio. So we feel good from that standpoint, but I don’t expect us to start new life science development in the foreseeable future. We would need costs to come down. They could be stabilized, but we need them to start coming down. Cost of capital improve and obviously rental rates start to move higher. All of those things are a combination that would allow us to consider activating the land bank. In the interim, we’re going through the entitlement process. In some cases doing construction drawings so that we’re ready to proceed because part of our business plan is obviously catering to growth tenants. And some prefer to have Class B space, but others prefer to have Class A space. You need to have both available so a development pipeline becomes an important part of our marketing pitch to all of our tenants, which is one reason we’re also looking at some of the distress in the marketplace and whether that could be an outlet at a much lower cost basis to provide a growth avenue for our tenants.
Derrick Metzler: Yeah. That’s helpful. Appreciate the color. I think as a follow-up, just in terms of the lab market conditions, I mean, it’s easy for us to point to new supply as a potential headwind, but your portfolio has performed really well. I guess, in terms of competitive supply that you see and do you think conditions are improving over the next year or moving sideways? Are there markets that could be potentially more challenging over the next year?
Scott Brinker: I mean, the overall market is clearly improving. It might be a little bit slower than we’d like. I do think we’re capturing outsized market share, but the trajectory is obviously positive. I mean, the amount of supply that’s underway today is 50% of what it was a year ago and it will be down another 70%, 80% a year from now and then it will go to zero. I think that will last for quite a while, and clearly, the fundraising environment is starting to improve as interest rates decline. In particular, venture capital fund raising has never been stronger. They obviously didn’t raise that money to sit on it. They’re going to deploy that into new companies going forward. So we do feel good about the big picture market backdrop and what it should lead to for landlords like Healthpeak over the next three years to five years. An even bigger picture is just the way the industry works with Big Pharma. They have a seven-year to 10-year time horizon to make a profit on a drug. When that window expires, they have to replace it, right? They’re not shutting down. I don’t think BMS or J&J, they don’t have a business plan that entails just, let’s run out our patents and close up shop. I mean, they’re redeploying those profits into new innovative drugs and already today the majority of the revenue comes from drugs developed by biotechs and it feels like the momentum is only positive in terms of most of the innovation happening at the biotech level. So we remain incredibly confident about the longer-term outlooks for the industry. In the next three years to five years, we clearly see an improving backdrop.
Derrick Metzler: That’s great. Helpful. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone. I just want to go back to the supply question. How much early -- how early will you lead the recovery? I imagine there’s a subset of landlords that have the money that can do the TIs. There’s other subset of the people that are delivering zero percent occupied projects and may just struggle. I’m just trying to get a sense of will you be leased up in a year or two, and then everyone else may take another three years or four years? What kind of landscape are we looking at?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. I mean, good question. I think in the core sub-market, stuff is going to lease up a heck of a lot faster and I think for those large incumbent landlords, you’re going to see us continue to gain market share. For those that developed in new sub-market and don’t have existing tenant relationships, they’re going to struggle. They are struggling. They will struggle. Hard for us to tell you how that product leases up or if it ever does lease up, but it’s non-competitive for us.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then just regarding…
Scott Brinker: You already see projects that were planned. Hey, Wes, I was just going to say…
Wes Golladay: Go ahead, Scott.
Scott Brinker: … you’ve already seen projects that were planned for life science that have gone the other direction, either planned conversions that never went anywhere or potential developments that have stalled and are basically mothballed. So that’s happening as well as projects just sitting vacant, in some cases looking for capital. So the markets, it’s not a criticism. It’s just a reality that they tend to overshoot in both directions. They got overly excited about life science and there’s a period of time where they probably underappreciate the strength of the business. So we’re clearly in that phase and we’re trying to take advantage of it.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then one final one. Maybe you can comment on how your tenant watch list is looking since the start of the year. Anything adding or maybe even falling off for both the outpatient medical and the lab?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. I think we’ve had within our portfolio tenants have raised $7 billion year-to-date, and as a result of that, you’ve seen our monitoring list come down to what we consider just normal course at this point in time and a lot of that is just the function of capital markets opening up, which is certainly leading to better credit for our tenants, as well as additional leasing.
Wes Golladay: Thanks for the time.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hey. Thanks for the time. I am curious if you can give us a sense about the typical amount of free rent concession on leases executed in the third quarter and then the batch of leases and all allies for fourth quarter work?
Peter Scott: Yeah. As we’ve been saying, it’s probably for every year of lease term, it’s about a month of free rent and that’s actually consistent with what we’ve achieved with all of our leases, especially those that are these larger new developments. So it’s in line with what we’ve been saying to the street. And by the way, John, that hasn’t really changed all that much over the last year. It certainly has gone up from the house beyond days a couple of years ago, but it’s stabilized as well as rental rates stabilizing the last couple of really the last year.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Understood. And then maybe if you could just expand on that, Pete, I think maybe a quarter or two ago, the expectation was for lab and a wide growth to accelerate throughout the year and there was a sequential decline this quarter ostensibly because of free rent. So what, I guess, what has surprised the downside on the trajectory of occupancy or free rent? Just any more color on the sluggish rebound and NOI growth in the second half of this year would be helpful?
Peter Scott: Yeah. On that in particular, that’s a good question. The free rent, as you point out, can have an impact from one quarter to another. I step back and I just look at the fact that at the beginning of the year, we thought we’d be at 1.5% to 3% same-store growth in lab, year-to-date we’re at 3.1%. So we’re actually exceeding the upside of what our original expectations are. So I’d say we, we feel like there’s been modest improvement. There is a lumpiness to that free rent that could have an impact one quarter to the next, but it is important to step back and look at it, not just in a one quarter increment, but to look at it over a longer period of time. So we feel like year-to-date, we’re doing quite well.
Scott Brinker: And that the same-store NOI is just a lagging indicator. It’s also a bit misleading. I mean, the fact is all the key metrics are moving in a positive direction, releasing spreads, now occupancy, the watch list, policing. Those are the things that drive earnings.
Peter Scott: Yeah. Yeah. Obviously goes without mentioning as well. Occupancy did tick up sequentially from 2Q to 3Q and so the free rent had a little bit of an impact on the same-store NOI, but certainly with occupancy increasing, that’s a pretty good trend line.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for the time.
Scott Brinker: Yeah.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. Your line is open.
Jim Kammert: Good morning. Thank you. If we could go back maybe just to the leasing you called out for 2025, the 320,000 square feet, would that -- what is it to really to know what sort of the dollar magnitude will be expended on that redevelopment and the particular yields you expect on that incremental capital?
Peter Scott: Yeah. I mean, I don’t know that we’re going to get into all the specifics because every building’s a little bit different with regards to the amount of capital, depending upon the age of the building. But I do want to just mention that those buildings are leased for the majority of 2025. So I just want to lay any concerns that people think those buildings are just going dark on January 1st. And as I said, a lot of those are buildings where tenants are upsizing and we’ve had a lot of success leasing those buildings up to earlier stage biotech tenants and having them grow in the portfolio. So we don’t look at it as a headwind. We look at it as an opportunity. But as we’ve said, if you had to put first gen type TIs in, it’s probably $300 a foot. I’m not sure that we’d have to do that across the entirety of that portfolio, but it will require a little bit of an investment because the average age is around 25 years and we are moving tenants out of those buildings into really high quality buildings. But again, we look at that as an opportunity, not as a headwind.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. They’re core sub markets too. It’s not like they’re just random buildings. So I think the execution risk is a lot lower. We just need to put some capital in and confident that we’ll get them re-leased. We really do like the portfolio that we own. I think it’s a unique position to be in.
Jim Kammert: Right. That’s fair. And then, Scott, your earlier comments said that greenfield development obviously we know doesn’t really make a lot of sense in most markets. So when you think about these redevelopment opportunities, you’ve got some coming up at 2025. If you look at your lab portfolio, what order of magnitude, either maybe in square footage or just give us a guidance, perhaps what is still not in state-of-the-art where you could continue to kind of harvest and increase the returns on an annual basis? What 1 million square feet or what else might you want to redevelop in the lab portfolio as it sits today in the operating?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. I mean, we do a pretty thorough across the 50 million square foot portfolio, ongoing assessment of redevelopment candidates, kind of prioritizing them out one year, two years, three years. So I think the disclosure we gave as part of this earnings release was incremental and hopefully positive. We could consider providing something additional, but it is a pretty intense portfolio management effort that we have just to prioritize those redoubts. But $100 million a year in the aggregate still feels like the right benchmark given the strength of the portfolio, the age of the portfolio.
Jim Kammert: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Just a quick one on outpatient medical development. Are you seeing more pre-lease build-the-suit type or spec opportunities for the next few years? And when you think about your yield requirements, how different are those two?
Scott Brinker: Well, there’s nothing spec. Everything is 70% or more pre-leased. In some cases, they are complete build-the-suits at 100%, like the one we announced yesterday with HCA. The yields continue to be 7% plus, at least in today’s cost of capital environment. That’s been our target. The pipeline could be even bigger if the return thresholds were lower. There’s no shortage of health systems that would like to expand their outpatient footprint. It’s just a matter of which projects get the green light given the rental rates that need to be paid. That’s really the governor on our opportunity set right now.
Mike Mueller: Okay. Thank you.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Scott Brinker for any closing remarks.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Well, thanks for your time and attention today and congrats again to our team on a really excellent quarter. Have a good weekend.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Healthpeak Properties, Inc. Second Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Johns, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Johns: Welcome to Healthpeak's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements. Although, we believe expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. A discussion of risks and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures to be discussed on this call. In an Exhibit of the 8-K we furnished with the SEC yesterday, we reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements. These details are also available on our website at healthpeak.com. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Chief Executive Officer, Scott Brinker?
Scott Brinker: Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Healthpeak's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today for our prepared remarks is Pete Scott, our CFO and the senior team is available for Q&A. First, I'd like to congratulate our entire team on an incredible quarter. We executed on every one of our stated priorities, including merger integration, leasing, asset sales and accretive stock buybacks. Last evening, we increased our 2024 guidance for the second time this year, driven by out performance in leasing, same-store operations and stock buybacks. In addition, our conservative balance sheet and dividend payout ratio are competitive advantages that benefit future earnings growth. Merger integration continues to go exceptionally well, both financially and culturally, as we're meeting or exceeding every goal we set. For example, year one synergies are now tracking to be a bit higher than $45 million. More important, over the last several months, our newly combined team been focused on defining the core values of our desired culture. Those core values are now represented by the acronym, WE CARE. W for winning mindset, E for empower the team, C for collaborate and communicate, A for active integrity, R for respective relationship and E for excellence and execution. These are the core values we refer to each day in the office and hold each other accountable for. Our outstanding second quarter results are a reflection of those core values in action and the strong culture we are building together. One of my strategic goals has been to bring Healthpeak closer to its real estate and to become fully immersed in the underlying businesses of our tenants. The merger helped us accelerate that transformation. Today, 70% our people directly support real estate. Two years ago, that figure was less than 50%. And we're increasingly dialed into the health care ecosystem. This is critical because the health care sector is not a traditional real estate business. Investment outcomes are very much impacted by the underlying business taking place in our building, not just the attributes of the real estate itself. A thorough understanding of the operating and regulatory environment and close relationships with leading providers will drive superior investment and portfolio management decisions over time. Okay. I'd like to provide an update on our life science business. 2Q was by far our largest quarter of lease executions in several years. The attractive pipeline we've been talking about is now being converted into leases, as our tenants have gotten more comfortable in making real estate decisions. We signed 800,000 square feet of leases in the second quarter, 75% were renewals and 25% were new. The re-leasing spread was positive 6%, and, as has been the case for several years running, not a single tenant downsized upon renewal. In fact, several of the tenants took additional space. 84% of that leasing was done with existing tenants and the remaining 16% are new to the portfolio. On one hand, highlighting our competitive advantage from existing relationships, at the same time, adding new ones for future growth. Sponsorship is paramount to tenants and their brokers in this environment. Our credibility, portfolio quality, and strong balance sheet give us a competitive advantage. Our 2Q results and pipeline suggest we hit an inflection point well ahead of the sector at large. We expect 3Q to be a big leasing quarter as well. We signed an additional 180,000 square feet of leases in July, all of which were new with an average term of 10 years. And our pipeline remains strong, with 620,000 square feet under signed LOI, including at Vantage, Portside, and Directors Gateway. Moving to our outpatient medical business. We're driving strong performance through our platform, favorable industry fundamentals and our high-quality portfolio. Occupancy in outpatient portfolio was up 20 basis points in the quarter and re-leasing spreads were positive 4.7%. Operationally, we haven't skipped a beat with the merger and our increased scale allows us to take advantage of strong volume growth across the sector as underscored by HCA's exceptional second quarter results this week. Also, as announced yesterday, we're very pleased to strengthen our relationship with CommonSpirit for the next decade plus. We sold about 900,000 square feet of space leased to CommonSpirit in June and July as part of the sale transactions we announced yesterday. Our go-forward relationship represents 2 million square feet or approximately 3% of our total ABR, and is well diversified across more than 30 different cities, including Seattle, Houston, and Salt Lake City. We recently executed early renewals across the portfolio, which extends the blended maturity date to December of 2035. So, whilst have been three years and now improves to more than 11 years. The blended re-leasing spread is positive 13% and the annual rent escalator will increase to a fixed 3%. Note that the terms of the existing leases will remain in effect through the original maturity date, most which are in 2026, 2027, and 2028. We used our in-house leasing team to negotiate and execute the early renewal another example of the merger augmenting our platform capabilities. This was a win-win outcome and we're very pleased with the collaboration between Healthpeak and CommonSpirit. Okay. Moving to capital allocation. Yesterday, we announced $853 million of outpatient medical asset sales in five separate transactions at a 6.8% blended cap rate. These were non and less-core buildings in markets we're not looking to grow, such as North Dakota, Earl, Nebraska, and Upstate New York. The sales are accretive to our future growth profile and the cap rate on our remaining outpatient portfolio would certainly be inside the sales we announced yesterday. We included a comparative asset quality table in our earnings release that support those statements. The net proceeds create significant dry powder to drive future earnings growth. We bought that $88 million of stock since our last earnings call as we continue to believe the share price was undervalued in comparison to the intrinsic value of our real estate. Year-to-date, we repurchased $188 million of stock at a blended price of just under $18 per share, which equates to an implied cap rate in the high 7% range. To accretively fund these repurchases, we've sold $1.2 billion of assets year-to-date at a blended cap rate of 6.5%. Portfolio fine-tuning is usually dilutive, but we took advantage of the temporary dislocation in our stock price to strengthen our portfolio in a way that's actually accretive to earnings. And I'll close with external growth. Our deep health system relationships are driving compelling new development opportunities. The two projects we announced yesterday totaled $53 million and are 84% pre-leased with stabilized yields in the mid-7s. These projects offer compelling value. At a positive spread, we're recycling out of older, non and less-core assets into brand new buildings in core markets with leading health systems. We're currently underwriting an attractive pipeline of similar development projects with our health system partners. And now, Pete Scott will cover operating results, guidance and the balance sheet.
Peter Scott: Thanks, Scott. We had a very strong second quarter. We reported FFO as adjusted of $0.45 per share, AFFO of $0.39 share and total portfolio same-store growth of 4.5%. Let me briefly touch on segment performance, starting with outpatient medical. Our results this quarter underscore the strength of the long-term demand drivers we are seeing. We reported same-store growth of 3.1%, a positive rent mark-to-market on the new leasing of 4.7% and a retention rate of 83%. Additionally, we are consistently achieving 3% fixed escalators on new leases, which should improve our earnings growth trajectory for years to come. Turning to lab. The strength of our portfolio, relationships and reputation are leading to outsized leasing demand and driving results that are exceeding expectations. We reported same-store growth of 3%, driven by 3% plus contractual rent escalators and a positive 6% rent mark-to-market. Occupancy did tick down a bit, but was largely the result of fully occupied Poway sale in San Diego that was completed earlier in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have signed 1.1 million square feet of leases and have a robust leasing pipeline for the balance of the year. Finishing with CCRCs. We reported same-store growth of positive 2%, driven by 200 basis points of occupancy growth and strong rate growth of 7%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a net debt to EBITDA of 5.2 times and nearly $3 billion of liquidity. However, these metrics don't take into account the majority of our disposition, which closed in July. Pro forma, these dispositions, our net debt to EBITDA is approximately five times, we have nothing outstanding on our line of credit and we have a cash balance of $300 million. So we are sitting on significant dry powder to drive future earnings growth from acquisitions, redevelopments, developments or stock buybacks. On stock buybacks, our existing authorization was due to expire in August, and we filed a new two-year $500 million authorization. Finishing now with guidance. We are increasing our FFO as adjusted guidance range by $0.01 to $1.77 $1.81, and we are increasing our AFFO guidance range by $0.01 to $1.54 to $1.58. Our guidance increase is driven by three items. First, we increased same-store guidance by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 4.25%. Second, the significant early renewal leasing in lab and outpatient medical, including CommonSpirit, provided an immediate FFO benefit. Third, we accretively bought back an incremental $88 million worth of stock at an FFO yield near 10%. With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Josh Dennerlein, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Josh Dennerlein: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to touch base on the CommonSpirit renewal here. Looks like you got 3% annual escalators going forward. I think it was 2.5% before. Just is that 50 bps improvement from the prior lease, is that kind of something we should expect across like the MOB space? I guess I'm just trying to think about like the future growth trajectory or internal growth trajectory of the MOB portfolio as you kind of resign leases?
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean most of what we're signing now is with 3% escalators. When we announced the transaction with physicians, almost a year ago at this point, we talked about the fact that their in-place escalator was a little bit lower, just given the timing of when they struck leases. A lot of them were single tenant, their blended escalator was more in the kind of low to mid-2s. Healthpeak had moved its escalator in the outpatient business up into the high 2s already. But as we sign new leases, almost everything is at 3%. So we do see our blended in-place escalator today is at about 2.5%, 2.6% in the outpatient business. Over the next few years, it will slowly climb into the high 2s, if not 3%. So yes, that should be the new normal.
Josh Dennerlein: Okay. That's good color. And then I want to talk about the internalization of that outpatient medical segment. It looks like you added like two additional markets in July. Just kind of where are you in that process overall? And then any kind of ability to kind of add better synergies as we go forward?
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean we started the year with $40 million of synergies. We're up above $45 million at this point because, in large part, the internalization has gone ahead of plan in terms of more markets than we anticipated sooner and a little bit better upside. So that's a big reason for the increase in merger synergies. But even more important to us as a leadership team is just the improvement in the platform and interaction that Healthpeak employees now have with our properties and with our health systems. I think longer term is an even bigger impact than the financial accretion. It's more than 100 people now on Healthpeak's payroll directly interacting with our team that are interacting with our tenants every day. It's just a -- I think it's a terrific change in terms of our platform capabilities. So we've got two more planned for the balance of this year, including here in Denver, which we're excited about. It's a super high-quality team that we're bringing on that's going to manage this really high-quality portfolio that we have in Denver. So we'll be at about 50% of our outpatient and lab business by year-end will be internally managed. And we've got, I don't know, 10 million to 12 million square feet next year that is not in process yet, but we should be able to execute in 2025.
Josh Dennerlein: Excellent. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico : Thanks. In terms of the lab leasing that got done and the pipeline activity, just hoping to understand a little bit more about how much is actually related to Gateway, Vantage and Portside, of what was leased in the second quarter in July versus the pipeline of activity still to close?
Peter Scott : Yes. Hey, Nick, it's Pete. So the 620,000 square feet of LOIs, I would say that about half of that is associated with the three large projects you just mentioned, Vantage, Gateway as well Portside. And a couple of them are pretty large deals as well. Our hope is to convert all of those to leases this upcoming quarter. And as we do, we can provide more detail. I think the thing one I would add to it is the phasing in of the upside, that will happen over a couple of years. The lease is probably on average will commence middle of next year. So we'll get an immediate FFO benefit once a lease commences. And then beyond that, it's probably the year after that where you start to see a really big pickup in AFFO as cash rent starts getting paid. So I think that's probably the best way I can describe the LOI bucket and the upside opportunity. But we're trending in the right direction, and we feel really good about the foot traffic and all of those.
Nick Yulico : Okay. Great. And then if I'm doing some math on this, I mean, it seems like if you actually convert those leases you talked about in the pipeline, and then based on what you've already done, that you get to almost about 50% of that $60 million NOI upside number that that you've spoken about previously. Is correct?
Peter Scott : Yes. I think directionally, Nick, that is correct. I would say, a lot of our lease deals that you've seen have been with existing tenants as well. And there may be a little bit of giveback space that we'll have to lease up. But I'd say just on the gross numbers you mentioned, yes, probably about half of that.
Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question, maybe more broadly in lab, is if you could talk about what types of tenant activity you are seeing on the new leasing side, if it's existing tenants expanding other tenants in the market where you're just capturing some market share? And then from an activity standpoint, how that shakes out between South San Francisco, San Diego or I think -- I imagine the bulk of the activity is?
Scott Brinker : Hey, Nick, it's Scott. I'll take that. I think our team is doing a fantastic job capturing market share. We've got the big footprint in all three of the core markets, but I really feel like we are capturing an outsized share of the market right now. So hats off to the team. And the footprint that we build, even when kind of the business was exploding in popularity for the last decade, we held true to our strategy, staying the core submarkets, campus model. And it's really paying off right now because having a great real estate platform and building quality is obviously a huge differentiator as well. And we like the fact that we have A+ buildings, we have B- buildings and everything in between. So that when I talk about having a pretty broad base of demand, it's in part because of that footprint. We can cater to all types of tenants, and that's a huge advantage. So we're working with credit tenants doing big deals, early renewals. We're working with Series A relative startups and everything in between. But for the most part, the leasing is tied to companies that have successful capital raises, whether it's private or public. In 2Q, it was primarily existing tenants. The pipeline is a combination and more weighted towards new leasing, which is obviously a great thing to see.
Nick Yulico: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just curious what brought on the negotiations for the early renewal of CommonSpirit. And is that 13% mark-to-market net effect if any -- including any capital that you provided? Just kind of looking for some color on overall economics of that deal. Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. Hey, Austin, yeah, we could have waited, but I think we were able to strike a mutually beneficial outcome, and that's the reason that we went ahead and did the early renewal. There are some TIs, but it's pretty modest. We did an 8-plus year extension on average, and the TIs are roughly one year of rent, so pretty modest or at market. So we're happy with that that outcome. But more than anything, it was just -- it was a deal we thought was favorable to the company, and we were happy to move forward with it.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then, Scott, you've spoken a lot about kind of the environment having an impact on how you approach capital allocation and disposition, share buybacks have been top priorities up until this point. But given where the stock is today, where interest rates are, is that still the top priority? Or are you rethinking your approach moving forward?
Scott Brinker: Well, I mean, stock buybacks are more of a tactical move. It turned out very favorably for the company. We were trading at a pretty big discount to the value of the real estate, where were to sell assets in match fund to accretively buy back stock. We were trading at a discount to consensus NAV and our internal NAV. So just the dynamics made that easy decision. The profitability from buying back stock today is lower. But we do have a fantastic balance sheet. I mean, we finished the quarter at 5.2 times. And if you account for the sale proceeds from Uniti transaction, we're down near 5 times leverage, which on a balance sheet our size is pretty substantial dry powder. So depending on what happens with the stock, we do have the authorization to keep buying it back. It's obviously a bit less attractive today, but we still feel like we're trading at a discount to the value of our assets. When I think about an implied 7-cap today, plus or minus, and we just sold, for us, relatively low-quality outpatient medical by our standards, at a cap rate below that. So I think that's telling in terms of where the stock is trading. But I don't expect that to continue. I mean, if we continue to grow earnings signed leases and put up excellent results like we just did. I mean, our expectation is that we're going to be trading at a premium and issuing stock and growing the company. We do have big outpatient medical opportunity. We announced $50 million of new development today with one of our important partners. Core market, core system, highly pre-leased, accretive, 7.5% stabilized yield, there's a fairly big pipeline of similar projects behind that, that we could execute on and certainly have the dry powder to do so.
Austin Wurschmidt: So, I guess what would it take or what would you need to see before maybe some of the deep pipeline you've spoken a few years ago within the lab segment, for you to approach commencing construction on some of that? Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Yeah. So if you think about our operating portfolio in life science, we're around 95% leased. But our development -- redevelopment portfolio has a lot of opportunities. So when you include the vacancy or availability there, I mean, it's more like 1.5 million feet that we need to lease up first, and that's our priority. But if our team continues to sign leases at these big development redevelopment projects, we could consider activating our land bank. We just need to -- to get comfortable with the return on cost relative our cost of capital. But we're certainly moving closer to making decisions like that, but I wouldn't say that we're there yet, Austin.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's really helpful. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kolakowski [ph] with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you. First, I'd just like to start with a conversation we had with our biotech team recently, where they said there's been a push to bring back some work from CDMOs that have been done internationally to return state side. Have you heard or seen any of that?
Scott Bohn: John, it's Scott Bohn. Yes, we've seen some of that come through. I mean we don't have a lot of kind of biomanufacturing bases in the portfolio. We've got some small-scale manufacturing within some of our facilities, but not a lot of true CDMOs. A handful throughout the portfolio, we actually have a deal that we're working on in Boston is one, but we are seeing some of that come back to the state. A lot of that, though, does end up in markets like RTP versus some of the core markets?
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. And then I don't know how much color you can give here. But just as far as your guidance is concerned, what does it imply for lab leasing for the rest of year or for lab handle and leasing for the rest of the year?
Peter Scott: Yeah. Hey, John, it's Pete here, and welcome to the earnings call. I think this is your first one. I think just big picture, as we think about all three of our segments, lab, we think lab should continue to improve through the second half of this year. Certainly, leasing helps. But one of the things I mentioned at the beginning of the year was we did have some free rent on a couple of large leases that impacted the first half of year. As that burns off, we expect to see acceleration in the second half of the year, and we continue to expect that. Obviously, with getting a lot of leasing done our confidence level improves as well. I think on outpatient medical, we did say that we expected the second, third and fourth quarters to accelerate relative to the first quarter. We got a lot of questions on that. And as you saw, we were above 3% this quarter, and we continue to believe we'll be above 3% for the second half of the year. And then I know, we don't spend a lot of time on CCRCs, but we've had a pretty good first half of the year. Our expectation is not to hit 20% growth. I mean, that's going to normalize everything eventually normalize, and it will normalize on the CCRC side. But we still feel pretty, pretty confident about our full year growth expectations for that segment. In fact, we're doing a lot better than what our original expectations were. So I know you just asked about lab, but I figured I'd give you a more fulsome update.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi good morning. Congratulations on all the lab leasing. Just curious if you could spend a little time talking about the cost to get that done, TIs associated with that seem go up. So, just curious -- or hoping you could give us some color around new and renewal PIs in today's market.
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean the renewal TIs were really low, especially given the length of term that we signed for those renewals. The new leasing, the TIs were up relative to last year, but I guess we have a different reference point. I would say they were exceptionally low last quarter, and this year, they were just a bit higher. I don't think they were outsized in any way. I mean, what, 20% to 25% of the rent is pretty modest. But each space is different. I mean that's the thing that's important to comment on. When you're looking quarter-to-quarter, it all comes down to what leases were signed, which buildings, how much work that space needed but we don't see the TIs being outsized in any way, especially considering the improvements that that were made to those buildings, should last for the next 10 to 20 years and the length of leases that we signed. So, yes, we would not characterize it as high TIs to generate the leasing volume, not at all.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks for that context. And then just maybe a more topical question in the news today. Alphabet was moving one of its life science companies from South San Fran to Dallas, where you have an Alphabet company in the lab space in your top tenants. So, just curious if there's any conversations going there? And maybe you could comment on how much term is left with your Calico exposure?
Scott Brinker: Well, we got 10 years left with Calico, but I didn't see that news, but that would be a first. I mean despite what's happening in other sectors and industries moving out of higher-cost areas to lower-cost, lower-tax states, it just doesn't happen in life science, it's just the reverse. In fact, a lot of times, if a company has some promise, they need to move to one of the three core markets to find the talent, to hook up with the right venture capital firms, to have the infrastructure. What you just described, that's one in a million. The vast majority of our tenants are coming into South San Francisco, not out of it.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks Scott.
Scott Brinker: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Yes thanks. I just wanted to touch on your life science leasing pipeline. I know in the past, you've kind of tagged that around 2 million square feet. And obviously, you got a lot of leasing done in 2Q and so far in July. I know on the call, you continue to highlight that the pipeline is strong. Can you kind of quantify where the pipeline is today? And have you backfilled some new tenant interest given the space that you signed?
Scott Brinker: Yes. We continue to cycle through the pipeline. So, obviously, you don't just do a tour and sign at least the next day. I mean there's a process involved in terms of inquiry and tours and sign an LOI and then signing a lease. So, you have pretty good leading indicators, which is why we've been more positive on our pipeline. And sure enough this quarter, it's turned into reality. And I think the third quarter will be equally strong. But we continue to see good traffic in our buildings, so including the 600-plus square feet we have under LOI, 200,000 square feet of leases signed in July alone. That's awfully strong.
Michael Carroll: Okay. But then the overall volume of the pipeline doesn't stand at about 2 million square feet anymore since you signed about roughly 1 million square feet? And then just real quick, too, on the 180,000 square feet that you signed in July, I mean that was -- can we assume that was in the in-place portfolio, not the development projects?
Scott Brinker: That's correct. Although last night, we did sign a lease at one of our development projects. So yeah, that's always good, I guess. We thought we had the most up-to-date information, but we did sign, convert one of those LOIs to a lease last night at one of our development projects. So it's great progress.
Michael Carroll: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So what do you think explains this behavioral switch on the life science space with tenants starting to think more constructively about doing deals? At NAREIT, you talked about some good signs from a capital raising standpoint in the biopharma sector, but then you have an Alumis IPO that was – looks like my own personal EKG right now? So, I'm just wondering where this positive mindset is coming from in your mind?
Peter Scott: Yeah. Hey, Rich, it's Pete. One of the things that we have been talking a lot about is just capital raising, generally speaking. If you look at the first half of this year, and we're talking not about R&D capital spend by large cap pharma M&A. I mean, that's a separate bucket. But the bucket we tend to focus on a lot is on -- you mentioned the IPO market, the secondary equity offerings, pipe deals, venture capital raising. And when you look at the first half of this year, it was the strongest year dating all the way back to 2021, where at that point, we were in that virtuous cycle within the lab space. So that's certainly helping with regards to tenants looking to lease space. We have some correlation between that and our leasing pipeline increasing. On the Alumis IPO, I mean, that a great company. They are in our portfolio. Martin Babler, the CEO, was previously at Principia. We've had a long-term relationship with them. They grew from 10,000 feet to 50,000 square feet with us. And I know you like to point to the EKG on the IPO, but they have raised $500 million year-to-date, which is pretty darn strong. So we feel great about having them in our portfolio. And that's an example of a company as they raise capital, the demand for space has increased.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Good. And then second follow-up on the asset sales out of the outpatient medical, and maybe I should know this, but where is that coming from? Is that legacy dock or legacy doc? Sorry, confusing. Where -- is it the acquired portfolio or the legacy portfolio, let's put it that way?
Scott Brinker: Yeah, Rich, we did that on purpose so that we don't have those types of conversations. But it was a mix of portfolio, I'd say it was weighted towards legacy physicians, probably obviously given a lot of CommonSpirit was in that portfolio. But it was a mix.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Thanks.
Scott Brinker: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. It's Mick Casper [ph] with Girffin. I just want to follow-up on the optionality with the cash and liquidity after the asset sales. You touched on the share buybacks earlier in development. But just from an acquisition standpoint, are you starting to see more interesting opportunities present themselves? And if so, kind of where are you seeing yields and IRRs today?
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean the market is opening up. I would still say it's pretty slow. I mean volumes are way off their historical norms, but starting to pick up. There's still a lot of volatility in interest rates, which is a key driver of transaction volume, certainly in the private market. We were happy with the pricing that we got, high six cap for the asset quality that we sold. And I think if we were to acquire anything, it would be higher quality assets in our current stock price. Although improved is not yet where we would be out acquiring stabilized product, but we're getting closer. And certainly, if our cost of capital supported it, there'd be a significant pipeline just given the depth of the relationships that the key people here have across the health system environment. So that's obviously something that we think will happen in time. It's just a matter of when. In terms of life science, very little stabilized product is available. But there's certainly signs of distress. It seems like it always takes longer to play out than you might think. The vast majority is probably not interesting to us for the reason I mentioned, that we purposely did not go outside of our core market or do a bunch of conversions. But there's a handful that we're keeping a close eye on that would be very interesting to us, but there has not been capitulation to date. But remember, as I said, it always takes longer to play out than you think. So we now have the flexibility to pursue things like that when and if they become available.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the asset sales with the seller financing. What was the rationale of doing seller financing? And what does the secured lending market look like today?
Scott Brinker: Yes, it's pretty simple, just certainty of execution. It's a transaction that the team has been working on for several months, if not a few quarters. And despite a lot of volatility, the buyer didn't retreat us on price and we can retreat them on the terms of the seller financing. We're comfortable with it. It's a very low LTV, relatively short-term. So there's clarity and certainty on getting the balance of the proceeds back over the next two to four years, if not sooner. But there really just isn't a financing market for something that large. So it was pretty simple. If we wanted to do a big execution on a sale, we really had no choice in a market like this, but to do the financing.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.
Scott Brinker: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you quantify how much you can grow the outpatient medical development pipeline over the next few years?
John Thomas: This is JT. There's a lot of development right now that we've disclosed in our pipeline under construction, and there's a lot of appetite by the health systems as they continue to transform more and more of their inpatient services to the outpatient setting, particularly in the stronger suburban demographics around those cities like Phoenix and Atlanta, two good examples. But it's – it could be substantial, $500 million to $1 billion over the next few years, is probably a pretty conservative guess.
Wes Golladay: All right. Thanks for that. And then you did call out the free rent to be aware of a potential move in earnings going forward. Is there any other moving parts to be aware of?
Peter Scott: No, I think, Wes, it's when the lease commences, right? Because when you sign a new lease, it doesn't typically commence next day, right? It commences once you finish completion of the work. So I think that's kind of hurdle number one, to getting FFO recognition. And then hurdle number two is the free rent burn off to getting to AFFO recognition or cash NOI recognized. And I'd say on average, it's probably -- for every year of lease term, it's probably around a month of free rent on a new lease deal to the extent that we're pushing pretty darn hard for 7- to 10-year terms on our new lease deals. And as you saw on the table we disclosed, we're having success achieving that. .
Wes Golladay: I got that. Just maybe a clarification on the question, like -- there's no move-outs that you know of or anything in the portfolio that would cause anything that we need to model as we look into next year?
Peter Scott: No. I think as Scott mentioned, on our operating portfolio, we're kind of in that mid-90s occupancy perspective and we tend to be able to feel like we can hold firm at that. Really the other one for us is leasing up the vacancy outside of the operating portfolio. And as we think about next year in lab, we have about 800,000 square feet of expirations. So a lot of that is back of the year weighted. And at this point, within our pipeline, I think we feel like close to half of that is under discussions at this point in time. So more to come. And we're just entering that 12-month period for exploration. So on the balance of it, we're starting to have conversations right now. But it's a pretty manageable number and within our pipeline, a lot of it is actually spoken for already.
Wes Golladay: Thanks for the time, everyone.
Peter Scott: Yep.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess, first on the life sciences side, could you just maybe help clarify on the LOIs, just so we know sort of for modeling, what percent roughly or what proportion is sort of existing tenants in your maybe core portfolio relocating just so we can -- we know sort of what's move in, move out and then versus new? And if you can maybe just expand upon your comments and talk about reaching that $60 million NOI. Like is that sort of -- should we expect that sort of a second half 2024? Or could some of this spill over into 2025?
Scott Brinker: Yeah. On the first question, I mean, more than half of the LOI pipeline is new, new leasing on currently vacant space. So there's a lot of upside in that pipeline. But just to clarify and reemphasize Pete's point, I mean, there's still a time lag between signing the lease and when the rent gets paid. But obviously, great progress on that. And Pete, do you want to take the second one?
Peter Scott: Yeah. I think you said, second half 2024 and into 2025, maybe you meant second half 2025 and into 2026 -- excuse me, -- Vikram. Our thought on the phasing in of the full $60 million is that, it would take a couple of years to get to that stabilized $60 million of cash NOI. We still feel good about that. But that phasing in would start next year and would be spread out probably over a couple of years. Hard to get into more specifics, as we said, as these LOIs convert leases, we will provide certainly more information on it for modeling purposes. But I'd say, it's best guess today, spread out over a couple of years, starting kind of middle of next year.
Vikram Malhotra: No, that's great. A lot of good progress on the Life Science side. So maybe just to clarify, you mentioned accelerating growth on -- in MOBs, I think on the same-store portfolio in life science as well in the second half. And I just want to tie that back to sort of the guide on same-store, you moved it up by 25 bps. But just wondering if you can tie it to, if you're having accelerating growth, it would seem like there's perhaps more upside. So I'm wondering if there's something -- maybe the CCRCs or something else is pulling that back?
Scott Brinker : Yes. We do see deceleration of CCRCs in the second half of the year just because you're not going to continue at a 20%-plus clip. So if there's any deceleration, it's just within CCRCs. And we're seeing acceleration in the other two segments. I would say that year-to-date, we're right around 4.5%. The upside of our guidance is 4.25% from a same-store perspective. And if I were just to focus on FFO, I think year-to-date, we're right around $0.90. That annualizes to $1.80, right? So you're sort of trending towards the higher end of our guidance ranges. We still have two more quarters to go. So we're not going to take it all the way to max to the middle of the year. There is maybe a little bit of conservatism in that. But again, we feel great about what we've done year-to-date. Remember, we did raise our guidance $0.02 each in the first quarter, FFO and AFFO, and $0.01 each again this quarter and the second quarter. So we're off to a great start. We had a great quarter. And for trending to the high end, that's great.
Vikram Malhotra: Great. Congrats on the strong quarter. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jim Kammert : Good morning. Thank you. Obviously, you've done a lot of portfolio curation to-date. But theoretically, how much more of the lab or OM portfolio would you sell if the price was right? To understand what's really sort of non-core remaining, if you will.
Scott Brinker : Yes. I mean, even the $850 million that we just did, I would characterize as mostly just opportunistic. They're perfectly fine assets. They were performing. We're matching them well. But they were, by our standards, relatively low quality. And to my point earlier, usually when you fine-tune the portfolio, it's dilutive. This environment just gave us a unique opportunity to fine-tune the portfolio in an accretive way and increase the growth profile of what's remaining. So how much of that is left side's pretty modest, but a lot of it depends on where we're trading. So I mean we could sell -- there's a lot of interest in our remaining assets, but hopefully, that's not the environment that we're in. I think we have a very high-quality portfolio across the three segments that should produce stable, strong growth at the high end of the peer group for years to come.
Jim Kammert : That's great. And then just a quick housekeeping. In an earlier question in response, you noted that you thought it's pretty likely that the buyer of the OM portfolio here in July, would -- you're assuming they have other existing proceeds? Or you just expect them to refinance kind of the next two years or so, and that's going to be your source of repayment?
Scott Brinker : Yes, refinance. I mean there's a maturity date on these loans that they will have to repay, refinance the loans by that date, if not sooner.
Jim Kammert : Got it. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. I know you quote renewal spreads for lab and outpatient leasing. But how similar or different would the lab spreads be if you included comparable new leasing spreads as well?
Scott Brinker : It just would be misleading. I mean, we could give you that information, but sometimes you're doing pretty significant TIs or changing the use of the buildings that I think it would be misleading. I don't think there'll be a material difference, but you have even more volatility quarter-to-quarter depending upon which space. Meaning somebody could be paying $5 in a 25-year-old space, and you put a bunch of money into it and it's almost brand new, and now they're paying $7. Well, is that really a 30% mark-to-market whatever the number is? It's kind of misleading. So, we choose to just go with re-leasing spread on renewals.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And then does it feel like the mid-single-digit renewal spread should be sticky in the back half of the year based on what you're seeing for expirations?
Scott Brinker: For the lab business. Yes, if anything -- yes, it should be. I mean our mark-to-market across the portfolio is in the high single-digits. That's not hard to do that number with precision. But that's where we're at, best estimate across the entire portfolio, just acknowledging that it bounces around quarter-to-quarter. But the 6% is good, but it's below the average throughout the portfolio.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Scott Brinker: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Michael Stroyeck: Thanks. Good morning. I know you already touched on the rationale behind the seller financing. Were there any bids that didn't require seller financing? And if so, are you able to share where those cap rates were shaking out? I'm just trying to understand if seller financing may have ultimately impacted pricing on the deal? Or if it is a fairly clean comp, and it was just needed to get the deal done?
Scott Brinker: Yes, I mean we didn't shop the deal. This was a direct negotiations. So, there really isn't even an answer to that question. These are just the terms that were discussed from day one. There's not exactly a deep market of loans of this size in the outpatient medical business in recent years. So, yes, not a great comp.
Peter Scott: Yes. The other thing just to add to that, not all the sales had seller financing. Obviously, smaller portfolios or smaller asset deals, you don't necessarily need financing to get those done. And I'd say the cap rates ranged pretty much on average in the high 6s on those as well relative to the high 6s we got on the portfolio we provided seller financing on. So, just to go back to what Scott said earlier, it was really more just about certainty of close on a portfolio that large. And we've had success providing seller financing on asset sales in the past. We did pretty large amount on our senior housing sales years ago, and we have very little left within that seller financing bucket. In fact, the vast, vast majority has been paid off and we feel confident the same thing will happen here.
Michael Stroyeck: Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe one just on the mark-to-market on renewals. I saw a nice step-up in the MOB portfolio. Are there any common themes across the type of tenants or assets where you are seeing stronger pricing power?
Scott Brinker: I think if you look at our tenancy, about 69% is the hospital. So, we don't see a lot of difference there. I mean it's basically where are we at in the market, how much demand is. A lot of times, what's interesting is if we've got a new MOB on a campus that helps drive rents a little higher. Most of the mark-to-market increases we saw this quarter were in Nashville. We do have a couple of new buildings in Nashville, so that's been driving things. But we had 13 leases that had anywhere from 11% to 32% mark-to-markets this quarter, and that drove the overall average up. Absent that, we'd probably be still at the upper range of about 3% to 4% number, but in the upper 3s.
Michael Stroyeck: Great. Thanks for the time.
Scott Brinker: You’re welcome
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn conference back over to Scott Brinker for any closing remarks. .
Scott Brinker: Yes. Thank you for joining today, everyone, and thanks again to our team for an incredible quarter. So enjoy the weekend. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Healthpeak Properties to Report First Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Host Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Johns, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Johns: Welcome to Healthpeak's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference call contains certain forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.
 A discussion of risks and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. In an exhibit to the 8-K we furnished to the SEC yesterday, we have reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements. The exhibit is also available on our website at healthpeak.com.
 I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Brinker. 
Scott Brinker: Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to Healthpeak's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today for prepared remarks is Pete Scott, our CFO; and the senior team is available for Q&A.
 We are extremely pleased with our first quarter results, and our momentum is positive on every key metric. We increased our 2024 earnings guidance by $0.02 at the midpoint, driven by same-store results, outperformance on merger synergies and accretive stock buybacks. The merger has proven to be a meaningful positive catalyst for the company, and the integration is exceeding our expectations.
 Many public company mergers are done through auctions, which delays the ability to integrate the 2 companies. Our transaction is completely different. Neither company would have proceeded with the merger without high confidence in our ability to put the teams and platforms together in a way that 1 plus 1 could equal 3. That meant having extensive conversations on people, process, systems and capabilities before we agreed to proceed.
 Our integration planning was underway before we even announced the transaction. In the 6 months since that announcement, our combined team has done an exceptional job integrating every aspect of our business. The continuity and buy-in from JT and the senior team who joined Healthpeak has been critical to the integration, including key health system relationships.
 Property management internalization has been a huge success to date and is a good example of the merger augmenting our platform. Strategically, it was important to me that our own employees are interacting with our tenants every day. And financially, we're now capturing additional profit that flows through property level NOI.
 To date, we've internalized 10 markets, covering 17 million square feet. We chose to accelerate the rollout given our success to date, and we expect to internalize an additional 4 million square feet by year-end. Significant upside remains to be captured. We're evaluating 10-plus million square feet for internalization in 2025 and '26, which in aggregate, would allow us to internalize more than 70% of our total footprint. The positive feedback from the property managers on the ground and our tenants further validates the strategic decision to internalize.
 Let me take a minute on the value proposition in our stock today, which we think is compelling. The baseline is a strong balance sheet with a high-quality portfolio with 3% to 5% same-store growth and a mid-6% with dividend yield with a conservative payout ratio. Beyond that baseline, we've identified $80 million of NOI upside potential, none of which is included in our 2024 guidance from additional merger synergies and leasing up our active life science dev -- redev pipeline.
 We also see 30% upside by recapturing our discount to consensus NAV, which we expect to do through consistent earnings growth and smart capital allocation. Industry headlines notwithstanding, over the past 2 years, we grew AFFO per share by 13%, and we expect to continue growing earnings moving forward. 
 Moving to our Outpatient business. The fundamentals have never been stronger. Patient volumes are increasing, absorption is accelerating and new development remains low. That's driving strong re-leasing spreads, retention and NOI growth. In addition, progressive health systems have a strategic focus to grow their outpatient revenue. It's less expensive for payers, more convenient for consumers and more profitable for the providers. We have the premier platform and relationships to capture this outpatient growth, whether on-campus or off-campus at both locations are necessary to capture demand. We expect new supply to remain low given the cost of construction. Today, our triple-net equivalent rents are in the low 20s while most new developments are $35 to $40 per foot. 
 Turning to our Life Science business. IPO and venture capital funding have improved recently, which is driving demand for space. Our leasing pipeline today is up 80% from last quarter. We're increasingly optimistic that pipeline will generate lease executions for the balance of 2024 and into 2025. Roughly 70% of our pipeline is existing tenants, many of which are deals that don't come to the broader market, again, providing us a big advantage versus the new entrants who can't tap into an existing portfolio of recurring tenants. We're also seeing a massive reduction in new construction starts that should extend for multiple years, creating a far more favorable leasing environment for landlords. 
 Let me close with capital allocation. The strategic merger with Physicians Realty closed on March 1 and is accretive to our earnings, balance sheet and platform. Year-to-date, we sold $363 million of fully stabilized assets at a 5.8% cap rate, plus $69 million of loan repayments. The most recent sale was an R&D flex office portfolio in Poway, East of San Diego that we sold to an affiliate of the tenant in an all-cash deal for $180 million, which was a 6% cap rate. 
 We have additional asset sales in various stages of negotiation and execution, but given the environment, we'll provide details if and when they close. We took advantage of the disconnect in our stock price and repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price just above $17 per share, which represents an implied cap rate of 8%. The year-to-date asset sales are more than 200 basis points inside that level, delivering immediate value to shareholders. 
 Our remaining authorization today is roughly $350 million, and we'll continue to pursue buybacks as priority #1 on capital allocation, obviously, depending on our stock price and the arbitrage opportunity from asset sales. Priority #2 for capital is new outpatient medical development with key health system partners, provided their strong pre-leasing and a positive spread to our asset sales. This capital recycling would be accretive to asset quality and stabilized earnings. We do have an attractive pipeline of such projects today in the $200-plus million range. 
 Priority #3 is distressed opportunities in life science, which we are starting to see, especially development projects lacking capital and/or leasing traction. These would be purely opportunistic and could be done on balance sheet or via joint ventures. Most of the distress won't be interesting to us, as we'll focus on our own core submarkets where we can use our scale and relationships to drive outperformance.
 I'll turn it to Pete for financial results and guidance. 
Peter Scott: Thanks, Scott. 2024 is off to a great start. For the first quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.45 per share, AFFO of $0.41 per share and total portfolio same-store growth of 4.5%. Let me briefly touch on segment performance. Starting with outpatient medical, we reported same-store growth of 2.6%, driven by a positive 3.4% rent mark-to-market and an 84% retention rate.
 Our strong leasing activity continues. During the quarter, we signed nearly 1.5 million square feet of leases, and we have a backlog of 2.5 million square feet in active discussion, including 700,000 square feet under LOI. Importantly, we expect outpatient medical same-store growth to increase as the year progresses due to accelerating internalization and an increase in occupancy from continued leasing. 
 Turning to Lab. We reported same-store growth of 2.7%, driven by 3% plus contractual rent escalators and a 2.6% positive rent mark-to-market, partially offset by an anticipated tickdown in occupancy. During the quarter, we signed approximately 150,000 square feet of leases, and we have a robust leasing pipeline of nearly 2 million square feet. We have 455,000 square feet under LOI, positioning the second quarter to be one of our best lab leasing quarters in recent years. In addition, we also expect lab same-store growth to accelerate for the balance of the year as free rent from some large lease commencements burns off.
 Finishing with CCRCs, we reported same-store growth of positive 27%, driven by increased occupancy and rate growth. Occupancy in our CCRC portfolio ended the quarter at 85.2%, and we expect continued positive performance.
 Shifting to the balance sheet. We had a very active quarter. We successfully completed the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4%. We closed on our newly originated 5-year $750 million term loan, which we swapped to a fixed rate of 4.5% prior to the recent spike in interest rates.
 And as Scott mentioned, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of stock. Subsequent to quarter end, we fully repaid our commercial paper with proceeds from the Poway sale. Pro forma this transaction, our net debt to EBITDA is 5.2x. We have $3.1 billion of liquidity, no floating rate debt and AFFO payout ratio of approximately 75% and nearly $350 million of authorization left on our stock buyback program. 
 Finishing now with guidance. We are increasing our FFO as adjusted guidance range by $0.02 and tightening the range to $1.76 to $1.80. We are increasing our AFFO guidance range by $0.02 and tightening the range to $1.53 to $1.57. Our increase in earnings guidance is driven by 3 items: First, we increased same-store guidance by 25 basis points to 2.5% to 4%. Second, merger synergies continue to exceed expectations and are now forecast to be $45 million in 2024. Third, we have bought back $100 million worth of stock at an FFO yield in excess of 10%.
 One last note before Q&A, we published a revamped supplemental alongside our earnings release. You may have noticed that we streamlined the document and modified it to more closely align with how we view the business. We also added an NAV input page to assist with modeling, which we felt was important for our stakeholders.
 With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. 
Joshua Dennerlein: I just wanted to follow up on your comment that 2Q should be one of the best quarters for lab leasing. Just -- I guess my first question on that is just how are rents trending on what you're signing versus maybe a few quarters ago? And then just what about TIs and concessions? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Josh, I can start with that. I think rent and TIs, as we look across our portfolio, it's been pretty steady for the last 6 months or so. As we look at market rents today, it's probably in that 5% to 10% premium when you compare it to our in-place rents across the portfolio, which is around $60 per square foot.
 On new lease deals, tenants are certainly seeking more turnkey space, which has increased the overall TI packages. But as I said, that's been much more steady the last 6 months or so. And I think from a lease term perspective, on renewal deals, we're probably seeing more 3- to 5-year in term. And then on new leasing deals, we're seeing more 7 to 10 years there. 
 And then obviously, the last piece I'll just say fundamentally is lease deals just take a little bit longer, especially as you price out the TI packages. So if a lease deal took 2 to 3 months to get done couple of years ago, it's probably closer to 6 months today, but we're certainly highly motivated to get our lab leasing pipeline, which has increased a lot over the last year or so converted from a pipeline into a lease transaction. 
Scott Brinker: Yes, Josh, I'd just add, our leasing costs have been really pretty modest. If you just look in the supplemental for renewal leases, our TI and LC has been 5% or less of the rental rate, and even for new leases, it's in the 10% range. I mean, it's really pretty modest and very low free rent as well. So I think we held in exceptionally well, just given the quality of the portfolio and the submarkets and the relationships. 
Joshua Dennerlein: I appreciate that color. And Scott, one follow-up for you. You mentioned you expect about 70% of the MOBs will eventually be internalized. How do you think about that 30% that you won't be able to internalize? Is that stuff you would eventually want to sell or maybe add scale in the market to get to a point where internalization makes sense? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. I wouldn't say it's assets we want to sell. It's more markets where we don't have significant scale. And then there are some markets where we have a big health system relationship where they prefer to use their own in-house property management firm, and Atlanta is a good example of that, that we still had market. The fact that health system wants to use their own people, we can live with that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Can you guys provide a breakdown of what's driving the increase to same-store cash NOI growth by segment? 
Scott Brinker: We didn't provide a breakdown, but I can tell you that all 3 segments are trending at or above the midpoint of the initial guidance. So we've got good traction across the board. Obviously, this particular quarter, CCRC was above. I expect that growth rate to normalize for the balance of the year. And then in lab and outpatient medical, I think all 3 quarters from here should be above what we reported in 1Q, but there's volatility quarter-to-quarter. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. I mean, I guess, just specific to the cash same-store NOI lab guidance, I think it was 1.5% to 3%. Pete, you referenced there's acceleration through the balance of the year is through rent burns off, I think, related to the RevMed and Voyager deals you've highlighted. So I guess, can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of upside is there? And then also just maybe what the risks are that's holding you back from going ahead and raising that at this point in the year? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Well, I would say that the 25 basis point raise that we did this quarter on the aggregate same-store guidance certainly reflects the improved performance in lab. On the lab side, in particular, we've been pretty consistent in saying this, that at the beginning of the year, we will have a little bit of bad debt cushion incorporated into the guide that we put out.
 And as we look at where we are today and look at all the capital raising that's gotten done, we feel like we probably had too much of a cushion at the beginning of the year. So we've released a little bit of that. And then we are getting internalization benefit as well. So we're probably trending towards the higher end of that initial 1.5% to 3% guide number. The biggest headwind, and this is something that we've talked about, is just the fact that we did have an occupancy decline as we look towards full year 2023 compared to where we expect that to be in full year 2024. We do think we'll see an occupancy increase as the year progresses in our operating portfolio, but we're comparing that to the full year number last year. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then I'm just curious, certainly, some of the VC funding and capital raising, you highlighted, have been positive, presumably for some of the leasing discussions in pipeline. I'm just wondering if there's been any change in those discussions or the pace with which things are moving forward on the leasing front and lab just given some of the added economic uncertainty and volatility we've seen in the capital markets. And then just maybe even as you think forward from here, I know it's been sort of the last 30 days or so, but any impact you see that having on sort of the future pipeline and decision-making. 
Peter Scott: I mean if you look, Austin, the capital raising has been at least year-to-date in '24 relative to year-to-date 2023, I mean, it's been up across every single category, especially on follow-on equity offerings as well as private placements that we fit into that bucket well. Certainly, there could be some risk going forward with interest rates going up. I think it's a little less rate-sensitive in the lab side of it and maybe cap rates in the world of real estate, and those private placements and follow-ons do take some time to come together.
 They're still happening. If you look across the last 30 days, the data will show you that even with the increase in rates, you're seeing capital flowing into biotech, the XBI is still holding up pretty well. Last night, there were some pretty good tech earnings as well despite the interest rate environment, so we still remain optimistic that, that capital raising environment has a pretty decent runway in front of it. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. 
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the disposition pipeline, how much is potentially for sale and what you could expect to transact on and how those proceeds would be split between debt reductions to be staying leverage neutral versus buybacks from here. 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Juan, it's Scott here. We've done $350 million plus of pure asset sales year-to-date. The pipeline is at least that large, but it's a volatile environment as Austin just pointed out. So when we have clarity on transactions, we'll announce the details at that time, but it's certainly a big pipeline, more focused on outpatient medical, whereas the sales to date have been more life science or this R&D portfolio that we had in Poway. So yes, it's an active pipeline in terms of how the proceeds would be used. In large part, it depends on the environment in the stock price, in particular. That's been the highest and best use of capital in recent months just given where the stock was trading.
 If that continues to be the case, then that would be priority #1. If interest rates stay high or move higher, obviously, we could always delever even beyond staying leverage-neutral, which is just we, for sure, will do that. We won't lever up the balance sheet to buy back stock. So those are kind of priority numbers 1 and 1A. 
 And then in terms of playing offense, it would be primarily focused on outpatient medical development, where we are seeing some highly pre-leased core markets, core health systems, strong yields. And we feel like we should be recycling out some older assets with a little bit more CapEx and risk in exchange for those brand-new assets in the right markets, right systems. 
Juan Sanabria: And just as a quick follow-up on that question. You previously talked about $500 million to $1 billion of potential dispose. Is that still kind of a big placeholder in people's minds just to think about that going forward for the balance of the year? 
Scott Brinker: It's probably the right range. Yes. 
Juan Sanabria: And then just curious as a second question, just on AI, lots of discussions, not just in real estate on what the transition is going to mean for everybody. But just curious, when we think about the physical infrastructure plant in lab, what the incremental use of power may mean for CapEx or just the buildings being able to handle it? Just curious on your early thoughts as this kind of progresses and evolves. 
Scott Bohn: Juan, it's Scott Bohn. I think with AI, you are seeing some -- maybe some automation labs within the labs, but you still have -- the bulk of those facilities will have chemistry and biology in your atypical lab build-outs. So we aren't seeing a dramatic shift in any -- by any means in the build-outs for some of our tenants who are more AI-focused. Our buildings have a ton of power to them, have the infrastructure, they have the capabilities to handle any of those needs. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. 
Richard Anderson: So nice beat on the synergies, typical, I guess, most REITs that's the low-hanging fruit of the story. But going forward is perhaps a little bit more difficult, which is the life science leasing that you've been talking about. I think $60 million of upside. Can you take a shot about what the timing of that is? It's not all next year. Could it be as far out into 2027? Or how long of a tail to the life science leasing do you think is possible here going forward? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Rich, well, as you mentioned on the synergies, I'll just start there, we do feel quite good about the trajectory that we're on, $45 million that we've been able to articulate we think we can hit this year. And we feel very confident in our ability to hit the $60 million run rate as we head into the next year. Obviously, the trickier part that you mentioned is on the leasing pipeline and especially those 3 marquee campuses. What I can say is that within our pipeline, we are having discussions on all of those campuses. I'd say some of those discussions are much further along than others.
 Realistically, if we signed a lease today or in the second quarter, it really wouldn't commence given some of the work we have to do until the earliest the beginning of 2025. So what I would say probably is it's high level, it's probably a 1- to 2-year period where we phase in and get to the full run rate there on the NOI. And it's probably the best guidance I can give you as we sign leases, and we're pretty good at disclosing those. We can try and get a little bit more specific on that number, but it's probably a bit in '25, a bit more in '26 and hitting that full run rate number probably towards the end of 2026. 
Scott Brinker: Rich, one of the things, I wouldn't characterize the synergies as low-hanging fruit. Most mergers actually don't achieve their projections. We've got a team of 300-plus people here that have been working on the clock to achieve those synergies. So hats off to them for making it happen. It was anything but low hanging fruit. 
Richard Anderson: I don't mean to trivialize it. Let's call it, middle-hanging fruit, right? So second question might be a tough one to answer, but I'm going to ask it anyway. When you think about the entirety of the transaction, including everything, including whatever the transaction fees were, if that's 3% of $5 billion, that's $150 million. When do you think the merger, the combination is truly kind of breakeven for the company when you take everything into consideration? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean if you're just referring to like a payback period, I mean it's less than 3 years. If you just take the synergies in comparison to the upfront cost, but obviously, company valuation is based on future cash flows, not just 1 year. And we feel with high confidence we're going to achieve those synergies, and it is permanent. And if -- the discounted value of those future cash flows is many multiples of the upfront transaction costs, so it's certainly value-creating transaction from that standpoint.
 And then most important for me, for our Board, and the same for the Physicians Realty Board, is we created the best platform in the sector, and that has intangible benefits that will last forever. So hard to put a number on that, but we have that now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. 
Michael Griffin: I was wondering if you could give some more color on the Poway disposition. You mentioned it's a mix of industrial lab and office space. Is the cap rate indicative of where lab might be trading today? Or were there some specificities given the asset mix that might warrant a higher cap rate? 
Scott Brinker: Yes, it wasn't really a life science property in any event. It's kind of a mix of uses, R&D, there's some manufacturing, some office, kind of an industrial footprint and build-out. In parts of it, it certainly wasn't traditional life science nor was it in the traditional life science market, so I wouldn't view that as a read through. I think it was a great price. That's why we sold it. So we were happy to recycle those proceeds into the balance of our portfolio. But yes, I don't think that's indicative of life science cap rates. 
Michael Griffin: And Brinker, where would you say kind of Class A lab space is trading these days on a cap rate basis? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Hard to say. Cap rates are always tough in life science just given market rents versus in-place rents. What we did in San Diego, Torrey Pines, a couple of months ago, rents were pretty close to market. So that -- in that case, cap rate is more indicative of valuation. And that was in the low 5s, but it was also a premier submarket, brand-new building credit tenant. I mean, so if you're trying to make your list of A+, it was pretty much A+ across the board. So I'd say that's the low end of the continuum for life science. 
Michael Griffin: Got you. That's helpful. And then maybe could you add some commentary around supply, particularly in South San Fran, where I think we've seen kind of elevated relative to the other core markets. And how might your competitive set compare to market supply overall? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Maybe I'll just touch on supply for a second, Griff, because it is a good question, and I'm going to repeat a statement that we've been saying for a while and others have been saying as well, but not all new supply is built equally. And we do fully expect the incumbent landlords, which there's not a lot of that out there in the core submarkets to outperform. As we think just big picture, there are a lot of new entrants into the space over the last couple of years, not surprising because it was such an incredible moneymaking subsector in real estate for such a long period of time.
 But I think a lot of these new entrants, and I think a lot of the very poorly capitalized landlords that we see now, they just fail to underwrite this incumbent risk, and we think a lot of them will struggle. But as we look at each one of our core submarkets, when you look at the headline number that gets quoted by brokers, when we parse through the data, and we have included this in our investor presentation, the competitive supply going back to the fact that I said not all supply is created equal. What we view as competitive, and I think we're probably still conservative in what we include in that bucket as well, it's a very manageable number. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Carroll: I wanted to touch on the life science LOIs that you kind of highlighted in the press release. I mean how many of those are true expansionary spaces that could be earmarked to push up overall occupancy levels within the space? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Well, maybe I'll just talk quickly about the overall leasing pipeline, Mike. I think that may be an easier way to answer your question, but our lab leasing pipeline today sits at around 2 million square feet, and all of those LOIs are included within that pipeline. Obviously, we have a pretty high degree of confidence those LOIs are going to turn into leases. But as we look at some of the parsing of that 2 million square feet, I'd say about 70% of that is with existing tenants within the portfolio. And then taking it even a step further, I'd say that probably 50% new lease deals, about 1 million square feet, would be new lease deals within the portfolio. And then the rest would be renewals. So a nice 50-50 split.
 And if you think about the amount of vacancy that we have within the portfolio across the marquee project, whether it be Vantage or Gateway as well as portside in South San Francisco, 1 million square feet within our pipeline of new lease deals actually matches up quite well with what we have as vacancy for new lease deals. 
Michael Carroll: And I guess related to that pipeline, how many tenants need to raise funds to kind of takedown that space? Or will any of those tenants decide to delay making decisions just given the increased volatility that we see in the capital markets over the past handful of weeks? 
Peter Scott: Yes. I'd say very few need to raise capital, if any. We wouldn't be having active discussions. In fact, you don't really have a lot of active discussions for deals that are contingent upon capital raising, those discussions tend to happen, at least today, after the capital has been raised. So I'd say that there's really no risk to that within the pipeline. 
Michael Carroll: And will those tenants delay making decisions? Or are they -- do you think that they could wait longer just given what's happened in the capital markets and the geopolitical landscape over the past few weeks? 
Peter Scott: No. Because, as I said, I think all those tenants have effectively raised capital if they needed to raise capital. Not all of them need to raise capital. There's some mid-cap and large-cap names in there as well. So I think the answer to that is no, they're not delaying decisions. It does take a little bit longer to get lease deals done today though, specifically as you price out the various TI packages and build-outs. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then just last one for me. I know there have been issues over the past year where the companies want to take down space, but the Boards of those companies have kind of vetoed it. I mean have the -- I don't know, do you know if the Boards have approved just the leasing that's currently in the pipeline? And do you think that they could potentially veto some of those transactions or at least push them out? 
Scott Brinker: I mean the pipeline is 30-plus tenants, so we'll refrain from going down the list, but the quality of the discussions today is much higher than it has been in the last 2 years. So we can't give you certainty on any of the stuff. And certainly, the geopolitical environment doesn't help at the margin, but I don't think it's a driving factor. The bottom line is the pipeline is massively bigger than it ever has been in the last 2 years, continues to grow, and the quality of the conversations is higher. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. 
Wesley Golladay: Just want to follow up on the new lease conversation. Looking at the 1 million square feet, are you seeing any change in demand for first-generation space, any submarket standing out and any kind of categories picking up activity? 
Peter Scott: Yes. I mean I think the part of that I'd like to focus on is the submarkets. We never really exited or I should say weired outside of the core submarkets that we wanted to focus on. So in San Diego, it's Torrey Pines and Sorrento Mesa. In Boston, it's the Lexington 128 market in West Cambridge and it's really South San Francisco. And what we're actually seeing is a gravitation towards tenants wanting to be in those core submarkets. And I think some of those other submarkets that were not fully proven that irrespective of development done in those they're going to take a lot longer to lease up if they ever do lease up. 
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then when you look at potential distressed opportunities, do you think you'll get any distressed pricing for those? Or is there still a lot of capital allocation in those great submarkets? And how would you look to potentially get involved? Would it be a JV, mezz-lending? Can you elaborate on that? 
Scott Brinker: It could be any of the above. It would be very opportunistic, but it would have to be in core submarkets. We really bring something unique to the table, which is our existing footprint, tenant relationships, broker relationships, et cetera. So we'll be very focused on particular submarkets, but we could be more open-minded on deal structure, but it would have to be opportunistic-type pricing. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. 
James Kammert: Just building a little further, if possible, on the lab leasing demand, it sounds like your pipeline is larger, these tenants have funding. Is that translating into any ability for landlords like yourself to kind of hold the economics in terms of TI packages and whatnot? Because if I recall, that was kind of being pushed more and more towards landlords in terms of $150, maybe to $250 and plus. Any comments there? And if you are still being required to pay those, are you able to get an economic return on that and effectively bake it into the rent? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Our re-leasing spread in the first quarter was around 3%. It could vary quarter to quarter. But as we look at our current pipeline, the renewal spreads will be above that level in the aggregate, some higher, some lower, but on average, certainly above the 3% across the portfolio. We still feel like it's in the 5% to 10% range. And at least in recent quarters, the leasing and TI that we're putting into the buildings to drive those rents is very modest, around 5% of rent on renewal leasing and around 10% on new leasing. So those are pretty modest leasing costs across commercial real estate. 
James Kammert: Right. I'm sorry, I wasn't clear, but I meant like on asset brand new space, weren't landlords being required to put in $250 type of allowance and stuff to make the deal happen? Or am I mistaken? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. So for new development, that's true. I was speaking more to renewal and re-leasing spreads. But for new development, certainly, there's an expectation of turnkey or closer to it, which we've been talking about for the last year or so that we're actually having more success in the current environment on our second-generation space. It's turnkey in nature, but at a much more modest investment, but lower rent, lower OpEx, and no TI from the tenants. So that's certainly a big part of our leasing pipeline. But we are getting some interest in our development projects as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: Just curious, how do you see tenant retention shaping up for the balance of the year? And where do you think the 96% operating portfolio occupancy could end the year? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Mike, it's Pete. Tenant retention, the headline number was a little bit lower, assuming you're talking just about labs, just because we actually had a subtenant that went direct, and we don't include that in the retention statistics. It was NGM that went direct on one of the Amgen buildings, and they have been a subtenant in that building for years. But the way we report it, we don't include that as the tenant was retained within the building. We report that as a new lease.
 Therefore, if you did include it as tenant retention, you'd be right around 60%. And I would say that that's probably a pretty good number, lab is always going to be a little bit below what we achieve in outpatient medical, which I think this quarter we put a number out there, we were 84%, which was pretty darn high. So I think the tenant retention number is a little bit misleading and you got to dig into it. And then occupancy... 
Scott Brinker: Yes. And then on occupancy, on the 96%, our view is that, that should pick up a little bit. In fact, I know there was a sequential decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. That was actually proactive termination we did at the towers building in South San Francisco, and we've actually already re-leased that space, it just hasn't commenced yet, so we don't include that in the occupancy number until the lease commences. So just if you factor that in alone, we'd expect the occupancy to tick up a little bit as the year progresses. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street. 
Michael Stroyeck: Could you just provide some color on the outpatient medical sequential occupancy decline during the quarter and just whether that largely came from legacy DOC or legacy peak portfolios? 
Thomas Klaritch: Yes. Really, you typically see -- this is Tom Klarich, but you see a decline from Q4 to Q1 pretty regularly because a lot of doctors hold over the holiday period and then when things settle down after the first of the year, they move out. So that's pretty typical. I wouldn't point to legacy peak or legacy dock as a cause for that. 
Michael Stroyeck: Got it. So I guess nothing really stands out in terms of like tenant credit, asset quality or anything else, just normal seasonality? 
Thomas Klaritch: Just normal rhythm during the year. 
Michael Stroyeck: Got it. Okay. And then maybe following up on the Poway disposition discussion, can you just help us understand how much of your portfolio is similar to these assets in terms of it not necessarily being traditional life science properties? 
Scott Brinker: That was really it. I mean we have like the land bank and conversions in West Cambridge, where we'll eventually tear buildings down and build by science. But in terms of the stabilized assets, that's it. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. 
Vikram Malhotra: Maybe just first one, the -- you've talked a lot about the life sciences leasing pipeline, but I'm wondering if you can update us or just provide color on the watch list? Given the capital raising amount, I'm assuming it's lower, but any numbers, any magnitude or perhaps in other ways, like what's baked into the guide for the watch list? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Vik, it's Pete here. I think you've done a very nice job actually in your research talking about this. And what's happening is actually following suit with what's staying. The strong capital raising is certainly causing us to have a much lower tenant monitoring list. No, our monitoring list would be a tenant that's got less than 12 months of cash runway. And if you just want to put percentages on that, I'd say that list today is 50% of the size of what it was a year ago, continues to trend in the right direction. So it's down considerably.
 And the other thing I would just mention, we said this before, even in the best of lab markets, you're always going to have a couple of tenants. We've got 200 tenants. You're always going to have a couple of tenants that you're paying close attention to because it really comes down to the science and the success of the science and not necessarily always about the capital markets and ability to raise capital. 
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. That's helpful. Just second, I'm wondering, the HCA sort of programmatic deal you had in terms of MOBs was -- has been pretty fruitful. I'm wondering with the combined company now with physicians, is there a likelihood of a similar deal with another system? Or is that -- is it just given the capital environment, even hospital systems are just waiting on development? 
John Thomas: Vikram, it's JT. We have a lot of historical relationships across the portfolio. So we start -- we have kind of -- I hate to call it systematic, but routine kind of steady pipeline with a number of health systems in multiple states. So all highly pre-leased, all kind of outpatient services that are higher margin and that they need to kind of expand into kind of new markets for providing access to care in those markets. So it's pretty systematic across the board and just has to be at the right price and kind of the right markets for us to proceed, but pretty steady flow of kind of off-market relationship business. 
Vikram Malhotra: And then just one more, if I may. Just a clarification. I think on the medical office rent spreads, there was a 500,000-plus-square-foot deal that I think you noted was not in there or it would impact rents later on. Can you just elaborate upon that? Like when will that hit the rent spread metrics? And what was that? 
Thomas Klaritch: Yes. The -- that lease was a master lease with a system in Houston, and it covers basically 3 campuses. I do want to point out that we did do that lease internally, so we saved about $3.5 million of lease commissions on that deal. And we also had no TI contribution, and we eliminated our capital liability for 10 years. So it was a great deal. 
 Two of the campuses did have an increase. There's -- one of the campuses had a decrease. So we'll have an impact on mark-to-market in July of '25. I think it was 6% to 8% decline. But to me, that's a great deal if you get absolutely no capital for 10 years on 600,000 square feet. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Congrats on a solid quarter and solid improvement in outlook. I wanted to get some clarification on the MOBs and the synergies. When you do, do the next round of internalization -- the targeted internalizations, is that additional synergies beyond the $45 million that's been identified? Like was that going to be additional $20 million bucket that you've kind of talked about?
 And could you also talk to us a little bit about just the revenue synergies and how that hits also into maybe the $20 million additional revenue target you talked -- additional synergy target you've talked about? 
Thomas Klaritch: Yes, Tayo, it's additional, and it's actual net cash revenue that comes in. So we're really ahead of schedule on kind of internalizing markets across the portfolio, and there's more to come. So I think we've assumed kind of a couple of year plan to internalize most of the markets that we -- where we had scale and where it made sense. But it's net cash continuously, year after year after year net cash to the bottom line. 
Peter Scott: Yes. And then on revenue synergies, we've been pretty clear that, that $60 million run rate does not include revenue synergies, so that could be some upside, whether that's through better lease execution, better retention, better lease rates, so on and so forth, that would be upside. I think it's a little challenging to our articulator to go through what we think that is, but we certainly think that there are revenue synergies out there for us to get. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. So the $60 million run rate is just from more G&A type operating expense type synergies that gets you from the $40 million to $60 million and then revenues or anything on top? 
Peter Scott: Yes, that's the right way to describe that. 
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Scott Brinker for closing remarks. Please go ahead. 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Thanks for joining us, everyone. Good momentum here. Happy to talk about it today and look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks and months. Take care. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Healthpeak Properties, Inc. Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Johns, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Johns: Welcome to Healthpeak's Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Discussion of risks and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. And in an exhibit to the 8-K we furnished to the SEC yesterday, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements. The exhibit is also available on our website at healthpeak.com. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Chief Executive Officer, Scott Brinker. 
Scott Brinker: Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to Healthpeak's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. 
 Joining me today for prepared remarks is Pete Scott, our CFO. Joining for Q&A is John Thomas, the CEO of Physicians Realty Trust and our senior team.
 I want to start by thanking our entire team for their contributions in 2023. Public market volatility, notwithstanding, your collaboration and winning mindset allowed us to produce record leasing volumes in 2 of our 3 business segments and to exceed our initial same-store and earnings guidance by 130 basis points and $0.05 per share, respectively.
 Last evening, we reported a strong fourth quarter, both operationally and financially. For the fiscal year, we grew same-store NOI by 4.8% and AFFO per share by 5.5%, driving our dividend payout ratio below 80%. The balance sheet remains in great shape with 5.2x net debt to EBITDA at year-end. We expect to close the strategic combination with Physicians Realty Trust on March 1. Since the announcement in late October, the 2 teams have been working side by side on culture, best practices, tenant relationships, technology and every other area that will determine the success of the merger.
 We have the highest level of confidence that this combination will in fact augment our platform capabilities, relationships, balance sheet and earnings. Just last week, we internalized property management in 3 markets with up to 6 additional markets expected to go in-house by midyear. We've had near 100% success, bringing the existing third-party staff onto our team. Those employees, on average, have worked in these buildings for 7 years, minimizing execution risk.
 As for synergies, we're confident we'll achieve the targets we outlined in late October, and they are contributing several cents per share to our earnings in 2024. Pete will expand upon the synergies and outlook in a few minutes. I want to share some thoughts on the operating environment for the 2 largest segments, starting with Outpatient Medical, where the sector is benefiting from demand exceeding supply. We have 2 decades of operating history in the sector and in 2023, we were at or near all-time highs for leasing volume, retention, renewal spreads and same-store growth.
 Looking forward to 2024, our same-store outlook includes the DOC portfolio and is 75 basis points above our 5-year history for initial guidance. We expect to benefit from sector fundamentals that have never been stronger, high-quality assets and operations and internalization. Most important, we believe we're combining the 2 best outpatient platforms in the country to create an even bigger and better company to drive internal and external growth for the next decade plus.
 Today, more than 65% of the tenants in the combined portfolio are health systems. When they make leasing decisions, it's often driven by relationships and no one is better positioned than the combined company. It's a very different leasing dynamic than other real estate sectors who deal with tens of thousands of very small tenants. Relationships are absolutely critical in our sector and the senior team of the combined company has more than 200 years of experience in the sector, creating an unrivaled relationship network. Our next generation coming behind them is learning from the best and bringing energy to continue innovating as the sector evolves.
 Let me turn to our lab business. The fundamental drivers of long-term growth are solidly intact with both drug approvals and new drug applications at or near all-time highs. That means R&D funding is paying dividends, creating a virtuous cycle. Big Pharma is ramping up partnership deals and M&A to replace looming patent expirations and companies with good data have ready access to capital.
 At the same time, venture capital deployment and the IPO market remains soft and boards are deferring leasing decisions when possible. Those dynamics will eventually turn in our favor, and we'll be well positioned to capitalize. We can also comfortably underwrite a massive reduction in new deliveries starting in 2025. Fortunately, even during the market exuberance for life science, we stuck to our strategy. As a result, we're highly concentrated in 5 of the best submarkets in the country where we have significant scale and deep relationships to capture leasing demand.
 Moreover, 85% of our rent is from campuses with 400,000 feet or more, which allows us to offer a wide range of price points and space plans and to accommodate expansions, all of which are important to tenants. Year-to-date, we signed 58,000 feet of leases with another 115,000 feet under LOI plus active discussions across our portfolio, so an encouraging start to the year. Cyclical slowdowns create opportunity on the other side, and we're preparing accordingly. In the past few months, we received approvals or entitlements that expand our land bank to more than 4 million square feet in 2 of the most important life science submarkets in the country.
 We're well positioned when new development begins to pencil. On a related point, we were pleased to close on the sale of a 65% interest at our Callan Ridge development for a 5.3% cap rate with rents essentially at market on a long-term lease. The sale was driven by favorable pricing, not a desire to reduce our lab exposure. We're actively evaluating capital recycling opportunities across the combined $20-plus billion portfolio, including outright sales and JV recaps.
 Any such proceeds would likely be used to fund a growing pipeline of relationship-driven opportunities across our core segments that we could always consider stock buybacks or debt repayment depending on relative returns. I'll close by saying that the macro backdrop has been casting a shadow over the underlying strength of the company. We can't control that shadow but we're more confident than ever about what lies behind it, in particular, platform, portfolio and balance sheet. I'll turn it to Pete. 
Peter Scott: Thanks, Scott. Starting with our financial results. We finished the year on a strong note. For the fourth quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.46 per share and total portfolio same-store growth of 3.6%. For the full year, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.78 per share and total portfolio same-store growth of 4.8%. And our balance sheet is in great shape as we finished the year with 5.2x net debt to EBITDA. Let me provide a little more color on segment performance. In lab, same-store growth for the quarter was 2.7%, bringing our full year growth to 3.7%, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range.
 During the year, we signed 985,000 square feet of leases with positive cash re-leasing spreads on renewals of 23%. The majority of these lease transactions were signed with existing relationships, and we were also successful in capturing incremental demand from new tenants. Occupancy in our operating portfolio ended the year at 97%.
 Turning to Outpatient Medical. We had a strong finish to the year with 4.3% same-store growth, bringing full year growth to 3.4%, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Occupancy ended the year at 91% and our tenant retention was approximately 80%. Both metrics are reflective of our leading portfolio and platform. Finishing with CCRCs, same-store growth for the quarter increased 5%, bringing full year growth to 15.6%. 2023 was a record year of entrance fee sales and cash collection. These cash collections exceeded the amortized amount included in both FFO and AFFO by $40 million.
 Two quick items on our financial results before shifting gears to our 2024 outlook. For the fourth quarter, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share. The dividend payment is forecast to remain the same post closing of the merger, which should provide us with incremental retained earnings in 2024. You probably also noticed that DOC filed an 8-K earlier this week with preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. They expect to complete their 10-K and other financial reporting on their normal time line in the next few weeks.
 Turning now to our combined outlook for 2024. Given our high degree of confidence the merger will close, coupled with the heavy lifting done by our respective teams to successfully integrate our forecasting, we are in a position to provide investors with an initial view of our combined 2024 outlook. However, critical items, including finalizing the GAAP merger adjustments will not occur until after the closing date. So we will make any necessary updates to our outlook and finalize guidance most likely in conjunction with our first quarter earnings.
 With all that said, our initial outlook for 2024 is as follows: FFO as adjusted ranging from $1.73 to $1.79 per share, which includes merger-related benefits of approximately $0.02 to $0.03. AFFO ranging from $1.50 to $1.56 per share which includes merger-related benefits of approximately $0.05. Total same-store growth ranging from positive 2.25% to positive 3.75%. Let me touch on some of the major items that underlie our outlook.
 First, based on the March 1 closing date, our outlook is for 2 months stand-alone Healthpeak and 10 months combined Healthpeak and DOC. The result of this is a weighted average share count of approximately 690 million for full year 2024, assuming no additional equity issuances. Second, we have identified sources for all of our capital needs and have no remaining funding requirement in 2024. We upsized our 5-year term loan to $750 million and recently swapped the entire amount to a fixed rate of 4.5%.
 Last month, we closed on our well-received Callan Ridge joint venture, generating $130 million of proceeds and eliminating $22 million of future TI spend. We have $250 million of projected retained earnings given our well-covered dividend, and we expect some seller financing debt repayments. These proceeds will be used to fund our development and redevelopment pipeline, repay $210 million of DOC's private placement notes and fund all of our transaction costs. Third, G&A is expected to range from $95 million to $105 million, which compares to stand-alone Peak at approximately $95 million for full year 2023. All in, our G&A is only increasing by approximately $5 million at the midpoint despite inflation and our asset base increasing by $5 billion.
 Fourth, our current FFO outlook includes a negative $0.03 mark-to-market on the $1.9 billion of DOC debt that we will assume. Notably, we do not add back this headwind to FFO as adjusted. Fifth, perhaps conservatively, we do not include any benefit from the Graphite Bio termination fee in our FFO as adjusted. Fixed item, the components of same-store growth are as follows: We see outpatient medical ranging from positive 2.5% to positive 3.5%. Fundamentals in outpatient medical continue to improve versus historical norms, including higher tenant retention, increased rent mark-to-market and increased escalators. Our outpatient medical same-store NOI for 2024 is approximately $825 million or 60% of the overall pool. We have included the DOC portfolio in our same-store pool for 2024, given the size and strategic nature of the merger.
 Turning to lab. We see same-store growth ranging from positive 1.5% to positive 3%. Lab growth is driven by contractual rent escalators, positive rent mark-to-market and the benefit of increased NOI from internalizing operations in San Francisco and San Diego. Not surprising, we do have some offsets, including a modest decline in occupancy relative to 2023 and timing of free rent, which naturally fluctuates year-to-year and is a headwind, particularly in the first quarter.
 Finishing with CCRCs, we continue to see growth in 2024 with a same-store outlook of positive 4% to positive 8%. I thought it would be helpful to finish with a high-level bridge of the major drivers in our outlook. Our outlook includes $40 million of synergies from the merger noting that a portion of these synergies are operational and flowing through NOI. We see approximately $30 million of year-over-year earnings benefit from same-store growth. And we see a positive $15 million benefit from development earnings, largely Vantage and Nexus plus the benefit from the Callan Ridge joint venture. So there are certainly a lot of tangible positive trends. But we are facing some headwinds.
 Interest expense is forecast to increase $35 million due to a combination of rising interest rates as well as the aforementioned debt mark-to-market. There is an approximate $10 million earnings roll down due to some onetime security deposits received in our lab business in 2023 that are not forecast in 2024 plus dilution from potential seller financing debt repayment, which, although dilutive does provide capital to recycle into our core businesses. We have $40 million of a temporary decline in NOI at 2 marquee campuses that I wanted to spend a moment on.
 First, there is $30 million of year-over-year decline in NOI from the well disclosed Amgen expiration at Oyster Point. The 323,000 of combined square footage across 3 assets is being put into redevelopment as we upgrade these assets to Class A product and multi-tenant buildings. We are rebranding the campus Portside at Oyster Point and substantially upgrading the amenity package and infrastructure in order to integrate the buildings more with [indiscernible] creating a nearly 2 million square foot contiguous mega campus with leading life science tenants.
 We have backfilled 101,000 square feet of the expirations already with our client lease, although we don't expect that lease to commence until the third quarter as we complete work to the base building and their suite. Second, after months of uncertainty, we have clarity on the Sorrento Therapeutics situation, although the lease rejections do result in a negative $10 million NOI impact in 2024. We have placed the 168,000 square foot Directors Place assets into redevelopment and are actively touring tenants through the buildings. There is a nice mark-to-market upside opportunity on this campus as we retenant the buildings, but the downtime is a headwind in 2024. In addition to the headwinds discussed already, we have included about $10 million in conservatism in our outlook for various items, including potential further capital recycling activities, proactive lease terminations and bad debt.
 In conclusion, while there are lots of puts and takes to our outlook, let me try and sum it up succinctly. Core operations are performing in line to perhaps better than expectation. Lab is not growing at the same rate as the last 10 years. Nothing grows to the sky in perpetuity, but we do like our market positioning and firmly believe we will outperform as sentiment and fundamentals improve.
 On the other side of the spectrum, Outpatient Medical is growing at a higher rate than historical averages as demand is outstripping supply, a key thesis in our merger with DOC combined with the improved capabilities and significant synergies. We have managed the balance sheet conservatively but like all REITs, we are not immune to rising rates nor can we avoid the required merger-related debt mark-to-market. And as we have consistently pointed out, we have 2 large marquee campuses undergoing significant repositioning. We have forecast the capital spend for these redevelopments in our 2024 plan, but none of the earnings upside. We are confident in our ability to recoup the lost NOI, but our base case assumption is lease commencements won't start at these projects until 2025 and beyond.
 If we can outperform that time line, then we will have further upside to our outlook. With that, let's open it up to Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. 
Nicholas Yulico: I guess first question is just relating to the guidance. I appreciate all the info you gave us on the DOC impact plus some of the other year-over-year items. But is there any way to kind of think about what just legacy Peak FFO or AFFO growth would be year-over-year? Just putting aside sort of all the merger impacts, maybe just on like a percentage basis or pennies impact? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Nick, it's Pete here. Maybe I'll just start with AFFO. We did provide AFFO this year because of all the GAAP merger-related items, and we don't necessarily want to get mired into discussion on all of those on this call. But if you look at AFFO this year versus where we were last year, our outlook is effectively flat, but that does include the benefit of the synergies.
 If you try and back those out, you'd say our AFFO would be down year-over-year. That's actually a correct statement. And if you go back to the merger proxy, the S-4 we put out, you'd actually see that in our forecast as well. And that's really primarily because of the temporary lost NOI at the 2 large campuses I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So if were not for this merger, our AFFO would actually be down year-over-year, but Certainly, with the benefits of this merger, the accretion we've articulated being about $0.05 per share, we're able to keep our AFFO flat year-over-year. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. That's helpful. I guess second question is just in terms of the lab business, if you can give maybe a little bit more feel for the leasing that you talked about that's in the pipeline right now. Kind of how the -- if any of that relates to San Diego plus how we should think about, I guess, the composition of what leasing would look like going forward from a maybe mark-to-market standpoint because I know that was impacted in the fourth quarter? 
Peter Scott: Good question, Nick. I'm not surprised that you're asking it. We did disclose that we've signed year-to-date about 175,000 square feet of leases and LOIs. The first week of January is quite slow. So that's probably a pretty good 4-week number. If you annualize that, it's still trending in a positive direction as you compare it to a year ago where leasing was. I'll turn it actually to Scott Bohn to give a little bit more color on the composition of those leases and LOIs. 
Scott Bohn: Yes. Nick, this is Scott. On those LOIs, we're -- it's a multitude of deals. It's not just one large deal, really across all the markets. As we talked about over the past few quarters, the demand has really trended towards the kind of sub 30,000 square foot range, and that's where the bulk of those deals that are today. We're pretty happy with the economics that we are shaking out on those. When you look at mark-to-market on the portfolio, we were probably in the 20% range last year.
 If you look at it today, taking into account where we are probably more in the 5% to 10% range, but that varies greatly given the TI Capital and other aspects of the lease that are in play today. So hard to pin down an exact number because there's so much differentiation in the leases today. But I'd say, it's probably in the 5% to 10% range overall. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. 
Juan Sanabria: Just a question on dispositions. You talked about potential for more assets to come on the market. So just curious, if you could give a little bit more flavor for the types of assets that you may look to sell. Would they be kind of core, long-leased assets, stabilized or maybe more noncore assets. Just kind of curious on what may be being floated out there at this point in time. 
Scott Brinker: Juan, it's Scott. I mean, obviously, we're not happy with where the stock is trading. There's a pretty big disconnect between what the private market would value our assets at and what the public markets would. So we're certainly looking at all available opportunities to create value. So I would say, it's a pretty wide-ranging menu of things that we're considering. If it's core assets like we did in San Diego a couple of weeks ago, it would be more likely than not kind of a recap where we maintain an ownership stake.
 We don't have a whole lot of sort of true noncore assets but we have less core assets that we could consider selling those may come at slightly higher cap rates than the print we had a couple of weeks ago in San Diego. That was obviously an A+ type asset in campus. But we're looking at a number of things. We've been saying that for the last year. We were a net seller of real estate in 2023. From where we sit here today, we'll probably be a net seller in 2024. But we have the ability to be price sensitive. Balance sheet is in great shape, sources and uses are spoken for. So we'd be price sensitive on anything that we do. 
Juan Sanabria: Great. And then hoping maybe you could talk to the -- maybe a question for Pete. The cadence of lab same-store growth, you mentioned there could be kind of a temporary drag in the first quarter. I believe you said free rent, I'm not sure. Lots of information, which is great. But just curious if you could talk about the cadence of expected growth for fiscal year '24. 
Peter Scott: Yes. Sure, Juan. I think from an FFO perspective, I would say that the cadence, there's probably not a huge amount of variability as you look out across the 4 quarters in the year. I will say that some of these larger leases that are commencing in the first quarter for lab, especially some of the ones we've been pretty vocal about like the Voyager deal out in Boston that we did that commenced at the beginning of this month or January, I should say, beginning of the year as well as the RevMed deal. I mean, they just came with 3 months of free rent, and we have the MGM deal that we just commenced as they took over one of the Amgen buildings that expired.
 So there's just a -- I'm not going to say there's a significant amount of additional free rent beyond what's market, but all of those leases are pretty sizable and commenced earlier this year. So it's just going to have a little bit of an impact on the first and second quarter same-store numbers relative to the overall guide. And that's really why I wanted to point that out. Some years free rent works in your favor, some years it doesn't. A little bit of a headwind this year in our number. But again, these are long-term leases with really high-quality tenants. So I just want to point out that same-store for lab will be a little bit weaker first half of the year versus second half. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. 
Michael Griffin: I wanted to ask on the development pipeline. I noticed some of those projects were pushed out a couple of quarters relative to last quarter. Curious if you could give any color on why that's the case? Are there any worries about demand for those projects? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Greg, it's Pete. I can certainly start with that. And I'll hit on the biggest ones. Vantage, we actually delivered a portion of that late last year. And then the initial occupancy is for what's remaining, and we do have another lease with Astellas that's expected to start later this year. So that's really the reason why that got pushed back a little bit. It's because we delivered a portion of that.
 On Gateway, we have certainly talked about that at length over the last 6 to 9 months with the Sorrento situation. I mean, realistically, the way we look at it, even if we signed a lease today, between space planning and actually doing some of the work to do the specific TI build-out, I mean you're talking about 6 to 9 months before a lease can even commence. We don't have a lease signed at this point in time. So as a result, we did push that out a little bit. We're certainly touring tenants through the building and the facility. It's a really great looking, high-quality campus, A+ right there overlooking the 805. But as we look out, based upon how long it takes leases to get signed, that has actually slowed a little bit. we decided that it made sense to push that out just a couple of quarters.
 I don't know, Scott Bohn if there's anything you'd want to add to that. 
Scott Bohn: No, it's good, Pete. 
Michael Griffin: Great. Thanks. And then I just wanted to touch again on the synergies from the merger. You talked about realizing about $40 million to $60 million of that. It seems like the merger is going on pace or maybe even better than expected. Curious if you could see any additional upside kind of on top of that $60 million or if that's sort of the kind of highest level of synergies that you could see. 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Griff, I'll take that. It's Scott. In October, we talked about $40 million of year 1 run rate synergies, and we've got a full $40 million in our 2024 guidance. So I would say, we are ahead of expectations in year 1. So hopefully, we can exceed that number as well. In terms of year 2, we'll see. The internalization so far is going well, 3 markets down, 6 more in the queue, so we're taking them one at a time just to make sure that it goes well, reduce execution risk.
 But if we're satisfied with the results, we could certainly continue to internalize more and more markets going forward and that would be a big part of achieving the high end, if not above the high end of that synergy range. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. 
Richard Anderson: So on the Amgen and Sorrento spaces, I think your -- the next time we'll see that in the numbers is 2026, correct me if I'm wrong. Is any one of the other sort of maybe faster to the punch. It sounds like Sorrento is a little bit more ready to use based on what your comments were. I'm just curious what the realistic time line is to see them back in cash paying assets? 
Peter Scott: Yes. I think, Rich, as you quoted 2 years, that's really more of a same-store figure. I would say from a lease-out perspective, as you pointed out, the 2 campuses. Sorrento, the scope of work is less significant on that than the scope of work on the port side project that we've rebranded. So I would say that we can finish the scope of work on Sorrento, and that's the Directors Place campus a lot quicker, and we'll actually finish the work on the portside campus.
 So I would see NOI probably earlier from that campus if I were to give you some guidance between the 2 then I would from the port side campus. Although that said, you do have to bear in mind that we will actually commence that lease, the 101,000 square foot lease at Portside with client later this year. So we have backfilled some of that. We have not backfilled at this point any of the Sorrento campus, but we're certainly touring tenants through it. 
Scott Brinker: Can I add something to that? From my seat, like our lab business, even 2 years ago, we're essentially at 98%, 99% occupancy, essentially nothing in redevelopment and a completely pre-leased development pipeline. From where we sit today, we've got some upside in occupancy on the operating portfolio. Scott and Mike are working on. We've got a pretty big redevelopment bucket that has a lot of NOI upside and then a fair amount of development that hasn't been leased yet.
 So just on Amgen, Sorrento and Vantage alone, you're talking about $50 million, $60 million of NOI upside. I don't know if that's 25% or 26%, but we do think it's achievable. Those are all Class A assets. There's a cost of capital, so maybe subtract a little bit of that upside from an earnings standpoint but it's substantial. So our lab business 2 years ago was kind of hit full utilization, for lack of a better word. And today, there's a fair amount of upside for us to go recapture. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. Yes, fair. Scott. The second question, shifting over to MOBs or outpatient medical, whatever we call them, so you guys are guiding to 3% same-store would combine with DOC. Your big pure play peer Healthcare Realty sees a path to same-store going up over the next couple of years beyond that through some occupancy lift and whatnot. I'm curious if you have a game plan of 3 -- sort of like that's your starting point, but do you see more growth out of medical office now representing the majority of your portfolio? Do you see more growth potential beyond that 3%, which has been sort of the legacy level of growth for medical office over the many several past years? Wondering where you see it going from here. 
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean it's really been a 2% to 3% growth business for the last decade. We do see that accelerating. It's not going to 10%, but we do think it's going to improve for the forward 5 to 10 years versus the previous 5 to 10 years, just given supply demand, construction cost and therefore, our ability to push rents. So our guidance this year is at the very high end, actually well above the high end of any guidance we've given in that segment historically.
 We have a pretty good track record of beating our same-store guidance and our earnings guidance. So you can assume that hopefully, there's some upside to the number that we gave. But it's a combination of occupancy. Obviously, we were up 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, I think like 60 basis points year-over-year. All-time high re-leasing spreads, all-time high retention. So yes, we do think that there is some upside to the historical outpatient medical growth rate. 
Richard Anderson: How do you condition tenants to be okay with higher rents, right, because they've lived with this world and you got to be careful about sort of screwing up the system, so to speak. Is it there for the taking, you think? Or do you sort of have to sort of thread that needle? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. And I'll ask John and Tom to comment as well. They're both here today. 
Thomas Klaritch: Yes. If you look at, Rich, the rents, I mean, we've seen -- what's actually benefited us is the new developments because the market rents that are coming in on those is typically 20% or so higher than what the existing rates are. So it gives us a little room to grow. And then if you look at our tenancy back 20 years ago, it was 25% hospital leases and 75% third-party physicians. Today, that number is 65% hospital. So you do have a little more ability to push the rents up when you're dealing with the institutions like that.
 John, if you have anything to add? 
John Thomas: Yes. No, I agree with that, Tom. And I think we've seen 6 straight quarters of well above that in renewal spreads and then conditioning -- your comment about conditioning tenants, the options, as Tom said, historically was to go to a new building, but the rents now are 20% higher than the new building. So it's just -- it's much more, I guess, negotiating leverage. And if you're raising the rents 5% to 10%, that's better than the 20%, and that's the conditioning.
 And then inflation increases, that's more important, I think, than the renewal spread right now, we're starting to get across the board annual increases that are fixed of 3% to 4% to 5%, people don't want to do inflationary CPI increases. So that just adds to that continuous stream. So it's more and more of the portfolio roles, more and more of the rents are going up 3%, 4%, 5% on renewal spreads and then you're adding a 3% to 4% annual increase. So the next 10 years, as Scott said, is very optimistic. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. 
Wesley Golladay: Can you comment on what's going on with the pushout of collecting on the seller financing, if it was pushed out a few months? 
Peter Scott: Yes. The seller financing, I mean, we actually did quite well off of providing that on our senior housing sales, which were 3, 4 years ago. So it's a business that we actually like if we provide the right LTV to the counterparty. With these loans, we've gotten repaid a lot over the last few years. I mean the balance was, I think, $600 million, $700 million. It was pretty high, down now to about $175 million. And our guidance for this year, call it, outlook, we had 0 to $100 million getting repaid. So $50 million at the midpoint, could be a little bit higher than that. And obviously, that's probably more front of the year weighted as well. I think our expectation is if it gets repaid, it will get repaid in the very near term, if not, it would get extended, which obviously, if it gets extended versus repaid, then there's an earnings benefit to that. But again, the expectation given where the LTVs of those are is that as the counterparty sell assets, we'd expect to get those loans repaid and probably more towards the front end of the year. 
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then I guess, can you comment on maybe how the conversations are going on, on leasing lab space? I think you had a new lease just under 200,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. It looks like some good activity in the first half in January. And maybe there's a little bit of a lag effect, but there's been some M&A in this space. There's the biotech in that that's had nice balance. Any noticeable change in your conversations? 
Scott Bohn: Yes. Wes, this is Scott. Scott Bohn I think from a demand perspective, we're in line with pre-COVID levels across all 3 portfolios. Boards are still cautious, as Pete mentioned, is taking new space and expansions and things like that. We are seeing some groups who have been on the sidelines are kind of -- have been floating around in the market, really kind of starting to dig in on space plans and getting real as they approach funding at some of the capital markets, both private and public open up. So I think that we're off to a strong start for the year. We like the way that the pipeline is shaping up. 
 The underlying fundamentals that Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks are strong indicators of future demand. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. 
James Kammert: The Q&A is kind of built on some of this, but could you provide a little bit more detail regarding the $700 million to $800 million of development or redev and CapEx guidance that you provided because I ask you kind of reconcile to a known development and redevelopments and what remains to be spent. And even if that were all spent in '24, I think that's roughly half of kind of a $700 million kind of target. So is this other activity at [ AOI ], Vantage, Sorrento? If you could just help kind of what are the major components of that in terms of that total spend for '24, please? 
Peter Scott: Yes. Happy to take that, Jim. I mean, obviously, on the development side, we still have to finish out the Vantage project, which is pretty significant. We've also got some new HCA developments that are kicking off. I mean that's a great program for us, and we'd like to continue to recycle capital and keep that program going and the yields are starting to increase on that, which is great. 
 I'd say what has gone up pretty significantly year-over-year as you look at 2023 versus 2024 is the larger, redevelopment bucket. I mean we're still redeveloping our Point Grand campus. We've got another asset given the Astellas [indiscernible] behind space there as they took on the lease at Vantage. So we've got another large building there. Plus we'll have the portside buildings go as well as Sorrento. So I'd say that the biggest components of that are finishing out the current development pipeline as well as the redevelopment ticking up. And that was always our expectation was that we would have to redevelop the specialty portside when those leases expired. I mean Amgen was on that campus for 20 years and really, we had to put 0 CapEx into that over that period of time. So we did really, really well on that investment. But 20 years later, there's some capital that has to go into that. Those are really the biggest drivers of that spend this year. 
Scott Brinker: Yes, there's no new starts in lab in that forecast. There's a couple of new starts in outpatient medical. Some are from legacy Healthpeak, others from legacy DOC just commitments that were made in some cases, 2 years ago. Any new commitments, though on development, it's because the yields are attractive, 7%, 8%, highly pre-leased. So we continue to find those very attractive and would recycle capital so that we can go ahead and move forward with those. 
James Kammert: Great. So basically, as this unfolds, the lease opportunity becomes more apparent, that's when those shift to become more explicit redevelopment or CIP activities, is what you're saying? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Correct . 
James Kammert: That's fine. And secondly, if I could. You mentioned, I think, Scott Brinker that you're looking at all capital alternatives. What are the latest thoughts on the CCRC portfolio? Is that still a potential? Or is it still room to grow on the NOI and FFO contribution? Or is that nearing maturity that might be a capital event for you? 
Scott Brinker: Yes, we're at 85% occupancy today. I would think we could get back into 90s. In that portfolio, it's performing well. We've got good assets, mostly in Florida, obviously, favorable supply/demand in that market for seniors, we've got a really good operating partner in LCS. We've got a really strong internal team overseeing it. 
 So we're not in a rush. At the same time, it really has no strategic overlap with our medical and lab businesses, which are highly complementary, same process and procedure, et cetera. So at some point, I think we will recycle. But to my comment earlier, would be price sensitive. We don't need to do anything. It's performing fine. We've got the team to run it, but the capital markets have just been too tight and soft to transact on a portfolio of that size, but we'll see if things start to open up in 2024. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. 
Joshua Dennerlein: Appreciate all the color around guidance. One quick question on that. I think you -- I think if I heard correctly, you're including DOC in your same-store medical office NOI outlook. If you strip out DOC from the 2024 same-store pool, what would the same-store MOB NOI growth look like? 
Scott Brinker: Yes, hard to say. We are getting the benefit of the internalization in the peak portfolio that we obviously would not have done absent the merger, so it comes hard to parse the 2 numbers. But I think we said historically, DOC has lower in-place escalators than Healthpeak, but that's converging over time as they sign new leases with, as John said, 3% or better escalators. So I'm guessing it'd be a little bit lower but not materially. 
 I think they said numerous times, their growth rate in 2023 was impacted by some unique asset specific events and proactive termination. So I would expect our growth rate to mirror or closely mirror the Healthpeak growth rate going forward. 
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe 1 different kind of question. Just you mentioned the stock price, you're not happy with it. Just kind of curious for your appetite for stock buybacks here. 
Peter Scott: Yes. We did buy back some stock, albeit at a higher price 1 year, 1.5 years ago. And I would say that the response from the Street was pretty unenthusiastic to that. That said, we do put an authorization every quarter for stock issuance or buyback with our Board. And we're not at a level, I think, today, where we buy back stock, but certainly, it's something that we're paying attention to. We're certainly a long ways away from a level where we even consider issuing equity, which is why we're talking more about capital recycling. 
 So we have a buyback program in place. We don't need to file one. We still have $400-plus million of buyback we could do, but we're not going to look to lever up if we ever bought back shares, we would look to do something through capital recycling. But I think I'd probably just leave it at that, Josh. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: I know there are some moving parts with properties that are going into redevelopment. But can you give us a little more color, unless I missed it, in terms of the lab same-store NOI, what's embedded in there for occupancy and spreads for '24 compared to what you did, especially when the spread tightened in '23 . 
Peter Scott: Yes. Mike, it's Pete. I'll handle that. So obviously, our outlook is 1.5% to 3% positive. What are the positive drivers within that, I mean, obviously, you've got rent escalators, which tend to be on average in the low 3s. We've got some positive mark-to-market embedded in there on lease renewals that we do get done. And then as we've said, there's a little bit of internalization benefit as well. So I think if we just stop right there, we'd probably be 5% plus from a same-store growth perspective, Which actually would kind of mirror what's happened over the last 10 years. .
 That said, there are some offsets, which I think are pretty well known. We've got average occupancy will probably be in the low 96% area. So you compare that to where we were last year. That's probably 100-plus basis points decline, so a modest decline, but nevertheless a headwind. The free rent that I mentioned, some years, it's up; some years, it's down. It's up this year, but it certainly is a little bit of a headwind as well. And then as we always do, we have a little bit of bad debt cushion in order to provide ourselves with a little bit of flexibility depending upon what goes on within our tenant portfolio, that certainly improved pretty significantly year-over-year, but we still do include a little bit there. 
 So when you take all the positives and you take all the headwinds kind of blends out to that 1.5% to 3%. I know it's not what it was for the last 10 years, but our stock price is also not where it was a couple of years ago as well. So it's certainly been factored into, I think, our valuation at this point of time. 
Michael Mueller: Sure. And maybe 1 follow-up, talk about positive spreads. Would you think that the spreads would be closer to what you were showing in 24 -- fourth quarter '24 or full year '23? 
Scott Brinker: No, the fourth quarter number was an outlier. I mean there may be select spaces within the portfolio that would have a negative renewal rate mark-to-market, but that was an outlier. I think 10-year-old TIs, the tenant that wanted to stay in the space with credit -- investment-grade credit, no downtime, no TI. So I mean that was a unique situation. I wouldn't expect a lot of those. . 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. 
Vikram Malhotra: Just maybe first on CCRCs. I know you mentioned at some point, you might look to divest. But I was a bit surprised just I thought the growth would be higher, at least I was anticipating it and just looking at the outlook. I thought there would be a more sort of robust outlook. So maybe if you can just compare and contrast or just give a sense of if you're seeing something different from your earlier expectations? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. Well, we still see some occupancy growth in 2024. Rental rates will grow, but more in the mid-single digits as opposed to high single digits just given the fundamentals in that sector. Then obviously, we've had a huge benefit from contract labor coming down over the past 18 months. We're largely through that benefit. We have very little contract labor in the portfolio today. So you just lose a lot of that benefit in same store. So I mean, that's what's happening at the property level. And then obviously, our accounting for this asset class has an impact as well.
 Most of the income in this portfolio comes from the prepaid rents on the nonrefundable entry fee. That's usually more than 75% of the total NOI and we just have this GAAP accounting method that we amortize all the entry fees. And we're leaving roughly $40 million of earnings on the table relative to the cash NOI that's actually being generated. So unfortunately, our reporting for CCRCs does not really reflect the underlying performance of that asset class, but chalk that up to GAAP accounting, unfortunately. 
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. That makes sense. And then you mentioned sort of relationships or key in MOBs and you've got a great HCA program. I'm just wondering 2 subparts to that. One, is there likelihood of the HCA program expanding, becoming bigger or other types of properties within HCA. And then second, just is there a pathway for similar programs with larger health systems? 
Scott Brinker: The answer is yes across the port. I mean there's a massive opportunity to help these big health systems grow their outpatient network. I might ask John to comment specifically. 
John Thomas: Yes. Vikram, I think you're aware, we've been doing this with Northside in Atlanta, have a project that's actually about to top out and further opportunities on the Northside pretty routinely. Same thing at -- we both -- both organizations have a great relationship with on [indiscernible], and we continue to have development opportunities there as well to come, so standby. But those are just a couple of great examples and fantastic markets. 
Operator: Your next question will go from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Scott, you flagged the estimated mark-to-market on lab of 5% to 10%. I'm just curious how that compares to the lease expiration you have over the next several years? And I'm also curious if there's -- what sort of the variation between larger versus smaller requirements? You noted some strength in sort of that smaller segment requirements. So any detail would be helpful. 
Scott Bohn: Yes, sure. On the mark-to-market, I think it's slightly lower in the very near term just with the Amgen leases rolling. It's kind of weighed down a little bit, those were relatively high rent that grew over that 20-year period that Pete mentioned. And then on the tenant demand side and leasing, we've talked about over the past several quarters, I mean, if you look across all 3 markets, the after demand probably somewhere between 60% to 75% of that is sub 30,000 square feet. So it's been really the strike zone for deals over the past 6 to 9 months. 
Austin Wurschmidt: But even as we get into sort of '25 and '26, I mean, do you expect that still to be pretty muted? Or is there any opportunities? I know you guys have flagged in the past, I think '25 was going to be a little bit of a more attractive year. Like does that then reaccelerate still as we get into next year? Or has the gradual moderation in market rents sort of wiped away some of that upside? 
Scott Brinker: It's more of the former. '23 and '24 were more modest because of Amgen and it starts to pick up a lot more materially in '25 and thereafter. But keeping in mind, Scott's bigger picture comment that it is down year-over-year from what we would have said a year ago just because of market fundamentals. But this should be the low point on the mark-to-market, and then we'll gather some momentum into '25 and beyond. 
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then you guys gave a little bit of color around sort of the thoughts around synergies. But I guess I'm just curious how much of that $40 million do you think kind of hits right out of the gate when the deal closes? And what is sort of that go-get for the balance of the year? How would you kind of break down the cadence of that? And then thinking about maybe what could end up getting pull forward even or even upside beyond maybe the high end of that? Just curious the latest thoughts. 
Peter Scott: Yes. Austin, it's Pete. I keep hoping one of these days we'll open [indiscernible] and see 5 thumbs up that are green, but it wasn't this quarter. Maybe it will be next quarter. 
Austin Wurschmidt: It just means you do. 
Peter Scott: We certainly do. Look, on the synergy -- what I would say on the $40 million, we said the vast majority of that is actually on G&A savings, and we would expect to achieve pretty much all of that at closing. Some of those G&A savings are difficult. We have to have conversations with employees on our side. DOC has to have those on their side. Those conversations have been had, never fun, but I'd expect the vast majority of that to hit right away. As we talked about on the balance, on the internalization, most of that really is the 3 markets that we've said we've internalized already. 
 So those are really tangible, but those will hit kind of quarterly as we get NOI benefits within our portfolio throughout the year. But again, we feel confident that we're going to hit all those numbers. That's why it's in our $40 million estimate that's really just 10 months as opposed to hitting that in a year. So hitting those numbers a little bit earlier on. As to the additional $20 million, I think those are really kind of 2025 numbers, and a lot of that is really internalization focused, although there could be a modest amount more of G&A. And where we sit today, we feel confident that we can hit those numbers. But again, those will be '25 numbers, and that will flow through to all the years beyond that. . 
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. No, that's great. Green thumbs on the answer. Appreciate the detail. 
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. 
John Pawlowski: I was hoping you can provide just a very rough range of disposition volume that you would look to close on this year if your public market valuation is still depressed. 
Scott Brinker: I mean, it could be 0 if the market is tighter, it could be a couple of billion dollars if the market opens up. I mean, we'll see, John, we're having all sorts of discussions, but we have them. We've been saying that on a couple of quarters in a row of earnings call. So we'll just have to see how the market plays out. But there's a lot of active discussions across the portfolio today. 
John Pawlowski: Okay. I know like the market's not completely liquid right now, but there's still such a massive gap in where your stock is trading and where you're able to close some deals, and I know not everything is going to trade at a low 5% cap rate. But even if it's well north of that, there -- it still seems like a very interesting trade right now to try to narrow the public to private valuation gap. So -- are you -- how much are you actively like on the market looking to sell right now in life science and [indiscernible] lease. 
Scott Brinker: Yes. I don't really have a different answer than what I gave in active discussions across the portfolio. I mean it could be a very material number if the markets open up.. 
Peter Scott: Yes. I think the other thing I would add, John, is obviously, we don't have any acquisitions dialed into our forecast as well. And then on top of that, we did actually bake in, and hopefully, this was something that everyone got from our prepared remarks is that we have baked in potential dilution from if we wanted to sell noncore assets the likely use of proceeds immediately would be to repay debt, right? And that's got a dilutive impact to it. That's not to say that we're going to look to further delever. We'd like to recycle that capital over time into our core business segments, but we have dialed in some flexibility within our forecast to allow us to recycle capital. 
John Pawlowski: Okay. And maybe a follow-up. Can you just help us understand the 2 development starts $90 million. I know it's a small volume, but 7% to 8% development yield on a risk-adjusted basis seems pretty thin relative to again, where the stock is trading or even debt repayment, again, on a risk-adjusted basis. So why is development winning out of the use of proceeds right now? 
Scott Brinker: Yes. I mean it's with a top partner in HCA. One of them is in Dallas, where we've had tremendous success. We've got assets on that campus. It's bursting at the seams. We're obviously highly pre-leased -- signing long-term leases with no CapEx for the foreseeable future. So the cash flow returns are still quite attractive in our view, and we're selling assets to fund it at an accretive level. So I still find those to be an attractive use of capital for our shareholders, John. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Scott Brinker for any closing remarks. 
Scott Brinker: Yes, I want to thank everybody for their interest. The team here is completely focused, hard at work on beating our earnings guidance again. I think we delivered really strong AFFO growth this year at more than 5%, we grew FFO more than 7% the year before that, and we expect to continue that. So in any of that, I appreciate you tuning in today, call with any questions. Thanks, everyone. 
Operator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. On July 19, we celebrated DOC's 10th anniversary as a public company from our earliest days it's the custodians of a modest portfolio of 19 buildings, the DOC team is remained committed to a discipline strategy of thoughtful growth, and prudent balance sheet management. This steadfast approach, combined with our unmatched partnerships with health systems and physicians across the country, has propelled our portfolio to nearly 300 owned assets totaling over 16 million rentable square feet.  While we are proud to reflect on our achievements so far, we are excited to embrace the opportunities available for DOC's next decade, the demand for the U.S. healthcare delivery system will continue to grow in tandem with the aging of America, and providers need to expand their outpatient presence to effectively care for their patients. Physicians Realty Trust remains ready to partner with our clients to address these changes. We are well positioned to finance and own the purpose built outpatient facilities that will replace expensive and aged inpatient space.  The opportunity to deliver accretive growth for acquisitions has been limited for much of the past two years, due to rapidly rising interest rates and the expected uncertainty as to where investment yield should settle. We've chosen to remain patient during this time prudently waiting for market pricing to meet our cost of capital. That doesn't mean we've been stagnant. Our team has worked diligently to remain connected with our health system partners, while also thoughtfully evaluating where the puck is moving for outpatient real estate.  We're pleased to share that our patients is beginning to be rewarded. During the quarter we completed a modest number of acquisitions, highlighted by the purchase of the Cardiovascular Associates building in Birmingham, Alabama, in a first year yield of 7%. This 73,000 square foot building was designed and built in response to market innovations that now allow many cardiology services and procedures to be performed in an outpatient facility. This is a natural clinically evolution with Medicare and commercial payers, each recognizing the higher quality and lower cost of providing cardiology services in an outpatient location.  We expect this to be a growth strategy for us as the first of many similar cardiology focused outpatient facilities, we will purchase development finance in the future.  In addition to the acquisition of Stable Properties, we will continue to invest meaningful capital in the development of outpatient medical facilities. This capital will be provided in varying forms including loan down debt facilities and mezzanine financing arrangements on heavily preleased projects.  Many of these projects will eventually come on balance sheet through contractual take out commitments. Our pipeline includes $68 million in contractual commitments to projects under construction, and the potential for $500 million of further investments in projects in the planning stage.  Projects within our development pipeline are diverse in nature, reflecting the robust opportunity available for outpatient medical investors. Four projects in our active pipeline are redevelopments of existing buildings, one is the conversion of a vacant Big Box retail anchor, and three represent the conversion of suburban general office buildings.  In each case, these projects will soon be helping leading healthcare providers deliver care in their communities.  We expect that our stabilized yields on these opportunities will exceed the interest rates received during each respective construction period, with first year rent returns that we project to exceed 7% wants stabilized. In any case, these financing opportunities will have higher long-term IRRs than we can achieve in the current acquisition market. We have not finalized these capital commitments and some are all may not come to fruition. Yet we are confident that our opportunity for attractive development financings will continue to grow.  Within the existing portfolio DOC's leasing team continues to do an outstanding job of maximizing the performance of our portfolio. We have ambitious goals to achieve positive net absorption this year while also capturing the exceptional renewal spreads and increasing escalators that we've delivered in recent quarters.  That momentum has continued this quarter with leasing spreads totaling 7.8%. Overtime, the achievement of leasing results and excessive historical levels are and maintaining or improving total occupancy should lead to sustainable and NOI growth over time that is sustainably higher than what the outpatient medical space has provided in the past. We projected this past quarter as the trough for same store growth as we sign and commence most both new and renewal leases in the future.  Jeff will now share comments on our financial results of second quarter 2023 and Mark will discuss our operating results. Jeff? 
Jeff Theiler : Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2023, the company generated normalized funds from operations as $61.2 million or $0.25 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $60.2 million or $0.24 per share. We paid our second quarter dividend of $0.23 per share on July 18, which represented a bad debt ratio of 95%.  We started the quarter with a strong balance sheet, however with the prospect of the Federal Reserve keeping rates higher for longer we decided to take advantage of the inverted yield curve to source additional capital and pay down expensive short term debt.  We closed on a five-year $400 million term loan in May, and concurrently entered into a five-year swap agreement, which fixed our interest expense at 4.69% for the duration of the debt.  As everyone knows, 2023 has been a very challenging year to raise capital. However, the deep banking relationships that we've built over the past 10 years enabled us to successfully execute this deal. Even in that difficult backdrop, and we are grateful for these partnerships. We use a portion of the proceeds of the term loan to repay our entire revolving line of credit and place the remaining proceeds in liquid funds that are currently earning just over 5%. We therefore maintain a positive spread on these funds, while our investments team actively works with health systems across the country to generate attractive acquisition opportunities.  Following that transaction, we start the third quarter in an enviable capital position. Our consolidated net debt to EBITDA ratio is 5.3 times. Further the successful execution of the term loan enabled us to reduce our variable rate debt percentage from 13.4% at the beginning of the quarter to 4.8%. While the current mood of the market seems to be that inflation is coming under control, we are prepared for either scenario with debt maturities that are well staggered and pushed out. Of our $2 billion of consolidated debt, only about $85 million or 4% matures before 2026. We're free to execute our business plan without any limitations on the capital side.  As previously noted, our $1 billion revolving line of credit is completely undrawn and when combined with the cash on the balance sheet, provides us with $1.25 billion of near term liquidity. Current commitments still to be drawn on our developments and outstanding loans are modest at roughly $68 million. This leaves us with dry powder for new acquisitions of roughly $300 million. We've been measured in our acquisition activity so far this year, but we're starting to see more and more attractive opportunities.  So while we still aren't providing definitive acquisition guidance, we can say that we expect the acquisitions to increase steadily through the remainder of the year. We will seek to deploy capital to traditional acquisitions, new development projects and our mezzanine lending platform.  Turning to just a few other items, we're working hard to mitigate the impacts of inflation on our corporate expenses. And we remain on track for the G&A guidance of $41 million to $43 million. Our construction team is also managing to the guidance of $24 million to $26 million for recurring capital projects, and we don't expect any surprises there.  With that, I'll turn it over to Mark, to walk through the details of the second quarter portfolio operations.
Mark Theine : Thanks, Jeff. Outpatient medical same store NOI growth totaled 0.8% for the quarter. This deviation from our long-term trend of 2% to 3% is the result of a decline in same store portfolio occupancy to 94.4%. While incremental vacancy creates near term headwinds, we believe that the current economic environment provides us with the opportunity to create long term value through aggressive leasing initiatives. We appreciate the value creation requires patience. But our conviction in the unique pricing powered offered by our high-quality portfolio and best-in-class management platform couldn't be greater. This confidence is substantiated by full portfolio renewal spreads that have outpaced our closest peers since the beginning of 2022.  That momentum continued this quarter, where we achieved renewal spreads of 7.8% across 244,000 square feet of leasing activity. Importantly, tenant retention remain high at 78%. And we successfully increased contractual escalations on lease renewals by 40 basis points relative to expiring levels. These exceptional renewal results were achieved with modest leasing costs of $1.19 per square foot per year.  As seen elsewhere in the broader real estate sector. Health System tenants are currently engaging in a flight to quality, rising construction expenses and stubbornly high interest rates have increased the cost of building new, benefiting existing owners of quality real estate. Our leasing team is focused on capitalizing on the opportunity to boost occupancy and remains engaged in the comprehensive campaign to increase the visibility of our space. This includes improved online marketing, the leveraging of technology to demonstrate the capabilities of our space and targeting of key brokers to drive foot traffic.  We're seeing these efforts gain traction. For the quarter we realize positive absorption of 4,100 square feet an average annual escalations of 3% on new leasing activity. Our pipeline of new leasing activity continues to accelerate, with active proposals extended on over 120,000 square feet of vacant space. We are encouraged by these early indicators for future net absorption. And we'd like to say thank you to all of our nationwide leasing partners. We sincerely value the relationships with this accomplished team of healthcare leasing professionals, and look forward to seeing many of them at our annual DOC Management Summit in Milwaukee this September.  Beyond these excellent leasing efforts, we are focused on the efficient management of operating expenses across the portfolio. The $1.7 million annual increase in same store expenses was primarily attributable to increases in janitorial maintenance, payroll and security costs. However, most of these increases were experienced early last year amid a higher inflation environment. Sequentially, operating expenses are down at $0.2 million or negative 0.4%. Inflationary pressure on operating expenses appears to be easing, which we believe will allow our leasing discussions to focus on growth and base rent and ultimately fuel future NOI growth.  We're accomplishing these financial goals, while also remaining focused on developing our strong relationships with industry leading health systems and physician practice tenants. After all, if these relationships that have contributed towards our success and building the portfolio since our IPO in 2013 10 years later, the continued strength of these relationships is evident in our 2023 Kingsley Associates Tenant Satisfaction Survey results.  This year, we surveyed over 450 tenants representing approximately 4.9 million square feet. Physicians Realty Trust received an impressive 73% response rate compared to the industry average of 58% this year. In addition, we beat the Kingsley Index in every major property management category, including overall management satisfaction with a score of 4.53 out of 5.  While we sincerely appreciate the positive feedback from our healthcare partners. The surveys we actually value the most are those that offer opportunities for improvement, and where we can invest in better in order to earn that tenants trust and lease renewal before the lease expiration. This year, fewer than 2% of the 458 survey tenants affirmatively indicated that they are unlikely to renew their lease when that expires.  Based on this feedback from our healthcare provider partners, Physicians Realty Trust is well positioned to capitalize on the continued demand for outpatient space while driving long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back to JT
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Mark. Jason, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO. Please go ahead.
Regan Sweeney: Hi, good morning. This is Regan Sweeney on with Juan. Just want to open up broad question on investments and cap rates. Can you discuss the acquisition market? What is the current bid ask spread and then is pricing adjusting to the higher interest rates? And where you're looking for cap rates to ultimately adjust to?
Jeff Theiler : Yeah, good question. There's not a lot of trades happening. What we're seeing is, you know, things in the mid-6s to low-7, you know, for our underwriting and the criteria and the quality that we want to acquire. We're looking at high-6s and low-7s is being kind of matching cost of capital, but same time not going up the risk spectrum to achieve those yields.  So, again, not a lot of trades happening. There's still some trades happening in the mid-6s. We're really excited about CDA [ph], which we were able to work with our partners there to achieve a 7% first year yield on that acquisition, a smaller transaction was 8%. And then we had another one at 7%. So those are the target ranges we're looking for with our cost of capital without jeopardizing the quality and credit or the buildings themselves.
Regan Sweeney: Thank you. Appreciate the color. And then just shifting gears to leasing if I can. In the prepared remarks. I believe you said the leasing spreads were 7.8 for the quarter. What's the expectation for the average spreads? Just as we think about the second half and into 2024 expirations?
Mark Theine : Yeah, this was Mark, I'll take that one. So at least the team's been doing a great job both focusing on retention and leasing spreads. We've consistently been in that mid-single digit and we had a very strong quarter of 7.8% leasing spread this quarter.  Going forward in the back half of the year, we expect that trend to continue in the mid to high single digit leasing spreads and we're not only focused just on that spread but also increasing the annual escalator over the life of the term of the lease and. And we've been very successful in getting three and occasionally even 4% rent bumps built into the lease going forward.
Regan Sweeney: Thank you I appreciate. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph : Thanks. Maybe just following up on the acquisitions, how are you thinking about your current weighted average cost of capital, maybe both from the equity and where you can issue debt today? And then, when you think about that, relative to the cap rates you just quoted, what makes it attractive to do deals today versus continuing to be more patient?
Mark Theine : Yeah, thanks, Nick. And I'll ask Jeff to respond.
Jeff Theiler : Hi, Nick. And so yeah, when you look at our current cost of capital, a shorter hand way to look at it is just kind of implied cap rate cost of long-term debt, which gets you to kind of like a mid-6, depending on what the day is mid mid to high-6. So that's why when we look at these deals, we're really trying to push a 7% cap rate. But importantly, we're also trying to improve the quality of the portfolio when we buy these assets. So we're really looking for kind of high credit assets, long-term leases, with great partners that we think we'll be able to, maintain that building for a very long period of time.  So that's kind of the short answer. The long answer is we do a 10-year IRR model and really are a little bit more scientific about it. But gets you to about the simplest.
Nick Joseph : Yeah, no, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then just in terms of providing capital for developments. How's the competition changed there? You've seen a pullback on banks, I would think you would be from construction lending. So does that actually open up even more of an opportunity than you'd seen previously?
Mark Theine : Yeah, if you, if you go back to the last quarter, I said, we had $300 million in the pipeline, we currently have over $500 million in discussions. And it is really construction debt at the banks has dried up the terms that didn't get it, the terms are more difficult, not only rate, but just covenants and collateral and thing is. It really bodes well for the opportunity to grow the kind of loan dome structure with health systems who are building these for outpatient medical services, moving care out of the inpatient facility into better locations that are demographics.  So we continue to see significant opportunities in that space.
Nick Joseph : Thanks. And as that pipeline grows, and sort of internal cap or any kind of any kind of internal risk mitigation that you put on just to not have too much exposure there. 
Mark Theine : Yeah, and one thing we've gotten more sophisticated with just internally and also in our negotiations is more kind of real time variability on both the construction period interest rates that we're charging plus what the ultimate yield will be on the back end of the once the project has stabilized and commences. So that kind of changes deal by deal. And then the location and the quality of the provider, et cetera. But I think we're doing a good job getting better returns out of our development financings and then mitigating then, both the interest rate time risk and the development risk.
Nick Joseph : Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Stroyeck from Green Street. Please go ahead.
Michael Stroyeck: Thanks. So one on pricing power for me. Just curious if you're seeing any bifurcation between the companies on campus and off-campus portfolios in terms of releasing spreads?
Mark Theine : Yeah, this is Mark, I'll take that. We're really are not seeing that much difference between on campus or off-campus. I think even going back to COVID, one of the things we saw was that there wasn't enough surgery center space off-campus, and we saw a lot of services moving to the off-campus setting. But really, what's driving our leasing spreads is the use of the comparable construction costs and relocating costs, and just with today's higher interest rates, and those higher construction cost, it's just much more expensive to move. And, we are able to negotiate higher spreads and still be less expensive than the cost to relocate.  So again, 7.8% leasing spread this quarter, is a trend that we think we can continue in the back half of the year as we work with tenants to renew space at a very high level.
Michael Stroyeck: Great, thanks. And then maybe one more. So despite some pretty high construction costs, we are still seeing some elevated AOB [ph] construction activity. Are there any pockets of your portfolio where you are becoming increasingly worried about new supply?
Mark Theine : Yeah, I don't think so. Most of the development is purpose-built, for a health system or physician group looking for newer in a better space in a better demographic location. So, Phoenix is hot, but it's hot -- and literally infinite. But the population is growing dramatically. So it's kind of matching up with the population needs that are there. And we don't see any, heavy construction heavy locations where there's not a population driver.  Atlanta's the same way as we have to [Indiscernible] project that we've already discussed. So it's good question, so that we monitor in our underwriting, but we're not seeing that in any of our markets.
Michael Stroyeck: Great, thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Yep. Thanks. Maybe this is a question for Jeff. I know after the term loan, your cash balance increased pretty significantly. What's the near term plans for that cash balance? Is that year marked for new investments or is there some debt pay downs that you want to utilize cash for to?
Jeff Theiler : Yeah, thanks, Mike. Tthe nice thing about our balance sheet is that we really don't have any more significant debt paid down. So we've really earmarked that cash for new acquisitions. And like I said, it's earning a kind of a nice yield in the short term, highly liquid money market account. So certainly feel good about the ability to deploy that, hopefully sooner rather than later. But in the meantime, it's not too much of a drag.
Michael Carroll: Okay, and then what's the preference for investment activity over the next six to 12 months? I know that you highlighted acquisitions developments, mez debt. I mean, where are the bigger opportunities right now?
Jeff Theiler : Well, the bigger opportunities are development, Mike. I mean, it's just -- but there's a long pipeline of acquisition opportunities. I wouldn't say in the market, but that were financed three and four and five years ago with 3%. Those loans are maturing now at 7%.  And we've only got a couple of opportunities where we're working with a current owner either refinancing or acquiring a facility like that. But we think there's a good pipeline of those opportunities that will come in mature eventually. So our preference is acquisitions always will be, at least for now. And that we find out the right price, the right quality, the right credit, but we're seeing more opportunities in the development.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And the cap rates that I've been hearing, I guess we're MOBs are trading at or at least higher quality. And MOBs is like in the low to mid-6 range. And I know JT, you're highlighting and just completed some deals at the seven. I guess what's different about the type of deals that you're looking at? Are these just more off-market relationship type deals that are getting you up into that 7% range?
John Thomas: Yeah, it's more off-market relationship deals. And it's also I think, just the reality of some, some owners are using all equity and kind of willing to accept negative leverage in anticipation of lower interest rates and compressing cap rates. We're not prepared to make that gamble. We don't think that's for us the appropriate way to invest.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And you would agree that the higher quality deals are trading in the low to mid-6s, I guess generally right now in the MOB space.
John Thomas: I would say there are some in that range. Again, we were we're focused on our cost of capital and the higher quality off market transactions. 
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you. 
John Thomas: Thanks, Mike. 
Operator: Next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Generally a couple of few earnings calls here simultaneously, but obviously the with the same store cash NOI growth slowing down a little bit. Just curious to get a little more color around what's happening there. And if you look at it sequentially, everything looks like there's really no change at all. But really, it's just it's more of the year-over-year there was just some deceleration in that same store pool. Some of the growth what do you have sequentially, year-over-year growth last quarter.  But just not sure there was still kind of that unique, single location situation that's still hitting the results, but just curious to get more color around all that. Thanks. 
John Thomas: Yeah. Hi. I'll have our give you a little more color, but it's we really do think we've hit a trial there. And again, it's still a kind of quarter-over-quarter with an intentional non-renewal last year and then a non-renewal but tuck-in where they cut some space back at the beginning of the year, which had a quarter-over-quarter continued impact, but we do think this quarter is a trough and kind of with leases, both commencing and being executed in the near term and net absorption, we're headed in the right direction, Mark do you want to add anything?
Mark Theine : Yeah. So, Steven, so sure, I have a lot here. First of all, again, our leasing team did a great job growing cash leasing spreads and 7.8%. So from a renewal perspective, we're growing our cash flow there.  Our same store performance was really the result of a change in occupancy, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks to 94.4% from 95%. So still a very highly occupied portfolio that performing well.  But to give a little more context to that 60 basis point decline and as you mentioned some unique kind of one-off things happen in there. That declines about 90,000 square feet, nearly half of which is that Cancer Center that we talked about last quarter. And during this quarter, we actually executed 5,600 square foot lease in that facility and have had good tours and momentum to fill up that facility.  And then as JT mentioned, one of the things that's going to offset that Cancer Center facility is the Minnesota Surgery Center that we talked about in the past. That was a 22,000 square foot surgery center that really for the last year has been in negotiation and under construction. And it'll start commencing rent payments here in the third quarter of 2023.  So just zooming back out to the high level here, we have a leasing environment, the macro environment that's working in our favor. As I mentioned, our leasing leads are up. Our tours are up, but more importantly, our proposals on vacant space are up. So bottom line is the cash NOI is growing. It's just not growing at our historical pace. But as JT said, we think this is the trough and we'll be moving in the right direction the back half of the year here.
Steven Valiquette : Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Ronald Camden from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Camden : Hey, just a couple quick ones for me. So going back to sort of the capital allocation, so one on the acquisition front, obviously, not seeing enough deals and leaning more towards some of these development. Any way to sort of quantify what that run-rate could be sort of on a long-term basis? Like, is there $100 million-$200 million of opportunities as you're building out these relationships? Just how can we get some more sort of hard numbers around that?
Mark Theine : Yeah, so for the development pipeline, I think a good run rate for us is going to be -- again, these projects are still in formative stages. So we're -- we want to be careful not to get too ahead of ourselves. But certainly $100 million to $$200 million as a pipeline, I think is achievable in a reasonable period of time.  At some point, maybe we'd start limiting the size of that pipeline based on the overall size of the company, but I think we've got a pretty good runway to get there. So that's kind of the short term plan.
John Thomas: Yeah. I think part of that is like, right now we have more opportunities in there. And I think that is we'll get kind of a continuous cycle of those facilities coming online, starting commencing, and as new buildings are coming online and stabilized paying rent, we'll start new constructions as well. So, again, we're really working to build up that kind of continuous cycle there. And so good opportunity to do that.
Ronald Camden : Right. And then just my last one. And maybe you touched on this earlier, but just on the MOB, same store cast NOI, maybe can you remind us, what are some of the sort of the one time things are impacting sort of that 80 basis points year-over-year number? And what -- when does that sort of clear up so you can get back to sort of the 2% to 3% range? Hopefully that makes sense.
John Thomas: Yeah, I think Mark just addressed that. But again, just to repeat, it's really kind of three events, two intentional and one were tended to cut back some space. And we're already in the process of backfilling that space with a lot of tours. And they partially lease some of that space already.  So second half of the year, we'll start seeing the benefits of those. But the non-renewed leases that we did intentionally one of those that surgery center that is now come online, it's been accredited, and is starting to treat patients and paying rent in this quarter. So we'll start seeing the benefits of all that. It's really two or three events out of 300 buildings.
Ronald Camden : Got it. All right, thanks so much. Super helpful.
John Thomas: Yep. 
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Fagwin [ph] from Baird. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is kind of quick, how much rent is expected to commence in the second half of this year?
Mark Theine : This is Mark. So in total, we have about 34,000 square feet of leases that are executed under construction. And will commence in the back half of the year that was executed. So if you took an average of $20, and a triple net rent and $10 of operating expenses, that's close to a million dollars. But it'll be staggered throughout the back half of the year, but a decent run rate, what's actually executed. And then of course, as I said, we've got a very active pipeline of leasing activity beyond that. It'll take a little time to work through that as we negotiate the construction commenced rent that that's cashflow that'll start in the back half of or -- near the end of 2023 and into 2024.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. You mentioned with the new embedded escalators been able to achieve on average 3% and even some 4% can you remind me what the weighted average escalators embedded in the entire portfolio is?
Mark Theine : Yeah, it's historically about 2.5%. But every one of these, new leases is being in the last few quarters has been higher than that. So it's going to just take time to grow the average, but you're heading in the right direction. So if we can maintain these type of renewals spreads and kind of the new market for leasing accelerators, we think we're headed to headed toward a 3% world, but it's going to take several years to get there. And hopefully more.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. Thank you, guys. 
Operator: The next question comes from Connor Siversky from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. [Indiscernible] on for Connor, today. Thanks for taking the question. In terms of the competition for assets, do you guys still see a lot of activity from foreign capital or have those entities move to the sidelines and potentially offering more opportunities for Physicians group?
Jeff Theiler : You know, I'd say it slowed down but we do still see foreign capital in the market, both directly and indirectly through other private equity tab shops or directly from foreign pension funds. We're in a JV with the foreign capital. And I think they continue to like the space as well, along with Remedy and Cain Anderson [ph].  So I'd say we've seen a slowdown, really in transaction activity, as in trade some cap rates kind of rationalize, but we do we do have like in our Beauford [ph] project with Physicians co-investors in that project with us to the tune of about $11 million and straight equity into that deal. So it's -- we still see a lot of interest in Physicians wanting to co-invest or remain part owners in investments we make.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And can you offer any color as to how much the portfolio is utilized by admin or mathematical functions, like the revenue cycle for example? Do you get that leases? Go ahead.
Jeff Theiler : Go ahead. Ask question. 
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, I was just going to say, do you get the sense that lease sizes could decrease as leases kind of roll over and the company utilizes those hybrid structures?
Jeff Theiler : Yeah. So we do have a very small percentage of space that is would be kind of general administrative space. Two have our redevelopment projects are, we're in deep discussions with clinical providers to -- they're still leased. They're still frankly leased for many years in their existing form. But we're in discussions with clinical providers to convert those buildings to clinical space. And frankly, we're really excited about those opportunities.  And then when projects in our pipeline would be an acquisition of a suburban office building, and again to convert it to medical use as well.  So we see a lot of great opportunity there in our own space in our own buildings. We have a small percentage, well-leased while being paid. But at the same time, we'd like others would like to see that convert to clinical office space over time.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Gorman from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Michael Gorman: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, JT, maybe kind of continuing off of what you just mentioned there, how do we contextualize the opportunity set that you have with some of these redevelopments. And I understand its purpose built versus the risk of kind of new supply? And I know, we talked about that earlier, but just maybe less disciplined operators than yourselves just taking suburban office portfolios or vacant big boxes and trying to just slap an MOB label on them and jump into the marketplace? What's the potential risk there?
John Thomas: Yeah, I don't. I mean, I don't think there's a lot of spec development in medical. We just haven't seen that since the crash in 2008-2009. And all the redevelopments that whole pipeline we're talking about. We have a provider in hand or a healthcare credit in hand working with us to do that conversion to clinical space. So it's, I don't see. I mean, it's well publicized how many malls are we saw that this week in The Wall Street Journal as well, Pebble says how many malls are in distress and how many, general office buildings are 20%, occupied, even if leased but the development and redevelopment projects we're looking at which are pretty sizable, have a provider and or a healthcare credit. We're working hand in hand to sign with the providers, to insert those buildings. And that's -- we wouldn't be contractually committed until we had those leases and that credit enhances.
Michael Gorman: Great, that's helpful. And then you started out the comments, obviously highlighting 10 years as a public company, which is great. And then it was just reminded me that one of the things that you focused on when you first came out was exploiting kind of a risk return gap in the MLB [ph] marketplace that you saw.  I'm curious. I know, there's not a lot of transaction volume. But as we've seen the capital markets and the transaction markets get more stressed, are you seeing any kind of risk reward gaps, that would be more interesting to you, whether it's a particular physician group type, or whether it's a particular geography that as the markets get better, they're likely to generate more deal volume for you?
John Thomas: Yeah, I think I alluded to this before. I mean, there's, there's a lot of what I would call distressed capital, ownership, but not distressed buildings. And that's what we're really trying to preserve dry powder at the right price, to capitalize on and to grow substantially again. Hopefully some more that materialized second half of the year. We do think 2024's still going to be a robust year for those kinds of opportunities.  We're starting to see those, I'd say anecdotally, in the context of one building or two buildings at a time, we're not seeing, huge numbers of those kinds of discussions going on. But the list is out there. It's pretty obvious, where those kinds of buildings, those kind of interest rate structures or loan structures that were in place that are maturing into a very new environment. And Jeff's done a great job with our balance sheet to remove that type of risk for us and position as well to step in and be owner and/or mez lender of choice to help refinance those buildings or acquire those buildings. 
Michael Gorman: Got it. So it's more on the ownership side than on the actual building side where you see that differentiation? 
John Thomas: Yeah, I think it's both. We're really not value add buyers, I mean, with these redevelopments, I'm talking about are empty buildings today, or leased buildings today that we would be converting with a provider in hand with a lease in hand to clinical. Yeah, but we would be looking for high quality buildings, high quality tenants with a broken capital structure.  And Mike, yeah, I have remind you, being with us from the very beginning that the hospital -- the loan was that was paid off, we really sold that three years ago, I think. But that was the very first acquisition we made with our IPO proceeds. So we kind of did a full 10 year round trip at that moment, and got better than 10% IRR on it, and worked out well for us. So…
Michael Gorman: I remember it well. Absolutely. 
John Thomas: So thanks for being with us, and look we'll go to the next caller.
Michael Gorman: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Miller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Mike Miller : Yeah. Hi, just a quick one here. For the CVA acquisition, just curious why your partner wanted to have a 1% stake in the JV.
John Thomas: Yeah, it was the existing owner and liked the returns of the buildings that -- developed that building with the Physician Group. It's a great partner we are looking at other opportunities with and I would -- I'd say it's more than an accommodation. It was just an interest that he had, and his group had an interest in maintaining that interest. And we're already -- and he's really point on helping us fill up the last 10% of that space. And we have a good leasing pipeline there as well. So pretty simple, this relationship. 
Mike Miller : Okay, that was it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, and good morning. Just curious on the incremental developments you added to the backlog? Are you seeing any increase on yields for those deals? Or is 7% to 8% still the right range?
John Thomas: I think I we're seeing an increase. The 7% to 8% is with the first year kind of stabilized yield, about 7% is kind of what we're kind of seeing in the current market. There is some competition in the general market for some of these developments. But at the same time, these are 100% pre-leased buildings, trying to mitigating risk and same time getting long term leases with good escalator.  So we're pushing to, kind of risk adjusted returns 7% to 8%, where we see the market. At some point, you get to a point where the rent is too high for the provider to make for it to make sense or for us to make sense for us. So balance.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. That's helpful. And then Mark, I believe he said 34,000 square feet of executed leases commencing in the back half the year. I think that figure previously was in the 58,000 square feet. So just wanted to clarify, is it safe to assume that the delta there is just what commenced in the second quarter?
Mark Theine: Yeah, that's exactly right. That's primarily that surgery center in Minnesota. So yeah, that's exactly right.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Understood. And then as the tenants take occupancy in the back half and we continue to see positive net absorption how do we think about the expense benefit and sort of that operating leverage moving forward?
Mark Theine: Yeah, that's a great point. It's not just the base rent, that we'll pick up when we improve our occupancy from those leases. But it's also the drag in operating expenses from the CAM [ph] reimbursement. CAM and buildings averaging $12 $13. So it's the pickup of both the base rent and the CAM, which will improve our margins as occupancy improves as well. 
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. Thanks for the time.
John Thomas: Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Thomas for any closing remarks. 
John Thomas: Thank you, Jason. We appreciate everybody's interest today and the questions. We'll look forward to follow up discussions. Please call us if you have any questions. Thank you. 
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Page, SVP, General Counsel. Please go ahead.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Physicians Realty Trust provides real estate capital to healthcare providers that specialize in outpatient medical services. We provide this capital in a number of ways. We acquire outpatient medical real estate designed to facilitate surgery, oncology, and other specialty services required by patients in high demand and the physician patient encounters ancillary to these medical services. We financed the development of these types of buildings. And we finance the transformation of buildings that may have become out of date as is, but provide a low cost option for transforming to host these medical services and meet the demands of our growinG&Aging US population. Our facilities and providers we partner with around the country provide accessed care for the entire population in the markets where we are located, not just the finite small percentage of seniors that can pay for and want senior housing. For years, the fundamental case for owning outpatient medical facilities has been strong, but is now stronger than ever. First, healthcare providers benefit from undeniable demographic tailwinds currently and that will dramatically increase demand for services in both the near and long-term. Second, due to Medicare's Progressive Payment System and Part C modernization, providers are incentivized to provide care at the lowest possible cost consistent with the clinical science available at the time to treat the patient safely and effectively. Third, current expense pressures are temporary and correctable. These pressures are caused by the unique combination of real time inflation and backward looking payer revenue rates that are set based on past costs rather than current or future expected costs. Each of these factors incentivizes health systems to move patients out of the inpatient hospital setting and into newer, lower cost outpatient sites of care as a means of improving their margin on services provided. These trends have been known and visible for years and have only accelerated in the post-COVID world. Time and time again, buildings hosting outpatient medical services have proven to be resilient and an essential class of real estate. When one of our clients chooses to reduce their space at the end of their lease, is not due to a top -- it is not due to a desire to work from home, the result of slowing demand or a consequence of a rapid rise in interest rates. Rather, our non-renewals are driven by unique and specific situations like physician retirements or a change in practice ownership. These are not structural trends or challenges. Our real estate is necessary for physicians and health systems to deliver their mission to meet ever increasing demand. Unlike other real estate asset classes faced with declining demand for space. Revenue from outpatient medical services grew 8% in 2022, in comparison inpatient revenues experienced no growth. High construction costs and the limited supply growth have allowed us to meaningfully increase rental rates in most markets and we expect to see that trend continue. The opportunity for new acquisition investments remains low for now as private investors make short-term wages on medical office cap rates returning to 2020 levels even at the cost of negative leverage. We believe that patience is a virtue and we will benefit from outsized growth and acquisition opportunities with our dry powder when market cap rates and the long-term cost of capital reach equilibrium. We do see a growing number of opportunities to finance new outpatient medical investments in our active pipeline in discussions now exceeds $300 million. We're proud of the two projects we started this past quarter, including our first on balance sheet development and expect to start several new projects later this year. We're excited to share that we've executed contractual commitments related to a $40 million medical office development located in the high growth at Atlanta Server of Beaufort Georgia. The 97,000 square foot outpatient medical facility, which includes an ambulatory surgery center, is 100% pre-leased on 10-year triple net lease terms with 91% leased directly to Northside Hospital, an investment-grade quality health system. The site also allows for an additional 100,000 square foot medical facility in the future, where we will have the development rights to build. Northside Hospital and affiliated physicians have executed leases based on a 6.2% yield on cost to deliver the project with 3% risk escalators on all lease agreements. Physicians that lease space and provide services in the building have contributed 44 some of the capital to develop this building. This investment increases our long standing partnership with Northside Hospital and is a direct reflection of DOC's strong relationships with health systems, we want to work with a long-term partner who knows healthcare first. Before our next earnings call, we will celebrate the 10th anniversary of an of our initial public offering. We appreciate your support, the support of all the families that work for and with DOC, and the investment-grade credit and high quality providers that partner with us meet the healthcare needs and the communities we serve. We look forward to the next 10 years and beyond. We believe we have the highest occupancy, the best balance sheet, and the best strategy for outsized growth well into the next 10 years and beyond. Quarter one was uneventful until we lost George Chapman, who passed away unexpectedly and well before his time. George made Healthcare REIT the powerhouse that it is today. I can't count the number of senior executives and professionals at public and private REITs and otherwise, that owe their careers to George's inspiration and mentorship. I can name at least three public REIT CEOs who are our stewards and direct beneficiaries of George's leadership. But more important than all the financial and business success, George was motivated most by his love for his family, Toledo, The Art, Cornell [ph] and the University of Toledo and taking care of seniors in advancing access to healthcare services for all regardless of their ability to pay. I believe George is looking down on all of us asking us how we are going to work to expand access to care to all, expanding senior housing to more, and providing professional opportunities to the youth of Toledo and everywhere to meet these objectives. George, we miss you . We at DOC are committed to your passion and mission. Jeff will now share comments on our financial results of Q1 2023 and Mark will discuss our operating results. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2023, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $60.3 million or $0.24 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $59.7 million, an increase of 3% over the comparable quarter of last year and our FAD per share was $0.24. The portfolio showed consistent operations with same-store NOI across our entire MOB portfolio increasing at 1.0%. This is below our long-term expectations for the portfolio. As we've discussed over the past two quarters, we anticipate this metric returning to our long-term expectations in the back half of the year as our repositioning properties start to roll back online. Our renewal spreads for the full MOB portfolio were negative 0.7% as one renewal had an outsized effect on an otherwise strong period of lease. Despite this, we still anticipate averaging positive mid-single-digit leasing spreads over the entire year, in line with our previous guidance. Across the portfolio, we continue to see evidence that our existing rents are under the current market rates, which allows for additional pricing power on new and renewal leases. Additionally, the historic rise in construction costs and uncertainty in asset pricing have been significant hurdles for new medical office development. Which we believe will enhance our ability to retain tenants. On the acquisitions front, we are starting to deploy capital, but in a careful manner. Our new investments have been concentrated on development projects with healthcare partners that have been in planning for multiple years. Encouragingly, the acquisition pipeline that we are actively negotiating has picked up significantly since the beginning of the year. We believe this will enable us to generate accretive external growth in the second half of the year. In order to reduce debt, existing debt and allow ourselves to be prepared for these future opportunities. We strengthened the balance sheet with $66 million of equity issued on the ATM in the beginning of the first quarter. We had previously disclosed this activity on our last earnings call. We feel that we are in an excellent position from a capital perspective at 5.3 times consolidated debt to EBITDA. Finally, we remain on track for our overall G&A guidance. A quick reminder to our analysts and investors that our G&A is always seasonally higher in the first quarter and we expect it to moderate going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk through some additional operational details. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks Jeff. To best capitalize on the opportunity we have within our portfolio, we are occasionally better served by transitioning space from 1 physician organization to another. These decisions are made to improve the overall financial health and value of our buildings over the long-term, but generally have a short-term impact on our net operating income. Among other benefits, these strategic efforts have served to dramatically improve the credit profile of our portfolio. This is especially relevant in today's environment where higher operating expenses are offsetting revenue gains for health systems. DOC's portfolio remains well-insulated from these pressures by the underlying credit quality of our tenants, 67% of which are investment grade quality. Better yet, 90% of our investment-grade tenants have a credit rating of A minus or higher. This means that these tenants would need to be downgraded several times before they could potentially lose their investment-grade status. Our commitment to credit quality remains unmatched by our peers and we believe this strategy will pay dividends for our shareholders in any economic environment. MOB same-store NOI growth was 1% during the quarter, our 20th consecutive quarter of positive same-store growth. Headline performance in the period was adversely affected by a unique situation at a single location in our portfolio. Specifically, our asset management team was faced with a physician group tenant that had a reduced need for real estate and an in place plan to consolidate locations. We made the decision to move aggressively to retain at least part of their space in our building as a means of preserving the healthcare ecosystem of the asset, and we are already in discussions with several potential providers to lease space not renewed by this tenant. Overall, this asset represents less than 1% of the same-store pool. Conversely, the 14 building landmark portfolio joined the same-store pool this quarter. As expected from such a high quality portfolio, occupancy is up 50 basis points since our acquisition and the portfolio grew cash NOI by 4.1% year-over-year. In total, the portfolio is exceeding our underwriting expectations and is representative of the quality facilities and tenant at the center of DOC's investment criteria. First quarter renewal spreads were impacted by the same scenario I just discussed during our same-store commentary with headline spreads totaling negative 0.7%. Excluding this one asset, renewal spreads for the quarter were positive 10.1%. In total, our leasing team completed 367,000 square feet of leasing activity this quarter including 289,000 square feet of lease renewals and a 72% retention rate. The great work this quarter by our leasing team to reprice lease renewals at today's fair market value with a 10.1% leasing spread should not be overlooked by one lease. Additionally, this leasing activity offers strong compounding growth for the future as approximately 60% lease assigned this quarter contain annual rent escalations of 3% or more. Looking back to the 2018 to 2021 time period, only 25% of our leasing activity on average contained annual rent escalations of 3% or more. Despite the short-term impact of a few vacancies in the portfolio, we believe the long-term value opportunity for our portfolio is fully intact as outpatient services drive retention and market pressures continue to increase triple net rental rates. Our team is focused on unlocking the full value of our portfolio through aggressive leasing initiatives, exceptional property management and smart capital improvement investments. Before turning the call back to JT and opening for questions, I'd like to quickly say congratulations to John Sweet, the Founder of DOC for earning the 2022 Lifetime Award from Healthcare Real Estate Insights. The award was presented in January at the Revista Medical Real Estate Investment Forum. John has always been known by hospital executives, brokers, developers, and investors for his witty sense of humor, unwavering integrity, and creativity in structuring investment transactions. As we celebrate the company's 10th anniversary this July, we cannot be happier to honor John for his career and contributions to the medical office industry, and we recognize as mentorship and friendship to all of us at DOC. Congratulations, John. With that, I'll turn the call back over to JT.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Jeff. We'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey, good morning, everybody. Guys you've spoken about sort of stable occupancy previously in the first half and headwinds abating in the back half of the year. But clearly there was an impact from this one tenant you highlighted in your prepared remarks. I'm just curious how that changes the cadence for occupancy comps in the first half and even back half the year relative to those prior expectations?
Mark Theine: Hey, good morning Austin. Its Mark Theine. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our leasing statistics were outsized by this one tenant, but our portfolio we're really starting from a position of strength with industry leading 95% occupancy. Over the history of our company, we've always been in that 95% occupancy range. So, we are experiencing a couple of one or two kind of moveouts and normal churn of the portfolio. But long-term, our occupancy has always been around 95%. We've been well served by our triple net leases, high occupancy, especially in this inflationary environment.
Austin Wurschmidt: So, within the same-store pool, when do you think full occupancy you've said is 95%, 96%. When do you the same-store pool gets back to within that range?
Mark Theine: Yes. So, again, we feel very confident in our comments about the improvements in the back half of the year. Really pointing to that, we do have 58,000 square feet of leases signed that are under construction and we expect rent commencement in the back half of the year. So, as those leases start to come on, we'll recognize them in our occupancy and obviously, our rent growth. So, that'll get us more in line with our expectations of the 2% to 3% same-store growth in the back half of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for that. And then just last one for me on the investment pipeline, you highlighted that acquisitions have picked up since earlier this year. I'm just curious if you could put a finer point on sort of the size of that pipeline, where bid ask spreads are today, whether they've narrowed to a level that you think makes sense for you to transact?
John Thomas: Yes. Awesome. Thanks it's JT. It's still modest on the acquisition front. We do have some growing pipeline. There's some activity out in the market. There's still private buyers in particular in in the low sixes range, we'd like to be higher in the sixes and up into the seven cap rate, but without jeopardizing quality or the credit quality or the quality of the facility. So, we'll see some activity pickup and we can expect more to come to market. Working with some health systems, looking at some potential monetizations there, So, we're excited about that. The real pipeline is on the development front and just working through kind of final documentation and pricing of those transactions.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria, BMO Capital Markets.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Just hoping to expound on that last piece about the development funding. It seems like the deals you've done recently are in in the low sixes. Is that a good bogey for development capital, giving your comments about where traditional acquisitions are? How should we think about that development capital mentioned $300 million opportunities that going forward?
John Thomas: Yes, Juan, we -- those get price too well in advance of actual construction starts. And the Beaufort project has with the 3% bumps, the quality of the location. Our IRR on that facility is much closer to 8.5% to 9% So, we'd like it to be higher when we start on that particular, but it's still a fantastic project. The second project is not priced and we would price it at a different rate today in the current market. At the time, we were negotiating through that and we'll be purchase acquisition rates for in the low 5. So, it's just -- it's obviously a timing thing with that and we're looking at different ways to think about that and the long-term commitments we make there. So, development starts, the things we're negotiating now are in the high sixes, low sevens, from a current yield because most projects we do are on a -- kind of loan down or more of a construction loan project and those are in the high sixes to low sevens if we were pricing them today.
Juan Sanabria: Great. And then just curious on any dispositions you guys have targeted. You had a kind of a small one done in in the first quarter? Any other opportunities? And if you can give us any color on the cap rate on that small piece that was sold off in the first quarter?
John Thomas: Yes, I'll speak about dispositions and ask Mark to give you some more specific details. We don't have a meaningful disposition strategy for this year. Opportunistically, we may sell a building here or there. We have we own 300 -- almost 300 buildings. So, there's always a handful in the in the portfolio that are older, smaller, in different markets where we're not strategically growing. So, from time-to-time, we may strategically dispose of something, but nothing specific. No material plans. Mark, do you want about this?
Mark Theine: Yes. Juan on the more specifics on just the one small asset we sold in the quarter was That building was originally acquired in the early life at DOC as part of a five building portfolio. This is the one building that was not as strategic in the existing tenant in the building as if they could purchase the building from us. The cap rate on that was actually just below 4. But again, very small building and what's more representative of our disposition strategy is what we completed last year with Great Falls. We had an we had an amazing exit with a great partner there in Great Falls and redeployed that capital accretively.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks guys.
John Thomas: Thanks Juan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley.
Derrick Metzler: Hi, this is Derrick Metzler on for Ron. Thanks for the question. So, curious about the one asset that dragged down same-store NOI. Could you provide any more color on the impact that it had given your comment that it was a relatively small asset?
Mark Theine: Yes. This is Mark. I'll take that one again. So, start with the fact, again, this is our 20th consecutive quarter of same-positive same-store NOI growth. And we currently we don't have a redevelopment or repositioning bucket, we report on all of our properties. So, as I mentioned last quarter, you know, we were expecting same-store to have a little bit slower start, but picking up in the back half of the year. And this one building in particular was a 110,000 square foot cancer center. We acquired in 2014 at a 7 cap and for nine years, they paid their rent on time every month. And we -- through our relationship with them, became aware of their plans to consolidate their office space and really reduce their square footage by about 50%. Some of which was admin space, some of which is clinical space, but the direct impact from this one tenant on same-store this quarter is 73 basis points same-store. So, our one would have been 1.73 excluding this building, and it had a 30 basis point impact on our occupancy year-over-year. So, just to help kind of contextualize this a little bit more, $200,000 in our same-store pool out of $82 million of cash NOI moves same-store 25 basis points. So, it doesn't take a lot of cash flow to really move same-store percentage quarter-over-quarter. So, again, what I said before, what gives us confidence in the back half of the year is the lease assigned that are under construction and we'll commence in the back half of the year. Our target for increasing our occupancy there is really our investment-grade hospital systems that are existing in the buildings and we're working closer with them to continue to expand.
Derrick Metzler: Understood. I appreciate that. I guess the follow-up is have you identified any more tenants that are potentially at risk for reducing their space similarly?
Mark Theine: No. Nothing, nothing to this size.
Derrick Metzler: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. JT, I wanted to touch on the private investment market. I know last quarter you highlighted that cap rates were in the mid-sixes trending upwards towards 7. But today, you highlighted that the private market bid is aggressive and maybe those cap rates are in the low 6 today. Are you surprised by the strong private bid and how it has not changed as quickly as you would have expected?
John Thomas: Yes. It's really trying to understand how that is -- how they're making the math work on those projects and talking to some of those private buyers. They have some all equity with low returned expectations. There's not a lot of bank financing. I wouldn't say there's high volume of those transactions, but there are people out in the market kind of high fives, low sixes. So, I don't think that's reflective of what the current value is. It's more of a reflection of people with buckets of capital, they're willing to take a bet that interest rates decline next year and cap rates go back to the 5s. I think that's kind of the simple math they're doing. We are active acquisition pipeline. It's in the high 6s as low 7s. We don't have a lot of volume in those numbers, but we do have good discussions in place.
Michael Carroll: Okay. So, it's your active pipeline right now. You do have sellers that are contemplating on selling at those at those high 6 levels?
John Thomas: Yes.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then on the Northside development, when was that agreement reached? I guess, I was surprised that that cap rate was fairly low. I mean, even at that cap rate, is it accretive to you? Or are you guys -- is that deal kind of expecting that you need interest rates to drop for that to kind of drive some accretion?
John Thomas: No. We the -- it's got 3% bumps. Again, about half the equity is coming from the physicians that are leasing the building. They've already written those checks. So, we've got this advanced funding from last year. It's really early of last year mid spring kind of discussion around the pricing at the time, 6.2% was much higher than acquisition cap rates and time. So, we -- again, the development is not a spot financing production. So, it's -- we were pricing it today. It would be higher. Our long-term IRR on that project, Mike, is still in the mid 8% to 9% and that's without executing another transaction changing cap rates or interest rates in the future. So, we feel good about it. We'd price it higher today if we could, but we're still going to make money on the project.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then why did you like to do that project on an on-balance sheet development. I know historically you've been more doing these construction loans. So, I guess why is that project different?
John Thomas: There's some unique circumstances with Northside and its location. They own the land. So it's on our ground lease. They have they have the second building's already designed and we think there's leasing demand to move forward with that project in the next year and that one will price again based upon kind of current pricing at the time. But and it would be priced differently if we were starting it today. But it's worth that ask for us to build it on balance sheet again for some unique circumstances. The tenant base is partly their employees, partly affiliated positions that aren't employed by them. A combination of, health care compliance and Northside their own balance sheet management. So we're excited to do it. We're working with RTG as the developer on that project to we who we partnered with before. They do a great job and have done a great job getting the billing to a 100% pre-leasing before we started funding it.
Michael Carroll: Okay. So then this is more of a unique situation. We shouldn't expect future ground up development fund balance sheet?
Mark Theine: I think you I think you'll see some, but our preference is the loan down where we're getting current construction loan yield and have more optionality on the back end to -- on the -- on potential of an acquisition. But you may see it from time to time. But, we're excited to do it and expand our relationship. It's a great market. Atlanta is still, very high.
Michael Carroll: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi.
Michael Griffin: Great. Thanks. Maybe to start off with the capital allocation kind of strategy high level, piggybacking off the previous Mike's question. I think you've talked about in the past about, solid balance sheet, a strategy for outsized growth. I mean, I'm curious maybe if you can elaborate JT on where this growth is coming from, And probably the capital question for Jeff, why put capital out today? Would joint ventures make sense? You talked about the development funding a minute ago. So any commentary on that would be helpful?
John Thomas: Yes. You know, beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, as interest rates were, you know, rising dramatically and fast and cap rates on acquisitions was not keeping up with that and still hasn't really reached equilibrium. We've been very modest on acquisitions. Not even a lot of builders trying to continue discussions we've walked away from opportunities where they were very attractive 18 months ago that aren't attractive or aren't as attractive today. Many sellers are just holding firm and hoping that interest rates decline and the cap rates improve from their perspectives next year. So we don't expect a lot of acquisition opportunity this year. The development pipeline, again, those are usually two years of construction projects and we can get outsized deals there. But you do take some capital risk and you do take some modest development risk, which we don't think we're taking any there because of the getting to 100 percent pre-leasing with investment grade quality tenants like the Northside project. So, I think those are mitigate over time that $300 million pipeline we're talking about, much of which won't even price or get started into a later in the year. So, again, it's a balance and forward looking projection if best we can about how to, how to price those projects. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. A little bit on the capital side. So, obviously, we reduced our leverage a little bit in the face of rising interest rates. And to try to build up some capacity in dry powder to take advantage of acquisitions and development opportunities. So we, we issued some stock around $15 per share. So that's kind of a, it's called 6.4% 6.5% implied cap rate. We feel confident that when we -- we redeploy those proceeds, we'll be getting, yields in excess of that. So I think we can we can utilize the capital that we raised accretively in the back half of the year. And again as JT has talked about, it's a little bit market dependent. On how fast we can get that out the door. But we feel like we're in a good position to do so.
Michael Griffin: Thanks for that, Jeff. I appreciate the additional disclosure on the release about the ATM issuance. I double checked with the prior quarter one, and so it wasn't any new news. So appreciate that. And then maybe one for Mark, just on the leasing side of thing. I think the lease percentage ticked down a little bit in the quarter, but it's still pretty high at around 95%. How are you kind of incorporating this into expectations around leasing occupancy growth this year and the ultimate impact on same-store? Thank you.
Mark Theine: Yes. Definitely. Take that. So on leasing as you just mentioned. And, again, we're starting 95% occupancy. So full -- but one thing we're doing -- actually two things we're doing a little differently right now. One is we're more proactively investing CapEx dollars into some of the vacancies. To make sure that spaces are ready available for lease immediately, but we're not, caught with supply chain challenges, anything like that. So we're being very proactive with our CapEx dollars to have spaces that are show ready. And then second, our leasing team this year has done a great job and it mentions on the first last earnings call that we've really increased our online marketing efforts and our broker outreach to enhance communication and really market those vacancies online and with some new virtual reality technology and online tours. So it's definitely a focus of our entire team to improve occupancy throughout the year.
Michael Griffin: Great. Thanks. That's it for me. And as an Atlanta native, just wanted to say I have to check out the new properties next time I'm back in my back there. Thanks.
John Thomas: Yes. We'd love to take you for a tour.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I know you talked touched on the landmark portfolio briefly in your prepared remarks. So I apologize I missed this data point, but could you quantify what type of lift the Landmark portfolio had on the same-store NOI growth in the quarter?
Mark Theine: Hey, John. This is Mark again. So first, welcome to the DOC call. Great to have you here. We appreciate the support from Green Street. Landmark, it's -- about 1.4 million square feet out of our 15 million square foot, 50.2 million square foot same store portfolio. So, while great results there just based upon the, overall size of the same store portfolio, it doesn't have outsized impact on our same store results. But those properties alone right there, 4.1% from the same store is a result of some increased occupancy and done a really good job. The landmark portfolio itself is 11% percent of the same store pool so year over year again, 4.1% percent growth there.
John Pawlowski: Okay. So I know, a portfolio, there's always it is, so graphic moving pieces. But instead they exclude the one property that had a large decline and renewal spreads, it sounds like that was a 70 bps drag, but landmark was a positive. So it feels like if you exclude those two pieces, the rest of the same store is kind of stuck in the low 1% analog NOI growth range. So if you looked through the portfolio. Is there any other concerning trends that's best to take a while longer to get back to that historical growth profile?
Mark Theine: Yes, John. So the one thing I would add to what you just said, you're starting to build on it correctly with the excluding Zingmister [ph]. But the one thing I'd add is, again, is the 58,000 square feet of leases that are already signed and under construction. Once those come online on a run rate basis, they'll add to approximately $400,000 of NOI a quarter. So that will continue to help build our same store and that could be another 40, 50 basis points there just from leases that are already signed. So again, that's on a run rate basis. They'll come online throughout the -- the back half of the year, not all at the same time, obviously, but throughout the back half of the year. And, that's what gives us confidence that we'll be rebounding into our more historical range of 2% to 3%.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me, just on the development app test development. And so I understand the lag at when deals are priced versus when you're actually committing capital. Just curious, John, why not walk away or re-price the economics of the $41 million construction start if the world changes Just curious why you're kind of anchoring the pricing a year ago?
John Thomas: Yes. John, there's we have a core value called CARE, where we collaborate, communicate, act with their integrity. We respect the relationships and we execute consistently. We've built this company for 10 years by being reliable with our health partners and we do re-price. We have re-priced where we have the opportunity. Again, we are in the I8 on an IRR basis on this transaction, 6.2 is the first year yield that grows 3% a year within, primarily an investment grade health system, and we'll have the opportunity to expand this campus by another 100,000 feet in the near future. So we don't see it as a as a project you walk away from. We see as a project you work with your partner and get to the finish line where you can. Other projects we've done exactly what you suggested. We've walked away from purchase options that again where we have the optionality and that's kind of the preferential way we like to do the development projects. So each situation, stands on its own merits and circumstances.
John Pawlowski: All right. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Miller with JPMorgan.
Mike Miller: Yes. Hi. Just a quick one. On the construction loan, the $35 million construction loan, looks like that's tied to a project with a renovation attached to it for surgery center, and it looks like you're planning to take that out in the back half of the year. What's the cost of that that you'll be acquiring, and then does that effectively just kind a come out of the loan balance? Is that the way to think of it?
John Thomas : No, it's a small part of the total project. The ASC, which is the first step of the redevelopment of that location with Emery is it's cap rates in the high. It's been closer to an eight, but we're committing capital to redevelop that. So, ultimate yield on that's in the sevens. And then the construction project is a separate loan, and then it's priced at 6.75% 6.8%. And then we have optionality whether to purchase that building on the back end and we'll evaluate to John's point a minute ago, evaluate the value of that purchase option at the time of execution or walk away from it or try to reprice it. So it's a small piece, the ASC piece. It's nice yielding with a small $4 million or $5 million acquisition, and then we've committed capital to renovate and improve that billing.
Mike Miller : Got it. Okay. It clears it up. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.
Tayo Okusanya : Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. In regards to the space, you guys are kind of strategically holding back for the kind of "right tenant". Could you just kind of talk us through a little bit about kind of what that total square footage is? What kind of rents you're ultimately kind of expecting on that space? And kind of earnings contribution once all that kind of leased up and kind of what's the internal timing around or internal targets around some of that stuff?
John Thomas : Hey, Tayo. One clarification, you said, you know, kind a holding out or non-renewal space to hold out for a better tenant. That's really not exactly what we do. In non-renewal space because we have a better tenant in hand. And that's the perfect example is the 55,000 square feet of leases that are under construction. So it just takes a period of time to build out that space for the incoming tenant. And we don't count that as least, occupied space until the rent commences, as appropriate accounting. And that particular location are those 55,000 feet. Is 50 bps of same store?
Jeff Theiler : Yes. Just 100.
John Thomas : Yes. Yes. So pretty meaningful contribution. And gets us back to 95% actual lease space when those commence. On the building that where we had to repositioning this quarter. We already have an active lease pipeline. Again, those discussions have been in place for a while. Amy Hall and her team have done a great job of building a list of tenants to backfill and lease that space at market rates. And we think that building get back to kind of high occupancy in second half of this year or first half of next year. So it'll start contributing again momentarily.
Tayo Okusanya : Okay. And then just like target economics for the, I mean, when you're going to release the space, are you -- is the goal you want in 10%, 20% spreads on kind a what the old leases look like? Or just trying to get a general sense of what kind of economic at targeting.
John Thomas : Yes, Tayo. So I think you're making a great point here, which is that our vacancy and short term leases really have an opportunity right now to increase cash flow as we're in an environment where rental rates are increasing quickly. In fact, just yesterday, just as a as an example, we were shared a leasing flyer for our brand new development in Texas and our second largest market. It's not an investment that development deal that we're directly involved with, but it's located right next to a large existing building we own. And the development rental rates and in that leasing flyer were 40% higher than the rents we have in place in our existing building that was built five years ago. So similar, you know, quality, even larger building a large delta between what current construction rental rates asking rental rates are and where are they embedded in rental rates of our portfolio are. So there's a great opportunity. And that's where our leasing team, our asset management team is focused on, is really understanding each market and bringing those current leases mark to market. As I said, I absent the one lease we discussed. We had 10.1% leasing spreads this quarter, which is a phenomenal job by our entire leasing team. And great potential with our asset management team.
Tayo Okusanya : Great. Thank you.
John Thomas : Thanks, Tayo.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Josh Dennerlein : Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Just kind a wanted to ask about something you mentioned in the opening remarks. I think I heard correctly, you mentioned you expect the transaction activity to pick up in the second half of this year. What's driving that your expected -- that expected pickup?
John Thomas : Yes. I think the just knowing what's in our pipeline and discussions, again, when we don't do much at all, any new acquisition is a pickup, right? So -- but we do have some active discussions, but it's not the kind of volumes we've done historically, because we're really pushing long-term cost of capital and trying to match up with market first year yields. So but I do think the market generally there's a lot of loans -- IO loans that were issued in 2019, 2020 that were attached to buildings that were purchased at 4.5%, 5% yields. And those loans are now costing 7%, 7. 5%. So it's -- there's a mismatch there, negative leverage acquisitions to cash flow, the LTVs are not -- don't support the size of those loans. So we're starting to see -- it's small right now, but I think that activity will pick up where we see not distressed buildings, but owners who don't want to come out of pocket to support that kind of cash flow. So we think there's a pretty large volume of that kind of opportunity out there. We'll see if it materializes or not if interest rates fall, maybe people, kind of ride it through until till the future. But right now, we're starting to see some evidence of those kind of that kind of combination coming to fruition.
Josh Dennerlein : Interesting. Are those mostly like one-off assets or are they more, like, portfolio of size.
John Thomas : Yes. I'd say a combination. But one-off assets is primarily what we look at. It's rare that we do. We've done two very large portfolios, but we've really built the company one building at a time so.
Josh Dennerlein : All right. Thank you.
John Thomas : Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. You touched on this a little bit, but I guess I was kind a curious too just on the for the same store NOI numbers. I think this is like the maybe the fifth quarter in a row where the expense growth was faster than the revenue growth. And I was wondering if there's just a line of sight to when that might reverse when the same-store revs would maybe ideally be growing faster than the expense line. You talked about the part of the remedy on that, but I'm curious if there's any other one. If it's contingent just upon that additional leasing you talked about or just other factors as well maybe controlling expenses there. Just more color on that would be helpful. Thanks.
John Thomas : Yes, Steve. So operating expenses in the same-store pool were up 6.9% year-over-year sort of in line with some recent inflation for this. We're coming off of a period last year where this comparable operating expenses were really flat in the comparable period, but prior a year ago. And if you if you look a little deeper into that, what we're seeing on operating expense growth is number one utilities, not necessarily consumption because we made some very intelligent and wise capital investments in the building. But in the rate of utilities, we're seeing a pretty large increase. And then we're also seeing some increases in labor related to janitorial engineering, things like that. So year-over-year, that's where the operating expense growth is. But again, one of the benefits of our highly occupied triple net lease portfolio is that those operating expenses are nearly offset in our recoveries which are baked into that rental revenue line item there as well. So our asset management team, property management team are always focused on keeping total occupants see cost low, managing operating expense as well and leveraging economies of scale. But we'll continue to try and focus on keeping those operating expenses below the inflation line.
Steven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: We are closing our question-and-answer session. Now, I would like to turn the floor back over to John Thomas for closing comments. Please go ahead.
John Thomas : Thanks again everybody for joining us today. We look forward to me seeing you at NAREIT and future investment conferences and speaking to you again in August. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Page. Thank you, Mr. Page. You may begin.
Brad Page: Thank you, Maria. Good morning and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. Joining me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, Chief Investment Officer; Mark Theine, Executive Vice President, Asset Management; John Lucey, Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer; Lori Becker, Senior Vice President and Controller; and Dan Klein, Deputy Chief Investment Officer. During this call, John Thomas will provide a summary of the company's activities and performance for the fourth quarter of 2022 and year-to-date performance in 2023, as well as our strategic focus for the remainder of 2023. Jeff Theiler will review our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022, and Mark Theine will provide a summary of our operations for the fourth quarter.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to the company's CEO, John Thomas, John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Physicians Realty Trust demonstrated resilience throughout 2022 and enters 2023 from a position of strength. Our assets are performing well, demand for our space remained strong, and our balance sheet is well-positioned for outsized external growth. We're proud of our achievements during the year, including attainment of the highest annual Fed, funds available for distribution for share in the history of the company. The cash growth is supported by record leasing performance. For the year, we executed leases totaling more than one million rentable square feet including over 800,000 feet of renewals and an average spread of 6%. Retention remained strong as 77% and more than 60% of our executed leases had an average annual escalator at 3% or greater. We remain focused on creating long-term value on behalf of our shareholders. This can occasionally require the selective non-renewal of leases when we believe that the space can be re-let to stronger health system tenants. While this has the effect of hurting total occupancy and same-store NOI growth in the short-term, we believe that these decisions result in a stronger portfolio that delivers superior cash flow growth in the future. During 2022, we increase the amount of space leased to investment grade quality tenants from 65% to almost 67%. And we believe that we continue to have the highest portfolio leased rate of any public medical office building investor. The rapidly changing interest rate environment required us to be disciplined when evaluating external growth opportunities during 2022. Still, we were able to add to shareholders -- add value to shareholders through the transaction we did choose to pursue. In July, we opportunistically sold disposed of our three Great Falls Montana medical facilities at a 4.7% cap rate, generating a $54 million game and an outstanding 16% unlevered IRR. We match this transaction with a $160 million of new investments in 2022 highlighted by our $82 million acquisition of the Calco Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York, at a 5.5% stabilized cash yield. We also continue to work with several health systems to move development and redevelopment projects forward that we expect to proceed in 2023 and generate rent in 2024. Our financial achievements were matched by our accomplishments as they relate to corporate responsibility in 2022. We made measurable progress toward our goal being a sustainable -- sustainability leader across all real estate industry sectors. For the year, we invested in 31 projects totaling $5.6 million that will directly reduce the energy footprint of our facilities, while also enhancing the desirability of these assets to tenants. Thoughtful investments like these are a critical part of our long-term sustainability objectives, including our goal announced in 2021 to reduce our portfolio's greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, over our 2018 baseline. Social accomplishments in 2022 include 902 hours of volunteer work, individually and corporately, to the communities we serve, which exceeded our 600-hour goal by over 50%. Doc also provided more than $408,000 to philanthropic fundraising and in-kind donations to community and healthcare provider organizations, benefiting their research and mission initiatives. In addition, in 2022, we earned recognition for Modern Healthcare as One of the Best Places to Work in Healthcare for the second year in a row, and Top Workplaces Honors from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in our headquarters for the fifth year in a row. Our ESG efforts continue to receive recognition at asset and corporate levels. During 2022, Doc assets were certified by IREM under their Certified Sustainable Property program, bring our aggregate count to 38 properties with this designation. Separately, we earned 16 new ENERGY STAR property certifications under their recently relaunched medical office building program, bringing our certification count to 26 and qualifying Doc as a premier member of the Certification Nation's efforts. We're also proud to share that we were named to Bloomberg's Gender Equity Index in January of 2023 as a first-time submitter, distinguishing our work in gender equity in enhanced public disclosure. We're thankful to have been recognized in each of these ways and remain committed to maintaining our status as a leader within the healthcare REIT sector on matters of ESG. In a few minutes, Jeff will discuss the strength of our balance sheet and Mark Theine will provide more details on our operating results. Before that, I'd like to take a moment to speak toward our expectations for the year ahead. In 2023, we have set ambitious goals to increase our occupancy at market rate and continue seeking medical office acquisitions and development opportunities. Our development financing pipeline is more extensive than ever, with more than $200 million at cost of opportunities under evaluation and exclusive negotiation. We expect to proceed with many of these opportunities and are targeting stabilized project yields in the 7% to 8% range. The acquisition market has not yet stabilized with current and capital market conditions. On market transactions are working around the high six cap rate. Still, with low volumes and a limited financing market. We do not believe the market is reached equilibrium, with our weighted average cost of capital, or the markets cost of capital growth generally. In conclusion, DPhysicians Realty Trust in 2023 with a strong, stable and proven portfolio. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain disciplined and capital deployment, patiently waiting for acquisition and development opportunities that will be accretive to our long term financial goals. We celebrate our 10th anniversary this summer, and we are proud that we have built this company to last for decades to come. I will now turn the discussion over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $61.5 million or $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $57.9 million, an increase of 5.4% over the comparable quarter of last year, and our FAD per share was $0.24. 2022, our normalize FAD was $242 million, an increase of 10.6% over 2021, and our full year FAD per share was $1.1. Releasing spreads remain strong this quarter at 7%. And we expect the broader economic environment to support our efforts to roll the portfolio's rent up over time. On the expense side, we're protected from stubbornly high inflation by our standard triple net lease structure, in which we recover 84% of all operating expenses, which is about 20 percentage points higher than our peer group. Well year-over-year same store NOI growth was below expectations at 1.5% due to the movement – due to the move outs discussed earlier in the year. We see positive results on a sequential basis with quarter-over-quarter same store NOI growing by 1.3%. On the acquisitions front, we had projected minimal acquisition activity in the fourth quarter, and saw that play out with just a handful of strategic transactions taking place, along with some funding on existing loans, patients continues to be the theme here. While cap rates have drifted significantly higher. We are not yet seeing a high volume of deals that meet our quality thresholds at pricing that makes sense in this capital environment. Our cost of capital is extremely competitive right now. So it isn't that we are competing against cheaper capital. Instead, we see this as the usual delay that happens when sellers have to adjust to pricing that is less advantageous than they could have received several months ago. Therefore, we are reluctant to put out acquisition guidance at this time. We believe that either cap rates will adjust to historical norms based on current debt costs or we will see improvements in our cost of capital that will create opportunities in the current market environment. We are in constant dialogue with potential sellers and health system partners, and believe we will be in an excellent position to grow the company's earnings substantially. When this bid ask spread closes. We took steps to bolster our balance sheet further by issuing $74 million of equity in the fourth quarter on the ATM along with another $66 million on the ATM in January. This place is our balance sheet on a debt to EBITDA run rate of 5.2 times on a consolidated basis, and provides plenty of dry powder for us to utilize at the right time. Finally, a few updates to our 2023 guidance. We expect G&A to increase by about 4.5% at the midpoint to a range of $41 million to $43 million. Current capital expenditures are expected to increase modestly by about 5% at the midpoint to a range of $24 million to $26 million. As we continue to see tenants trade TI dollars for lower renewal spreads. As mentioned earlier, acquisition guidance will be withheld until we have more visibility on how cap rates and capital costs evolve in 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk through some additional operational details. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. Our tenured asset management, leasing and capital projects teams are united in our focus to serve our healthcare partners. While growing cash flow for our stakeholders. We contributed to these goals in 2022 by delivering record renewal spreads, maintaining retention, and efficiently prioritizing capital project investments in this inflationary environment. These successes are the direct results of our commitments to outstanding customer service and in line with our care core values. Despite the difficult macro environment, we delivered record full year renewal spreads of 6% while maintaining retention of 77%. Importantly, these results were achieved without offering excessive incentives. With full year renewal TI's totaling just $0.80 per square foot per year. This efficiency was matched by our capital projects team, who deployed $23.9 million of recurring CapEx in 2022, representing $1.48 per square foot. During the fourth quarter, we continued our positive momentum by achieving renewals spreads of 7% on 141,000 square feet of volume, with leasing costs totaling $0.45 per square foot per year. In addition, new leases totaling 42,000 square feet commenced during the quarter at an average rate of $18.64. Tenant improvement costs on new leases totaling $3.89 per square foot per year remain well within industry averages, demonstrating our commitment to bottom line effective rent rather than headline rate. The weighted average annual rent escalator on this quarters 182,000 square feet of leasing totaled 2.9%, a significant increase against the portfolio average of 2.4% MOB same-store NOI growth was 1.5% in the fourth quarter, below our historical 2% to 3% growth rate due to the 30 basis point decline in occupancy from the vacancies we discussed last quarter. In total, this 51,000 square feet of lost occupancy across 13.5 million square foot same-store portfolio is largely explained by activity at two specific buildings. First, same-store occupancy continues to be impacted by the strategic non-renewal of suites and an MOB in Minnesota to allow for the construction of a brand new ASC that is currently under construction and leased to the dominant investment grade health system in the market. The new 21,000 square foot surgery center is expected to be completed and paying rent during the third quarter of 2023. Second, 22,000 square feet of vacancy is attributable to an MOB in Pennsylvania, where our historical physician tenants were employed by a hospital and relocated to the hospitals-owned medical office facility at the end of the lease term. We are making several investments to improve this space. And we have partnered with the local brokerage team with strong healthcare relationships. Overall, we do not view the small amount of negative net absorption to be indicative of market conditions or our potential for internal growth, but rather one-off events that will have a short-term impact on the portfolio. Excluding these two assets, MOB same-store NOI growth would have been 2%. Well, we don't typically highlight our sequential same-store results, the 1.3% growth in NOI, stable occupancy in 0.5% reduction in operating expenses show positive progress in the impact of our team's efforts. This is our 19th consecutive quarter of positive same-store NOI cash growth. Again, we enter 2023 with strong leasing momentum. The macro leasing environment continues to offer an advantage to existing medical office inventory, with quality space in move in condition due to the cost and time required for new construction, especially in markets like Phoenix, Nashville, Atlanta and Dallas where Doc has a strong presence. At the beginning of the year, our leasing and marketing teams launched a comprehensive campaign to increase online exposure of our properties, target key brokers and market influencers and leverage the relationships and knowledge of our in-house property management team. Just two months into the year, our efforts are already yielding results, as tours of vacant space are up nearly 30% year-over-year, and we are trading proposals on over 162,000 square feet of vacant space in the portfolio. Our leasing and property management teams have a busy calendar of broker open houses to showcase our portfolio and demonstrate new virtual reality technology, which allows prospective tenants to visualize a customized suite and finishes before commencing expensive construction. We have dedicated approximately 60% of our 2023 recurring capital budget of 24 million to 26 million to leasing initiatives that include renovating vacant suites, tenant improvement allowances to retain and attract healthcare providers and general building renovations where there's a strong leasing activity due to the supply and demand of physicians in the market. Through these collective efforts, we believe that there's opportunity for an increase in total portfolio occupancy in the back half of the year. Following a typical three to six months, it takes to design construct and commence a new lease. We expect this positive momentum to also appear in lease renewals, while 2023 scheduled expiration volume remains small at 4.5% of the consolidated portfolio. The market conditions that help contribute to our success in 2022 remain intact. For the full year, we expect renewal spreads to be in the mid single-digits compared to the long-term MOB industry expectations of 2% to 3%. And we anticipate retention to be in line with our historical average of 75%. To conclude, we anticipate that our operational initiatives will lead to improve same-store NOI growth beginning of the third quarter of 2023. While below target same-store performance is frustrating in the short-term. We believe that long-term value is maximized through thoughtful portfolio management, intelligent capital investments and aggressive leasing initiatives. The thesis for medical office is as strong as ever, and we're excited to execute on behalf of our stakeholders in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Thomas : Thank you, Mark. Maria, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the time. Just hoping to talk a little bit more about the leasing efforts and the occupancy upside. Can you quantify how much occupancy upside you expect? I think, you said in the back half of the year and would that really be driven by filling current vacancy, or is it more incremental new leasing of space that has been sitting vacant for a bit, and given the -- you give the piece parts of re-lease spreads and occupancy a bit? What is the expectations for same-store NOI for 2023?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Juan thanks a lot. This is JT. I think our ambitious goals this year around both vacancy and really non-renewing lower quality credit tenants with higher quality health system tenants who need to expand into space in their building. So it's 95% to 96% somewhere in that number is full occupancy, and so our ambitious goal is just to hit those numbers, and so positive accretion for the year, and our compensation goals are tied to that as well. So, we're, you know, we think that's very achievable, somewhere in that range, and same-store is a number that is impacted by a small percentage, very small percentage of move out, some of which we caused on our own in sequential quarters and it takes a couple of more quarters to backfill that space with both leases signed, but also more importantly, completing the TI and the commencement of those leases. So, back after the year, we have expectations for good, solid return to our same-store growth numbers that are historical. First half the year, we're burdened by the decisions we made, we think the right decisions in the third and fourth quarter of 2022.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then I was just hoping for some color on the transactions market and where you see that the bid-ask spreads, maybe in terms of cap rates of where sellers are still holding on what you think is realistic, given your capital costs are generally higher capital across the market.
John Thomas: Yeah. Great question. And we're seeing a significant movement in cap rates, they're just not many transactions occurring. Sellers are just holding on, hopeful that we returned to the glory days of 2020 and 2019 from cap rate perspective. But transactions are occurring in the mid-sixes. And we think we have a great cost of capital in the current environment, but that cost of capital still expects needs high sixes to mid-sevens cap rates, depending upon the annual increase reserves in the rents and things like that to execute. So, we think there's a good opportunity in the back half of the year assuming that market reaches equilibrium in that range. But in the current environment, we're just not seeing many trades that right quality, right credit, right location that we want to buy, in the mid-sixes. So we want to see those cap rates move up. And, like Jeff said, we've got a balance sheet loaded to execute once we reach equal equilibrium. It's my word in cap rates with market cost of capital.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks John.
John Thomas: Next one.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up on some of your opening remarks on the lease escalators. I think you said you -- for you just signed in 4Q, I think, 2.9%, up from 2.4% in the in-place portfolio. I guess how are the current conversations going for leases renewing in 2023? Are you able to push a little bit more aggressively on the go-forward leases?
John Thomas: Hey, Josh, great question. That's one of the things that just kind of understated in our comments. [Technical Difficulty]
Joshua Dennerlein: Hello?
Operator: Sir, you may proceed.
John Thomas: Maria, can they -- can you hear us?
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes.
Operator: Yes. I can…
John Thomas: Hey, Josh, can you hear us okay?
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Went out, basically, right when you started talking.
John Thomas: Oh, the best comments I've ever made on an earnings call.
Joshua Dennerlein: That's what I figured. All the good stuff.
John Thomas: Yes, exactly. Shoot, the stock would have gone up 20%. No, just kidding. Hey, Josh, what I was saying was, I think 60% or more of our leases in the fourth quarter, we renewed with -- average annual increase was over 3% or 3% or more. And the compounding effect of that is probably the best thing we can do in our leases and just moving our, kind of, average annual escalator up from 2.4%. I think we're up to 2.5% now, and we continue to move that up. So those conversations continue to be strong. And we continue to have a, kind of, some negotiating power in the average annual increase sort of to move those up beyond historical averages. And our leasing team, led by Amy Hall and her team, are doing a great job, kind of focus on not only in the renewal rate, which again, for last year, was 6% or more, but also that average annual increase. So, we try to get CPI, we try to get floors in that CPI increaser, but just moving that number up has a long term compounding effect. We don't sign one-night leases or two -- or 30-day leases or even one year leases. We signed five years or more increase -- re-leases and extensions on existing leases. And that average increase was a really important part of our strategy to grow in a way over the time.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate that color. And then, maybe one big picture question for me. Any kind of, like, changes you're seeing with health systems in the current environment kind of coming out of COVID? I know they did have labor pressures. Just some challenges on that front. Like, anything they're looking to do differently that might help your business or hurt it a little bit? Just trying to get a sense of the landscape.
John Thomas: Yes. Since 1982, there's been a push by Medicare and payers to move more care out of the hospital into outpatient settings. And I think health systems realized during COVID, they don't have enough outpatient space available for the kind of demand in their markets. And so, what we're seeing differently from health system is a more intensive strategy to open new outpatient locations, in strong democratic locations and that's what's leading to a lot of development opportunities for us.  All health systems, investment grade and otherwise had challenges in 2022 with inflation and labor shortages and stress of labor and things like that. We're starting to see that stabilize. And the revenue side or the reimbursement side of healthcare is always a lagging indicator, not a lagging indicator, lagging impact on their P&L statements. And so, expenses, a real time revenue, take reimbursement rates, take time to catch up with inflationary pressures. And so we're starting to see -- starting to see stability there, but at the same time, reimbursement increases kind of catch up with inflation. So, lots of lots of ways to go. But the US healthcare economy this year is going to be $3.5 trillion. So there's lots of lots of money in the system, lots of intensive efforts to move more care to the outpatient setting which is more profitable and at the same time, some stability in the labor market. 
Joshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Tayo Okusanya: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Question on internal growth. I think everything that's happening on the top line is pretty impressive, even with some of the deliberate occupancy drag, but with OpEx, I think you're getting the same store OpEx growth was 9.8%. Could you just talk a little bit about efforts to kind of mitigate some of the OpEx increases going forward, and specifically is part of that just because of again, your triple net leases, but not everything is passed through at this point? Jeff, I believe you mentioned, you had like an 84% reimbursement rate. Could you just talk a little bit about again how ultimately some of the OpEx growth gets mitigated going forward for better same store NOI growth performance? 
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, thank you, Tayo. I’m going to ask Mark to respond to that.
Mark Theine: Yeah, good morning, Tayo. So you point out our operating expenses in the fourth quarter were up 9.8%. It's definitely higher than historical norms. But one thing kind of below the surface that's really pushing it up this quarter is some one time insurance costs are insurance in the quarter was up 1.2 million over the prior year. And again, those are some one time costs in the quarter. But you know, one of the things we really appreciate about our portfolio is just you know, as alluded to is that we're 95% occupied and highly triple net lease. So, our operating expense recoveries were actually up 10.3% to offset that increase. What our asset management team is really focused on is controllable expenses, and you know, where we've got the ability to impact long term, the operating expenses of the portfolio. And if you look specifically at controllable operating expenses in the quarter, those are up about 5%, 5.5%. So, that's a pretty good run rate and great work by our asset management team in this inflationary environment to really focus on those controllable expenses, which exclude insurance and taxes.
Tayo Okusanya: That’s helpful. And the continued investments in real estate technology again, I think you guys put like 0.5 million into that again this year, this quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about again, your ultimate return on investment that you're looking for how this is going to help you guy, you know, in lower operating expenses, just again, as you just kind of look at more investments on the technology side. What exactly you kind of expect to get out of that?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Tayo. This is Jeff. Good question. So what we think we'll get a good return out of that investment just on a monetary basis. But really, the investment is also designed to help us stay in front of the latest technology, the latest real estate technology. And to your point, I mean, help us manage our operating expenses going forward. So we think it is going to be a good return on the investment side. But it also gives us front row access to all these new companies that are coming out with innovative real estate solutions, and really helps us be at the forefront of, having the best possible management of our properties and keep our operating expenses low for our tenants and which, you know, of course helps the company itself.
Tayo Okusanya: Are you partnering with any of those companies at this point and seeing any kind of result?
Jeff Theiler: You know, Tayo I think it's JT– I think, I think part of the opportunity, you know, in this PropTech investment we made is to work with other REITs to kind of identify and benefit from some of the best IT minds out there. So I don't think our shareholders are looking for us to create our own IT platform. I think benefit is we're investing alongside other REITs and other institutional real estate owners to kind of develop IT tools that we will benefit from and at the same time, have a great IRR or return on investment from those – that direct investment. So, we haven't seen anything directly but we get to explore these tools, which is part of the opportunity that are under development or that are kind of leading-edge technology. So, we'll see some long term benefits eventually.
Tayo Okusanya: Right. And then one more for me if you can indulge me, just some capital allocation question. So some of the recent equity issuances again, what again are going to be the use of the funds, especially this kind of given the issuance of that your current kind of implied cap rate. And lastly, how do we think about the dividend outlook going forward, given like the 96% EFFO payout ratio?
John Thomas: Yes, Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: I’d be happy. Hey, Tayo so – yes, we did some equity issuance on the ATM, we're trading at an implied cap rate in the mid 6% range. That's consistent with where we've seen Class A medical office buildings being marketed. We haven't seen many transactions closing still. And cap rates have really only been moving in one direction which is up, so we thought it was prudent to strengthen our balance sheet at these levels, which we think is going give us a great opportunity when the market stabilizes at what we think the right numbers are to really be an active investor and to really generate strong earnings accretion, which is a certainly a departure from the previous times when cap rates were so low, it's hard to generate earnings accretion, we think we're going to be able to get best-in-class, Class A MOB's at really good pricing. So, we feel good about the strengthening of the balance sheet. You know, obviously in the meantime, it also pays down our variable rate debt, which is seems to – also seem to be only moving in one direction, which is higher with the Feds increases. So, we think it's a smart capital allocation decision.
Tayo Okusanya: Great. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks Tayo.
Jeff Theiler: Thanks Tayo.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Griffin: Great. Thanks. Maybe to follow-up on Tayo's last question there related to the equity issuance. I mean you talked about being disciplined in 2022, patients continues to be a theme, you mentioned a competitive cost of capital. You why the equity issuance now, I guess, just given the sense that it's at a pretty notable discount to what consensus NAV is that, you seem like you're fine from a balance sheet perspective, it seems like the capital markets are going to be pretty muted for the near-term. Why did it make sense now and why not maybe put it off for until capital markets activity improves?
Jeff Theiler: Hey Mike, I'll take that. Yes, look, I think we're running at the low end of our leverage range, right, which -- we've put our leverage range out at 5.5% to 6%. Certainly, one can argue that the capital markets have been very choppy over the last few months. I mean, certainly we've had a good month in the capital markets overall, or good year-to-date, I should say. But that's not guaranteed by any stretch. So, really, the idea it's kind of a -- it's not a discount to where we're trading on an implied cap rate versus where we'd be buying assets today if they were closing. So, I think it makes sense to have that optionality to kind of build that dry powder now, such that if the capital markets freeze up for some reason, we're still going to be in a position to grow and grow when others can't.
Michael Griffin: Right, so it seems that in your view, it's relative on an implied cap rate basis, maybe investors should be thinking about it on that basis relative to premium or discount to NAV, am I reading that correctly?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I think that -- I mean they go hand-in-hand, right. But yes, I think that's how we're thinking about it. Our implied cap rate versus where assets are trading in the -- are being marketed right now, I should say.
Michael Griffin: Okay, cool. And then maybe one for Mark. I know you talked about selective non-renewal of certain leases. You mentioned the MOBs in Minnesota and Pennsylvania as examples. I get the long-term strategic rationale behind this, but I just want to clarify are -- is there any potential for additional strategic non-renewals that could impact occupancy in 2023 and any additional color on that would be helpful?
Mark Theine: Yes, certainly. So, again, we strategically did not renew two leases to -- in Minnesota to bring in an investment-grade tenant. So, that's going to create great long-term value for the company, for the portfolio, for shareholders. And we're going to continue to look at opportunities always to replace existing tenants with investment-grade quality, great long-term tenants. So, it does create a near-term drag on our same-store results, which is frustrating, but it provides the right long-term value and we will always look for those opportunities in 2023 and years after that. So, the good news is our leasing team has done a fantastic job this year of already commencing conversations on 162,000 square feet of new leases and taking space. Now, not all that will get done, but those are good conversations to start the year. And we feel good about filling vacant spaces throughout 2023 and really growing our net absorption.
Michael Griffin: All right, that's it for me. Thanks for the time.
Mark Theine: Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Camden: Hey, just two quick ones. Staying on the balance sheet. So, the -- if I look at the $66 million plus or minus equity issuance post Q, just trying to get a sense of what that was put towards? And sort of the related question to that is, so if I annualized your interest costs for Q, I get to sort of an $80 million number. Is that sort of the right ballpark, or it's some debt get paid down? Hopefully that makes sense.
Jeff Theiler: It does. Hey, Ron, it's Jeff. So yeah, we put that towards paying down the revolving line of credit. So, obviously we're – we expect eventually to redeploy those proceeds into acquisitions, but in the meantime, we pay down the line of credit with it. So it'll bring the interest expense down a bit.
Ronald Camden: Got it. And then just on the acquisition, I know you guys are not providing guidance given sort of what you've talked about and – can you talk a little bit more about just what the competition is like why are cap rate thing so tight, who's sort of stepping up and still buying here and why haven't we seen sort of more widening? Thanks.
John Thomas: Yeah, it's JT. I think – I think it's just a seller's holding out and hoping. So essentially hope, conflicts with, rising interest rates on short term loans that were used to acquire for four cap, five cap assets in 2017 to 2020 range. But, I think – I think until we see kind of more distress on the ownership side of the capital side, medical office billings. We won't see a lot of trades occurring. So it's moving in the right direction. It just takes time for the market to kind of – kind of rationalize between cost of capital and it's been a 20 year bull run, and in medical office, and the 10 year treasury, and kind of other things. So it's – it just takes time for the – when interest rates rise 400 500 basis points like they have in the last six to nine months. It just takes time for them – in the kind of the market to reconcile itself. So it'll get there and, we expect to – we expect a pretty good backup – backup – back half of the year. But the market is going to get there.
Ronald Camden: Got it. That's it for me. Thanks so much.
John Thomas: Yeah. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. JT, just staying on the MOB private market valuations, I think you highlighted that assets were being marketed in the mid 6% cap rate right now. Is that a fair valuation or do you think it needs to go higher from that mid 6% type cap rate?
John Thomas: Yeah, Mike, great question. I think that's when they're marketed that rate. Almost by definition, that means the price should be better – from a – shouldn't move up from that range. And so, frankly, the fact that assets are even marketed, above six is a dramatic change from where they were marketed six months ago, and they still need to move a little higher. So, we're waiting patiently. We're not – we're not out of the market, as far as, you know, exploring opportunities. But, when we – when we make an offer on a Class A asset that we're really excited about it's – it's going to be higher than, mid 6%.
Michael Carroll: So we're thinking more of like a high 6%, are we talking about 7% type range, or I guess, like mid 6%, obviously, pretty wide range? I mean, are we talking higher than that?
John Thomas: Yeah. Generally, and we're IRR investors. So, depends on the annual increases where they are market rents and things like that. So it's a combination of factors, but from a cap rate perspective, just the market generally is – it's we're seeing trades very few. But we are seeing trades in the mid 6s on assets that if they were trading, let's just call it seven. We would be pretty excited about it moving in the right direction. So it's just few and far between, but we think the market is moving in the right direction, as a buyer, in a long-term investment.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And what's the appropriate IRR target? I mean, trying to translate this from a cap rate to an IRR. I mean, are we talking about 8% plus IRR?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I think, that's a fair way to think about.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then are these high quality MOBs so like off campus affiliated with a major health system. Is that what we're generally talking about here?
John Thomas : Yes. And we're very transparent. That's all we buy. And so that's what we're talking about. So you can get lower quality at a higher rate. You can do other asset classes at a higher rate. But right now for Class A assets and that's and I think, in part that's where we see development kind of leading the way for the next several years is health systems really we're looking for new strategic locations. And we're working with several right now on kind of helping them develop those locations and getting in a more attractive yield in the current cost capital environment.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then I know earlier in your prepared remarks and through some of these questions, you talked about selectively not renewing some tenants if you think that there's a better tenant that could take that space. I mean, are we talking about some of the things that you already did or are there additional leases that you plan on doing this with in 2023?
John Thomas : That's a great question. So it was about -- we have 16 million square feet, and we're talking about 40,000 square feet where we did that last year and we're already backfilling that space. It just takes time for the new leases to commence post TI. There will be a little bit of that in the first quarter of this year, but it's -- when the tenant has too much space, I mean, that's almost worse than having the tenant kind of renew a lease and occupy space that we think there's a better market rates for -- out there for to compete for that space. So, we have a little bit of that in the first quarter of this year. But it's not a lot across 60 million square feet. But in short-term, it's negative; long-term, it’s very beneficial to the company.
Michael Carroll: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Rodgers: Oh, yes, good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups on investments. I think the first would be around the development funding pipeline 200 million that you talked about. I think this was a similar number to where you started last year. Maybe give us a sense of kind of how it kind of wound up in 2022 versus that expectation, I think was probably lower, but just to give us your own assessment of that. And then I guess what gives you confidence in that number for this year and debt markets maybe part of that? The second would be maybe a follow-up to Mike's question just a minute ago. In terms of the investment activity that you expect to accelerate in the second half, is that because you're seeing more RFPs on the market, more packages coming out? Is it more hope or you're actually seeing good amount of activity that would lead you to be able to close activity or close acquisitions in the second half of the year?
John Thomas : Dave, those are all great questions. Hope is not a strategy or we not depend upon RFPs to find assets or work with health systems. Those tend to be auction type processes where there's always some low bidder that you don't want to compete with. Not that we couldn't. And so I think the 200 million is active discussions with health systems. Last year when both supply chain and inflation was going up, you couldn't get a construction, a contractor to give you a quote on contract to build a building that was good for more than a day. I mean, historically you get a bid and 90 days later, 180 days later, it was still a good number. So last year, a lot of the projects we're working on are still there and that's the confidence in that $200 million number is some of those projects that are carrying over, and we the health system that positions, we're waiting on some stability, stabilization in the construction, and also the timeline with supply chain and other things that are beyond everybody's control. And so, numbers are coming in today, we're proceeding with some projects that we thought would begins construction in the fourth quarter, but the tenant, the capital, us, the contractors, all have more stability today than we had three months ago. And frankly, that's going to create much more long-term value for us by that short delay in those -- on those projects. So we'll be breaking ground in the next 30 days on projects that we've been working on for a couple of years. So we feel really confident in that number going forward and we see a lot of more opportunity in that space.
Dave Rodgers: All right, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, I guess not to get too granular on the same-store OpEx that was up 9.8% in the fourth quarter, but I guess to flip the narrative around here a little bit with the one-time insurance cause that you mentioned you absorbed in the fourth quarter that makes the favorable 0.5% sequential decline in OpEx, I should be little more impressive. So I guess with the assumption that the insurance costs were probably up sequentially in 4Q versus 3Q just remind us, which cost categories actually improved the most sequentially. And then also, were there any seasonal factors worth mentioning one way or the other that may impact that favorable sequential comparison on the OpEx? Thanks.
Mark Theine: Yeah, Steven. This is Mark. Thanks for pointing that out. I should have mentioned that earlier, but we've done a great job sequentially keeping our operating expenses actually declined a little bit. Contributing to that sequential change utilities was a large contributor quarter-over-quarter and actually a decrease in holding that relatively flat and same with general maintenance category there, year-over-year those were -- those two categories were up about 700,000 and 600,000. But quarter-over-quarter, we did a great job with our asset management team to keep those flat. I think we're also seeing the results of some of our ESG efforts in the utility expense from LED upgrades things like that, where we've made wise capital investments, and we're starting to see that reduction in the operating expenses from some of those projects that we completed this year.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. And you mentioned that you don't normally do those sequential comparisons, but again, I guess the reason why you don't do that as they're just some seasonality factors that just mucks that out sometimes, just curious any reminders on any seasonal factors on sequential comparisons either 4Q to 1Q, or just any other times throughout the year as far as any obvious ones that stick out?
Mark Theine: Yeah, the obvious ones would be snow removal and markets -- North Dakota was hit pretty hard with our snow removal costs in the fourth quarter, but really don't have a lot of seasonality in our operating expenses outside those obvious ones. And again, our highly occupied triple net lease portfolio help insulate the overall NOI same-store numbers there. But, clearly, we watch that carefully for our healthcare tenants and partners, because it's the overall occupancy cost that matters when we talk to them about lease renewals.
Steven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Miller with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
Mike Miller: Yes. Hi. So, for two questions. The first one, on the $200 million of development funding that's under discussion, I guess, if all that comes to fruition, how much capital do you think could go out the door in 2023 and generate a return on it? That's the first question. Second one is what's the return profile on piecing these smaller condos together, like in Atlanta, versus a typical building acquisition that you would make?
John Thomas: I can't help but laugh at the second question, because it's a great question. Actually, it's -- the long term return profile there is much better than about anything else we do. It just -- it's just taking time. It's a very strategic location. For some reason, 20 years ago -- 25 years ago, physicians and hospitals thought condo projects for the right way to build buildings and invest in buildings. And in this particular case, a kind that was built in a incredibly strategic location, across the street from three health systems. And so, we're really excited about the long term -- and maybe the -- maybe the best, kind of, IRR cash yield we'll ever get from individual investments. It just takes time to accumulate the condos over time. So, a great question. We know it looks odd, but at the same time, on the back end, we're going to have fantastic returns from those investments. On the on the development, that's a good question. It takes 18 months to build these buildings. So the ones under construction or about to begin construction, those will -- it just plays out over time, over the 18 month construction cycle. So of that $200 million -- for your model averaged out over 18 months, but it's something like that. So it's -- and frankly, that's the projects we know we will probably finance this year, or contractually commit to financing this year. And we're working on others. So I think there's -- I think there are opportunities for kind of outsized investment on the development side.
Mike Miller: Got it. Okay. Thank you
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to John Thomas for closing comments. Please, go ahead.
John Thomas: Yes, Maria. Thank you. And thanks, everyone for joining us on the call today. We're really excited about 2023. It's a different markets and at a different time. But we think a 20-year bull run and seller's market has turned into outsized opportunity for DOC, Physicians Realty Trust this year, and we look forward to seeing you at some of the investor conferences coming up soon. Thank you.
Operator:  -- concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation. Have a great day.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. The third quarter of 2022 is a quiet and steady as you go quarter for DOC further demonstrating the stability of medical office as an essential real estate class. This year has been challenging for health systems and physicians alike, as medical cost structures have been impacted by double-digit inflation in both staffing costs and supplies that have been further complicated by lagging government and commercial reimbursements. Despite these headwinds, the United States demand for healthcare services is at an all-time high in the past as the population ages and patients receive procedures that were deferred during the pandemic. Providers have continued a long-term shift of care to the outpatient setting where advances in clinical science now allow for many higher margin services like orthopedic surgery to be performed in a lower cost environment. CMS has again expanded the list of procedures that can be performed in ASCs going into 2023. This trend is predictable and rational. Our patient care sites benefit from a more stable staffing model, increased operating efficiency and improved patient convenience, all while freeing up hospital capacity for higher acuity needs. Our portfolio is built with this dynamic in mind. While capital market volatility continues to produce a mismatch between buyers and sellers in the pricing of new investments, our entire team is focused on portfolio optimization and working with our health system partners to address their real estate needs for the years ahead. This partnership focus continues to enhance our development pipeline, and we continue to see the potential for a higher volume of development financing opportunities in 2023. Within the existing portfolio, we continue to benefit from the increased market rental rates, driven primarily by general inflation and rising construction cost. Renewal spreads exceeded our expectations at 6.2% for the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date spreads to 5.7% across 670,000 square feet of activity within our consolidated portfolio. Importantly, these high spreads have not come at the expense of retention, which remains near 80%. We remain excited about the performance of our portfolio despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Mark will share more details in a few minutes. In September, Hurricane Ian calls wide-scale destruction on the west coast of Florida, and our prayers and best wishes go out to the families directly affected by the storm. Our Florida based team's quick response help to mitigate the storms impact on our healthcare partner providers, their patients and our real estate assets. Fortunately, we experienced only minor wind damage to a couple of our smaller facilities and the property will be back in operation quickly. We had no material financial impacts in the storm, and we will thankful that our team members and their families affected by the storm our site. We've all seen the difficult expense environment healthcare organizations are experiencing driven by extraordinarily tight labor markets and medical supply cost as well as non-cash mark-to-market losses in their investment balances. We've devoted significant resources at DOC to building a professional credit team who assist us in underwriting our investments but also periodically reviewing the financial results of our tenants. We have visibility through lease reporting requirements into 94% of our tenants by AVR with the average size of the tenants without this requirement totaling less than 5,000 square feet. We also utilize independent claims data to monitor procedure volumes across our portfolio. Our largest tenant concentration is with CommonSpirit across 12 markets. CommonSpirit's S&P investment grade A minus credit rating was reaffirmed in September with a stable outlook. Moody's and Fitch also reaffirmed their respective IG rating for CommonSpirit as well. According to S&P, CommonSpirit's strong credit rating reflects CommonSpirit's exceptionally broad geographic reach, supporting a financially diversified health system across 21 states with a large $34 billion revenue base. CommonSpirit has $15 billion of unrestricted reserves and 175 days cash on hand. While CommonSpirit's 2022 operating margins were strained at negative 4.5%, S&P believes CommonSpiritt's labor initiatives and market strategies and performance initiatives should help the system achieve their targeted 5% to 6% EBITDA targets by June of 2023. With 66% percent of our space leased to similarly strong investment grade health systems, we see similar resiliency across our tenant base despite broader market challenges. Across the healthcare delivery industry, volumes and opportunities for revenue growth is there, and CMS, Medicare and commercial insurers are increasing reimbursement rates for 2023, reflecting higher inflation and labor costs. Doc continues to make progress in our sustainability efforts, creating value for our healthcare provider partners, shareholders and communities through short and long range business human capital and operations planning. As a benchmark of our efforts, Doc currently scored 75 out of 100 in the recently released 2022 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. Outperforming the international average is 74. We also earned a Green Star Designation award to submitters achieving scores of 50-plus on GRESB's implementation and measurement of the management and policy sections. In addition, the Company earned an A rating and a score of 98 out of 100 on the 2022 GRESB Public Disclosure Level, ranking first in its healthcare comparison group. As we look to 2023, it is difficult to project external growth until capital costs become more predictable, and we can match our cost of capital to market opportunities, acquisitions or development financing. That said the market appears to recognize that asset valuations will need to adjust to complete transactions and construction supply chains seem to be improving in our favor. Our balance sheet is in great shape and our debt metrics are well managed, with no near-term maturities so that when the current market conditions settle down, we are well-positioned to grow and grow at higher levels. We expect to continue to capture higher leasing spreads and those increases in contractual revenue along with our 2020 acquisitions and our 2021 development financing will increase our 2023 NOI including same-store NOI. We will complete our 10th anniversary in July '23 in a very positive way. We believe medical office has as asset class has proven time and time again to be the safest and most offensive and most predictable real estate for investment and operational success. I will now ask Jeff to present our Q3 financial performance and then Mark will address the performance of our high-performing award winning asset and property management team. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company generated normalized funds from operations of $61.4 million or $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $61.8 million, an increase of 13% over the comparable quarter of last year, and our FAD per share was $0.26. The Company's operations were stable this quarter with same store NOI growth of 1.1%. This came in below our expected range due to 40 basis points of occupancy loss, which Mark will discuss in a moment. We continue to believe that our rents are below current market levels, evidenced by the 6.2% releasing spreads achieved during the third quarter. Our largely investment grade tenant base continue to perform as expected, with no material increase in defaults or rental relief requests, despite the inflationary pressures that JT discussed in his remarks. Finally, in terms of our own margins, we remain shielded by our triple net lease structure, with 84% of all operating expenses reimbursed to us by tenants in the third quarter. Our acquisition volumes increase in the third quarter primarily due to the purchase of the Calko Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. Our expectation is that acquisition volumes will be lower in the fourth quarter, as we wait for sellers to adjust their pricing expectations to better align with the current capital market environment. In the meantime, we will be lining up potential opportunities so that we can take full advantage of the creative deals at the right price. Along those lines, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides plenty of flexibility to be patient during this time. Our consolidated net debt to EBITDA was 5.6 times at the end of the third quarter, and we have no material debt refinancings until 2025. We raised 8 million on the ATM in the third quarter at $18.15 per share, and have 300 million remaining in the current ATM program. Finally, a few updates to our 2022 guidance. We expect G&A to come in near the lower end of the $40 million to $42 million range that we set out at the beginning of the year. We are also reducing our guidance for recurring capital expenditures to 25 million to 27 million for the year, down by 4 million at the midpoint. This reduction is due to the better than expected condition of a $750 million landmark portfolio, as well as impacts from tenants exercising automatic renewal options, which push more of a CapEx responsibility to the tenant. With that, I'll turn to Mark to walk through some additional operational details. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. Physicians Realty Trust completed a productive third quarter with our portfolio of outpatient medical facilities demonstrated stability growth amid the current economic environment. We are especially proud to share this quarter that our leasing team achieved above average leasing spreads of 6.2% in Q3 on the heels of an impressive 8% leasing spreads last quarter in Q2. The consecutive quarters of strong releasing spreads above the historical 2% to 3% is a direct result of the mission critical nature of our assets and the enhanced value of our portfolio during a rapidly rising replacement costs. Importantly, we've achieved these results without sacrificing retention, without excessive concessions, and not discounting annual rent escalators. In total, tenant improvement and incentive packages totaled to $0.61 per square foot per year on renewals, while we achieved an 81% retention rate and a 3.1% average annual rent escalator across our 251,000 square feet of leasing activity in the consolidated portfolio during the quarter. Leasing costs were particularly low this quarter as 25% of our renewal volume was completed via automatic lease renewal language in the lease or by tenant options to extend the term with no landlord contributions for tenant improvements or commissions. Given the current cost to build and finance a new development, we anticipate healthcare providers will continue to utilize existing medical office inventory, ultimately driving up total occupancy costs in quality facilities with well capitalized real estate partners. In terms of new leasing activity, Doc currently has 85,000 square feet of executed leases in construction, but not yet paying rent. We anticipate approximately 20,000 square feet of these leases will commence in Q4, with the remainder commencing rent payments in the first half of 2023. MOB same-store NOI grew 1.1% during the third quarter, with results legging due to a 40 basis point decline in same-store occupancy. Over half of this decline resulted from an opportunity to increase occupancy long-term in a building with an investment grade ASE tenants. While we're not satisfied with the 1.1% result, it's important to view the occupancy in the context of the broader MOB landscape. Our 94.7% same-store lease rate is meaningfully higher than industry averages. Tenant demand for medical office facilities has never been stronger and we remain focused on unlocking the value of our portfolio for the long-term. When necessary, this includes the selective vacating of suites that have higher potential with a different tenant, even if growth is impacted on a short-term basis. Looking ahead, we expect same-store occupancy the bottom in fourth quarter before returning to prior ranges as suites currently under construction become online. Same-store operating expenses were up just 2.1% year-over-year, despite the high single digit inflation experienced throughout the economy. This performance is a credit to our asset and property management teams working diligently on behalf of our healthcare provider partners to minimize total occupancy costs. Specifically, this quarter's results was driven by the successful challenging of several real estate tax assessments, resulting in a year-over-year property tax decline of nearly $1 million that served to offset increases in non-controllable utility expenses. These property tax outcomes are just one example among many of the ways that our team works diligently to execute consistently on behalf of our shareholders and hospital system partners to deliver value during this period of economic uncertainty. I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Mark. Doug, we'll now be ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: So the first one for me just. Just general hospital backdrop seems challenging you know the public hospital names seem to have been having a rough couple of quarters. Curious as you interact with your hospital tenant base, what they're seeing what they're hearing? And if demand for MOB space is, seems like it's, whether there any kind of changes to demand trends, just kind of given the top operating backdrop for hospitals?
John Thomas: Yes, great, great question Omotayo. That's one of the reasons we've preferred and we've always focused on really non-profit hospitals primarily is the market strength and the market share. Those facilities typically have and the long-term commitments of those facilities have to their markets. As you know, DE came out of the accession system to 25 years. Obviously, the systems and merchants have been mailer for 10 years. It's the providers and the organizations that we partner with and vast majority of our investment grade tenant base, which is 66% of the whole portfolio, our non-profit health systems with long-term commitments to those communities. And so what we are seeing is a lot of, again, like I said, portfolio optimization where they want to lease the right space at the right price for both of us at market rents, which are increasing. And then the stronger systems, again that we work with are looking at new growth opportunities and that's where the development financing opportunities are coming. So, it's a tough market. Revenue and volumes are high. The challenge many hospitals are having with the volumes and the revenue opportunities is they don't have the staff to actually provide the service. Our health systems are fighting through those issues and again have high utilization. But the expense structure, wage cost, supply costs are exceeding reimbursement rates, which there is always a time lag. And government in particular can be a year to two years behind kind of current inflation costs. So, CMS did better this year. They are not doing enough for physicians, and we expect that they will address that during the line of accession. The commercial insurers are stepping up as well to increase reimbursement to appropriate inflationary levels. So, we are seeing a lot of positive momentum. Everybody is tightening their belt as best they can. But most of the systems we are working with, in the bigger markets stronger markets, are really looking at expansion opportunities not retrenching.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. Then the next one for me. Just same-store NOI growth again. We've all been trained to kind of expect steady 82% to 83%. You are kind of in below that range for the past two quarters at least. Everything seems to be going right. In terms of the mark-to-market you are getting 6% to 8%, much more focused on operating expenses. So just kind of curious like, when do you expect a lot of these kind of initiatives to ultimately kind of raise the same-store NOI growth to that kind of [indiscernible] way win better relative to your peers?
John Thomas: Yes, our expectation is we will be back to a normal pace in 2023. So, as I mentioned a minute ago, really focused on portfolio optimization right now, we have had two or three locations, where we just didn't renew it at least on purpose, so that we provide an expansion opportunity for, frankly stronger tenants in those buildings. So, same-store can be such a short-term number, really focused on the long-term performance of the portfolio. And with that, we have had a couple of quarters in a row with dynamics like that short-term negative impact on same store, but hit a long-term benefit to the organization. Mark, do you want to expand on that?
Mark Theine: Yes. No, that's perfectly said. And I think it's also important to keep in context that, our same store occupancy is at 94.7%. So it's a functionally very full portfolio and the 40 basis point decrease in same-store occupancy represents about 53,000 square feet in total. The specific example that we were referencing with the ASC is a building in Minnesota, where we deliberately did not renewed a couple leases to make room for a large full floor ASC tenant, with an investment grade rated system. So that's an example where we are going to take a little bit of -- on the same store growth in the near-term while that space is under construction. But ultimately we will have great long term value and take a building that was 90% occupied to 100% occupied for the years to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping to spend a little bit more time on the leasing side. You have had great success on renewables for the last couple of quarters. But just curious on the new lease side, what those spreads look like and how much capital is being spent on that side? I think he gave us to renewal numbers on both on the on the TIs in the prepared remarks. So just talking a little bit more on the new side.
Jeff Theiler: Absolutely. So our leasing team has been doing a great job on both renewals and out there focusing on leasing the vacant spaces that we have. As I mentioned, we have 85,000 square feet of new leases that are signed in under construction, when those are completed and generating revenue bill at about 100 basis points same-store. To recruit new tenants and it is tough right now given the construction climate out there. And on a per square foot basis per year, this last quarter, I think we were close to $6, which is per square foot per year, meaningfully higher than our renewals where we're experiencing quite a bit of tenants exercising options to renew or we have auto lease renewal language and a lot of our leases, keeping our CapEx low on renewals.
Juan Sanabria: And then just on the tenant credit side, which Theiler just hit on. I mean, is there anybody on the watch list, I mean that the tone sounds definitely a little bit more cautious which I get or have the rent coverage numbers. And those moved materially to, if you could provide a sense of a range of where those coverages are just to get a sense of crashing, where we are today, even with the turbulence going on in the market?
Jeff Theiler: Juan, this is Jeff. No, I mean, we haven't seen anything material in terms of any relief request or anything like that. Coverages remain about the same. I mean, they're probably a little bit down, but nothing that would concern us at this point. I think JT's remarks were just addressing the overall industry. And what the health systems are going through right now. But we're not concerned about our own portfolio at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBank. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: I'm just curious on the 25% automatic renewals that you referenced. How are leasing spreads negotiated for those types of deals given you're spending less on TI dollars? And are you able to change for the escalator dynamics within those types of leases?
Jeff Theiler: That's certainly varies least by lease, but a lot of leases do have fair market value language included in them. So that is a conversation that we certainly have with the healthcare partners and in some cases brokers in the market to help us determine the fair market value. Clearly, in many markets that's increasing as a result of the construction costs and the inflation that we're experiencing in this environment. There are a few examples where the lease has just continued to escalate at the previously negotiated annual rent escalator which maybe 2% or 3%. I think that it really makes our leasing spreads that much more impressive when you factor in some of those options renew that are renewing a 2% to 3%.
Austin Wurschmidt: And I know next year's expirations, not really a huge number overall, but you did highlight this quarter is coming in above your expectation. I suspect those might have been negotiated during a different economic backdrop. So, what does give you guys the confidence you can continue to achieve releasing spreads above historical levels, given sort of this tenants are catching up the reimbursement environments catching up, and it's just a little bit tougher overall for given some of the expense pressures, etc?
John Thomas: Yes, this is JT. The confidence level comes from, again, real time kind of market discussions, as you mentioned, most of leasing kind of has that is an 18-month conversation, before concludes, and we still have high construction costs. It is -- the growth in that construction cost is moderating. It's coming down to certain types of materials, some labor, but we still have a high inflation rate that's going to drive better lease experience for the foreseeable future. So well, that more kind of foreshadowing in our next call at the beginning of the year. But for now, we see continued positive trend at higher than usual rates.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Griffin: Maybe starting on the transaction market, it looks like things have obviously slowed. I'd be curious to get additional thoughts on, if you're seeing a private market appetite for MOBs out there. And maybe a sense of where cap rates if traded have sort of gone? And have you noticed the change in the spread between on versus off campus cap rates?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, the markets the most part is shut down. Right now, I mean, the interest rates have climbed dramatically since our most recent investments in the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter. Banks have shut down lending to the private market. So, while you can find a loan from small regional banks, you're not going to get large capacity for portfolios are their expensive assets. So assets, looking at cap rates. I think now the brokers have learned that it's going to best case scenario to six and if you look at the cost of debt, if you can even get it and the equity prices of the MOB buyers in the public market, you're in the 60s and 70s before it becomes accretive. And you match up capital market cost with going with seller expectations. They just haven't caught up there yet. So we've just paused. We're continuing with our development financing. We're about 200 million of total investments for the year. We're still working through some of our development pipeline. Again, assuming we can get kind of can match up our yield expectations and needs compared to our capital cost. And we expect next year to be pretty robust buyers market, if you will. So, market just as not pricing discovery continues. It's getting closer, but we're not there yet.
Michael Griffin: And maybe just staying on the recent transaction activity. I'd be curious to get a little more color on the Calko acquisition, maybe why it made sense? Also the JV partner and it could there be a potential for future opportunities with this partner going down the road and maybe an additional caller? They would be helpful.
Jeff Theiler: Yes, let me address the JV partner first. It's one of our long standing partners. As I mentioned earlier, we're in our 10th anniversary year as a public company. Are they beginning in year one we did, we started doing some one-on-one JV opportunities with them. That's a great sophisticated private company in Dallas that we've known for a long time and they found opportunities for us to co-invest and we sold them assets, we bought assets from them, etc. So a great partner they brought us into this opportunity. So if you recall, we had just completed the sale of Great Falls in Montana at 4.7% cap rate. This is an asset that wasn't Calko asset and Brooklyn was not on the market, when our JV partner started talking to them earlier this year. Expectations and fair expectations are in the low four cap rate range. By the time we were invited to join those discussions, we had just completed the Great Falls transaction. We needed a substantially better price than the low fours. We were able to commence seller to accept a first year 5.5% cap rate. There is a little bit of leasing opportunity there, not much, but long-term great investment grade tenant base, lot of physicians affiliated with that health system in the building, new asset, relatively new building less than nine years old in the Brooklyn market. And the opportunity for cap rate compression, once cap rates start going back in that direction, we thought are outstanding. So the IRRs look fantastic. And again, we just had that recent sale just perfect opportunity to recycle that cash, those proceeds, into a high yielding long-term asset.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes, thanks guys. Maybe just a follow-up on the Calko acquisition. Just curious how you're thinking about your weighted average cost of capital and how that compares to that 5.5 about for asset?
John Thomas: Yes, Josh. As I just mentioned, there was really an opportunity to roll 4.7% cap rate proceeds from an asset that would generate a very large net gain from that we have held for nine years to opportunistically rolling that cash into that investment. If we were pricing it today and we hadn't sold assets to recycle it in an accretive way like that, we would think about the pricing differently. If the trade has gone up 150 basis points since completed that transaction, so it's a different world, two months, three months later. But at the time, it was a perfect opportunity to roll that cash into an accretive acquisition. As I mentioned, we think about these investments on a 10 year plus IRR basis. And if you think about the long-term opportunity for compression in that market of a new asset, we think, it's outstanding long-term IRRs.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. But how are you thinking about your WAC these days? Where does it stand? How do you think about on a long-term basis?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Josh. So when we look at our weighted average cost of capital and use that to evaluate potential acquisitions, we are obviously looking at cost of equity, cost of debt. The cost of debt, debt markets are not super functional right now, but I think we could probably do long-term 10 year debt in the 6.5% to 7% range depending on what day it is. 10 years shopping all around these days. Cost of equity is obviously going to be higher than that, kind of look at a FAD yield plus expected growth rate. So we are looking at IRRs that are between 8% and 9% like a target range on a levered basis. And so I think that matches up pretty well with what JT was talking about when he was saying that cap rates need to be in the 6s and possibly 7s in order to be accretive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Rondel Camden] with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Just a couple of quick ones. Just starting on the debt side. Just looking at the stack here, I see the 262 million on the revolver. That's floating. I see the 105, that's floating as well. You guys are sort of thinking about next year. It sounds like every 1% moving rates on the floor is this is sort of 3.6 million of headwinds. How are you guys thinking about for the headwinds from that potentially next year? Are you thinking about hedging just curious?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, that's a good question. We've got about 18% variable rate debt which we're certainly cognizant of that especially as rates seem like they're going to continue to increase. We do like having some cushion a variable rate debt that's easy to pay down, if we have loan paybacks from our mezzanine program and that kind of thing. It's a good short-term use of proceeds that is kind of anti-dilutive when you get paid back. But certainly, that's something that we continue to evaluate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, hedging strategies, et cetera.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just continue to put together you know, some of the breadcrumbs on the same-store NOI front. I think sort of the previous question. I think you talked about some of the repositioning and stuff that that's being a drag a little bit from the historical 2%, maybe a little bit lower this quarter. But even if you get back to that 2% isn't there a scenario that basically AFFO or FFO is actually flattish next year or just. I'm just trying to think about the interest costs headwind versus the same store NOI growth. Am I thinking about that correctly? Or how do you guys think about it?
Jeff Theiler: I mean, like everyone, the freight interest rate headwinds as they continue to go up. I think the same store NOI, particularly if you add in some additional leasing opportunities that we think we might be able to get. We do believe we'd be able to overcome that kind of headwind, if you will. But certainly it's kind of a tight environment right now. Ideally, we get some creative acquisition opportunities as well, which could further enhance our FAD and FFO per share growth.
Unidentified Analyst: My last one is just go back to the transaction markets. You did some equity, it's sort of 18. Obviously, now, the stocks a little bit lower with the soft in the market. The fair to say that other than maybe sort of recycling assets, where you're selling to buy into it's sort of going to be tricky to do anything else going forward? Or is that like -- is there any sort of other sorts of capital JV capital that you guys are thinking about or a sort of recycling going to be the main driver from here?
Jeff Theiler: I think it depends, Jeff again. So, it depends on, kind of where we can find pricing in the market. I mean, there's certainly potential acquisition pricing that would work even at our cost of equity right now. We haven't seen it yet because the markets kind of shut down. But should the pricing go to there, I think using equity would be a viable way to do that. Certainly, we look at capital recycling as well. And we've been in contact with potential JV partners for years. And if we had an opportunity that we could avail ourselves of that source of capital, we would also consider that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: I'm going to touch back on an overall market rent. I mean, for MLPs I mean, how broad base is rank growth? I mean, is it really regional, I mean, are you seeing it like there's a difference between on campus off campus? I mean, how much has it been on up really in 2022? And have you seen it accelerated through the end of this year?
John Thomas: Mike, it's JT. I'll let Mark comment as well. It's market to market. And it's kind of where you're starting from, that's why, it's not like rent growth slowed down, because this quarter was 6%, last quarter was 8%. It's the least is coming due and where they are in their current market compared to the existing market. Nationwide, construction costs are high, those markets that are the strongest Atlanta, Minneapolis, some of the smiley face markets, Phoenix, are growing at faster rates than others, but they never seeing opportunities really across the board. So, it's -- we do expect that to continue. And, again, it's going to be quarter by quarter, but also market by market and where the optics are, as you know, most of our acquisitions come with new 10 year leases, so we only have so much rolled each year, to be able to capture this rent growth opportunities. And then those tenants, as we mentioned, where they have, options to renew that either fixed rates or a current plus 2% kind of role or some kind of market rent kind of arbitration process that changes that dynamic, again, just based upon the leases in place. So it really across the board, the opportunity across the country, though, is to roll rents up in most markets, assuming where we were at market rates. CommonSpirit is an example. We did struck those 10 year leases in 2016. Those were all struck based upon the market rates in place in those individual markets at that time. So, again, all of those should be growing at faster rates today.
Mark Theine: Yes, I think it also varies a little bit by specialty of the tenant as well, where there's higher acuity specialty and more custom build out. Those are very sticky spaces, and therefore have a little bit more opportunity to influence the rental rate upon renewal. Just the alternative and the construction cost to relocate, those are very difficult and especially and expensive in today's market. So you have a little bit more of an opportunity to increase based on specialty.
John Thomas: Yes, and Mike, the other thing I mentioned is, the difference went on and off campus, I will tell you, most of our development, financing is off campus sale systems are trying to penetrate new markets and capture market share is they came out of the pandemic with balance sheet strength. And so, I'd say there's probably more opportunity off campus, new groves locations, while there's still strength in the on campus buildings as well. We're about 50/50s, we have, kind of see, both sides of that.
Michael Carroll: Yes, that's all fine. Now, it's probably difficult to kind of answer this now just because the market is so uncertain. But to current market rents today, can you support a new development project or break ground a new development project given where things are right now? Or does rent need to go up a certain percentage to really kind of make some of that underwriting workout?
John Thomas: You hit the nail on the head. The projects we finance are highly preleased, 90% plus, most of them are at 100% with system anchor tenant, and they're approaching that or we're approaching that on the yield on cost basis, and then comparing that to the actual construction costs. And comparing that to market rents, which are, by definition today are going to be higher than kind of an existing building. But as I mentioned, these are health systems trying to capture new market share and expand in locations geographies where they don't exist today. So, it's a balancing act. So, we're only going to fund those where we're comfortable that that spread to an existing building can be achieved in the services that the health system is going to put in those buildings. And I think all of the things we are looking at right now have ambulatory surgery centers in them, and partnered with physicians partnered with orthopedic surgeons. So, there are high margin services moving into those locations. So it's a balance of something that we have to be careful about in our underwriting and we are confident that we are.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then just how difficult it is to probably source new acquisitions? I mean, are you seeing other opportunities on the debt side? I mean, could we expect you to be a little bit more active making debt investments over the next few quarters? Or do you really need to see where interest rates kind of really hammer out before you are willing to do even that type of stuff?
John Thomas: I think that's a great question, Mike. And I think we have historically made that investments either as part of development or part of a recap of the seller who's not ready to sell, but is willing to raise your partner with us in some kind of economic basis. Most of the private activity -- because we have been competing more with private buyers in the last three to five years than we have with public buyers, most of that activity at high cap rates was done with low cost debt that was three to five year debt. So just do the math. We are looking at 2023, 2024 probably an opportunity to step in very beneficial way for high debt or higher yielding debt or acquisition opportunities at profitable cap rates. So that's what we are excited about next year and the following year both in operations, but also the opportunity to deploy capital, again assuming the capital markets that open up for us to match to fund that.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. So this was touched on a little bit, but just back on the question on the components of the same-store cash NOI growth. Because last quarter you had same store revs up, call it, 4% operating expenses up 8% to get to the 1.9. This quarter revs up 1.4%, operating expenses much more in line and only up 2% to get to that 1.1%. You talked about the reasons why that's where it is for the quarter. That's all kind of understood. I guess the question is, if you had to crystal ball this for next year just the round numbers. I mean, what are the components just on the revenue growth and expense growth to get really kind of same-store NOI will kind of shake out for next year, once the dust settles on the re-tenanting and everything else?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I'll take that. So I think next year we do think that there is going to be a nice rebound in our same-store. Our operating expenses this quarter were particularly low because of some of the real estate tax challenges that we were successful in contesting on behalf of our healthcare partners. Without those real estate tax benefits, we would have been closer to 7% increase in our operating expenses and it is an inflationary environment out there, we will continue to work on behalf of our healthcare partners to keep those operating expenses as low as we can. But the nice thing about our portfolio is that it's very well insulated due to our high occupancy and triple net lease structure. So we think that those operating expense increases next year will be offset. And therefore really going to benefit from the leasing work we have done both in terms of the new leases coming online, the 85,000 square feet I mentioned and these leasing spreads. And so, I think in 2023, we will start to see the benefit of that and get back to our normal levels or even just a bit above our normal levels in the back half of next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: I have two quick leasing related questions. First, Mark, on your comment about same-store occupancy bottoming in the fourth quarter, what's the rough magnitude of the decline relative to 3Q 94.7%? And the second question is, just on the rent escalators, you've baked into your 2022 leasing. How do they compare to prior years escalators?
Mark Theine: Yes. So on the first part, in the Q4 occupancy, we do know of our retention rate is historically 80%. So, we know that there's going to be some move out, but we're going to offset that with some new leases as well. We've got 20,000 square feet of leases signed, that'll come online in Q4. But we do think same-store will bottom, occupancy will bottom next quarter and then rebound in 2023. In terms of our annual escalations, our leasing team did an outstanding job this quarter averaging 3.1% and much better than our historical averages in the 2% to 3%. We're really pushing three and even four sometimes, and we can get it on our annual escalators to build in that long-term growth over a 5- to 10-year lease.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Mark, I wanted to go back to the suite turnover that you talked about and the retaining that will drive some of the results in 2023. Was there something that drove this year to be a higher amount of turnover within the portfolio? I would think that would be kind of a recurring natural thing for you guys. So curious about, how you view that in the next year or two versus maybe what made this year a bigger year of that turnover?
Mark Theine: Yes, I don't know that this was necessarily that much bigger of leasing volume or turnover. And next year, we've got about 4.6% of our lease is up for renewal, that's kind of been our average, and our lease expiration schedules been 3% to 4% a year, until we get to 2026 in those CommonSpirit leases. So right now, there's just been construction timing of the new leases completing those and starting rent payments.
John Thomas: Yes, this is JT. I think, part of the dynamic is. So like the ASC option here, they were probably looking at building their own building or kind of going into a new development at higher rents, as we talked about development financing we're doing with health systems that are capable of absorbing those higher rents, but doing much larger buildings and footprint. So, high construction costs makes moving into an existing building, a better option or repurposing an existing building a better option than a brand new development project. So, I think that's probably driving some of these changes. And to do that, if you need 20,000 square feet, we don't have 20,000 square feet available in the building. And we are going to have to eliminate or non-renew some leases to make that happen.
Dave Rodgers: And then JT, maybe just for you, with regard to you talked about kind of fully leased acquisitions, you've got fully stabilized developments that you're financing. Do you see an opportunity between that to do more maybe on the value add side with the leasing team you have and the people that are in the organization to maybe add incremental value particularly coming out of the backside of the dislocation and pricing?
John Thomas: No, I think we're exploring all those opportunities. Again, right now that kind of investment pipeline is still there. It's just quiet -- and sellers, if they're not forced to sell right now we're trying to ride it out as well. Again, but I think we'll see more buying opportunities next year. But now we've always looked for opportunities where building might be 80% leased, but we have a tenant in hand. We have so much repeat business and so much, aggregation of business with hospitals all over the country and with physicians groups in multiple locations. So I'm kind of always looking for an opportunity to buy an 80% occupied building and backfill with a lease in hand with an existing client. So that is a great comment, great suggestion and something we explore often.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
John Thomas: Doug, I appreciate it. Thank you everyone for joining us. We'd like to welcome to the Doc family [Kew] and his wife had a young baby girl last night. We're just excited for him. [Kew] leads our credit efforts and he will be back doing credit analysis tomorrow, I'm sure. Now, [Kew] will take appropriate amount of time and get to know this new daughter and we just appreciate everybody joining us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Page, Senior Vice President, General Counsel. Thank you, Sir. You may begin.
Bradley Page: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust second quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. Joining me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, Chief Investment Officer; Mark Theine, Executive Vice President, Asset Management; John Lucey, Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer; Lori Becker, Senior Vice President and Controller; and Dan Klein, Deputy Chief Investment Officer.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over the company's CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Physicians Realty Trust continue to deliver stable and reliable cash flow growth during the second quarter, driven by exceptional leasing spreads of 8% on 256,000 square feet of renewals and our asset management team's thoughtful management of operational expenses. These results will be impressive in any period, but are especially remarkable in an economic climate made challenging by double-digit inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. Doc was built with times like these in mind, where we have a foundation of strength with almost 300 facilities in 36 states, 95% leased and no meaningful debt maturities before our revolving line of credit matures in 2025. Our balance sheet couldn’t be stronger supplemented by the recent Great Falls Disposition. In addition, we remain protected from inflation operating expense growth, given our portfolio is 95% leased rate with only 2% exposed to full service, gross leases impacted by inflation. We don't believe that any other healthcare real estate portfolio public or private can come close to providing investors with that level of cash flow stability. In past periods of volatility provide any lesson to real estate investors, it is that there is almost always a timing disconnect between the changes in investor's cost of capital and potential seller's expectations on valuation. This scenario is precisely what we've seen in the first half of 2022, and while Doc has chosen to remain disciplined in our deployment of capital toward new investments. However, this discipline does not mean we have been passive as volatility can also create opportunity. A great example of this strategy is our just announced disposition of a surgical hospital and two adjacent medical office buildings in Great Falls, Montana. Mark will share more details in a moment. We are beginning to see evidence that rational investors like Doc are shifting the transaction market to a more balanced bid versus us. We've made progress in advancing our pipeline accordingly and remain focused on the development of highly pre-leased outpatient care facilities anchored by our existing investment grade health system partners. Our pipeline for development financing currently includes over $100 million in potential commitments. It finalized construction of these projects will begin in 2023, and we have more opportunities in discussion. Our acquisition pipeline for stabilized assets remains muted while price discovery in this environment continues. Still, we remain confident in our full-year investment guidance, including development commitments and acquisitions of at least $250 million with the potential for more. Despite the challenges of the current economic climate, we continue to execute consistently on our overall ESG strategy with the recent publication of our third annual ESG report and recognize the critical need to invest in healthy, physical and social spaces for our communities. Within our ESG report, we have substantially enhanced our disclosures by aligning with the global reporting initiative while expanding our reporting within the frameworks of the sustainability accounting standards board and task force on climate-related financial disclosures. We adopted a climate mitigation plan recognized by this science-based targets initiative in line with a well below two degree Celsius strategy. This increased transparency provided a better understanding of our impacts on the environment and society and the direct economic benefits to our tenants. We've taken bold steps to build upon our DE&I efforts to shape an open and diverse internal culture while setting aggressive multi-year goals to chart our progress. While we're proud to celebrate our milestones, we recognize that our progress is simply a step forward for Doc as we continue to invest in better in our communities and families. We remain firm in our conviction that outpatient care of medical office facilities leads to investment-grade tenants offers the best risk adjusted returns in real estate. We seek to improve the quality of our portfolio with each investment decision we make. We will continue to focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders while ultimately getting the portfolio to a 100% concentration in outpatient care facilities over time. Before opening the call to Q&A, Jeff Theiler will share our financial results and Mark Theine will provide more detail on our exceptional operating performance. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2022, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $63.7 million or $0.27 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $61 million, an increase of 11% over the comparable quarter of last year and our FAD per share was $0.26. In the broader economy, we now have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and whether this will technically be defined later on as a recession is unclear. It is clear however that we are in highly uncertain times. The economic experts are debating whether we have bigger inflation problems or recession problems and while we hope for a soft landing like everyone else, we have positioned our portfolio to perform well in any scenario. With the sale of the Great Falls hospital, we have improved the percentage of our rent from investment grade quality entities to 66%. This is far better than any other healthcare REIT and will provide exceptional stability to our rental income. Alongside with safety we also see green shoots of growth in an industry typically defined by more modest rent increases. The 8% leasing spreads in the current role should lead to increasing internal growth in the quarters to come and alongside this enhanced rent growth, we are well shielded from inflationary increases in operating expenses based on our lease structure and high occupancy. 98% of our leases are protected from expense pressures through their triple net structure and our expense loss to vacancy is only 5%. Our overall capital structure is designed to be conservative while providing the flexibility needed to grow our company when the time is right. We have eliminated virtually all refinancing risks over the next three years and currently maintain a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.65 times, which will be reinforced with the $116 million of cash proceeds from the Great Fall sale. We also raised $18 million on the ATM this quarter at an average price of $18.61 to help fund our acquisition pipeline. With that, I'll turn it Mark to walk through the details of the Great Fall sale and other operations. Mark?
Mark Theine: All right. Thanks, Jeff. We're proud to announce another very successful quarter of growth, driven by our long term strategy of partnering directly with high quality health systems and physician groups to meet their real estate needs. At the heart of this strategy, is an acute focus on improving the overall quality of our real estate portfolio, operating results and relationships. We successfully made progress on all three of these initiatives this quarter as demonstrated by one; the profitable sale of the Great Falls clinic facilities, two, achievement of record releasing spreads and three, excellent Kingsley Tenant satisfaction survey results. Starting with the Great Falls disposition; since our first investment in 2013, we have watched the Great Falls clinic grow as an essential provider of care to the people of Great Falls, the State of Montana, and even patients from Canada. Over time, we ultimately acquired three facilities on this campus for a blended 7.9% cap rate, consisting of inpatient surgical hospital, an ambulatory surgery center and a medical office building. The facilities were 100% occupied and leased to the Great Falls clinic, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Surgery Partners. In 2019 Doc began discussions with the Great Falls clinic leadership team about a potential expansion to the hospital and surgery center facilities. Under the leadership of Dave Domres, our VP of Construction and Project Management, Doc assisted in the design, coordination and financing arrangements of these expansions in exchange for new long-term leases covering the entire campus. These lease extensions executed in September and October of 2021 increased the overall annual rental revenue, increased the existing annual rent escalator by 50 basis points and extended the term to 20 years at each facility. Through the value created with these new leases, Doc ultimately was able to opportunistically sell the existing facilities and future development expansion last month for approximately $116.3 million in net proceeds representing a gain on sale of $53.9 million, a 4.7% disposition cap rate, and a 16% unlevered IRR. As Jeff mentioned, the proceeds from this sale provides capital to recycle into accretive future acquisitions. It also improves the quality of our portfolio and the security of our cash flows by increasing our investment grade tendency to 66%. The life cycle of this investment is an outstanding example of the value created by the Doc team through its active asset management and trusted healthcare relationships. Our leasing team also continues to leverage trusted healthcare relationships and market knowledge to unlock the value of the Doc portfolio through strong tenant retention and lease renewal spreads. During the second quarter, our leasing team completed 256,000 square feet of lease renewals on the consolidated portfolio at an aggregate releasing spread of 8.0%, the highest quarterly mark in the company's history. Importantly, we achieve these results without sacrificing retention or leasing costs. In total tenant improvements and incentive packages total just $2.19 per square foot per year on renewals, well below industry averages, as we continue to focus on net effective rent as the most important measure of total leasing performance while tenant retention of 76% is in line with long-term medical office averages. Given the strong demand for outpatient real estate, both on and off campus, we remain committed to unlocking the full value of our real estate through leasing. When appropriate, this strategy includes the selective vacating of suites that have higher rental potential with different tenants even if that impacts same-store metrics on a short term basis. Looking forward to the second half of 2022, we expect lease renewal spreads to continue to be between 5% and 7% as the cost of new construction continues to outpace the benefit of renewing leases in place. Simply stated, we believe this is the strongest leasing market in the company's history, and we are optimistic about our pricing power in the years ahead. At the portfolio level MOB same-store NOI growth was 1.9% in the second quarter. The NOI was driven primarily by a year-over-year 2.1% increase in base rental revenue. Operating expenses were up 8.0% slightly below the 9.1% year-over-year CPI change as of June 30. As expected, increased operating expenses were largely offset by an 8.7% increase in expense recovery revenue due to the high occupancy and triple net structure of our portfolio. In the nine years since our IPO, we have not only built one of the highest quality healthcare real estate portfolios in the industry, but we have also assembled an award-winning healthcare real estate team. Our efforts directly translate into care for tenants, evident in our 2022 Kingsley Associates tenant satisfaction survey results. This year we surveyed nearly 320 tenants representing approximately 5.5 million square feet. Physicians Realty Trust received an impressive 74% response rate compared to the industry average of approximately 55% this year. In addition, we beat the Kingsley index in every property management category, including overall management satisfaction with a score of 4.48 out of 5.0. While we sincerely appreciate the positive feedback from our healthcare partners, the surveys that we actually value the most offer opportunities for improvements and where we can invest in better in order to earn our tenant's trust and secure their renewal before the lease expiration. At Doc, we believe that great customer service does not happen by accident. It happens by design and it all starts with the great team dedicated to our mission to help medical providers, developers and shareholders realize better healthcare, better communities and better returns. With that, I'll turn the call back to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Michelle. We're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just hoping to start on the releasing spreads, obviously a great number. Just curious on as part of those negotiations, what kind of annual rent increases you're getting and is there any shift away from a fix towards a more of a floating structure, maybe with a cap collar? So just curious on a little bit more fuller details on those lease negotiations.
Mark Theine: Sure. Good morning, Juan. This is Mark. So yeah, we're really proud of our leasing team's efforts this quarter and seeing really strong leasing momentum to achieve those 8% releasing spreads. In addition to focused on the initial rate, when the renewal kicks off we're also focused on the annual escalators you mentioned. In fact, two thirds of our lease escalators this quarter had a rent bump of 3% or higher. So we're excited about the compounding cash flow from those embedded annual escalators going forward. And, we do try and put a lot of CPI adjustments into our new lease renewals that does come with sometimes the floor and the ceiling. And in the negotiations now I'd say, since the CBI number's been even higher than anticipated we're getting requests for more fixed escalators and those we're now pushing back in the 4% range on leases going forward.
Juan Sanabria: So how quickly do you think you can get towards like a 3% plus escalator? Should we just think of it as looking at your average least term and the 5% rolling and thinking that those go 3% plus versus I think you said [indiscernible] at quarter end.
Jeff Theiler: Yeah Juan. It's JT, it's an incremental growth across the portfolio. Walt's [ph] always been a good thing until the last couple of years. So with only 2% rolling this year, 3% next year, but it is incrementally growing. Before this year, we had about 10% of the portfolio on CPI increasers and that's a strategy we implemented four years ago as we started doing new generation and renewal leasing. So it'll take time, but I think the higher increases may get us quicker than we thought.
Juan Sanabria: And then just on the investments pipeline and dispositions, still sticking to the guidance, I'm assuming that it sounds like it's going to be more development commitment. Yeah, right now -- we're right -- I was going to say is the dollar amount that you'd previously targeted? Is that more the commitment dollars we should be thinking about you allocating or actual spend on which you'll earn yield on in this current year?
John Thomas: It includes the future development commitments and really always has. We maybe have not made that as clear as we should, but we think we'll clear $250 million of development commitments and/or acquisitions this year, probably 50-50 weighted, maybe a little bit more toward the development commitments. Most of those dollars, the development dollars will be spent in 2023 and those will start generating returns in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning, everybody. Just curious how the disposition in Montana came about, how long that deal was in the works, and then maybe if you could just speak to like the depth of the buyer pool?
John Thomas: Yeah. We've been really proud of that facility. Mark kind of walk through the history of it. It was one of our first investments in the surgical hospital out there and then there's a separate MOB with an ambulatory surgeon center in it, all on the same campus and then a fairly large medical office building. We've been working with the physicians and who were co-owners out there again for eight years. So we really hadn't had a plan to sell it. It was a very high yielding asset, but we'd been approached by a number of potential buyers and then just started exploring some price discovery with them, and frankly, those exceeded our expectations. So it wasn't a plan disposition, but, really an opportunity. So I need to pull really deep. I think we kind of once we started getting some offers that were attractive, we kind of took it to a broader market. So, there's still a broad pool out there and again, we're excited, the new owners are people we trust to take care of those physicians and that's important to us.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then, so with sort of this sale, I guess, and the majority, or sorry, half of the capital needs on the $250 million being spent next year, does this Montana sale kind of meet the capital needs now for the year? Or are there other deals you're contemplating given the strong pricing you achieved here on this transaction?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Austin, I'll take that. This is Jeff. Look, we're always looking at opportunistic dispositions. The Great Falls sale takes us down in terms of leverage about a quarter turn. So that puts us in a really good position to fund our acquisition pipeline through the remainder of the year, but that said, we have been getting inbounds on various assets, and so we always look at opportunistically selling something to help fund our pipeline.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then just one clarification. I couldn't make out what the development financing pipeline is today. Could you share that figure again?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, it's over a $100 million today and we've got some other opportunities that we're kind of deep in negotiations on. So, I think we're -- we felt like we might can get to a $100 million, $150 million, commitments this year. Most of those dollars be spent next year and I think we're on a good track to do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Connor Siversky: Morning out there. Thanks for having me on the call. Just to clarify, the $65.8 million you have in real estate held for sale on the balance sheet for Q2 that did not include the payment assets, correct?
Jeff Theiler: Oh, no, it did. It did include those assets.
Connor Siversky: Okay. Okay.
Jeff Theiler: Where a subsequent event, the sale does.
John Thomas: They went under contract and then didn't close, went under a contract in the second quarter, didn't close till subsequent event. So we had to put it in held for sale at that point.
Connor Siversky: Okay. And then, on the broad subject of, of cap rate expansion, I'm just wondering on a market-by-market basis, if you're seeing any more upward pressure, in any market in particular versus others.
John Thomas: Yeah. There's hot markets like the Texas market continues to be high, Florida continues to be high, the Atlantas continues to be strong, but you really across the board and we're seeing more and more assets that were for sale that went kind off market, i.e. under LOI or kind of contemplated transactions and then have seen some of those assets come back to market at potentially better cap rates for the buyer. So I think, we're still in that price discovery phase, but there's still a strong bit out there for medical office buildings for.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yeah. Something to drill down into the development interest that you're tracking in the marketplace. Is it more difficult for Doc to find those types of investments just given the higher construction costs that's harder to pencil out those deals or are most of those deals more strategic in the actual cost for the health system or the developer is not as important as you would typically think?
John Thomas: Yeah, Mike, obviously cost is important to, to everybody, but these are all related to health system expansion, strategic expansions. I think they're all but one or a 100% pre-leased by the health system and the other one is heavily preleased to a health system, with a clear track on where the physicians will come from to fill that space. Construction costs is high. These are all yield on cost transactions. That's the way, I'm a little hesitant to say exactly what the commitments are because some in the end maybe determine they're too expensive based upon kind of current market rents but, these are all heavily preleased strategic developments with high revenue outpatient surgical services that the hospitals want to pursue. So kind of a balanced approach. We're not out there to inspect development. We're not out there and our funding, comes with signed leases and with this signed GMP contract where we know exactly what the cost is going to be.
Michael Carroll: Has your yields, the yields that you demand for those, initial funding and takeout acquisitions opportunity has, have those changed given what happened with interest rates.
John Thomas: Yeah. Those are trying to move up.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then, you talked about this in your prepared remarks. I'm not sure if I missed this part, I know you said that the market is still in a price discovery mode right now. How long do you think it's going to take for you to or the market to better understand where cap rates are? I'm not sure. Did you indicate of how much you think cap rates have increased so far or where you expect them to kind of settle out at?
John Thomas: Yeah, I think we're starting to see assets that underwrite well and that we're attracted to that are, starting to movement to well north of five, but mid fives to high fives are kind of -- we're starting to see more and more of that. Those aren’t always reflect the kind of quality and credit that we want to pursue. But, it's rare that we see -- we still get a lot of ask for the low fours, but I don't think anybody's out there paying low fours for assets right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Griffin: Hey, thanks for checking the question. Just going back to the 250,000 of renewals, can you talk about maybe what drove that? Was there any specific tenant types? Were they looking for expansions staying in their existing space? Any additional color on that would be great.
Mark Theine: Yeah. Michael, Mark here, I'll take that one. So on the renewals, the 256,000 square feet represented a retention rate of 77% and we do expect that the tenants are looking to stay in place in their existing suites now, especially as John was just mentioning, the construction costs are rising. So it's become more expensive to relocate. Supply chain challenges that made it, difficult to relocate from a timing perspective as well. And so that's also -- the combination of those two things are helping us to push on our leasing spreads while, keeping retention high. So these are existing tenants and I'd say our customer service and property management team does a great job keeping these tenants happy and then renewing in their space for the long term.
Michael Griffin: Great. That's helpful. And then on the real estate technology fund investment mentioned in the release, can you maybe expand on that a little bit what that is, maybe a continuing focused on investment in technology in your business? Some additional color there would be great.
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. Michael, this is Jeff. So it was a relatively small investment in a real estate technology fund that's run by Fifth Wall. It actually has a lot of other REITs and real estate companies as LPs. And while we think the investment itself will perform well, the primary reason for the investment is to just get an early look at, the real estate technologies that are out there. So you get enhanced access and early access to these types of technologies and, ultimately what we'd like to do is just enhance the efficiency of our operations and our portfolio. So we think it's a win-win from both access to these technologies as well as a, a good return.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I guess with your, bullish comments that were in one of the strongest leasing environments in the history of the company and that releasing spread are trending quite favorably, just hoping you can maybe give some more color on just the context of that in the fact that the operating expenses in the same-store data we're up 8% year-over-year. So I guess with the better, you know, leasing environment is also higher cost. I guess the question is at the end of the day, if same store cash NOI growth is kind of hanging around that 2% to 3% range with the better leasing environment, could that accelerate or do higher expenses kind of offset that, and you kind of maintain that same sort of cash NOI growth up the next couple of years. Just want to get more thoughts around that. Thanks.
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, Steve, it's a great question. So as Mark alluded to, kind of high construction costs and higher kind of the opportunities for other space at much higher rates allows us to push kind of retention rates that or retention renewal rates at a higher cost. At the end of the day, there's a total to your point the total cost of occupancy that the tenant bear, the hospital system, investment grade tenants, like we like to least to can bear, so that's why service to those tenants and managing the operating cost and expenses, the best we can really matters really paying attention to the energy cost of the building, the utility cost generally. So, the more we can do to help hold those costs down, the more we can kind of push on the rent side as well in a balanced way. So, 8% is an outstanding number. I think it's a little unique to some of the particular buildings and leases that were impacted by that 8%, but we are seeing, 5% and 6% for the next couple of quarters. So it'll be a balance over time, but for the foreseeable future, we see the real opportunity to do that while at the same time, impressing our tenants with management of the operating expenses to hold those down the best we can.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. Got it. Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Kramer: Hey guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess kind of a little bit similar to the prior question, but just kind of looking at this quarter same-store NOI number, I think a little bit below kind of maybe, maybe what we were expecting and I think others as well. And I think, maybe below kind of the historical trends that you guys have kind of performed at as well, wondering if there's anything in that number, that maybe brought it a little bit lower and then kind of just thinking broader higher level, right, it's really positive leasing momentum you guys are doing. When do we kind of start to see that, I guess in kind of the same-store NOI quarterly figures?
Mark Theine: Adam is Mark, I'll take that. That's a great question. Our same-store number that's quarter 1.9 is slightly below our historical average in our rent bump around 2.4% and, as we were mentioning about the leasing results we're really excited about the leasing momentum that we have because what's pulling our same-store down this quarter is a slight dip in our occupancy of that same-store portfolio. So looking forward at the leasing momentum, we've had, we actually have a 100,000 square feet of leases that are executed, but not yet commenced. They're under construction and so we're excited that those leases will be coming on later this year in early part of 2023 and, just looking if you had performed all those 100,000 square feet as paying rent today our same-store would've been about 2.8% this quarter. So there's a nice pipeline coming of leases that are under construction. And as you know, these leasing results lag just a little bit until the cash flow starts. Yeah to be clear under construction is the TI build outs. So…
Adam Kramer: That's really helpful guys. And I think that's really helpful to be able to kind of quantify the 2.8 number. Are you able to kind of give a obviously not exact number, maybe more of a range of kind of the cash NOI that this development would yields bridging to that 2.8% from the 1.9%?
Mark Theine: Yeah. So the new developments technically our yield on cost of 6% plus, I'm not sure that's the question you are asking, but that's in the new developments, those numbers tend to be more than 6% and much higher than kind of current acquisition cap rates.
Adam Kramer: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe switching gears a little bit and just the final one here just the opportunity send in the loan book, maybe comparing that, today versus call it three, six, twelve months ago, and how things may have changed.
Mark Theine: Yeah. So the loan book a little unusual a year ago, because we had $50 million out in as part of the landmark mezzanine loans that was kind of the first step towards the eventual acquisition of that portfolio. We do see some opportunities, again, some of them are mezzanine, excuse me, some of our development financings is really in the form of mezzanine financing at a higher yielding rate as part of the capital stack of those projects. Some of our development is kind of loan owned or owned where we are funding, the development directly off our books and it's greater opportunity to deploy more capital. So we're seeing more -- we're seeing more loan opportunities, but last year was kind of an unusually high number because of landmark and that went away as part of that acquisition.
Adam Kramer: Really helpful guys. Thanks again for the time. Chat soon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Yeah. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on the leasing spreads. JT, you made a comment just a couple minutes ago regarding next couple of quarters had some good visibility, but there were some unique things about the assets that drove the bigger increases. So I guess the first question is, do you not really see that continuing into next year? Is that just kind of cautiousness and then maybe Mark, this would be a better question for you on the rent spreads that you've achieved in the escalator increases. Is there anything unique between on campus or off campus or single tenant or multi-tenant that's driving those numbers higher in the second half of this year?
Mark Theine: Yeah, my comments, you said at earlier cost just, again, right now for the foreseeable future, we're seeing lots 4%, 5%kind of 6% opportunities for roll up. In some cases it's just a function of which markets where the buildings are and, however more aggressively we can push those rates. I'll let Jeff answer the -- or excuse me, I'll let Mark answer the second after the question.
Mark Theine: Yeah. So looking forward for our leasing spreads in the back of the year, you think we'll be looking at, 5% to 7% releasing spreads on target, which is as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. In terms of, what we're seeing single tenant multitenant or single tenants typically have very long leases, we don't have too many single tenant renewals right now. So primarily our leasing activity is in the multi-tenant buildings and not seeing too much difference in the on campus versus off campus. Again, we're really paying attention to what the overall market rate is for the particular location of that asset.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. So first of all, just on acquisitions, your target for the year versus where you are right now, you seem to be running a little bit behind if you would, let me use those words. I'm just kind of curious, is it the whole kind of price discovery scenario right now that's making you maybe not be as aggressive, but maybe, you expect to have better acquisition volumes in the back half of '22.
John Thomas: I can't say a better time. So, there's lots of -- we've seen lots of opportunities. It's just, seller's expectations are a year out of date right now. So we're starting to see more and more. We're getting closer to closer on kind of a bit an ask that works for us and that, will work for the seller. So the second half of the year you'll see more acquisitions.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then just curious, in markets where you tend to overlap, HTA and HR, but just kind of curious, kind of post-merger, what are you hearing from hospital systems in those markets? So what are you seeing in regards to how the merge MTD may be competing differently and again, how are you guys kind of responding to that? If anything is changing at all?
John Thomas: Well, a lot of our development opportunities are coming from health systems who are looking for kind of expansion and strategic relocation of some of their practices. We're seeing some other opportunities in some markets that are more acquisition in nature and back filling billings that are less than occupied by those health systems where they would be interested in occupying them more. If we were the owner. We'll see some opportunities.
Omotayo Okusanya: So you actually think that that's actually going to create more opportunities for you because physician practices and hospital systems are looking for alternatives to that.
John Thomas: Yeah. I don't know if they're looking for alternatives to others. I just think we're working closely with several health systems on opportunities just like that. So either new development on and off campus or occupying more space and existing buildings that are kind of that they are in today, but are will move more space into it, but you own the buildings in the future.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. And the last one for me, just can any updates from a regulatory perspective, anything changing from a Medicare reimbursement or commercial insurance or reimbursement perspective that potentially could impact physicians and hospital systems that maybe we should be aware of?
John Thomas: Yeah, so we're not directly impacted by the inpatient rates, but that certainly affects the P&L of our health systems, which again we 66% of our space or leased to health systems, that's outpatient space, but, CMS did readjust their proposals for next year. I think they came out in the last week, so that's a 4.3% bump, which is filled probably still not enough to cover existing inflation and nurses salaries in particular, but it is much better than it was last year. Commercial insurance, again, talking to the health systems that shared that data with us about their ongoing negotiations, those are growing in the, 5% to 6% or more rate depending upon the market. So we're still waiting on CMS to kind of their proposal on the physician reimbursement was lower than it should be. But they always start low and kind of works higher by the time the final rule. So we would expect that to improve as well again, reflecting inflation. And then the outpatient surgery space, they're looking at about a 3% bump and I'm sure they'll try to fight for some more as well and again, that's for Medicare. So commercial insurance rates should grow at a pace in excessive 3% for those outpatient surgery center operators that we have so many -- that we lay so much space to.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey everyone. Thanks for the question. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about debt needs over the next 18 months and what kind of rates you could potentially achieve?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. Hey Josh, this is Jeff. The nice thing about our lease maturity schedule is there's no refinancing or anything coming up over the next I guess over three years. So there's no refinancing needs. Right now we were comfortable where we are in the line. So I don't know that there's necessarily a need to term out that debt. It's hard to say exactly what long term rates -- what our 10-year rates would be right now, just because there isn't a whole lot of activity in the market. So there's not a lot of visibility. We would guess maybe 5% or so give or take. So like I said, I don't think, we'll need to use it, but that's where we see rates right now.
Joshua Dennerlein: I've noticed some other REITs in like the net lease space kind of like term loans. Like, would you do like 10-year or worse like a term loan, if you needed to term out the line kind of look attracted?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. If we decided that we wanted to term out the line, we'd probably look, the term loans, a better execution right now than 10-year debt. I thought you were just asking about 10-year costs.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Sorry. I was probably too specific just to get a sense of where cost of capital is across all the companies. So appreciate that. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks.
John Thomas: Thank you, Michelle. Thanks for everybody for joining us today. We're excited about the prospects of the third quarter and look forward to seeing you at the investor conferences and on the next earning call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Physicians Realty Trust is off to a strong start to 2022. Our operating platform continues to perform exceptionally well with operating cash flow at peak levels and occupancy near all-time highs at 95.2%.  Despite the interest rates that have accelerated in an unprecedented pace, seller expectations on cap rates have barely budged if at all limiting quarterly investments to $23 million as we maintain discipline in deploying capital in this volatile capital market.  The DOC portfolio was built with a focus on the long-term. Our shareholders benefit in the short-term from actual cash flows and long-term from disciplined accretive growth in both assets and cash flow. Unlike other sectors, the DOC portfolio remains full – near full occupancy and our headline growth rates are not the results of cash flow lost during the pandemic.  Our buildings have remained full and performing during authentic growth through a focus on net effective rent, financing accretive development of medical office facilities and selective external accretive acquisitions.  Historically, growth in medical office rental rates have been generally limited to 2% to 3%, both in annual lease rate increases and renewal spreads. Any growth in excess of this range has typically required excessive incentive packages that have served to increase headline rents at the expense of net effective rent actually reducing total cash flow.  We have and continue to resist the temptation to embrace short-term measures that improve quarterly statistics at the expense of long-term growth and firmly believe that this is the right approach that best benefits our shareholders.  That’s why I am excited to share that we see for the first time in my 20 years of experience in medical office, the opportunity to organically grow lease level cash flows by more than 3%. Amy Hall, our Senior Vice President of Leasing and Physician Strategy will share more information in a few minutes about our experience year-to-date and our expectations looking forward.  DOC’s pipeline of finance development is deeper than ever. Our strategy for development has been to align our interest to third-party developers and health systems by financing projects directly at a cost that allows for initial rents that are in line with market while providing our shareholders with accretive returns. These accretive returns come initially in the form of the development yield, but later in the form of an attractive purchase option.  It is a deliberate decision that we don’t self-perform development as we don’t want to compete with the many great developers that we partner with that serve our health system and physician clients. This also benefits our shareholders as we avoid the significant G&A cost of a development team that would be both cyclical and redundant with the skills of our clients.  On our last call, we forecasted $250 million to $500 million of new investments in 2022 inclusive of stabilized acquisitions and new developments. As of today, we estimate we will have the opportunity to finance projects that will cost approximately $160 million to build and will have value in excess of $200 million once online in 2023 and 2024.  The pipeline is highlighted by pre-leased health systems anchored medical office facilities and ambulatory surgical suites in fast-growing top 20 MSAs. While construction costs are inflating, our projects are financed on a yield on cost basis that is higher than acquisition cap rates with a GMP construction contract in place.  Development momentum remains strong in today’s rate environment as providers understand that they need more outpatient surgical and diagnostic facilities outside of the four walls of the in-patient hospital. This is appropriate clinically as it moves [care to] (ph) the lowest cost setting while preserving precious hospital resources for the treatment of infectious disease and provision of high acuity services.  Outside of development, our investment philosophy remains focused on best-in-class facilities where we can add value through superior customer service to drive retention and cash flow growth. Cap rates on stabilized properties have compressed each year since 2013, but it’s our view that the compression is most seen in older Class C properties.  Accordingly, our investments, beginning with the acquisition of the CHI portfolio in 2016 has focused on higher quality facilities that maybe more expensive on a nominal basis but are expected to provide the best risk-adjusted IRRs over the long-term. Each of our investments are made based on the expectation that a property will benefit not from further cap rate compression, but from its long-term strategic value to the healthcare providers.  While there is a high volume of Class B and C assets available to acquire in the market, we don’t believe that they carry enough yield relative to the Class A assets we are targeting to offset the risk an owner takes on in today’s environment. Instead, we will remain disciplined in selective pursuing investments where we can match our long-term objectives with those of the healthcare providers occupying those assets.  This focus on high quality assets includes the environmental impact of our investments. We continue to be excited about the results we’ve achieved on our environmental, three year goals, established in 2019 that matured in 2021. That is just a start and we will report those results formally and transparently in our Third Annual ESG Report to be released in June 2022.  As we will share then, we are increasing our commitment in all areas to reduce Greenhouse emissions that the environmental impact of our buildings for the improvement of the communities we serve and remain on target to achieve our goal of reducing Greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in 2030. We also believe that evidence shows that investments will generate stronger retention, higher rental rates, lower occupancy cost, while producing better cash flow and long-term value for our shareholders.  I am proud to share that Physicians Realty Trust is honored to once again be recognized by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as a Top Workplace for the fifth consecutive year. Top workplaces are determined through an annual team member survey collecting data on company leadership, compensation and work environment.  Congratulations to the entire DOC team on building and maintaining our unique company culture that continues to be recognized among the best in both Milwaukee and our industry. Study after study shows that companies with a focus on culture deliver superior total shareholder return over the long run. We will not sacrifice our commitment to culture for short-term financial benefit.  We are also proud to share that our Senior Vice President of Physician and Leasing Strategy, Amy Hall has been selected as a 2022 GlobeSt. Women of Influence. This award shines a light on individuals that have personally impacted the market and significantly driven the industry to new heights via their outstanding success across commercial real estate. Thank you, Amy.  We completed our Annual Shareholder Meeting yesterday and I am proud to report we had 95% or greater approval for each of our trustees and for our executive compensation plan. We work for our shareholders and while others are distracted in trying to restore the trust of their shareholders, we have the trust and are able to focus on working with our outstanding physician clients, health system partners, and developers delivering long-term returns for our shareholders.  We appreciate our loyal shareholders who recognize us for us discipline and strategy for long-term growth and we welcome new investors as they too recognize the strength and stability of our trusted platform.  I’ll now ask Jeff Theiler to share our financial results, Mark Theine will then share our operating results, and Amy Hall who will report on the current leasing environment. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2022, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $63.4 million, or $0.27 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $61.5 million, an increase of 13% over the comparable quarter of last year, and our FAD per share was $0.26. Portfolio performance was steady this quarter generating same-store NOI growth of 2%. Importantly, the landmark portfolio has been successfully integrated and is performing at our underwritten expectations. Across the portfolio, we are seeing continued strength in the operations of our tenants, both in the reported financials and the insurance claim volumes that we monitor on a near real-time basis.  Based on the carefully curated portfolio we built over the past nine years, we believe we are well positioned for long-term success no matter what happened in the macro environment. Speaking of the macro environment, as everyone knows, we are already seeing data that reflects the highest inflation in 40 years. Our portfolio is built to withstand destructive force.  We’ve always concentrated on providing predictable and secure cash flow to our investors by embedding expense recovery provisions with a 98% of our leases to pass on those inflationary cost to the tenant. We also maintain the highest occupancy in the sector, which minimizes the cost leakage of those expenses to vacancy. Combined, these attributes results in a landlord expense protection ratio of 93%, which is unparalleled and provides certainty of income for our shareholders.  Moving forward, as market participants consider the negative GDP rank of minus 1.4% for the first quarter, there has been increasing concern about the durability of the economic recovery. We don’t preface to know exactly what the future holds for the U.S. economy, but we are certainly comforted by what we do know. 64% of our rental income is derived from investment-grade quality entities or their direct subsidiaries.  As we saw over the course of COVID, when we collected over 99% of our rent, it puts us one single tenant on a short-term deferral, we believe that our rental income is safe no matter what happens. Exceptional tenants lead to exceptional stability. That same theme rings true on the capital side. We were able to raise $500 million in October of last year at the rate of 2.625% using $250 million of that to pay off our term loan that was due to mature in 2023, eliminating our one significant near-term funding risk.  Our balance sheet overall is in great shape. Our consolidated leverage at 5.65 times debt to EBITDA will be substantially below our single MOB peer, assuming their merger passes the shareholder votes.  In summary, our company remains on solid financial footing and is poised to perform well in any environment.  With that, I’ll turn it over to Mark. 
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. I am once again pleased to highlight the value of our asset management, leasing and capital projects teams who delivered another solid and consistent quarter. Our relationship-driven platform and culture cannot be easily replicated in today’s labor market and our investors significantly benefit from the concentrations and knowledge that we have developed in our top markets across the country.  From a performance perspective, our MOB same-store NOI growth in the first quarter was 2.0%. The NOI growth was driven primarily by a year-over-year 2.6% increase in base rental revenue and operating expense recoveries as our net lease structure served to protect our investors in this inflationary environment.  Our focus on landlord expense protection is best shown in our sequential same-store results, where operating expense recoveries grew 9.8% and offset the 8.5% increase in operating expenses observed relative to the prior quarter. Sequentially, same-store portfolio occupancy remained flat at 95%.  However, we are optimistic that the occupancy in the same-store pool will grow in the second half of the year as we currently have 15 leases totaling 49,000 square feet that are under construction, have not commenced and are not yet included in our occupancy statistics. Had those leases been in place and paying rent throughout the quarter, annual same-store growth would have been upwards of 2.4%.  Turning to CapEx, our capital projects team efficiently completed FAD CapEx investments of $5.7 million representing 6.2% of cash NOI. Embedded within all capital investments made by DOC is a strong commitment to the materials and practices that enhance the patient experience, as well as our ESG Green to Green philosophy.  These efforts continues to be independently recognized with DOC probably earning ten new property-level energy star certificates in 2021, as well as ten new certified sustainable property designations from the Institute of Real Estate Management. Over the last three years, DOC has earned a total of 28 certified sustainable property designations and reduced our energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions by over 10% continuing our record of recognition for leading sustainability initiatives.  We look forward to continuing the sustainability conversation in June, following the release of our third annual ESG report. The narrative on medical office have long been focused on the predictability and safety of the underlying cash flows and we firmly believe that the DOC portfolio is positioned to deliver outsized internal growth in the quarters and years to come through the efforts of our talented and determined operating team.  Joining us today to share more about the leasing trends we’re seeing in today's medical office market is our Senior Vice President of Leasing and Physician strategy Amy Hall. Amy? 
Amy Hall: Thanks, Mark. It’s a pleasure to join the team on the call today. Prior to joining DOC in 2016, I worked in the leasing industry for over 10 years at CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield, serving CHI, which is now CommonSpirit as one of my main clients. That experience helped me and DOC execute advanced leasing strategy, maximizing value for our shareholders and remaining aware of the priorities of our health system tenants to achieve the best long-term outcomes for both parties.  Before we dive into some quarterly results, it is important to remember that prospective leasing conversations often began as early as six to twelve months before commencement. While the first quarter leasing results were reasonably good, they were realized without the full benefit of recent inflations that have increased cost across the board including the cost of new MOB construction by more than 20% in the last year alone.  We will really start to see the impacts of those changes with higher re-leasing spreads in Q2 and beyond. During the first quarter, our leasing team completed 209,000 square feet of lease renewals on the consolidated portfolio at an aggregate re-leasing spread of 2.1% consistent with historical trends of 2% to 3%. Excluding the impacts of a 5,000 square foot tenant that we strategically retained at a lower rate in order to preserve the cohesive ecosystem of a multi-tenant property, re-leasing spreads for the quarter were above 3%.  We also kept TIs low at $1.28 per square foot per year, well below industry averages as we continue to focus on net effective rent as the most important measure of total leasing performance. Tenant retention for the quarter was 76%, mostly in line with our 80% to 85% target with portfolio absorption remaining effectively flat.  Our strong overall absorption and occupancy rates continue to provide confidence that we can selectively vacate certain suites and find higher rental potential with different tenants. New lease TIs totaled $2.01 per foot per year as tenants opted to contribute more of their own capital toward tenant finish, to reduce the growth in rental rate in this landlord-friendly environment.  Demand for medical office remains robust both off-campus and on as health systems and physicians work to position their outpatient realistic footprints to best serve their patients. This demand backstopped with inflation that increases the value of our existing medical office assets gives us confidence that leasing economics will continue to accelerate throughout the remainder of 2022 and in the years to come.  We expect leasing spreads for the second quarter to be in the mid to potentially even high-single-digits. We also negotiating leases that rent visibility to third and fourth quarters where we expect renewal spreads to be in the mid-single-digits. Alongside these higher than expected spreads, we are finding success in increasing tenant rent escalators to be better aligned with today’s inflationary environments.  For example, current market conditions allowed our team to increase annual rent escalators for a major health system lease from 2% to 5%. In fact, of the 53 renewals completed during the first quarter, 11 had an escalator that was greater than prior in-place measures. Escalators on new leases averaged 2.7% in the quarter, meaningfully ahead of our 2.4% portfolio average and we expect to continue to find success on this front moving forward.  This is especially true in our urban markets like Atlanta and Phoenix where market escalators are now approaching 4%. These trends indicate a structural shift in the MOB market and barring unforeseen circumstances we expect them to continue in the years ahead. We believe our portfolio was well below market rates overall and see our upcoming lease roll in this environment as an opportunity rather than a risk. Put simply, DOC’s medical office portfolio is poised to capture the benefits of this inflationary environment.  With that, I will hand it back over to JT. 
John Thomas: Thank you, Amy. Doug, we are now happy to take questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Griffin: Hey. This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. Wanted to touch on external growth at first. Curious what you think of the expectation for the cadence of investments to trend throughout the remainder of the year relative to initial guidance. 
John Thomas: Yeah, I think we are – again, we’re off to a little bit of a slow start and again most of that’s more attributable to kind of the volatility of the capital markets’ interest rates in particular versus kind of opportunities that we see in our investment pipeline.  So, I think we are still on track for the year to do $250 million to $500 million in total that does include the development financing, which of course is kind of – will be more back-ended because of those projects just gets started this summer and you are spending as the construction process evolves.  But again, I think there is plenty of good opportunities for us in the acquisition market as well. But it will be limited this year more in the second half than the first half just due to the capital markets in particular. 
Michael Griffin: Right. And JT you touched on cap rates relative to rising interest rates in your prepared remarks, but I am curious obviously with the expectations that interest rates going to continue to increase for the near foreseeable future, do you see anticipated upward pressure in cap rates maybe in the near to medium-term? 
John Thomas: I mean, you would expect it, but we haven’t seen it. And I think that comes from just the flood of capital chasing the medical office product. There is a lot of Class B and Class C assets out in the market right now and that are trading in the low 5s. And those rates haven’t really changed rather than compressed since last year. So, we’ll see how it goes. That’s part of the reason why we are being patient in looking more to investments if at all in the second half of the year, but we anticipate making those investments. 
Michael Griffin: Great. That’s it for me. Thanks for the time. 
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. 
Omotayo Okusanya : Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. So in the latter part of 2021, with the same-store numbers, again kind of more at the high end of that 2% to 3% range, you had done a really good job with kind of operating expense management. This quarter, it looks like OpEx kind of ticked up quite a bit. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and the negative impact it had on your same-store NOI number? 
Mark Theine: Hey, Tayo. Yes, this is Mark on the operating expense side for same-store. The fourth quarter and first quarter are both a little bit higher than what we typically see in our operating expenses. This quarter they are up about 4%, that’s primarily driven by utilities and janitorial. And then sequentially, utility rates have been increasing a little bit.  And then in the first part of this year, we also reached our annual real estate tax and insurance accrual. So those are a bit higher for the year. But the beauty and the strength of the DOC portfolio is that we are 95% leased and primarily all triple net leased. So, we talked about our landlord expense protection and those costs are passing back to the tenants.  So, we are working hard as an asset management team to operate all the buildings efficiently and cost effectively and utilizing our scale, especially in markets where we have good concentration to manage those operating expenses. And we think that through some of the CapEx investments we are making, we will be able to lower some of those utility cost in the back half of the year.  But again, we are optimistic about same-store in the back half of the year as a result of some of the leasing efforts and I think that in the back half of the year, we’ll be back up above our annual average rent escalator from some of the occupancies that’s under construction and will be coming online. 
Omotayo Okusanya : That’s helpful. And then, also if I may ask one more question on the retention side, again the target has historically been 80 to 85, very close to it this quarter, but I think it was like 79 or so last quarter, it was like 76. Just kind of curious what, again, what’s happening on that end, as well, because the last few quarters you have had negative kind of net absorption in the portfolio both in 4Q and 1Q. 
John Thomas: Yes, Tayo, it’s JT. If you have four leases to renew and you renew three of them that’s 75% right. So, it’s really more a function of that than the 80 – over the course of time, it’s 80% to 85% quarter-by-quarter just depends on how many leases you have and what the square foot is. So it’s – there is no downward or negative trend there. It’s just a function of our highly leased occupancy. 
Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. JT, given the comments you made on cap rates and thinking that you would expect upward pressure, but haven’t seen it. And where the stock is trading today, I mean, did dispositions become more attractive funding source to fund sort of the investment activity for the year? 
John Thomas: Yeah, Austin, and welcome to the team. That’s something – it’s a great – it’s a sellers’ market. It’s a great time for dispositions. We don’t have a lot that we really are interested and – in selling. But we expect some opportunistic dispositions this year kind of capturing these strong cap rates per asset. So, I think you will see some dispositions during the year, but it won’t be a huge number and we really like our portfolio overall. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then, I am just curious since you’ve closed the Landmark portfolio, I think you had some new relationships that came from that. Have you seen any pickup in the investment pipeline around those new tenant relationships? 
John Thomas: Yeah, similarly for specific contracts or leasing upcoming we got a great start on the leasing, as well, but [Amy] (ph) was at a function with one of those assets the other day talking about their own investments in the building we bought, plus the opportunity for expansion of an additional twin building in that portfolio. So, we really anticipate over time a lot of great add-on opportunities with those assets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for the time. 
John Thomas: You are welcome. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. 
Adam Kramer: Hey guys. Good morning. This is Adam Kramer on for Richard. Wanted to ask a little bit more in detail about kind of the acquisitions, I recognize you are kind of maintaining this $250 million to $500 million, it’s kind of total investment activity guide, wondering if you could kind of give a split between acquisitions or external growth acquisitions versus kind of the investments that you guys have talked about. And then any kind of further, I guess, kind of commentary on the investments would be helpful as well. 
John Thomas: So, I think, it’s hard to predict an accurate split today, but probably 50-50 would be a reasonable assumption between development starts and acquisitions. I think we’ll clearly get to 50% on the development pipeline side of that number and probably get some more opportunities there that we might close in the third and fourth quarters.  So, probably, a little bit of a lean toward the development to get to the higher end of that range. But we’ve already – we completed subsequent to quarter end a $27 million acquisition which is adjacent to one of our other medical office buildings very synergistic in that New Albany market with a great health system in frankly a building that Mark Theine and I have been chasing for ten years.  Again, it’s adjacent to a building that took us eight years to acquire. So we are persistent and consistent. So, I think the acquisition environment is fine. I think there is some good opportunities out there. We are just being very careful and selective with the – in this capital market. 
Adam Kramer: Got it. And that all makes sense. I guess, this has been touched on a few times already, so I apologize if I am kind of beating a dead horse. But also just want to ask about, whether I guess the guide is – it implies a step up in acquisitions in the latter part of the year, right, when cap rates may have kind of widened already.  And you mentioned already that cap rates may not have moved yet. And so wondering if the guide just allows you to maybe capture greater acquisition volumes later in the year when cap rates will have widened? 
John Thomas: Yeah, I think, your point is exactly what we are thinking, which is those assets that – again, almost all of our business is off-market. And so, it’s really a kind of a ebb and flow in the negotiation, trying to match fund with our cost – with our capital and cost of capital with the acquisition cap rate. So, I mean, certainly there can be more opportunities later in the year, particularly if cap rates do ease back a little bit. And then, investment activity might accelerate. 
Adam Kramer: It’s really helpful guys. Thanks again and [shout later on] (ph) later on. Appreciate it. 
John Thomas: Yeah, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Valeria Zimina: Hi. This is Valerie on for Valeria on for Juan. About funding, how should we think about your acquisition pipeline if we shouldn’t expect a large uptick in dispositions? 
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. This is Jeff. I’ll cover that. So, certainly, as we think about funding and JT mentioned it earlier, there could be some opportunistic dispositions as there has been a lot of interest in various buildings in our portfolio. So we evaluate those of course. Putting that aside, when we evaluate these acquisitions, we are always making sure that from a cost of capital standpoint, it’s advantageous to our shareholders to acquire them.  So, we look at what our cost of long-term debt is and what our cost of equity is and make the determination based on that. And I think that’s a big part of the reason when we talk about the split of acquisitions. A lot of that split is more of that split this year is dedicated towards developments and loan funding, that kind of thing. 
Valeria Zimina: Okay. Gotcha. And one more question. So, recognizing that you raised shares via the ATM. What’s your view of selling assets buyback stock in a leverage neutral manner of the implied cap rate of 5.8 which still we have? 
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. It depends. So, certainly, to the extent we have assets that we don’t think are good long-term ones that is something we’ve done, right. And we did that back in 2018 when we did a portfolio and sold assets and took down leverage.  Mathematically, it isn’t really that effective when our share price is where it is to sell assets and buy back stock because you lose a lot of that benefit just with the deleveraging alone. So, it’s a good theoretical exercise, but you generally need stock price it’s pretty significantly lower than it is now. 
John Thomas: Yeah, for the long-term, I think, the dispositions we might achieve this year, we think will be at – cap rates where we can be accretive and new investments that improve the portfolio and improve the yield that we are getting on the assets we are selling. So, we think that’s a better long-term use of that capital. 
Valeria Zimina: Okay. Great. Thanks. That’s it for me. 
John Thomas: Doug I think that’s it for the questions. Thanks everybody… 
Operator: There are no other questions. 
John Thomas: Thanks, Doug. We look forward to seeing everybody at the BOMA and then NAREIT in a couple of weeks and thanks for participating today. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Fourth Quarter 2021 Year End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bradley Page, Senior Vice President, General Counsel. Thank you, sir, you may begin.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the Company's CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. And thanks everyone for joining us for our on time as scheduled earnings call. Physicians Realty Trust had an outstanding 2021 and we enter 2022 very excited about our internal and external growth prospects. Our confidence comes from the continued performance of the DOC portfolio in the face of a challenging operating environment, despite the emergence of the Delta and then Omicron, COVID variants and the highest inflationary environment in recent memory, our healthcare provider tenants demonstrated their financial resiliency throughout the year, delivering 99.9% rent collections in 2021. The strong collections resulted in less than $100,000 of bad debt expense for the year on total rent and camp revenues of over $437 million. This operational strength combined with our 95% leased rate and unmatched exposure to investment grade quality tenants left us well-positioned to deliver full year same-store NOI growth of 2.5% across our entire portfolio of medical office facilities. We see internal growth momentum accelerating with the portfolio averaging 2.9% same-store growth in the fourth quarter, all without the benefit of a repositioning basket. Mark Theine, Mark Dukes, Amy Hall and our entire team did an incredible job managing our portfolio, generating these best-in-asset class results. It’s one of the most stable and reliable real estate asset classes over the last decade, and specifically over the last year it's not surprising that medical office space continues to attract capital for new investors. These compressed cap rates not only increase the underlying value of the DOC portfolio, but also make our long standing health system and developer partnerships even more important as we work to source attractive investment opportunities. In 2021, we leverage these relationships to complete $1 billion of gross investments in an average first year cash yield of 4.9% increasing our portfolio footprint by 11%. These investments are highlighted by our acquisition of the $750 million Landmark Portfolio in December, which is the largest transaction we’ve completed in the history of the company. Most importantly, the acquisition adds 10 new health system relationships to our portfolio, providing ample opportunity for future growth. In addition to Landmark, we completed $258 million of other investments, all of which we are excited about and all off market. These deals include our seventh and eighth transactions with HonorHealth, a premier investment grade health system, serving the rapidly growing Phoenix, MSA. We are IRR focused long-term investors, nurturing relationships and providing best-in-class service to healthcare providers earning more business. That's capital allocation for the long-term. We couldn't have accomplished these results without the exceptional financial leadership and balance sheet management of Jeff Theiler and his team. I will let Jeff share the details, but an upgrade to our investment-grade credit rating is a pretty good starting point there in once in 100-year pandemic. In addition, we ended the year with leverage of 5.8 times debt to EBITDA and are well positioned in a rising interest rate environment with 80% of our outstanding debt locked at fixed interest rates. Transitioning to DOC's ESG platform, we ended 2021 with 10 new buildings earned IREM Certified Sustainable Property designations, recognizing DOC’s commitment to resource efficiency and environmental initiatives in each of these properties. Approximately 19% of our portfolio square footage is now certified with IREM. Certification requires each property to meet baseline requirements and earn necessary points across energy, water, health, recycling and purchasing commitments. We also received the 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy in recognition of our commitments to environmental transparency and accountability. In 2021, we completed our inaugural GRESB application. GRESB is a mission-driven, industry-led organization providing standardized and validated ESG data to financial markets. In our first year submission to GRESB, we earn a score of 75. This score outperform the international average of 73. In addition, we received a Green Star designation awarded to participants achieving scores of 50 plus on GRESB’s measurement of the management and performance sections. We look forward to sharing the full results of our environmental impact in our ESG report after third-party data verification is completed in quarter two. 2021 represents the final year of our inaugural three-year environmental goals cycle based on our pre-pandemic 2018 baselines. Social accomplishments in 2021 included 695 hours of paid volunteer time off and company organized activities to give back individually and corporately to the communities we serve. DOC also provided more than $400,000 in philanthropic, fundraising and in kind donations to community and healthcare provider organizations benefiting their research and mission initiatives, surpassing our 2021 goal of $350,000. We are thrilled and humbled to earned recognition as a 2021 modern healthcare best places to work. Based on anonymous team member survey results, DOC was the highest rated healthcare real estate provider among the honorees. This prestigious nationwide ranking is the gold standard in the healthcare industry for recognizing workplaces that empower employees to provide patients and customers the best care of products and services. We are proud to enhance the company's governance through updates to our management team and Board of Trustees with two outstanding individuals. Since 2016, the daily operations of our asset and property management team have been led by Mark Dukes when he joined us from Duke Realty, after overseeing their health care portfolio asset management team while working directly with Deeni Taylor. 2021, Mark was sworn into service chair and Chief Elected Officer of the Building Owners Management Association International, the highest honor in property management and commercial real estate. In recognition of his leadership and talents, he's earned a promotion to Senior Vice President of Asset Management. Our Board is also looking to the future and starting the process for succession planning. And we're very excited to add Ava Lias-Booker, a senior partner at the prestigious McGuireWoods law firm who's been elected to the Board, effective March 1st, 2022. In addition to Ava's wealth of legal and business experience, we're excited about her leadership in DE&I efforts at McGuireWoods and helping us meet and exceed our hiring and career development goals for our team. Looking to 2022, we're proud to be starting the year from a position of strength. Unlike our segments of -- unlike other segments of the healthcare real estate, the growth we experienced in 2021 is organic rather than a recovery of pre-pandemic NOI, and our portfolio remains insulated from direct exposure to high labor cost. Similarly, our healthcare system plans are stronger than they've ever been. We're pleased to offer them a stable real estate platform as they work to expand their outpatient delivery capabilities to benefit their patients. On the acquisition front, we will pursue accretive investments that also makes sense from a long-term IRR standpoint, appropriately considering the potential for continued inflation in a rising rate environment. We're fortunate that the long-term thesis of medical office remains more compelling than ever and health system clients have a growing appetite for new outpatient care facilities and strong demographic markets. We are actively involved in discussions with multiple partners for financing new medical office developments anchored by high quality health systems and providers to be started during 2022, which should convert to ownership and long-term rental income streams in 2023 and 2024. It yields well in excess of current acquisition yields. Including our development pipeline, we expect to invest $250 million to $500 million in 2022 due to our relationship focus and strength in off-market acquisitions, we anticipate first year yields on these acquisitions and developments to range from 5.25% to 6%. In conclusion, Physicians Realty Trust has entered 2022 with a strong, stable, and proven portfolio. Our management team is well rounded with multiple years of collaborative progress, working together with a rock solid commitment to our culture that continues to earn recognition and awards. We have an eight-year track record of discipline investments in management and we expect another year of measured investments in this volatile capital market that will benefit our shareholders for years to come. Jeff?
Jeff Tyler: Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $58 million, or $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $55 million, an increase of 3.6% over the comparable quarter of last year, and our FAD per share was $0.24. Looking back over the year, our portfolio performed well through all the COVID variants with no material negative impacts. Accounts receivable remains at low levels and the same-store NOI growth came in on target at 2.5% for the year. The quality of the portfolio was significantly upgraded in 2021 through both acquisitions and dispositions. With over $1 billion of investments last year, headlined by the landmark portfolio, the quality of our tenant base is second to none. Certainly, investors have focused on growth more than stability lately, but this carefully curated group of tenants will perform well in all environments. And we expect to be able to increase the portfolio's growth over time as we catch up to the rapid rise we've seen in market rents over the past year. Conversely, on the disposition side, we finally took the long awaited step of selling our LTeX in the fourth quarter. As it turns out, despite some negative headlines we entered with the assets, the investment itself the sound and delivered a 9% unlevered IRR. We had some significant mezzanine loan repayments in the fourth quarter as well, including $54 million for the Landmark transaction, which was used to help fund the portfolio purchase. In 2022, we will look to redeploy dollars into these high yielding loans when possible, as they provide our investors with a solid risk adjusted return, while also increasing our potential future acquisition pipeline. As well as deploying dollars into development opportunities and acquisitions anchored by high quality health systems. Turning to the balance sheet, we hit a milestone in 2021, with our credit upgrades from Moody's and S&P, we took advantage of this, and the low rates in the fourth quarter to issue $500 million of 10 year bonds at 2.625% interest rate, effectively pushing out all significant debt until after 2025. We also reduce the leverage that resulted from the landmark deal by issuing $133 million of equity on the ATM at an average price of 1,854, bringing our consolidated leverage down to 5.66 times debt to EBITDA. So we are in a comfortable position in terms of the balance sheet, as we enter the New Year. However, we are certainly mindful of the cost of capital increases we are looking at on both the debt and equity side. As JT mentioned, we intend to be deliberate about finding better returns and utilizing structures such as mezzanine investments, as well as funding loans to owns and developments. We will not however, move down the quality curve as we continue to build out our core portfolio. Faced with these challenges, we are anticipating between $250 million to $500 million of investments for the year, but expect them to average out at an initial yield in the mid 5% range. The rest of the years guidance, includes G&A of $40 million to $42 million and capital expenditures of $29 million to $31 million as we manage and care for our significantly expanded portfolio. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operational statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. The DOC portfolio produced strong operating results during the fourth quarter, supporting our commitment to deliver stable and growing investor returns. This commitment to high quality growth is reinforced through our acquisition of the Landmark portfolio, which improves our already great asset base in nearly every key quality metric. I'm pleased to share that the integration of these new assets to our portfolio has been near seamless, and outcome that would not be possible without the excellent efforts of our best in class team of property managers and accountants. We look forward to growing relationships with our 10 new health system partners for years to come. Our in-house leasing team has also been productive, completing 1.2 million square feet of total leasing activity during 2021 at an 80% retention rate, and positive 1.6% renewal spreads. For the fourth quarter specifically, we completed 389,000 square feet of leasing with a strong 79% retention rate. Not included in these numbers is an additional 42,000 square feet of new leases executed in the quarter, which are currently in construction, and will commence rent payments over the next several quarters. We've been especially pleased with our ability to exhibit pricing power, without expanding concessions in this inflationary environment last year, but in the last two quarters especially, the leasing team has been focused on balancing tenant retention and leasing spreads, while pushing on the contractual rent escalators higher than the portfolio average of 2.4%. They were successful in this mission, with over 85% of our leasing activity executed in 2021, containing an average rent increase of 2.5% or greater. Looking ahead to 2022, 4% of DOC's portfolio totaling 565,000 square feet is scheduled to renew with a current average rental rate of $24.89 per square foot. These explorations include several specialty surgery center and orthopedic spaces, where we remain confident in our ability to release at favorable leasing terms. We are also encouraged by our ability to re-let vacant space, given the strong demand we're seeing for Class A outpatient facilities. Our pricing power is backstopped by construction costs that are up more than 20% above pre-pandemic levels, limiting alternatives for tenants who may choose to seek space elsewhere. These factors have turned our expiring leases into an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the superior quality of our portfolio. We're optimistic that tenant retention will remain high in the year ahead, and that we'll be able to achieve renewal spreads in excess of the usual 2% to 3% average that the medical office sector has historically seen. Moving to our same-store NOI growth, our 246 property same-store MOB portfolio generated cash NOI growth of 2.9% for the fourth quarter. Despite the inflationary environment, operating expenses were actually down 4.7% against last year as a result of several real estate tax and insurance expenses that were challenged and refunded at year end. In total, operating expenses were down 1.5 million year-over-year, leading to a $1.1 million decrease in operating expense recoveries from tenants under our triple-net lease structure. Our CapEx investments for the quarter totaled 7.5 million, or 8.9% of cash NOI. For the full year, we invested $25.5 million in recurring capital investments, near the low end of our $25 million to $27 million guidance that we offered at the start of last year. In 2022, we expect our full year recurring CapEx to remain around 8% to 9% of NOI in total between $29 million and $31 million. Within our 2021 CapEx investments, we invested approximately $5.6 million in ESG related projects to improve energy management systems. Upgrade HVAC mechanicals, and install more efficient and longer lasting LED lighting. Overall, these investments not only make our buildings more efficient, but also improve our margins on common area costs and reduce operating expenses for our healthcare partners. In recognition of these efforts, we are proud to share that DOC has earned an additional 10 new IREM Certified Sustainable Property designations in 2021, reinforcing our commitment to expanding our ESG practices. In total DOC has earned 28 IREM CSP designations since 2019. We're making significant improvements on all fronts related to ESG and look forward to sharing these results in our third annual ESG report in June. To conclude, 2021 was an outstanding year, in which we grew the portfolio from $5 billion in real estate investments to nearly $6 billion by year end. And our off market acquisitions showcase how relationships will continue to power the future of DOC. We've built a high quality portfolio that is operating well, with an exceptional asset management and leasing team that has and will continue to deliver bottom line results. Before turning the call back over to John, I would also like to say a special congratulations to Mark Dukes on his promotion to SVP, Asset Management. Mark is not only a true leader at DOC, but also within the commercial real estate industry. Congratulations, Mark. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Jesse will now be happy to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Good morning team. Just wanted to start on the investments side. Could you talk a little bit about some potential optionality you have about converting some of your preferred mezz loans into an either developments or otherwise into acquisitions in 2022? And how much if any is assumed in guidance in part -- as part of that how you're thinking about joint ventures, you expanded the Davis Joint Venture in the first quarter as a tool to put capital to work into 2022?
John Thomas: Yes, Juan, it’s JT. Thanks for the question. So we look at mezz primarily as a means to an end. So most mezz loans we're making are with the anticipation of converting that to full ownership either through the development structure or through an acquisition or potentially through a JV structure. So it's been a great tool for us. Landmark is a perfect example where we can recap the portfolio two years ago had $50 million of high yielding mezz but had REITs, short and long-term REITs to acquire the portfolio, and just frankly just happened quicker than we expected. So it's a great tool for us. We expect to continue to use it those cycle in and out, usually on a 12 to 18 month cycle. So we're kind of constantly evaluating when and where to place those. So didn't always convert to ownership, but that's the primary use for that, that methodology. Alone downs provide us an opportunity to get even more attractive yields on development, but also well kind of managing rent costs, inflationary costs with the provider in those construction processes.
Juan Sanabria: Is there anything assumed for any of those loans to turn into the simple ownership in 2022 as part of your acquisition guidance?
John Thomas: We should -- we could have some convert this year. We have some mezz on development projects that we funded last year that I'm now CEO and are currently operating with. We're at commencement, so we'll work through that process with the developers in those couple of situations. So yes, as part of that 250 million to 500 million part of it assumes some of them as conversed ownership.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then just on the core, kind of cash flow growth. It sounded like you've got some the leased rates seems like it's higher than the occupied rate, maybe there's some delays with some of the setup costs. I guess I wanted to check if that's accurate, and then to see how you guys are thinking about that growth going forward, you kind of mentioned that you expect it to accelerate. Is that driven by just greater renewal spreads or increases in the annual bumps is the portfolio turns in, and you're able to get higher with annual renewals or annual bump sorry?
John Thomas: Yes. I wanted to it's really a combination of both. I mean, the good news is the quality of earnings is stronger than ever and the strength of our portfolio was stronger than ever with the downside first time in really my career were while is not as advantageous as historically it has been. So we don't have a lot rolling this year, but where we do have leases rolling. We have 300 buildings and we have some vacant -- a small amount of vacant space, but some vacant space. But we see inflation hitting those rents, construction costs, which would be the competition for the rents, increasing pretty significantly. So we do expect higher than average releasing spreads this year and new leasing spreads absorptions, because of that. The first year of a really big lease roll for us is 2026 and that's the 10th year anniversary of the CommonSpirit acquisition that we did. So we manage that really quarter-by-quarter and evaluating when and where to address those leases and stretch those leases and working with CommonSpirit for their space needs. When we did that transaction, all the rents were set at the market rates at that time in those individual markets, and frankly, we see those as below market in those markets right now, generally overall, and so, you know, see a big opportunity in 2026, working with them at an appropriate rate, but at the same time, we think there's good potential for better than average releasing spreads across that portfolio.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks, John. Time flies. Thank you.
John Thomas: I’ll be here before you know it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for the color on prepared remarks and some of the commentary from fall to one. I did want to just follow-up on the acquisition guidance and maybe push a little bit more on the range. It sounds like the range was driven in large part by cost of capital. But maybe you could give us a little bit more insight as to what would drive you to the top end of the range. And if there's any scenarios that could maybe surprise to the upside, even above the high end of the range. So really, it's just a question of like, what assumptions are driving that high-end and low-end of the range?
John Thomas: Yeah. The high end of the range is primarily driven by mezz financing and loan developments. And so we see that as frankly market for high quality assets that we're financing part or all of the construction costs for those projects, and then once leases commence at those rates, and so that's where you can drives the high end of that range could be even more attractive. The low end of the range is driven by best-in-class medical office acquisition and primarily off market, best-in-class assets and an open auction process, trade in the mid fours still, in the private market. And so, again, we think we can drive best-in-class asset acquisition pricing still in the 5.25 plus range, so it's really a combination of both.
Rich Hill: Got it. That's helpful. So if I can maybe come back to the mezz financing for a second, I recognize why -- how and why that can be a big driver of acquisitions, but are you seeing increased competition from a variety of lender sources to provide mezz financing and is there any scenario where that becomes less of a lever than where it's been in the past?
John Thomas: I don't see a scenario where it becomes less there's more development, planning going on right now and in process then we've seen in years, driven by delays in construction projects during the early part of the pandemic to a need for more outpatient space as recognized by the other health systems during the pandemic. So we're not out competing in the open mezz market for mezz paper, it's just, it’s lender is construction lenders, primary senior secured lenders are looking to work with their clients to finance new construction projects. Frankly, we get, kind of, leads and introductions that way, but also our development partners where we continue to do repeat business with Mark Davis being a perfect example in Minneapolis. He sees it as an attractive part of his capital stack. And in the end, it's a financing tool for us and for the health system and the developer that keeps rents as low as possible in these new buildings and in high inflationary market. So, it's a combination of those that worked really well for us, it worked really well for keeping rents at market as market is increasing in those markets.
Rich Hill: Got it. That's helpful. Just one more question for me. Inflation obviously, is on everyone's mind right now. If I put on my cross-sector hat, there are some landlords that are thinking about or trying to change their lease structures to be a little bit more inflation-protected including CPI lookbacks that catch-up. Have you had any discussions about that? Is that anything that you would consider? Basically a question of would you change the structure of your lease terms to maybe provide more inflationary hedges than might be in place right now?
John Thomas: Yes, beginning of 2017, that became our standard approach to leasing new leases or in renewals as our standard kind of terms include CPI with a 3% floor that has been effective. So, about 10% of our portfolio has a CPI adjustment annually and again, the floors usually getting negotiated in exchange for some kind of cap. So, those range from 2% to 4% with a CPI adjustment. So, about 10% of the portfolio has that in place. Again, we have we have long waltz, we have 2% to 3% rolling every year and so that's -- it's kind of -- will take time to convert that across the rest of the portfolio, but starting to have an impact.
Rich Hill: Got it. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from a line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on that last answer JT, if you wouldn't mind just on the new standard lease, you said 3% for -- with CPI, is there -- are there typically kept on the new leases?
John Thomas: Jordan, JT. So, again, it just depends upon kind of the counterparty and what's important to them. So, some had caps, almost -- they all have floors. So, sometimes the floor goes from 3% down to 2%. In this inflationary market, that’s something we may continue to move up and be an important part of the negotiation, but that's the long-term conversion that we've started in 2017.
Jordan Sadler: And then in your prepared remarks, you did -- you spoke to it a little bit and in the Q&A here, but you referenced accelerating internal growth. Can you maybe speak to that a little bit more? Is that, as you look forward, more a function of pushing through a little bit better rate or the better leasing spreads you mentioned here, or is there also -- are there other opportunities either as a function of some amount of redevelopment or occupancy uplift in certain aspects of portfolio. What you were referring to?
Mark Theine: Hey Jordan, this is Mark. Yes, so as it relates to really driving our internal growth, it comes in two ways. One is the revenue increasing, as JT was just talking about with a strong focus on our leasing spreads in our annual escalators. Our annual escalators today are 2.4%. If we look at the leases that did have a CPI adjustment last year in 2021, those leases grew at 3.3%. You know, the other important point to note is on the expense side that our leases are triple net structure, so we're protected against a lot of those inflationary pressures on the operating expense side. So as we saw this quarter, our operating expenses are actually down as a result of some great work but the asset management team to challenge property taxes to renegotiate some insurance rates. And so we're really looking on ways to continue to invest our CapEx dollars into the properties, where we can lower operating expenses for our partners and then also for ourselves, where we can, you know, save on the expense side, so we're using a combination of, you know, trying to increase rents and grow revenue while also keeping great control on our operating expenses.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, I feel like when you hit the pipeline rate, which is amazing three questioners and but can you maybe speak to what you guys are seeing on the investment pipeline? You got the 250 to 500 guide and a lot of progress last year. Are you seeing that this year versus last year or is it picking up just maybe characterize it for me?
John Thomas: Yes, Jordan, its JT. We've got a nice pipeline. Our – kind of typical model is, you know, onesie, twosie transactions with existing relationships either developers or owners or health systems, physicians themselves, so kind of nice pipeline. I think we'll have a good strong start to the year to report with first quarter – first quarter earnings, but it's onesie, twosie. There's some – there's some larger portfolios floating around the market. There's one really big portfolio or less than the market, so we evaluate everything. So it's – I think – I don't think we'll – I think we'll have I think the opportunities is far exceeds the guidance we're providing and the capital markets improve, I think we can grow even stronger. We feel good about the guidance we've given. On the development side, we have – we've seen and negotiated with more development opportunities than we ever have. And again, these are all either 100% or higher pre-leased opportunities. Somewhere we'll do the loan down which where we'll deploy more capital in somewhere mezzanine, where we'll provide less but at a higher rate.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then on the larger portfolios. You know, I assume pricing is still very competitive and more aggressive there. Is that sort of fair or is there a way to get a bigger deals done going there?
John Thomas: It's hard to it's hard to pull off a portfolio in an off market manner like we did last year. So pricing, there's a lot of buyers out there, still a lot of private capital looking to get into the space, so pricing is still – still very strong. I don't expect, given the portfolio's that are kind of being actively marketed. I don't have great expectation that we will be interested in either the quality of the portfolio or the pricing of the portfolio but you know, again, we evaluate everything.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thanks, guys.
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Toti with Colliers International. Please proceed with your question.
David Toti: Great. Thank you. I just had a quick question for you, Jeff. Relative to the changes that you're expecting in the cost of capital that might impact your acquisition appetite, how are you underwriting those specific changes? And what are you expecting in terms of, sort of inflation in the cost of capital?
John Thomas: Yeah. Thanks, David. So, certainly, as we look at all these acquisitions, where we evaluate everything on a long term IRR basis and so we factor into that, kind of what our – what our cost of debt is on a long-term basis. So, where we think we could issue called a 10 year bond today. We also look at our cost of equity, generally, on a – an apple yield basis, plus an expected kind of inflation rate on that. So, we use those two factors and then compare – compare the potential acquisitions against that weighted average cost of capital. So when we're looking at, interest rate increases, and we're typically looking at what's projected by the Fed and the expectations around those short term interest rates as well. When we look at market, market rent increases? Certainly, that's increased in our mind as we look over a 10 year period, from where it was a few years ago. So we do increase the market raise inflation, a bit from where it used to be.
David Toti: Okay. Then just one follow-up question to that, which is, do you expect cap rates will remain sticky and lag for some time – let's assume that you have capital increases – capital cost increases? Well, that begins to compress some spreads potentially, until the market catches up in terms of expectations for yield?
John Thomas: Yeah. It'll be interesting with the cap rates, because certainly you do have some increasing, cost of capital for all buyers. But then you also have rents that are going to become more and more below market. So you'd expect to see the ability to increase the – the rents under these assets over a long period of time, more than you used to be able to. So, there'll be some offsetting factors there, right now, we'd kind of expect cap rates to remain about where they are. We'll just have to watch and see what happens, but we don't see any drastic moves and cap rates coming anytime soon.
David Toti: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. How are you thinking of funding the net external growth in 2022? And then where does that put leverage at the end of the year?
Jeff Tyler: Hi, Nick. It's Jeff. So, certainly, our leverage we ended the year at a pretty good rate on an enterprise basis. We are 5.8 times debt to EBITDA. Obviously in 2021, we had delivered ahead of the Landmark transaction. In the fourth quarter, we issued $133 million on the ATM, just to bring that expected leverage down from I guess it would have been just over six times debt to EBITDA to the 5.8. As we think about the acquisition pipeline in 2022, I'd say, we're largely in you know, kind of a pay as you go type mode. And so we're certainly comfortable from a risk standpoint, with the leverage as it stands today. I'd expect that, it's going to, directionally over a longer period of time trend down. And we're certainly going to be conscious of, where our current cost of equity is, as we, look to execute on this pipeline. And that's a big part of the reason, we're looking at these, different – different acquisition structures like the – the mezzanine loans and the loan to own. So that we can find appropriate yields based on our cost of capital.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just for the five in the quarter, the 6% cap rate assumption is that cash or GAAP?
John Thom: Always cash.
Jeff Tyler: Always cash.
Nick Joseph: Okay. And so what was that -- so maybe 25 to 50 basis points higher on a GAAP basis historically?
Jeff Tyler: Easily. Yeah.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yeah, thanks. I just want to talk about the acquisition cap rate range. I mean, what's driving that range higher? Is it that Mezzanine type investments and the loan to own development commitments? Is that why that caprates in the mid to high 5 type target range?
Jeff Tyler: That's right, Mike. We are seeing and we are in negotiations on more development projects right now than we are acquisitions. And so we have a nice blend of both. But those -- the development projects are going to either through Mez or through a loan down structure, are going to be much closer to 6 or more than less. So, we see a real opportunity both for high quality, long-term assets to put into the read and a much more attractive price than acquisitions.
Michael Carroll: Great. And then just back to the leverage question. I know leverage is a little bit higher than normal today, and you kind of highlight this, but given the stability of your portfolio, I don't think it's really a concern. Are you willing to complete these investments and push leverage a little bit higher, or is that kind of like a cap that you don't really want to be much higher than you are right now?
Jeff Tyler: Yeah. Mike, I don't think we're capped exactly where we are now. Certainly, we want to be a little bit more cautious about leverage when we're up to 5.8 times versus when we're kind of closer to 5. But there's some short term flexibility there. Again, just because of the nature of the portfolio and how stable it's been through even kind of the biggest operational stresses over the past few years.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then I guess related to the Board changes, I believe in your prepared remarks, you kind of talked about succession planning. Hey, did I hear that correctly? And what does that entail? What you are kind of planning right now on the succession side?
Jeff Tyler: Yeah, sure. We don't have anybody from our original Board or current Board that's retired or established are not standing for re-election this year. But we're starting to look at in the next couple of years, we're likely to have two, three Board members kind of transition through retirement. So what we want to do is, when we bring identify new great candidates to add to our Board is get some overlap with that historical knowledge and leadership. So we're going to expand the Board slightly for the next probably look for one more candidate to add to the board eventually and then shrink it back down as we see some retirement. So just a good transition, a good succession planning there.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Gorman with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, John. I think maybe just on a little bit of a bigger picture topic recently there was some focus in your sector, but not your property type, on the effect of private equity in the ecosystem. And obviously the retail sector has been dealing with some negative effects from private equity investment over the years. And I just wonder if you could share with us your thoughts on private equity's expansion in the healthcare space. It's acquisition of physician practices and how you think about private equity within your own portfolio and when you kind of look at new assets for acquisition.
John Lucey: Yeah, great question. And there's a lot of private equity on both sides of our business. On the real estate side, some of the larger, smarter private equity firms that have gotten into real estate in a big way are very disciplined, but they're out there looking for they're always, kind of, a flood of capital looking to get into the medical office space. It's just -- kind of, sometimes its onesie-twosie, sometimes they're want to enter in a big portfolio. So, yes, I think that's helping to increase the -- or decrease cap rates generally, just with the pressure that cash looking for them high quality assets and then their yield expectations. On the on the provider side, we're seeing a lot of different roll ups, if you will, from private equity across specialty types. So its -- UnitedHealthcare is the largest employer of physicians today. Certainly, not private equity, but there's a -- and they're out acquiring kind of all kinds of practices. But in the private equity world, there's an orthopedic -- there's a couple of orthopedic roll ups. There's a couple of ophthalmology roll ups. There's dermatology roll ups, there's GI roll ups, and it's kind of by specialty. So, ideally, we're either side by side or we're kind of talking to the physicians who typically own the buildings that the private equity firms are rolling up. And kind of establishing new leases where the -- everybody kind of makes a long term commitment to the practice and location. Sometimes that happens after the private equity comes in, sometimes it happens before. So, we're in active discussions with private equity firms. We don't -- we're not threatened by them, but at the same time, they do change -- typically change the capital structure of the practices. And when we’re in sale leasebacks, we like to know and understand our credit and what our collateral is behind those leases. So, having a big impact and something we're out in front of in a big way.
Michael Gorman: And in most instances, there were -- there's a physician owner. They are still looking to kind of split that structure between the practice and the real estate?
John Thomas: Yes. I mean, you think about it. A 5 cap is a multiple of cash flow, and then on the private equity firms, they're talking in 10 to 15 times EBITDA. So there's a balance between the two and where you can maximize value, when you sell kind of both sides of the house, if you will, the opco and the propco.
Michael Gorman: Okay, Great. Thanks. Appreciate the commentary.
John Thomas: Yes. Happy to, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question. I noticed the MOB, the same-store cash NOI is about 80% of the portfolio. The non-same-store is about 19%, 20%. So I just want to kind of understand maybe the difference in performance between the two set -- the two subsets there, and maybe the drivers of that non-same-store portfolio going forward. I'm guessing a chunk of that’s landmark, but just trying to understand whether I think should about the total portfolio potentially growing better or worse than that kind of same-store number of 2.9%.
Mark Theine: Yes, Dan. This is Mark. Good question. And you already, kind of, guessed, it's the same store portfolio. If you look back, last year is nearly, the entire portfolio this year in 2021 is, we had significant growth in our investments, $1 billion of new investments between the landmark and the HonorHealth transactions that we've not yet owned for a full year, represent the majority of the non-same-store portfolio. So it's primarily new acquisitions there and, obviously, that will be added to same-store after a year of ownership.
Daniel Bernstein: And is there a difference in growth rates between the two sets there?
Mark Theine: Yes, if you continue to…
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. How should I think about the drivers that are different?
Mark Theine: Yes. In the landmark and HonorHealth portfolios both, again, we underwrote them on an IRR basis, but those have historical leases with 2% to 3% rent bumps and, primarily triple net lease, so we expect that those will continue to be in line with the profile of the existing portfolio and in the same-store portfolio.
Daniel Bernstein: That's all I had. Thanks.
John Thomas: Excellent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to one Jordan’s question, really trying to understand what the same-store NOI outlook could look like going forward. Again, it sounds like again, you're getting better mark-to-market in new leases, you have the difference between the occupied versus lease, which again should kind of add some occupancy going forward. So just kind of it sounds like you're talking about very good strong pricing. And then this quarter, you put up a pretty good number of 2.9%. So as we kind of think about 2022 and beyond, I guess is it fair to kind of think of same-store being kind of more at the very high end of kind of this historical 2% to 3% bogeys, you know, the MOB to kind of measure up against.
John Thomas: Well, Tayo, it’s JT. I think, I think again, this the first year and in 20 years we've had, we see more and more opportunity to press rents and increase those rents, again, offset for us by 95% occupancy, which is I mean, there's just, you can't get to 100% and we'd like to get to 100% and Amy Hall and Mark Theine could get us to 100%, if possible, but that's it's a stretch. So, you know, on the same-store side, we've got 2.4%, 2.5% kind of on average annual escalators, 10% of the portfolio, which I think would include almost all and would all fall into the same-store that does have those CPI increases, so we should get some uptick from that this year. So it's measured in 2022. In 2023, when landmark does roll into the same store pool, we underwrote that and do have expectations that the first year yield will exceed 5% because we don't – the rents – the near-term rent roll and renewals, there's an opportunity to really push those rents, you know, and that piece of the portfolio, so it's incremental, but, you know, over time we, again, that the quality of our cash flow and the strength, the ability to increase that quality of that cash flows is there.
Tayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to John Thomas for any additional concluding remarks.
John Thomas: Again we thank you for joining us – joining us this morning. We had a great 2021. We have very high expectations for a very strong 2022. We look forward to reporting back next quarter. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Jesse.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-05 11:00:00) =====

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the Company's CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. I have to admit, this may be the most anticipated earnings call I've ever had the opportunity to participate in. Physicians Realty Trust had a landmark quarter in acquisitions, operations, and balance sheet management. The momentum has continued into the fourth quarter as subsequent to quarter-end, we sold our?3L? tags at a cash gain, continuing our progress to eventually become a REIT with 100% of our revenue generated by investments and outpatient medical office facilities. Despite the Delta variant COVID spikes, each of our facilities have remained open continuously since the summer of 2020 and rental income collection rates remain near 100%. In March 2021, we shared our expectations of completing 400 to 600 million in new investments during the year, including both acquisitions and development financing. It would've been easy to complete good investments pro - ratably throughout the year, but our investors are more interested in DOC making great investments with better long-term accretive returns resulting from our relationship focused strategy, rather than just meeting a calendar. We appreciate your confidence through the first half of the year while we completed our negotiation with Landmark, and we're patient with our great partner in Scottsdale on our health. While they completed the construction of two of the most recent additions to the DOC portfolio. On October 1st, we announced our agreement to purchase the 15 building of Landmark healthcare facility portfolio for $764 million. A Class 8 portfolio includes 1.4 million square feet with an average building size of 97,000 feet. Each asset is affiliated with a premier health system. Including ten new system relationships to DOC. Those include the investment-grade rated University of Florida Health, Beaumont Health, and McLaren Health Care to combine for 40% on the portfolios tenancy. In total, 74% of the Landmark portfolio is leased to an investment grade health system. And the portfolio carries over 7 years of average remaining lease term, each providing great stability for years to come. Additionally, the transaction includes a purchase option on another 46 thousand, but on-campus MOB that land market has developed. Currently with DOC mezzanine capital, and their own equity and construction financing that MOB will be completed in 2022. Upon completion of this acquisition, our share of leases to investment-grade health systems as a percentage of our gross leasable space, will increased from 64% today to 65% on a proforma basis. We're excited to add these relationships and assets to our portfolio and are well on into the final due diligence and closing process, including the transition of property management responsibilities were applicable. While one or more health systems could exercise their right to match our purchase price or other conditions could prevent us from closing, we do not anticipate a material reduction in this investment opportunity and expect to close a landmark acquisitions by the end of the year. The 2 new HonorHealth medical facilities we acquired were self-developed by HonorHealth. The HonorHealth neuroscience facility located on their flagship Osborne campus, has 109,000 rentable square feet and is a 100% leased with a waited average remaining lease term of 7.7 years. The HonorHealth medical office facility is 60,000 square feet on the campus and attached to HonorHealth News and Oren hospital and serves that high-gross submarket northwest of Phoenix. These investments expand our total investments anchored by HonorHealth to 8 facilities, totaling approximately 459 thousand square feet. We expect to continue to grow with this outstanding investment-grade health system and the physicians aligned with them in the future. With these amounts investments we now exceed $1 billion of new investments closed or under contract during 2021. DOC 's growth has been fueled by our relationship with healthcare systems and physician groups and the developers working directly with those providers. Those developers includes Cambridge Healthcare, the David scrutiny, Landmark, Meridian, Catalyst, and others. While there's nothing wrong with private ownership of medical office facilities, as a unique advantage, public companies like DOC have a long-term ownership of medical office facilities aligned with best-in-class healthcare providers. Most of our largest clients are faith-based or community non-profit, tax exempt organization. We're focused on access to healthcare for the next 50 years, not the interest rate in the next 5 years. Our stability and long-term approach to capital and ownership and laser-focused best in industry, customer service, and property management provide us a measurable advantage to sourcing and completing our investments, growth strategy, and goals. We believe investors want access to a publicly traded best-in-class pure play medical office rate. And we humbly believe all the data identifies Physicians Realty Trust, our board and our management as the best option for that investment. Before I turn the call over to Jeff to review our financials, we're also excited and humbled to announce that dock is among modern healthcare's 2021 best places to Work. Our ranking of 26 in the supplier category represents our debut appearance, earning distinction while serving as the highest rated healthcare real estate provider among the honorees. DOC wouldn't be graded the best place to work without our exceptional team. And today I want to recognize our very own Mark Diggs, VP of Asset Management, who just began his 1-year term, as Chairman of BOMA International. His leadership and attention to DOC will not waiver. At this recognition and leaderships that commercial real estate industry is a tribute to his professional and personal excellence. And we're blessed to have him on our leadership team. Would also like to recognize Mark Time, our EVP of Asset Management, and one of DOC's founders, who was recently named by Globe Street to the 50 under 40 list of people to know in the U.S. commercial real estate industry. Congratulations, Mark and Mark, and keep up the outstanding leadership to DOC as the providers in the communities we serve. Jeff.
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you John. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company generated normalized funds from operations of $58 million or $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $55 million, an increase of 5.3% over the comparable quarter of last year. And our FAD per share was $0.24. In the third quarter, the Company delivered consistent performance with same-store NOI growth of 2.5%, and same-store occupancy down 50 basis points year-over-year as strong lease spread have offset a handful of deliberate non-renewals. The portfolio saw no material impacts at all from the Delta variant and we continue to collect over 99% of all contractual rents and accounts receivable balances remained at the lowest levels in the history of the Company. Looking back over the past 2 years, although we were optimistic that the portfolio would whether the pandemic better than most real estate asset classes, has performed so well, it has even surprised us. As we continue to invest in building the best tenant base in the industry, refine our credit monitoring process, and dispose of our limited non-core assets like we did with our recently announced LTeX sale, we see no reason why we won't continue to perform even better over the long term. The Company closed $109 million of investments this quarter at an average first-year unlevered yield of 5.4%, highlighted by the off-market acquisition of a newly-constructed on-campus MOB with HonorHealth. In October, the Company closed another a $100 million of deals and announced the $764 million Landmark transaction. The 15 building portfolio is 74% leased to investment-grade tenants and not only provides an exceptionally high-quality portfolio today, but also opens the door to ten new. Health system relationships for future growth. Since many of our acquisitions are repeat deals often directly with health systems, we would expect it's latest transaction to provide future benefits as well. We continue to see enhanced demand for medical office properties as private market participants aggressively pursue the product. However, the difficulty of prime these assets away from health system owners is significant. Which enhances the value of our existing portfolio, as well as our platform. We had a busy quarter on the financing side of the business. We amended and extended our revolving credit facility, pushing the term-out until 2025 and reducing our current cost by five basis points. We also took advantage of our upgraded rating profile from Moody's and S&P to issue $500 million and 10-year bonds with a 2.625% coupon. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay our $250 million term-loan and expect to continue to build out our long-term debt curve over time as we grow the Company. As of now, we have only $84 million of debt coming due through 2025, providing exceptional financial stability for our investors. We issued $53 million on the ATM in October at an average price of $18.61 as we see the pipeline continued to build for next year. Additionally, we recently signed a contract to sell our 3 long-term acute care assets for $62 million. Finally, eliminating some non-core assets that we bought in the early years of the Company. These were assets that went through the bankruptcy process in 2019 and generated some temporary negative sentiment. While we achieved a 9% unlevered IRR on our LTAC investment, we prefer the risk-adjusted returns of medical office buildings over the long term and capitalize on the opportunity to sharpen our pure-play MOB focus. Following this transaction, medical office buildings will now provide 96% of our overall NOI an increase of 2% from last quarter. Turning to other relevant portfolio metrics our third-quarter G& A came in at $9.5 million and recurring capital expenditures were $6.7 million for the quarter. So both are trending towards our full-year guidance of 36 to 38 million for G&A million to $27 million for CapEx. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our portfolios statistics in more detail. Mark.
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. DOC continues to benefit from our growing operating platform and strong relationships with HealthCare partners. Before highlighting our Q3 performance, I'd like to start by recognizing two outstanding recent achievements by the team. First, Physicians Realty Trust was selected by the Institute of Real Estate Management as the 2021 accredited management organization of the year. The AMO accreditation was established 75 years ago to advance best practices in real estate management at the Company level, with 560 worldwide firms holding this prestigious accreditation. Today, we are exceptionally proud to be at the very top of that list as the 2021 Accredited Management Organization of the Year. Second, we recently announced our inaugural GRESB score of 75 in their 2021 Real Estate Assessment outperforming the international score of 73 out of 100. In addition, we received a Green Star designation recognizing the team's work implementing and measuring sustainability policies. As these achievements indicate, DOC remains committed to acting as an ESG leader as we accelerate our external growth momentum. We continue to expand our in-house property management and leasing platforms during the third quarter, laying the groundwork for additional cost efficiencies to deliver long-term enterprise value for our shareholders. As an example, our recent off-market acquisition of 2 newly constructed facilities occupied by HonorHealth are our 14th and 15th real estate investments in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA. Through our in-house management teams, we are excited to expand this trusted partnership with HonorHealth, while also realizing the benefit of our management infrastructure through additional property management fees. Looking forward, our management structure is scalable and will continue to benefit from concentration as we invest in top quality properties and portfolios, like the Landmark portfolio that is scheduled to close in Q4. In the third quarter, we saw the power of our platform and portfolio generate both internal and external growth opportunities led by same-store growth of 2.5%, leasing spreads of positive 4.4%, and an in-house leasing team that saved over $4 million year-to-date in commissions that would have otherwise been paid to outside leasing brokers, assuming a conservative 3% fee. Our same store MOB portfolio, which again does not exclude repositioning assets, generated cash NOI growth of 2.5% for Q3 in 2021. The NOI growth was driven primarily by a year over year 2.5% increase in base rental revenue. Operating expenses were up 7.3% and offset by an 8.4% increase in operating expense recovery revenue. Once again, demonstrating the insulated nature of our triple-net leases. Year-over-year operating expenses were up 2.2 million overall, primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in property insurance costs and a $0.7 million increase in real estate taxes. Same-store occupancy year-over-year was down approximately 50 basis points as we intentionally vacated several suites this quarter to make room for anchor tenants with stronger credit to expand the better rates and lease terms. Year-to-date, our leasing team has completed nearly 800,000 square feet of leasing activity with an 80% retention rate and positive 2.7% leasing spreads. In Q3, specifically, tenant retention was 72% across 179,000 square feet of lease renewal. With cash renewal leasing spreads a positive 4.4%. To further drive future internal growth 80% of the leases executed this quarter contained an annual rent escalation of at least 2.5%. Notably, these results were also achieved with limited leasing costs totaling $1.47 per square foot per year across the full volume of consolidated leasing activity. A figure that's much more efficient than industry averages. Our successful net effective rent outcomes are driven by the quality of our assets and backed by the market pressures driving increases in rental rates and construction pricing. As we look at our portfolio moving forward, DOC's investments are diversified geographically, with no one state accounting for more than 15% of rent, and no single tenant accounting for more than 5.7%. Additionally, our investment-grade quality tenants improved to 64.4% in the third quarter, from 62.5% in the second quarter. as a result of the LifeCare portfolio disposition and HonorHealth Investment. These metrics and all of our portfolio quality metrics will further improve with the acquisition of the class A landmark portfolio that is 74% leased to investment-grade tenants and includes 10 new hospital relationships. The team is focused on the due diligence and integration of this portfolio by the end of the year and overall, very excited about growing the DOC portfolio from $5 billion in real estate investments at the beginning of 2021 to nearly $6 billion in real estate investments by year-end. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator Instructions]. One moment please while we hold for questions. Our first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thanks. good morning. I'm here with [Indiscernible]. There's a lot going on in medical office today, including HTA announcing its strategic review this morning. I was wondering if you can comment on your interest level in participating in a potential sale process versus other opportunities that you're seeing in the market.
John Thomas: John, we're focused on our core business in acquiring new investments and investment-grade quality medical office buildings and financing developments of those facilities. Again, we see every opportunity that's publicly available and evaluate those, but we don't comment some on them to be reached completely. So thanks for the question.
John Kim: Last quarter you mentioned John cap rates for high-quality portfolios going in the low 5, and I'm wondering if you can update us on this quarter and what you're seeing fully for those assets.
John Thomas: Yeah. Like we've seen, we think the Landmark portfolio is -- humbly is the highest quality portfolio we've seen and execute on that in an off-market basis. We are seeing portfolios trade frankly, well below in the mid-fours now today, so again, high-quality assets and kind of sizable portfolios. But we think the Landmark portfolio we acquired at an attractive price and frankly better than an openly marketed process.
John Kim: Yeah, I was going to asked about that. So the 4-9 was negotiated a while ago. Where would that trade today if it were to be sold? And can you also comment on the refers you mentioned you weren't that concerned about it, but how many assets or what percentage of the portfolio have that option?
John Thomas: Yes. So these were all built, purpose developed for those health systems. I think one was acquired by like Mark in the process of their relationship with the health system. But all of them have a Roper's and where they are on the ground leases. We, our Landmark, or both have visited with all the health systems and starting to receive waivers back verbally and in writing. So they still have some time left in their review process, but we expect substantially all of them, if not all of them to waive those?Ropers? and complete the acquisitions. In your other question, again we're seeing prints of assets sold in the open market portfolio. So on the open market in the mid-4. Again, we think the Landmark portfolio with specifically with the quality of the billing, the age of the billings, the walls of the billings to the health system credits involved, 74% of these buildings are leased to investment-grade health system credit. So, we think we will trade in the mid-4's, but not low 4's.
John Kim: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.
John Thomas: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Great. So, I think the previous guidance was for $400 to $600 million. So I guess that's over with, you guys are blowing through that, any goalposts you would offer up for the remainder of the year or just on a look forward basis, John, or just kind of trying to frame up what the investment opportunity looks like. It really [Indiscernible] after the third quarter.
John Thomas: Depending on how you count, there's a lot out there available in the market and we're still evaluating some opportunities before the year-end. And I don't think we're prepared to update guidance, if you will, as we didn't blow through the 4 to 600. And included in that is we've got -- we did announce over a billion of investments which is the biggest challenge is of Landmark, of course. We do have 3 projects still under construction, one of those will break ground in the first week of December. It's a 100%-leased, beautiful facility and we think it'll be an award winner next year and in the Minneapolis market, got 1 in New York MSA under construction with Landmark, and we now have an option to acquire that building when it's completed next year and then we have projects within investment-grade tenant in the Dallas, Fort Worth market. I think we will see a little bit more completed this year and then first-quarter pipeline is really building up nicely.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then can you speak to sort of the financing evolve this maybe Jeff, you can kind of frame up where you are on leverage right now on a pro - forma basis for all this activity and sort of where you expect to be or how you expect to get back this where the target range.
John Thomas: Sure. Thanks. Jordan. So if you look at our third quarter on our enterprise debt-to-EBITDA we were about 5.0 times, proforma for all this activity, assuming Landmark closes completely in the fourth-quarter, that would bring us to about 6 times debt-to-EBITDA. So that certainly at the higher end of where we've operated historically. However, if you look at our portfolio, we're 65% in investment grade tenancy. We collected 99% of all our rents during a terrible pandemic. We're effectively 98% triple-net lease. So there's no operating margin risk in there.
Jeffrey Theiler: We only have 4% to 6% of our leases expiring each year over the next 3 years. And we've prepaid pretty much all of our debt. So, we only have $84 million of debt to refinance through 2025. So we think we're in an incredibly stable financial position, so we'll leverage trend down from 6 times pro - forma, yeah, it probably will. Are we nervous about carrying 6 times debt to EBITDA for some period of time? No, absolutely not. So we will be opportunistic as we look at funding, it will depend a lot on the upcoming pipeline and we'll just kind of continue to evaluate it.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just coming back to Landmark, but also the HonorHealth transactions, including one of the more recent ones, new construction assets at closing in. What looks like a 4.5 cap. Can you maybe speak to the merit of investing in MOB sub-5 -- at sub-5 cap rates, and maybe it would help by explaining the difference in the growth profile of the -- maybe the HonorHealth assets versus the actor's portfolio for example. Where you're getting a 5.5.
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. I understood Jordan, you know, the Phoenix market is really as hot as it can be, pardon the pun with Phoenix. We think the rents at that -- in those two buildings are below market at this point, and certainly in the current market. We have some shorter-term leases in those a nice long Walt overall in both those buildings, but we have some shorter-term leases where we can move some things around and take advantage of some of those kind of mark-to-market and that billings. We think the kind of opportunity set there, in particular, as, as much stronger than that stated first-year cap rate. We have opportunities from reward development and more acquisitions with HonorHealth itself directly and so these were off-market transactions. They were under construction, kind of went into a pre -sale arrangement with them mid-year and it took them to allow the uncompleted, and [Indiscernible] and rent commencing. So the rationale for that I think -- I think Jeff can walk through the math and then kind of with the ramp bumps. And again, our expectation of moving some rent start more aggressively in parts of those buildings. There will be a creative in 2022.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Edwin (ph) with RDC. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Coniensky: Hey, good morning, guys. It sounds like you have an opportunity to potentially drive rent growth higher. You've been holding back from?space?. I was wondering if you could quantify that opportunity.
Mark Theine: Yes. Sure. Jason, this is Mark, As you mentioned, and we said in our prepared remarks, we deliberately did not renew a few leases this quarter to make room for our anchor tenants, in many cases, investment-grade rated hospital systems to expand and take over the full building. That's a specific example in Louisville that we have just seen. And then year-over-year, some of the other spots, we're really -- we're really picking our spots and focused on markets like Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, where market rental rates are increasing more than the averages. So for us, our portfolio is 96% leased, but there's opportunity as you know from maybe 1%, 2% of the portfolio here to really pick our spots and trend drive, rental increases and market rents higher than normal.
Jason Coniensky: Okay. And then as we look into the acquisition pipeline, looking ahead to 2022, obviously 2021 is very back-end weighted. Should we expect anything similar in 2022, given you're still going to be digesting the landmark deal or will it be more evenly spread out throughout the year?
John Thomas: Yeah. Good question. As I said in my introductory remarks, you'd like to?ratably? during the year. I think back to one of the other questions, we will issue guidance for next year with their next earnings call, but we've been deploying $500 to a $1 billion almost every year and again, most years it's more ratable throughout the year. This one we just had the opportunity to capture a very large transaction and also to develop the projects that just took longer to complete than we expected. So again, I think hopefully we'll see some more ratable first quarters is building up very nice right now. And we're in negotiations with a couple of more development projects which have not commenced yet, probably commenced first quarter and we will be able to include that in our numbers for next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. One of the things that we've noticed and certainly in our channel checks is there's a lot more interest from private equity and medical office. And I'm wondering you think about that. How do you how do you think about those competitive pressures? How do you drive accretive growth? Do you -- would you consider levering up here a little bit given your Balance Sheet? Just sort of thinking about a pretty, pretty strong background -- backdrop for medical office and how you handle allocations drive through that?
John Thomas: If you look at institutional real estate investors, whether they be public or private, look across all commercial real estate asset classes. I don't think there's another one maybe, but cell towers that collected virtually all their rents in 2020 and many are still suffering through significant declines in occupancy and high wage labor costs, which don't affect us. And so as you're allocating capital in an institutional investor, it's no surprise that some of the world's biggest private equity firms and non-traded rates are going to be very attracted to the medical office space and I'm just driving appreciation of assets, again, in a 4 or 5 a day kind of FMV of best-in-class assets. Generally a 4-pack cap rate going in, but we look at our investments on a long-term IRR basis. And so again, those investors that have a 3 to 5-year horizon, with a be private equity or other private capital. We think we compete very well against that. We think the health systems are looking for long-term owners with the transparency about public Company and opening the business model of a public Company that's wants to be -- create situations and relationships that are win-win and that's -- we think that's how we keep getting repeat business with the likes of HonorHealth and others and had a great long-term relation with Landmark and they finally decided just to sell us all their assets and so we think that's the updating the firm to welcome to the party. We have great relationships with most of them and look from time-to-time with potential joint venture opportunities. But for the most part think, adding assets to our balance sheet is our primary focus. Jeff.
Richard Hill: That's helpful guys. If I may -- i appreciate the collar on the unlevered yields for Landmark. But any thoughts or anything you might be willing to share on accretion in 2022 or 2023? I recognize it's early. Recognize you haven't guided. So, if the answer is no, I completely get it, but I figured I'd ask.
John Thomas: Yeah, the answer is generally no, but the Landmark portfolio does have some more vacancy across the portfolio than our our portfolio and we're already working on in evaluating lease-up opportunities for that space and we were talking about two or 300 basis points, but there are some shorter Walton in some of those buildings and as we talked about before, the market rent are moving more aggressively up in those markets and so again, we expect to take full advantage of those opportunities with those health systems and source new developments with those health systems.
Richard Hill: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. I will. Thanks. Turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
John Thomas: We appreciate everybody joining us this morning. We look forward to follow-up calls and Nareit. Unfortunately, Zoom is next week, but we look forward to seeing you one way or the other. Thanks for participating.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Physicians Realty Trust Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Bradley Page, SVP, General Counsel. Thank you, you may begin.
Bradley Page: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust second quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. Joining me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, Chief Investment Officer; Mark Theine, Executive Vice President, Asset Management; John Lucey, Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer; and Laurie Becker, Senior Vice President, Controller. During this call, John Thomas will provide a summary of the company's activities and performance for the second quarter of 2021 and year-to-date as well as our strategic focus for the remainder of 2021. Jeff Theiler will review our financial results for the second quarter of 2021. And Mark Theine will provide a summary of our operations for the second quarter of 2021. Following that, we will open the call for questions. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They are based on the current beliefs of management and information currently available to us. Our actual results will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations and those anticipated or implied in such forward-looking statements. For more detailed description of potential risks and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the Company's CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. And thank you for joining us this morning. Our portfolio of best-in-class medical office facilities continue to perform exceptionally during this second quarter, delivering the predictable growth and operating outcomes that medical office investors have come to expect. This includes the collection of over 99% of all cash rents due during the quarter, supported by patient volumes that remain resilient, despite the recent spikes in the Delta variant. Along with this operational performance, we continue to have confidence in our external growth pipeline. Since our last call, we have made additional progress on our acquisitions, and have high quality medical office building targets in various stages of negotiations. Substantially all of this pipeline is off market in direct negotiations with existing health systems, and developer and owner clients. So while our investments will be back and weighted this year, we remain very confident in our guidance and $400 million to $600 million of investment activities for 2021. Our loan pipeline continues to grow as well, including the newly announced mezzanine loan in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. DOC's real estate loan book totaled $176 million and outstanding principal at quarter end and a secured by real estate valued at over $1 billion. In addition to the attractive 8% average coupon our loan portfolio represents a source of future growth through embedded local REITs and purchase options. Within this loan book our five projects under development with an expected market value of over $200 million upon completion, including one loan to own transaction, our pipeline for development financing opportunities continues to grow. We expect to secure mainly these new opportunities by year end supporting our growth in 2022 and 2023. We're also evaluating the opportunity to use the robust medical office market, to dispose of some non-core facilities at a profit. This planning can both enhance the quality of the portfolio and also provide an additional source of funding for the growth this year. Our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Theiler will review our financial results and balance sheet in a few minutes. But I wanted to recognize Jeff and for Mark Theine leading us in the achievement of our long overdue upgraded credit ratings with both S&P and Moody's. We've already seen the benefits of these well-deserved upgrades to our cost of capital, amplifying our opportunity for outsiders to predict growth going forward. The trends in favor of medical office have proven to be very predictable and reliable, driving a consistent and growing rental income stream for the benefit of our shareholders. Public investors and healthcare real estate can count on medical office to remain open, occupied and busy. Medical office does not need to recover. As an asset class it is only impacted temporarily in spring 2020 and DOC has maintained close to 96% occupancy throughout the pandemic. We remain focused on growing our funds available for distribution each year and we'll continue to manage our organization to achieve that result annually. Jeff will now review our financial results and then Mark Theine will share our operating results. Jeff?
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company generated normalized funds from operations of $58 million or $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $55 million, an increase of 3.6% over the comparable quarter of last year, and our FAD per share was $0.25. Our operating portfolio has continued to perform well in the second quarter. Our same-store portfolio had consistent occupancy year-over-year and generated NOI growth of 2.4%, right in line with the fix escalators and consistent with our expectations. The one deferment we granted in the midst of the pandemic last year has been fully paid back, including $200,000 of associated late fees. Through this quarter and to the present time, we are seeing very little negative impact with our tenants from COVID at this point, despite the emergence of the Delta variant. We are optimistic that our portfolio will continue to perform and be resilient in the current environment. Turning to the balance sheet, we've been recognized by two major rating agencies over the past few months for portfolio and balance sheet improvements that have been years in the making. We were upgraded to BBB flat by S&P on May 13, and upgraded to Baa2 by Moody's on July 1. These upgrades have a significant impact on our cost of capital and improve our ability to compete for the highest quality buildings. In their rating evaluations, both agencies recognized the high quality of our pure play MOB portfolio and its superior performance during the pandemic. They also noted our discipline capital strategy and best-in-class tenant mix, specifically our 63% concentration of investment grade tenants, 93% exposure to net leases and significantly lower proportion of near term lease expirations relative to the sector. We remain highly disciplined with our capital strategy, raising $83 million on the ATM in the second quarter at an average price of $18.39, as we continue to pre fund our acquisition pipeline. As a consequence, we currently sit in an excellent financial position with consolidated debt-to-EBITDA of 4.5 times, and an outstanding revolving credit facility balance of $72 million, leaving $778 million of availability. This pre funding has placed us in a position to successfully execute on our substantial pipeline in the back half of the year. We are still confident in the acquisition guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year $400 million to $600 million of new investments, and expect to execute on those investments prior to the end of the year. As we discussed last quarter, the pipeline is full of the types of buildings that are inner sweet spot, high quality MOBs with strong investment grade Tennessee from leading health systems. JT has talked about the progress on this pipeline and will perhaps that progress has been slower than we were anticipating. It has been steady and we remain on track. Turning to other relevant portfolio metrics, our second quarter G&A came in at $9.1 million and recurring CapEx was $5.7 million for the quarter. Our full year guidance for those metrics remains unchanged at $36 million to $38 million for G&A, and $25 million to $27 million for CapEx. I will now turn the call over to Mark, to walk through some of our portfolio statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. Quarter-by-quarter MOB has continued to prove their reputation for stability with occupancy collections and leasing trends that remain strong regardless of market factors. The steady internal growth delivered by our asset management platform is the result of superior tenant satisfaction, strong 2.4% built-in rent to rent escalators, and an industry leading 96% lease rate. Our leasing and CapEx teams continued to deliver value during the quarter, with an impressive tenant retention of 87%, positive cash releasing spreads of 2.7% and low CapEx investments that totaled just 7% of cash NOI. The operations team also continued to execute on the plan to expand our in-house property management platform, laying the groundwork for further cost efficiencies across the portfolio that will deliver long-term value for shareholders. Specifically, we've recently welcomed Mercedes Marquez and Nicole Bradley to the DOC family as we expand our management efforts in Phoenix, Arizona and Birmingham, Alabama. From a performance perspective, our MOB same-store NOI growth in the second quarter was 2.4%. The NOI growth was driven primarily by a year-over-year 2.4% increase in base rental revenue. Operating expenses were up 6.2% and offset by 7.0% increase in operating expense recovery revenue. Year-over-year operating expenses were up $1.9 million overall, primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in utilities and a $0.4 million increase in insurance cost. Same-store occupancy remained steady at 95.4% year-over-year, as our leasing team continues to execute consistently with strong retention. On a consolidated basis, we completed a total of 395,000 square feet of leasing activity during the quarter, the second highest quarterly volume in history of the company. Tenant retention was 87% across 353,000 square feet of lease renewals with cash renewal spreads of positive 2.7%. Notably, these results were achieved with limited leasing costs totaling $1.68 per square foot per year across the full volume of leasing activity. A figure that is much more efficient than industry averages. Our successful net effective rent outcomes are driven by our deep understanding of our primary markets, and constant evaluation of the local leasing trends. Turning to our capital investments for the quarter, we once again proactively managed recurring CapEx to $5.7 million or 7% of cash NOI. Year-to-date, DOC has invested $11.3 million in recurring capital projects. While committed leasing TIs were low on a per square foot basis, we do expect capital expenditures to tick up during the second half of the year due to increased leasing volumes. As a result, we still expect to fall within the $25 million to $27 million full year guidance previously announced. Embedded within all capital investments made by DOC is a strong commitment to materials and practices that enhance the patient experience and our ESG efforts. Our second annual interactive ESG report was released in June, and highlights the exceptional progress toward our three year goal to improve the portfolio's overall carbon footprint, energy, water, waste, usage by 10% compared to our 2018 base year, In 2020, DOC invested in 29 sustainability driven capital expenditure projects totaling $4.2 million, generating approximately $7.7 million in operating expense savings over the next 10 years. Additionally, we exceeded our team's social goals by raising our donating over $350,000 for worthy causes across the country, and providing over 515 volunteer hours of service to charitable organizations. In the eight years since our IPO, we have not only built one of the best healthcare real estate portfolios in the country, but we have also assembled the best healthcare real estate team. Our efforts directly translate into care for tenants, evidence in our 2021 Kingsley Associates Tenant Satisfaction survey results. This year, we surveyed nearly 365 tenants representing nearly 3.4 million square feet. Physicians Realty Trust received an industry leading 76% response rate. In addition, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we earned the highest scores in the history of the company, including an overall management satisfaction score of 4.53 out of 5.0, beating the national benchmark. Going forward, we expect continued successes from our growing operating platform, resulting in enhanced local market knowledge, repeat investment opportunities with existing partners, profitable operating efficiencies, and continued tenant retention. With that, I'll now turn the call back to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Jeff. We'll now take your questions.
Q - Juan Sanabria: Thanks guys. Only my wife calls me Ron, but that's fine. Certainly acquisition pipeline, hoping you guys can give us a little bit more color on the expectations for the second half. I think last quarter you talked about visibility on $200 million of opportunities, maybe how those evolved in kind of pricing expectations?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah, great question, Juan. The pipeline has just continued to build, we're very confident about getting the full year numbers $400 million to $600 million, and we've got line of sight to a pipeline that's at least that big right now. So it's a collection of high quality medical office building, some that were under construction in the first half of the year, and just kind of moving to CO and we'll move to recommencement here this quarter. And so it's really, we're really excited about it. So hopefully, we'll share a lot more with the next call.
Juan Sanabria: And the pricing is still kind of that mid 5% to 6%?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, 5% to 6%. I mean, again, the higher quality newer buildings are going to be at the low end of that range. But the development pipeline, which continues to grow, is where we achieve those higher returns.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, and then just curious on what you guys think about the importance of scale, and maybe the opportunity for public M&A given potential cost synergies or further improvements to the cost of capital post your credit rating upgrade? Or if you prefer to kind of just onesy and twoesy and don't really like the prospect of a bigger portfolio transactions or just kind of your general thoughts on that subject matter?
John Thomas: Yes, Juan, I'm sorry, we had a brief disruption here. The - I think I got the gist of your question, the - our execution strategy from the beginning has been direct negotiated off market transactions, primarily through health system relationship, physician relationships, and healthcare, real estate developers. And that's what we're focused on our strategy and execution there. And again, we've got a high quality pipeline, we'll be able to share a lot more about with the next earnings call. Scale is obviously very important. As we've grown, as Mark mentioned, we've expanded our internal property management team in a couple of markets, where we had some significant growth opportunities. And so, again, scale in our core markets continues to drive a lot of synergy value, and it grows more enough to provide more opportunities. So, it's a public market M&A, or large portfolio transactions, we certainly look at everything, but we're focused on our core strategy and we're approaching $6 billion in assets, we've got pretty good scale already.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you, guys.
John Thomas: Thanks, Juan.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph, with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. As you look at your acquisition pipeline, obviously, a lot of it is back end loaded this year. Is that kind of unique to this year? Or is that representative of what your acquisition pipeline should also look like heading into 2022?
John Thomas: Yes, it is unique for this year, it just the circumstances of how the pipeline built-in at the end of last year, is that we'd like to be a little more spread out. And I think historically there was a time where we were closing the building a week. So it's just the uniqueness of this year, I think there were some sellers, some health systems, at the end of last year, that weren't really thinking about monetizing, but with expecting changes in tax laws, kind of changing in political environment, things like that, we're seeing more opportunities kind of evolve that - kind of bubbled up in the first quarter, that we've been negotiating through. And again, expect to execute on this quarter and the last quarter. So, I think it's just unique to this year, but now, it's been, frankly it's been pretty exciting for us.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just back to the broader transaction market, you mentioned cap rates, maybe 5% to 6%. How have you seen portfolios trade relative to individual assets? And then what is the buyer pool look like?
John Thomas: Yes, the buyer pool has gotten bigger. Private equity continues to quote unquote, private equity if you will, as it continues to raise a lot of capital continues to explore both individual assets and the portfolios have been floating around. We haven't seen anything - of course, we look at everything is marketed. But most of our substantially all of our transaction volume this year will be off marketing, not portfolio based transactions, but there's a premium out there for the portfolio's we've seen traded leased based on the quoted, cap rates, the ones that have the $300 million to $500 million portfolios that are floated around, I think, I think we're hearing five and a quarter kind of cap rates, 5.5 on some of those. On assets that are probably high five to six, if bought in an individual basis. So a lot of capital chasing the assets. As we said, we're, we expect to dispose of opportunistically, a few of our assets that just don't fit our strategic portfolio going forward, but they're tracking in a nice high price.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jordan Sadler: Good morning, guys. So, I want to follow up on that last piece. JT, you mentioned, dispositions, which I feel like we've kind of had - you guys have had an on again, off again, view towards dispose a little bit. And it sounds like you're mentioning them again, which makes me feel like you're a bit closer maybe then you had in the past to sell in some stuff? Can you maybe offer a little bit more color to run surrounding the sales?
John Thomas: Yes, we think our portfolios - we pruned some things a couple of years ago, out of the portfolio. We think our portfolio is outstanding, so of our 275 buildings we love all our children. So, but the - there's just a couple of, I think small circumstances where either portfolio might trade, and our assets are complimentary to that, or, I know, we're always kind of out exploring the opportunity to sell the L tags, things like that. So it's just opportunistic in things that have bubbled up, but we do expect to close on a handful of dispositions this year. And we'll use that capital to fund our acquisitions.
Jordan Sadler: Volume wise, are we looking at like $100 million total or something smaller?
Operator: We dropped the line.
Jordan Sadler: Can you guys hear me?
Operator: They are still connected. I do not know what the technical difficulty is.
John Thomas: Hey, Jordan, we lost for a minute. Sorry about that.
Jordan Sadler: Shall I repeat the question, or you got?
John Thomas: Yes, your question was, you said $100 million. And my response to that was that would be on the high end. It's a handful of dispositions.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, along the same lines, the leverage really with the use of the ATM, Jeff, good job, you're, I think about as low as we've seen in a while and 4.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA I think you've quoted. So sort of appetite that continues to sort of use that to get the leverage lowers ahead of sort of the back end weighted acquisitions would be my question. And then any insight on additional ATM that's been issued post quarter end?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, good questions, Jordan. Like you said, we've been pretty proactive about funding the acquisition pipeline in the first two quarters of the year. So really, we're at a point right now where we could execute on that acquisition guidance and not raise additional equity. So I think we're in a really good spot. I mean look, we're always opportunistic about how we fund our deals and it's dependent on what we see coming down the line in the far future as well. So, we'll take it day-by-day, but as a need, we don't have any need for additional equity.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Than the second one for you Jeff, the late fees in collections totaled book in 2Q that will repeat?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, just 200,000.
Jordan Sadler: 200, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Amanda Sweitzer, from Baird. Please proceed.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Following up on your comments on increase CapEx and the increased leasing volume, you expect your back half lease maturities actually look comparable to what you experienced in the first half. So are you expecting to be able to build occupancy over the remainder of the year? And what's the outlook for leasing vacant space today?
Mark Theine: Yes, thanks, Amanda. This is Mark. As you'd mentioned, the back half the year we've got about 2% of our ADR coming up for renewal in the second half of 2021. It's about 91 leases, and an average of about $23 per square foot. So we feel really good about where the market rental rates are and especially a lot of the local market trends being able to push some of those rents and some of the escalators upon lease renewal. And then what we're seeing a lot of right now is, requests for CapEx and TI and some early lease renewal. So we accelerated a few leases this quarter, extended early, adding some nice term to hospital leases, and extended them into the future have a solid rent bumps. So if we expect solid leasing activity to continue there.
Amanda Sweitzer: That's helpful. And then, as you've seen more companies start to kind of solidify the return to office plan. Can you provide an update how you're thinking about your health system administration tenants today? Have those tenants given you any update about how they're thinking about their go-forward space needs?
John Thomas: Yes, I think, we have a small amount of if you will, administrative space with health systems, but it's leased for multiple years. So we're having that dialogue. I think health systems are, again, with this Delta variant, it's kind of slowed down some of their internal thinking, while I focus on the hospitals that are full, and again, shifting patients to the outpatient care facilities like we own. So we don't have any good color yet other than systems are trying to rationalize make that decision. We've had conversations about either selling those building, subleasing those buildings, or keeping them in shape, while they figure out those plans, maybe in the fourth quarter. So sorry to be so vague, but it's we don't have a lot of that space.
Amanda Sweitzer: No, that makes sense. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Our next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. I guess maybe just on that last point around health systems, figuring things out given COVID and maybe this resurgence, can you just give us any color on conversations have had or expect to have on either sort of sale leasebacks or just even more directly on health systems, looking at that whole off campus close to consumers in terms of pushing care out there?
John Thomas: So, we're obviously big believers in that long-term strategy by health systems to plant outpatient care facilities in new markets. That's exactly like the Brooklyn Park development, we're financing the project we're developing this year are almost all - financing the development of this year almost all exactly that kind of description, amatory surgery center anchor and health system employed physicians, outpatient care diagnostics, things like that. Our portfolio does include a nice balance or a mix of on campus. Assets that are the health system in our case in our pipeline are monetizing to raise capital for their balance sheets, and at the same time, coordinating discussion around new developments with those same health systems. So it's a good mix, I haven't seen a real change in the long-term trends expanding on campus, newer assets, and at the same time planning flags and new demographics for growth.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe Jeff, if you can just remind us in this environment where there's still inflation concerns, whether it's on labor materials, taxes. Can you remind us again, just the overall structure kind of the preponderance of leases, how the pass-throughs work?
Mark Theine: Yes, Vikram, this is Mark. Actually Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks that our portfolio is very well insulated from rising operating expenses due to the triple net structure, 93% of our portfolio is triple net. And then, really all but 2% have some protection against inflation, of operating expenses, some of them are modified gross leases, which also have a cap that's paid for by the tenants. So be able to solve that in our same-store results with a slight increase in operating expenses, but nearly all of it was recovered through our recovery structures in the portfolio.
Vikram Malhotra: Got it, okay, that's helpful. And then I just want to go back to the disposition comments, that you made, and I like guess like leverage obviously is in a great place, so you can look to use a balance sheet. But just given where the maybe some of what your private peers are doing, which seems like they're in the market or sell more given pricing. What would make you want to kind of really move that disposition number higher?
Mark Theine: Really not Vikram. Like I said, these are opportunistic sales, if you will, and we've talked for years about selling the all taxes, if we can get an appropriate price may continue to perform very well in this in the COVID environment, and that's kind of what they're used for. So EBITDAR has been stronger than a year. So there's a potential good opportunities to sell those this year, the others again, it's a very small handful of buildings in unique situations that we're having opportunity to sell, pricing has been excellent. And we're ready to move those out. We've really, the portfolio is in fantastic shape with 96% occupied, there's not a lot in the portfolio, we want to that we want to even consider selling.
Vikram Malhotra: Great. Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thanks. JT on the investment pipeline, I mean, it sounds like that the size of the pipeline is equals the amount of deals that that you want to close in the second half of the year? I mean, do you have those deals under contract right now and you just need to close on those? I mean, how does that work out?
John Thomas: Yes, no, it's a good portion of them are under contract and just moving to work down the normal closing process with those transactions. Others are under exclusive kind of signed letters of intent, all the economics and deal terms are worked out, just working through the documentation and closing process. Little slower, in part because of, of travel restrictions, and, frankly, the demand for in construction and other things and going around the country, but we remain very confident about not only getting those transactions closed, but continue to work through negotiations on several other things on our pipeline.
Michael Carroll: Okay, how many of those deals in the second half of the year reflect development projects? And do you work out those deals during the time of those projects begin the construction as soon as occupancy or the leases commence? That's when you close those deals, or how's that work out?
John Thomas: Yes, it varies a little bit. The loan downs, essentially work out where we finance the construction off of our balance sheet, they're 100%, occupied investment grade credit quality tenants, and then the loan stays in place for typically for a year for tax reasons, but stays in place for one year, and then it collapses into ownership, you'll see one of the investments we made this year was the cancer center, which is exactly the process we've been on our boats for a couple of years. The first is alone, and now it's converted to a younger ship. Some of the development financing is where we just are part of the capital stack. And typically, that happens when the building is pre-leased to some high percentage, but not fully leased and the developer has their own capital and gets thrown construction loan, we provide some capital, and then we have a real firm that is triggered again, usually with rent commencement. And then maybe for a year after that with for tax reasons, so it just varies. But as we said, or I said in my comments, the assets under construction, on our books today, would be valued at about 200 million, once we convert those to ownership. So that'll happen, most of that will happen in 2020. What's under construction today, convert over in 2022, some of that could blend into 2023. Projects we start in the fourth quarter of this year in we're working through most likely probably at early 2023 conversion to full ownership. But that pipeline is growing. It's been an interesting year for health systems, moving forward to projects that didn't do - that they didn't start last year but proceeded with this year.
Michael Carroll: Okay, and then your investment targets, does that reflect the amount of capital you're going to deploy out this year? Does that reflect the amount of capital you're going to commit to deploy, including those development projects that will bleed into '22 and '23?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, it'll reflect obviously, the amount of acquisitions we complete, and then the amount of development that we're committed to for the year.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. And then just last one, Jeff, Can you remind us what the long term leverage targets is? It's still mid five net debt-to-EBITDA number, has that changed?
Jeffrey Theiler: No Mike. So 5.25 kind of long-term debt target, obviously, that's a conservative number. So there can be some flex around that. But that is the in general, our long-term target.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed.
Daniel Bernstein: Good morning. Wanted to dig into a little bit about the benefits of the increasing internal management and maybe kind of the strategic direction of that as it related to ESG. Just signal maybe that you guys are looking a little bit more away from triple net to more gross lease type of assets. And then maybe and certainly way to quantify kind of benefits, or what benefits you've seen as you grow that management side of the business?
Mark Theine: I'll give, Daniel its Martin. A second to think about the direct financial relation, but it's really, again, part of our long-term strategy, Dan of, again, when we have a health system and we always have a lot of repeat business with the Middle East, that's our goal with the health systems that we work with. And so once we get to scale, and you can internalize that management, again there's a financial benefit of kind of every time you add another building, but you don't have to add another property management team, just the direct correlation there. So, is like in the Phoenix market and the Birmingham market, we just continue to grow in those two markets, and just had the opportunity to hire a couple of outstanding people to put on the team and then directly manage those buildings in those markets ourselves. So scale pretty natural, Columbus, Ohio has been a fantastic example for us of how once we internalize management, not only are we getting a $1 return from that financial return from that. It's also leading to more opportunities in those markets, so they just kind of builds upon itself. So it's not a sign of moving away from triple net leases. Again, we're focused on, again, kind of minimizing the risk maximizing the synergy value of internalizing management and managing the buildings better and at a lower cost. And thus, hopefully moving more of the total cost of occupancy to triple net rent to us not just expenses.
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, to add to that, as JT said, it all starts with the relationship, the hospital relationships, the local market knowledge, the ability to expand our acquisition opportunities with hospital partners across the country. Then secondly, the financial impact starts with economies of scale from just having more properties in the market and being able to lower operating expenses for our healthcare partners in the buildings. Again, most of our expenses are insulated by the triple net leases, but we looked at benefit upon lease renewal from the total occupancy costs that we can show the tenants. And the management fee itself usually adds about 20 to 30 basis points onto a cap rate as an acquisition if we internally manage there. So there as they do, so there's a direct impact from the management fees associated with internalizing property management. So we've really grown a great team around the country and look forward to leveraging the economies of scale and the team as we grow the portfolio in the future.
Daniel Bernstein: All right, and what portion of the portfolio is now internally managed?
John Thomas: Yes, seven of our largest markets are our top 10 largest markets are all internalized. We have to manage everything in the portfolio, of course, but there's a few markets where we partner with hospital systems who have a real estate team directly. And we treat them exactly like part of our partner or a development partner that has lifelong relationships in the market. We work just hand-in-hand with them, almost as if they're part of the DOC team. But technically it's not internally managed. So, some of our top 10 largest markets today.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Appreciate, that's all I have. Thanks.
John Thomas: Thank you, Dan.
Operator: This does conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
John Thomas: Yes, thank you again, for joining us today. We really appreciate the questions dialog and please follow if you got any other and might do you have any other questions? We do encourage you all to get vaccinated. We're starting to move back into the office ourselves and stay safe. We hope to see everyone at the conferences this fall. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Physicians Realty Trust First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Physicians Realty Trust is off to a very good start for 2021. This begins with our pure play focus on medical office facilities, which continues to serve us and our shareholders well. While other types of healthcare real estate are just beginning to see signs of a recovery, medical office clinical visits have been and remained at pre-COVID levels and have been for a long time. We created this operational strength to our nation’s healthcare providers who adapted quickly at the onset of the pandemic to manage COVID outbreaks while continuing to provide necessary non-COVID healthcare services. They accomplished this by shifting non-COVID care to the out-patient setting, accelerating a trend that has been apparent for the past 25-years. All indications are that this is a permanent change in the delivery of healthcare that will continue to grow in the years ahead, especially for more acute orthopedics, oncology and cardiology procedures. Beyond the pandemic, demand for medical office buildings continues to grow in line with our nation’s continued need for out-patient healthcare. CMS estimates $4.1 trillion were spent on healthcare services in 2020. And the national healthcare spending in the United States is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4% from 2019 to 2028, outpacing GDP as well. We expect that an outsized portion of this spend will be directed to off-campus facilities in particular where we continue to see health systems demanding more space. The trends in favor of medical office have proven to be very predictable and reliable. And as a result, we expect our portfolio to produce a consistent and reliable rental income stream with steady growth over time for the benefit of our shareholders. Public investors in healthcare real estate can count on medical office to remain open, occupied and busy. Medical office does not need to recover, as an asset class, it was only impacted temporarily in Spring 2020, and DOC has maintained close to 96% occupancy routinely ever since. We remain focused on growing our funds available for distribution each year, and we will continue to manage our organization to achieve that result annually. On the acquisitions front, we announced the purchase of a brand new medical office facility with an on-site out-patient surgery center on the campus of AdventHealth Hospital in Wesley Chapel, Florida. Several members of our team have long-term relationships with AdventHealth, and we hope to find future opportunities for investment with this system across their national footprint. We also finalized commitments to finance three new medical office facilities anchored by leading investment-grade healthcare systems with two buildings being off-campus and one on campus. We continue to evaluate a number of new development projects and expect a positive uptick in development for the year and going forward. Our investment pipeline continues to grow with visibility on nearly $200 million in prospective opportunities that we expect to close in the coming months, plus a growing number of acquisitions in negotiation that we would expect to execute in the third and fourth quarters. Our growth this year may be slightly weighted to the second half of the year, but we remain very confident in our acquisition guidance of $400 million to $600 million in new investments in 2021. In June 2020, we published our inaugural ESG report, sharing our hard work on environmental management of our buildings since 2018 and progress toward ambitious goals to improve the energy utilization and waste management of all of our facilities. We will publish our second annual ESG report in June 2021, and we will be proud to report great progress on all of our environmental, social and governance goals and the DOC culture. Under Mark Theine’s leadership, Physicians Realty Trust earned the EPA’s ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year, and we expect this to be the first of many awards recognizing our commitment and success in reducing our carbon footprint and providing a better setting for our physicians and providers through better managed buildings. Jeff will now review our financial results and Mark Theine will share our operating results. Jeff?
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2021, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $57.7 million. Normalized FFO per share was $0.27 versus $0.26 in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 3.8%. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $54.5 million, an increase of 7.8% over the comparable quarter of last year and our FAD per share was $0.25. We remain highly focused on this metric as it is the most direct way to measure our company’s performance versus our peers, and we will continue to focus on growing our FAD per share at an outsized rate for our shareholders. We continue to see strong operating performance from our $5 billion medical office building portfolio in the first quarter of the year, the same-store NOI growth was right in line with expectations at 2.4%, and we increased the lease percentage of our portfolio by 10 basis points to 95.8%. Our portfolio continues to be ably - continues to manage the strain of the COVID pandemic, and we collected the usual 99.7% of our billings in the current quarter. The one deferment we granted last year continues to be paid back on time, and the last and final payment will be made in June. Barring an unforeseen intensification of COVID in the future, it now appears that DOC has been able to manage through the worst of the pandemic and emerge with no material negative impacts. This is a direct testament to the strength of the medical office asset class in general, and in particular, the strength of our investment-grade tenant base as well as the high quality of our buildings, credit team and property managers. The balance sheet has been an area of focus for us and is now a positive differentiator between us and the rest of our healthcare REIT peers. With our enterprise leverage of five times debt-to-EBITDA, including our pro rata JV debt and our 62% investment-grade tenant base, we believe we offer our shareholders the best risk adjusted investment in healthcare real estate. We raised $52.4 million of net proceeds on the ATM in the first quarter, effectively pre-funding a portion of what we anticipate to be a substantial year of growth for the company. Our revolving credit facility is only 18% drawn with $156 million outstanding, leaving $694 million of availability. We generally expect the target leverage of 5.25 times debt-to-EBITDA on an enterprise basis going forward. We continue to be confident in the acquisition guidance we laid out several months ago of $400 million to $600 million of new investments despite the relatively slow start in this quarter. We have been admittedly picky. However, we also have high visibility on a number of the types of medical office buildings we are seeking, those with investment-grade-rated health system tenants, performing specialized medical procedures in strong demographic areas. JT referenced the pipeline value of those deals and those types of deals in negotiations during his prepared remarks. Because these are primarily relationship deals, we feel a higher degree of certainty than if we are trying to acquire them at auction. And we still expect to end the year within the total acquisition amounts we guided to at an average cap rate between 5% to 6% subject to suitable capital market conditions. Turning to other portfolio metrics. Our first quarter G&A, which usually trends higher than the rest of the year, was on track at $9.5 million and we expect to meet our guidance range of $36 million to $38 million for the year. Our recurring capital expenditures were well under budget at $5.6 million as our team managed to create some additional efficiencies and some TIs that were budgeted for new leases turned out better than expected. We now expect to be at the bottom of a recurring CapEx guidance range of $25 million to $27 million for 2021. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our portfolio statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. The first quarter of 2021 represented another solid and consistent quarter for Physicians Realty Trust. I’m once again pleased to highlight the strength of our underlying assets and the value of our asset management, leasing and property management platform. DOC’s best-in-class operations team remains dedicated to enhancing the physician-patient experience offering healthcare providers the benefits of a national real estate owner with scale paired with a personal touch of local management. From a performance perspective, our MOB same-store NOI growth in the first quarter was 2.4%. Predictably, NOI growth was driven primarily by a year-over-year 2.4% increase in base rental revenue, in line with our weighted average annual rent escalator. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $2 million overall, primarily driven by a $0.6 million increase in real estate taxes and a $0.6 million increase in insurance costs. However, the value of our net lease structure is once again evident in the nearly dollar-for-dollar increase in operating expense recovery revenues. Lastly, lower parking revenue had a 20 basis point impact on Q1 same-store NOI growth. Specifically, paid parking receipts have now returned to 80% of normal levels during the first quarter, which compares favorably to 48% of normal levels experienced nearly one year ago during the height of the pandemic. Turning to leasing activity. We continue to see significant opportunities to add value as we capitalize on increased demand in our larger markets. We completed 197,000 square feet of leasing activity during the period with a 76% retention rate and positive 6,000 square feet of net absorption. While Q1 leasing volume represented 1.4% of the portfolio due to our staggered lease expiration schedule, we have had a significant increase in leasing tourists and tenants looking for existing medical office space as construction prices continued to drastically increase. In fact, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we just executed a new 18-year lease for the single largest vacancy in our portfolio, a suite totaling 22,000 square feet at the MeadowView MOB in Kingsport, Tennessee. Having navigated through a year of the challenges posed by the pandemic, I’m proud of our team’s uninterrupted focus and continued achievements. Similar to our asset management and leasing teams, our capital projects team also had an excellent quarter, additionally prioritizing recurring CapEx investments totaling $5.6 million or 7% of cash NOI and ahead of 2021 guidance. Embedded within all capital investments made by DOC is a solid commitment to the materials and practices that enhance the patient experience as well as our G2 sustainability philosophy. This quarter, DOC was nationally recognized as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. This prestigious award is the highest level of EPA recognition as partners must perform at a superior level of energy management, demonstrate best practices across the organization, improve portfolio-wide energy savings. We are proud to celebrate the recognition from the EPA for our ESG efforts to date, but recognize that this is simply a step forward for DOC as we continue to invest in better as leaders across the real estate industry. With that, I will now turn the call back over to John Thomas.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Epoch, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Thank you for the time. I was just hoping, John, you could talk a little bit more about the development funding you referenced in your prepared remarks, types of yields you are expecting if mainly that includes price to purchase the asset upon completion and if you could remind us what kind of pre-leasing you typically look for before committing that kind of capital?
John Thomas: Yes. Happy to, Juan. So we have seen a number of new development financing opportunities this year. As I mentioned, we have started three. One is an on-campus building that is 75% pre-leased to the health system and with lots of potential demand for the lease-up during the construction cycle. And that is a mezzanine loan financing, so we are providing much of the non-construction loan, equity if you will, with the developer funding the balance, and then we have options to acquire it on the back end after CO. Then we have another off-campus building that is 100% pre-leased to an investment-grade credit that is more of that - or not more, obviously, kind of the loan-to-own structure. And in that, we typically get 6% plus yield during construction, and then it converts to ownership. We have a call option, if you will, to convert that to ownership after CO. So the other building mentioned is also more like the mezzanine loan financing with an anchor health system, ASC -- anchor health system joint venture ASC with a national operator, and then some other pre-leasing with physicians. So that one is again closer to 75% pre-leasing and it is a mezzanine loan with an option to acquire at the end. So we have been pretty successful with both types of financings. Some we take a little less risk and the developer has more kind of lease-up risk, if you will, in the 100% leased opportunities. We really like that loan-to-own structure as we featured in our annual shareholder report, the building we have built at the Sacred Heart. So we expect to do more of those types this year and be productive. All of these are buildings that will CO in 2022, so next year, and they will be great additions to the portfolio.
Juan Sanabria: And how big is the pipeline of opportunities where you have the right of acquiring assets that you’ve already committed to? Do you have any sense of that scale?
John Thomas: Yes. We have got it under, I guess, various mezzanine loans. We did a large package at the end of the year. So we are pushing $500 million, $600 million of underlying asset value securing our mezzanine loans. In all of those, we have some form of option to acquire and/or right of first refusal, ROFR rights.
Juan Sanabria: Great. And then just one last question for me, just on cap rates, and I recognize you are sticking to your 5% to 6% guidance range. Just curious, we are obviously hearing about increased competition, but how you are feeling about within that range where you are more likely to come out and where things are trending for the deals you are looking at that are under LOIs or what have you, just to give us a sense of where the deals are trending pricing wise?
John Thomas: Yes. We are in the low fives for Class A assets. As Jeff mentioned, we are really picky on the high quality assets. And again, these are health system anchored and heavily leased buildings that we have been acquiring. They are all off market, so that does help us. The auctions that have been published, cap rates that are coming through the marketed deals seems to be compressing. But we are in the low-five to mid-five on Class A acquisitions and then stretch closer to six on usually smaller assets that are off-campus and/or the development projects that again we are financing this year.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
John Thomas: Thank you, Juan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Hey, guys. So just a point of clarity on the $500 million to $600 million, you mentioned JT. you have mezz supporting presently $500 million to $600 million of assets that you have rights on or acquisition rates or options to purchase? Is that what you were saying?
John Thomas: Yes, that is right. So the underlying value of the buildings that are securing our mezz loans is well in excess of $500 million.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And in terms of the pipeline of additional mezz loans and/or development loans that you are underwriting right now in terms of additional capital you put out the door, how much is that of the $200 million plus that you flagged?
John Thomas: Yes. Most of the $200 million or I must say all of the $200 million there were kind of an LOI or close are acquisitions. We have additional development financings that we are still underwriting and competing for, if you will. So that would be in addition to the $200 million.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And what is the nature of the $200 million? Is it sort of your bread and butter transactions, some anchor deals, affiliated deals typically?
John Thomas: Yes. These are newer. It is a mix of on and off-campus. Some are just finalizing construction. They are all health system anchored and heavily leased to health systems. But there are some physician groups obviously in some of those buildings, and the pipeline itself is just bread and butter buildings.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then I heard the word picky, obviously Jeff mentioned, I just heard you mentioned it again. So what is sort of you are flagging? I’m kind of interested in maybe the lessons learned, if at all from the pandemic, if there is something that kind of has informed your underwriting. I know you guys came out aside pretty well, but is there anything that we have looked at some assets, and this is now filtered in your new underwriting?
Jeffrey Theiler: Hey, Jordan, this is Jeff. I will take a stab at that. So as you said, I mean, we came through the pandemic really well. I think a testament to the underwriting that we did and kind of the continuous monitoring of the credit team of our tenants. So I don’t know that is really changed anything. For the last number of years, we have had a really strong focus on investment-grade tenants, large health system anchored buildings. And so when we say picky, I think that is really what we are talking about. It is picky in terms of the tenants and the specialties and where they are. So nothing different than the last few years that we have been focused on these types of tenants, just kind of a continuation of the strategy, which really served us well during COVID.
Jordan Sadler: Perfect. Maybe just one for Mark before I get off the clarity on the parking fees. Mark, you said, I think 20 basis points of the 2.4% rental revenue - sorry, 2.4% of NOI was related to the parking benefit, but I’m not sure if that was sort of a year-over-year metric because I heard the 80%, the 48%, but I was just trying to clarify what periods we were talking about there?
Mark Theine: Yes, Jordan, happy to clarify. So the same-store impact from lower parking revenue was 20 basis points in the quarter. So our 2.4% would have been a 2.6% same-store NOI growth if parking was at pre-pandemic levels. So we -.
Jordan Sadler: Q1?
Mark Theine: I’m sorry, Q1.
Jordan Sadler: Q1 it would have been 2.6%, right? Yes, okay.
Mark Theine: Yes, yes. Q1.
Jordan Sadler: And then the 80% versus the 48%, what were those two periods?
Mark Theine: Yes. So the first quarter was we have returned to 80% of the pre-pandemic levels compared to 48% and we were at our lowest point last year kind of in that March-April time period. So we have got about $130,000 of parking revenue kind of upside to return to normal levels is what the dollar figure is.
Jordan Sadler: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Mark Theine: Yes.
John Thomas: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. We have talked a lot about the acquisition pipeline, but JT, you mentioned kind of beyond what is under LOI right now in negotiations. Can you try to put a size of that pipeline that is kind of the next step beyond the near-term?
John Thomas: Yes, Nick, it is, like I said, we are very confident in the $400 million to $600 million number, and I think that is probably the best way to say it. I think the next two quarters we will hopefully get more in the third quarter and accelerate a little bit of delay from the first quarter. But again, $200 million is in near-term visibility, another $100 million kind of in active negotiation, if you will, and then we do have good confidence of the balance.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then you talked about the ATM issuance to pre-fund. How do you think about funding the remainder of this expected acquisition growth kind of going forward over the next few quarters?
Jeffrey Theiler: Hey, Nick, this is Jeff. Yes. So certainly, we have been using the ATM opportunistically, we will continue to do that. Like we said, we feel very confident in the overall volume of acquisitions for the year. So we are going to try to use the ATM when it is appropriate. And if we pre-fund some of that, that is fine. We just want to make sure we are in a good capital position to kind of run through our guidance. So it is likely to be the ATM. If there happens to be a big portfolio deal or something like that, we would look at maybe a follow-on offering to complement that as well.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. Good afternoon. Maybe just first one, you alluded to backfilling the largest vacancy in the portfolio. Maybe just give us some more details about that lease and if that were in place, sort of what does that do to total NOI?
John Thomas: Yes, Vikram. Thanks for the question. Really excited about this new lease. As I mentioned, we are seeing a significant increase in our leasing tours and interest in the buildings across the portfolio, and I think this is a perfect example this quarter or what we just signed after the quarter ended here, the 22,000 square foot lease at our MeadowView building. The tenant is the existing anchor in that building. They occupy the first two floors of this building and now are expanding to the third floor and will occupy 100% of the building. Last year they invested over $3 million of their own money into a surgery center on the second floor. So this group is growing quick, the largest multi-specialty group in the area and needed this for their future growth. So from NOI perspective and same-store perspective, it is going to have a nice bump for our future growth, and kind of -- it is got a year of ramping up as they do construction and build out. But once we get to a run rate basis, it should help with that 28 to 25 basis point increase in our same-store.
Vikram Malhotra: Got it. And then you also referenced that post-quarter, again the tour activity picking up quite dramatically and the governor on supply being construction costs, etc. So I’m just wondering, give us a color maybe some of the larger systems or tenants that you are talking to. How are they thinking about sort of expansion space and maybe more granular - the type of space on off-campus? What are these tenants specifically looking for?
John Thomas: Yes. Well, as you know, our portfolio is 96% leased, so we are starting from a great position of strength there and working hard to fill up those vacancies, both on-campus and off-campus. We are definitely seeing growth in the off-campus space as groups are looking to expand just existing services. And when we do lose a tenant, it is primarily due to the fact that they can’t grow within our buildings. So we do have a little bit of repurposing to do there. But again, increase in volume and activity and from our hospital partners especially.
Vikram Malhotra: And then maybe just last one. Any update or anything that is come up on the watch list? I mean, we are still seeing the effects of the pandemic and a lot of different health systems or health operators are still getting funding from the government. So just wondering if there is anything cropped up from a watch list perspective?
Mark Theine: Vikram, not really. Our AR is in better shape than it is ever been. It is just been, again, I think a testament, as Jeff mentioned, our credit team and our asset management team and just the close relationship we have with our tenants. So a lot of the health system - again, our - 62% of our tenant base is investment-grade health systems. Many of those health systems, I think we attract and quantify that - the aggregate of all of the health systems that we do business with had pulled in about $9 billion of the funds through the various structures through the CARES Act funding. But what we look at primarily and focus on is the activity in our buildings, and that has been full steam ahead since last May and everything has been open and operating and busy. And as I said, volumes are at pre-COVID levels. So the activity in our buildings -- before the pandemic and certainly now well supports the rent being paid in those buildings. And so we don’t have any discomfort. And hopefully, at some point, hopefully some of that CARES Act money turns into grants and not a loan and kind of removes some of that strain on the health system generally.
Vikram Malhotra: Fair enough. Thanks so much.
Mark Theine: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Following a bit more on the stronger leasing activity that you are seeing, have you seen an acceleration in rent above your prior expectations or have you been able to pull back on TIs or other leasing concessions as a result of that strength you are seeing?
Mark Theine: Good question, Amanda. This is Mark. The answer is yes to both. As a result of some of the increases in construction pricing, rental rates have been rising around the country. So we have been able to push on rate as it just gets more expensive for providers to move from building to building or construct new. So we have been pushing on rate quite a bit there. And then on TIs, I mean, just because it is harder to move, our leasing team did a good job this quarter of offering less tenant improvement allowances from the landlord. So our CapEx was actually a little bit lower than we originally projected from some TI savings there.
Amanda Sweitzer: That is great to hear. And then higher level on capital allocation, can you talk more about how you are thinking about your cost of equity today just relative to the decline in cap rates that you are seeing for medical office broadly? Has that caused you to change your hurdle price for equity issuances at all?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. Hey, Amanda, it is Jeff. So as we look at our cost of equity today, clearly the stock has done better through this year than kind of a lot of last year. So the cost of equity for us has been pretty steady, I would say. I mean, certainly cap rates have gone down and become a little bit more competitive, luckily the cost of our debt has gone down as well. So that makes an overall cost of capital hurdle easier to achieve with the acquisitions that we are looking at. So as we look at kind of the stock price where it is been lately, I think it is at levels where we can achieve the full volume of our acquisition guidance and still provide accretive returns to the shareholders.
Amanda Sweitzer: That is helpful. Thanks for the time.
John Thomas: Thank you, Amanda.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thanks. So I guess, I noticed in the press release that you guys trademarked a phrase, invest in better. Can you talk a little bit about that phrase and I guess how should we think about that?
John Thomas: Yes, Mike. we done that I think three years ago, maybe. But...
Michael Carroll: Did you?
John Thomas: Yes. I’m glad you recognized it. It was really a combination of the culture of our organization. So it really goes across the board; invest in better people, invest in better health system, invest in better buildings. So it is something that came out of our kind of internal strategy discussions and then as we try to message to investors, to prospective clients and health systems and to people that we recruit. We have had almost no turnover in our organization. The team performed extremely well during the work from home and still mostly working from home, and we take a lot of pride in that. So everything we do, we try to do it with excellence, and as we say, invest in better.
Michael Carroll: No, it makes sense. I guess, JT, can you talk a little bit about the type of patients that are flowing to out-patient settings now, I guess, due to the pandemic that were previously going to in-patient settings? Does that change the type of buildings that they are going to? I mean, is it more surgery centers or on or off-campus? I guess, how is that kind of evolving?
John Thomas: Yes. So Jeff spoke to this earlier as well, what we learned from last year was that just reaffirm the strategy that we have seen and believed in for years, and again, investing in better, looking into the future, which is where healthcare services are best performed and can be clinically performed. And the buildings with surgery centers last year away from hospitals that were the busiest during the kind of - once things settled down last May and people learned how to kind of isolate COVID patients in the hospital, literally all other care that was in trauma was being directed to out-patient settings. And we did that consumer surveys we had commissioned in five of our largest markets, the survey found if you didn’t have COVID, you wanted to go a healthcare services at least a mile away from the hospital. So we didn’t pick the mile, that was just the feedback came from the market, from the communities. And so, again, certain buildings we are investing in, we mentioned the Wesley Chapel building, which is on-campus, but it has a surgery center. Orthopedics, total joints are just moving out of the hospitals rapidly. And hospitals that didn’t have or they were trying to keep orthopedic surgery in the in-patient setting or in the in-patient facilities last year, lost all that volume to out-patient facilities and other providers. And so that is why we see -- we think we see an uptick in new development. We are financing at least one project. And we think some others this year where hospitals are moving are investing in surgery centers away from the hospital campus, again to take care of orthopedics in particular. And then there is going to be a significant move of procedural cardiology again out of the four corners of an in-patient facility and into the out-patient setting. And those buildings will typically be closer to a hospital, but don’t necessarily have to be on the campus. But again, I think those are the things we will continue to see. And oncology just continues to, sadly, but continues to grow in our portfolio and providing linear accelerators or radiation oncology closer to the patients and the consumer, if you will. Again, it is the trend that we have been seeing for years and we are seeing, and that is one of our development projects this year as well.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then is there - I guess what has driven this change? I mean, is it just - obviously, it is consumers’ preference given the pandemic of staying away from hospitals. But what is going to keep that from kind of reverting back? I mean, has there been any changes to regulations or advancements of technology that is going to help drive that shift to out-patient or maybe accelerate that shift to out-patient that we have seen over the past few decades?
John Thomas: Yes. I think what we saw last year was an acceleration, again, just because people didn’t want to go the hospital, people avoided care. Sadly, there was a lot of people that died last year from - not from COVID, but from not getting the care they needed because they were afraid to go to the hospital. But what is going to - I think it is here to stay just from a consumer now are more comfortable with it in the out-patient setting. And then CMS is phasing out the so-called in-patient-only rule, which is Medicare for years have put out a list of procedures that they would only pay for if it was done in an hospital, so in the in-patient setting. They have been shifting more and more or paying for more and more procedures to be done in the out-patient setting. That is what helped drive the move of total joint replacements from the in-patient facility to the out-patient facilities. Over the last couple of years there has been a pretty dramatic shift of procedures and volume. And then two years ago or last year started the shift of cardiology procedures as well. So I think it is about 2023, I believe, is the CMS has declared they won’t have an in-patient rule at all. They will just pay for procedures and let the clinicians pick the best clinical setting which will tend to be more efficient lower cost out-patient care facilities, convenient to patients and the physicians themselves.
Michael Carroll: Great. Thank you.
John Thomas: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Connor Siversky: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for having me on the call. Just really one for me, quick follow-up to Mike right there. So we have seen this chart from time to time comparing out-patient visits, in-patient procedures, and I’m wondering if you could provide any color as to what inning we are in, in that trend? And by that I mean, how much left is there to really take out of the in-patient environment?
John Thomas: There is a lot. I mean, there is a lot of volume. I think last year or maybe 2019 was the first year the number of procedures done in the out-patient setting was greater than the number of admissions, if you will, in the in-patient setting. But that number accelerated in 2020 and it is going to continue that shift, as we just talked about, is going to continue to shift. You are talking basis points on basically a trillion dollars a year of healthcare services. So every year, basis points would be billions of dollars moving out of the hospital and into the out-patient setting. And in cardiology, we are just getting started. So that is a pretty dramatic shift. So you are going to go from 100% two years ago to 5% moving out-patient every year, I’m making that number up. It will be a slow evolution, but then it will ramp up pretty dramatically about how much cardiology will move out of the hospital.
Connor Siversky: That is helpful. I’m wondering then as these higher acuity procedures are moved out of the hospital, do you expect any change in the design philosophy at medical office buildings in order to facilitate some of these procedures?
John Thomas: Yes. I mean, when you have out-patient surgery you’ll have to have separate ingress and egress points for surgical patients. Again, we are thinking differently about lobbies and dedicated elevators, really kind of lessons learned from, if you will, from the pandemic or preventing the next pandemic or anticipating another pandemic in the future. Cardiology buildings are - I mean, the whole idea there is moving cardiology into an out-patient surgical facility. And so the types of rooms that are there are going to be unique for that service. The move of total joints out of the hospital into the out-patient setting, a lot of that is being done with robots. It is really a pretty fascinating procedure to watch. The robots require a little bit more room than a typical OR fit. So again, you are getting a little bit more space. And then, again, oncology, it continues to move to the out-patient setting. You have a whole different psychological effect of how those buildings are designed dealing with the patients and their families there.
Connor Siversky: That is interesting stuff. Thanks for the color. I will leave it there.
John Thomas: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: I will say, I concur that was just interesting question and answer just now. So maybe I’m reading too much into the parking volume, but it seems to me the hospital volume has come back a little bit more like 90% or so and parking volume here is staying 80%. Am I reading too much into this that maybe telehealth has impacted the amount of car volume that is coming in? I’m just trying to really assess whether you are going to come back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of parking receipts? I know it is not a huge portion of your rents, but trying to...
John Thomas: Yes. It is one of our elastic revenue. Dan, the issue is valet parking. It is not the volume of patients, it is valet parking. So with COVID, valets are still restricted in a lot of states. And then just people’s comfort level getting in and out of the car, that is not there and vice versa. So that will come back. And again, I think even in many ways stronger once we get more vaccine out and more herd immunity.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Really, that is all I had. I appreciate it. Thanks.
John Thomas: Thank you. And to conclude on that comment, we do expect it to fully recover.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey JT. Hope all is well. I’m curious on the in-patient rule. Do you typically see an increase in many MOB developments or RFPs once something comes off that in-patient list?
John Thomas: Yes. There is usually a time lag. So like cardiology has been - I think it was two years ago, there were 13 procedures that were moved off the in-patient-only rule, and last year there was another 20. So just it takes some time for the clinicians to kind of organize around a different setting, and then that affects design, as we talked about before. So total joints took - I mean, accelerated pretty quickly. Forgive me for that computer message. Total joints, it took a little bit of time, but it moved rapidly to the out-patient setting in pretty dramatic fashion. And then, I think in obviously last year people are getting - as much as they could. So I think the prediction is on total joints that will be at about 90% will be done in an out-patient setting by 2025. And what would be left would be patients with comorbidities. They just require more intensive services other than the orthopedic procedure. So cardiology, a little slower to that move, but it is going to pick up pretty dramatically this year. I mean, we are already starting to see cardiology dedicated ASCs. And there is a lot of planning going on around that with physician groups we are talking to.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then interesting commentary on the comorbidity, it is what is kind of going to be a left after 2025 for total joints. Is that the kind of way to think about hospitals as they are going to be like the unique patients that require really high level of acuity and then pretty much anything else can be kind of done off-campus?
John Thomas: Yes. I think last year again showed that we could perform that way. So the hospitals of the future are going to be for highly intense medical conditions like COVID, transplant and trauma. And then you’ll have some oncology surgery have some like open heart surgery and then some cancer surgery. But it is really going to be for the high acuity patient and the high acuity medical conditions, infections like COVID, then everything else is going to be out-patient.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, interesting. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on that kind of last line of questioning, and I agree definitely with the model of everything shifting out-patient. How should we be thinking about how that translates into future demand? And I ask that question from the perspective of we haven’t really seen your development pipeline or development pipelines of any of your peers really ramp up. Occupancy is steady, we haven’t seen this huge kind of ramp in occupancy. So I guess, how do we kind of match that kind of what we are seeing at that level versus how it is going to translate to kind of operating metrics in dollars and cents for DOC?
John Thomas: Tayo, it is a big question. I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, again, the CMS actuary predicts medical spending is going to grow 5%, 5.5% I think on average every year between now and 2028. And the 2028 is kind of the - I guess, the beginning of the back end of the baby boom population. So what is going to top out on them, the aging part of the population start catching up in the younger population. But again, the vast majority like we just talked about, that spend is going to continue to shift to the out-patient setting. And I think we talk about the hospital of future whether it be existing physical plans or the physical plans that feature - again, those rooms are going to be designed to be able to convert every room into intense - some kind of intensified care so you could take care of a COVID patient and again have more access to the ventilators and things that you need for that kind of care. So I think that is just - getting to those metrics is right now we just know what the age - I mean, actually accurate on the aging of the population, how much demand they are going to have, how much it is going to cost and then of course governments and payers, insurance companies, employers are trying to shift the cost curve. So it is not just about aggregating populations in dollars, it is also trying to take into account lower cost settings. Again, that will be in the out-patient setting.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks, Tayo.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to John Thomas for any closing comments.
John Thomas: Thanks everybody for joining us today. Again, we are off to a great start and we have got some fantastic things to share with you in the upcoming quarters. And look forward to seeing many of you during the NAREIT Zooms, and hopefully in-person soon, and we just encourage all to get vaccinated. If you can’t find a vaccine, give us a call, we will help you find one. Thank you much.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-25 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Physicians Realty Trust Fourth Quarter 2020 Year End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brad Page.
Bradley Page: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call and webcast. Joining me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, Chief Investment Officer; Mark Theine, Executive Vice President of Asset Management; John Lucey, Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer; Laurie Becker, Senior Vice President, Controller; and Dan Klein, Deputy Chief Investment Officer; and Amy Hall, Senior Vice President, Leasing & Physician Strategy. During this call, John Thomas will provide a summary of the company's activities and performance for the fourth quarter of 2020 and year-to-date as well as our strategic focus for 2021. Jeff Theiler will review our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020. Then Mark Theine will provide a summary of our operations for the fourth quarter of 2020. Following that, we will open the call for questions. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They are based on the current beliefs of management and information currently available to us. Our actual results will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations and those anticipated or implied in such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of potential risks and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company's CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. And thank you for joining us this morning. Before we discuss 2020 and the fourth quarter, we want to commend our team in Texas that has answered the call to keep our buildings open and operating during last week's historic winter weather. We had four buildings with frozen pipes and water damage and we've been working around the clock to get the buildings back in operation. As of this morning, three of those buildings are operational with tenants actively using their leased space. We anticipate the final small building not yet open to be opened within the week. All of our buildings are insured for events like this, any deductible costs will be ultimately recoverable from the tenants.  With all of these challenges, 2020 turned out to be a very successful year for Physicians Realty Trust. From the onset of the pandemic through December 31st, 2020, we collected cash equal to over 90% of all rent and other charges due from our tenants, culminating in the collection of 99.6% of rent due in the fourth quarter. The single deferral granted during the year representing about 0.5% of total billing since April is in payback and is being paid timely by that tenant. We ended the year with the lowest outstanding accounts receivable balance we've ever had as a percentage of revenue, and an occupancy rate of 96%, the highest of all public owners of medical office facilities. Our portfolio's resiliency is directly attributable to our focus on the clinical and financial quality of our healthcare provider tenants with more than 61% of our rentable square feet leads directly to investment-grade quality tenants. We also believe our pure play focused strategy on medical office facilities, with a balance between off-campus and on campus locations was instrumental to our success and critical to the success of our providers. As COVID swamped hospitals across the country, the providers located in our medical office facilities, especially those off the campus of a hospital remained open and available to care for non-COVID patients. While the equity market was volatile, we ended the year with the best total shareholder return of any public REIT with a significant medical office portfolio. With that said our total shareholder returns including dividends were flat for the year and that is always disappointing. We've worked hard since the formation of our company in 2013 to build an enterprise and portfolio resistant to economic weakness, and the events of 2020 stress tested our team and assets. The portfolio performed, frankly as expected, but not without meaningful time and attention from our property management teams and the excellent work of our hospital and physician partners. Nevertheless, we continue to focus on delivering reliable growing cash flow to our investors to drive exceptional shareholder returns. Accretive acquisitions are a key component of this growth and we're excited about the investments made during the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, DOC completed $208 million of investments. These investments include four off-campus properties anchored by investment-grade health systems, expanding our relationship with Hartford Healthcare, and the Ohio State Wexner Medical Centre, and establishing a new relationship with the Lehigh Valley Health Network. As expected, we also executed our option to purchase the brand new Sacred Heart Summit MLB and Ambulatory Surgery Centre in Pensacola, Florida, that was developed with DOC's participation in the form of a $29 million construction loan. For the full year, we completed $275 million of new investments in an average first year yield of 6.5%. In addition, we announced the formation of a new joint venture with the Davis Group, who we have partnered with since 2014. The strategic venture currently includes eight assets and will focus on the acquisition of both new and value-add assets that will source -- that we will source and manage together with Mark Davis, and his team in Minneapolis St. Paul. We're excited to add a strategic option to our investment platform that will provide more opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders. Finally, our investments included the funding of a $54 million portfolio of mezzanine loans with Landmark Healthcare Facilities as part of a recapitalization of their ownership in nine medical office buildings. These facilities are primarily leased to and anchored by leading non-profit healthcare systems in nine markets, totaling 1.1 million square feet and 94% occupied. 73% of the rentable space in these buildings is leased to investment-grade tenants. Our loans include REITs offer, REITs, and other features which we expect to lead to future investment opportunities with Landmark. As we enter a new government, we expect the Biden Harris administration to pursue the expansion of Medicaid coverage in states that have not already done so. We believe the policies of this administration will accelerate the move of care out of the in-patient setting, expand telehealth coverage, and incentivize hospitals and physicians to bend the cost curve while caring for more people. Our investment philosophy has anticipated these trends and we believe our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit as specialty care moves away from the hospital to the more efficient out-patient setting. While, DOC itself received no direct government assistance during the pandemic, our tenants obtained more than $7 billion in various forms of CARES Act support, PPP loans, and CMS advanced payments. We can comfortably say we do not believe our tenants require any further support to pay their rent. This has been true for most of the 2020 as our tenants have been open and caring for patients routinely since May. Our dedicated credit department has monitored our tenants throughout the pandemic and the visibility we have on 92% of our tenant's financial performance continue to provide us with unmatched insight in our portfolio stability and a tremendous competitive advantage. With the distribution of vaccines in early 2021 and the expectation of returning to normal, we will continue to invest in better with a focus on accretive acquisitions, internal growth, and a steadfast commitment to ESG. We're off to a great start of new investments for 2021 with commitments and contracts totaling more than $150 million, plus development financings of $20 million so far. Once completed and stabilized, these development projects will exceed $60 million in investment opportunity. With that start, we anticipate $400 million to $600 million of new investments this year, subject of course, to capital market conditions. Jeff will now review our financial results and Mark Theine will share our operating results, including our ESG accomplishments for 2020. We will then be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $56.7 million. Normalized FFO per share was $0.26 versus $0.27 in the same quarter of last year due to reduced leverage. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $53.0 million, an increase of 14% over the comparable quarter of last year. And our FAD per was $0.25. Our full year FAD was $208.5 million or $0.99 per share, which was an increase of 6.1% over the prior year. We are highly focused on this metric as it is the most standardized and comparable way to measure our company's performance versus our direct peers. And we will continue to focus on growing our FAD per share at an outsized rate for our shareholders. The foundation of the company remains our $5 billion pure play medical office portfolio, which is 61% leads to investment-grade quality tenants, the highest percentage of any public medical office portfolio. Consequently, the DOC portfolio has been one of the best performing portfolios among all REITs, healthcare, and otherwise during the pandemic. We collected 99.6% of our rent in the fourth quarter and over 99% for the full year. We have just $1.3 million remaining to be paid back in the one COVID deferral granted, as the first few payments were already made in January and February of this year. We expect the entire balance to be repaid by June 2021. We intentionally reduced leverage throughout 2020 issuing 19.3 million shares at an average price of $19.06, generating net proceeds of $364 million. As a result, we ended the year with a comfortable leverage of 5.1 times debt to EBITDA, including our pro rata share of JV debt, which puts us in an excellent financial position going into 2021. We have only $166 million gone on our $850 million revolving line of credit, providing us with ample liquidity for investments and we generally expect to target leverage of 5.25 times debt to EBITDA on an enterprise basis in 2021. As mentioned on recent earnings calls, we unintentionally slowed down the acquisition pace during the first half of 2020. However, as we saw our portfolio easily whether the worst of the pandemic, we pivoted back towards growth and completed $208 million of new investments in the fourth quarter. The investments we made were at an average per share cash yield of 6.7% and under had significant underlying IG credits. If all of our investment and disposition activity had taken place at the beginning of the quarter, it would have generated an additional $2.1 million of cash NOI. We are pleased with the scope of the fourth quarter's investment activity ad we have enough visibility on our current pipeline that we can comfortably project 2021 investment activity of $400 million to $600 million at an average cap rate between 5% to 6% subject to suitable capital market conditions. We will continue to focus on the properties that have proven to be successful, high quality assets with market leading investment-grade health system tenants. Our same-store portfolio, which does not exclude our repositioning assets, generated growth of 1.5%. Our quarterly G&A totaled $8.2 million, a sequential decrease of 2% as COVID impacts continue to reduce our overall expense load. We ended the year at $33.8 million, a G&A, which was at the low end of our guidance range. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect G&A costs to increase as we resumed normal levels of travel and acquisition activity, resulting in projected G&A costs between $36 million to $38 million for the year. Recurring CapEx also normalized to a range of $25 million to $27 million in 2021 as we look to add capital back into our portfolio in a thoughtful and efficient manner. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through our portfolio statistics. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks Jeff. Since inception, DOC has been dedicated to building a best-in-class relationship-driven operating platform that utilizes local market expertise and scale to drive tenant retention, cost efficiencies, and profitable growth for shareholders. We have executed consistently on this plan, expanding our in-house property management function into most of our largest markets, while leveraging the local market expertise of facility partners were best. This frontline team helped keep our facilities open, clean, and available for patient care throughout the pandemic. We are encouraged by the positive signs of the recovery due to the vaccine and are grateful for our asset management, property management, and engineering teams who have demonstrated extraordinary resilience in the face of the pandemic, as well as the recent severe weather in the Southern United States. This team has earned a 95.9% positive tenant satisfaction rating in our work order system throughout the pandemic and extreme weather. Our portfolio's resiliency is a direct reflection on the clinical and financial quality of our healthcare provider partners. Our portfolio known for its industry leading 96% occupancy also achieved industry leading rent in CAM cash collection of 99.6% in Q4 2020. Under the leadership of Joey Williams and Ann Gurka, our accounts receivable team worked closely with asset management throughout the year to collect 99.1% of contractual rents and CAM for the period from April through December 2020. Continuing the trend, we have collected 99.3% of January 2021 contractual rents, on-track to meet or exceed the fourth quarter collection rate. February-to-date collection results are also strong and consistent with previous months. We have received no new requests for rent deferral. Again, these results are a direct reflection on the quality of our healthcare partners, the quality of our facilities, and the reason we view medical office buildings as the most resilient asset class in real estate. Our leasing team had a productive year despite the challenges of social distancing and virtual meetings with a positive absorption that totaled 16,200 square feet for the year. Overall, we completed 962,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2020, with a 77% retention rate and positive 2.04% cash leasing spreads on our consolidated portfolio. Currently, the average annual rent increase in our portfolio is 2.4% and over two-thirds of all leases executed in 2020 contains an average rent increase of 2.5% or greater. In the fourth quarter, specifically, we completed 185,000 square feet of leasing activity with positive 3.0% leasing spreads. The retention rate for the quarter was 53%, a number significantly below DOC's typically reported rate, but was in fact the results of a large physician practice we deliberately did not renew and immediately entered into a new 10-year lease the very next day with an existing investment-grade health system partner. Well, this was a non-renewal by definition, the net absorption was not impacted and we upgraded the portfolio by expanding our relationship with an existing investment-grade rated hospital system partner for the long-term. Q4 retention would have been 68% if we exclude this transaction. Finally, our in-house leasing team continues to do an excellent job attracting and renewing tenants at strong rental rates with under market rent concessions. In the fourth quarter, rent concessions for lease renewals including TI and Leasing Commissions totaled of $1.21 per square foot per year and $5.08 per square foot per year for new leases. For the full year, our TI leasing Commissions, and free rent concessions totaled 8.3% of annual net rent and are significantly below our peers who are investing 15% to 20% of annual net rent to attract and retain tenants. Looking ahead to 2021, 4.1% of our leases are scheduled to expire with an average rental rate of $21.61 per square foot. We expect high retention as hospitals and providers are reengaging on lease discussions and expansion plans that were put on hold during the pandemic and we are optimistic about continuing our strong leasing momentum in 2021. Our same-store MLB portfolio, which again does not exclude repositioning assets generated cash NOI growth of 1.5% for the fourth quarter of 2020. The NOI growth was driven primarily by a year-over-year 1.7% increase in base rental revenue. Operating expenses were up 9.1% and offset by a 10.4% increase in operating expense recovery revenue, demonstrating the insulated nature of our triple net leases. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $2.7 million overall, primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in real estate taxes and a $0.7 million increase in general maintenance and janitorial services attributable to COVID-19. Lastly, lower parking revenue had a 23 basis point impact on our Q4 same-store NOI growth. Specifically, paid parking receipts improved to 78% of normal during the fourth quarter, which compares favorably to 49% of normal levels experienced during the second quarter. Turning to our CapEx investments, we pivoted quickly and efficiently in 2020 to priorities projects and team safety. In 2020, we invested $19 million in recurring capital investments, in line with our previously revised CapEx guidance. In 2021, we expect our full year recurring CapEx investments to return to normalized levels between $25 million and $27 million. As part of our capital investments in 2020, we invested approximately $3.2 million in ESG-related projects to improve energy management systems, upgrade HVAC mechanicals, and install more efficient and longer-lasting LED lighting. Overall, these projects make our buildings more efficient and improve our margins on common area costs, while also reducing operating expenses for our healthcare partners, in turn; reducing the total occupancy costs for our provider partners will ultimately provide the potential for growth and rental rates at renewal. As a result of ESG projects like these, DOC has reduced its energy, water, carbon, and waste footprints again in 2020 and we look forward to sharing these results in our second annual ESG report in June. In recognition of our ESG efforts, we are proud to share that DOC earned 10 new IREM Certified Sustainable Property, CSP designations in 2020, reinforcing the ongoing commitment to expanding our environmental, social, and governance practices. The IREM CSP is a sustainability certification program that recognizes exceptional real estate management, which improves Green Building Performance. In total, DOC has earned 18 CSP designation since 2019. To conclude, by adhering to our core values represented by care, we remained disciplined operationally and financially in 2020 to deliver safer healthcare facilities for our providers and their patients, as well as safer results for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, we've made great progress toward our ESG goals and we're especially committed to energy and water conservation and exceeding IREM Certification of our buildings. We are blessed to have great leadership in our organization from the Board down to several of our Executives leading us on the DE&I journey as well. We are not satisfied with our progress there, but we are determined to make a difference inside and outside of our organization for equity across each of our communities. We're also excited to recognize Amy Hall and her promotion to Senior Vice President of Leasing & Physician Strategy. Amy has been with us since 2016, leading our Leasing team and is responsible for more than 4 million square feet of leasing activity since she joined. She has done a fantastic job. We look forward to her leadership for years to come. Finally, 13 properties across our portfolio are being used for vaccination sites in our and we are accommodating our health system partners and others in this important community. We expect more and more vaccine is made available to the community providers in our business. We will now respond to your questions. Omar?
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please state your question.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. Maybe just starting with the Davis Joint Venture, can you talk about what was attractive about doing that the ultimate size of where that JV could go? And then how you think about acquired assets either through JV or on the balance sheet?
John Thomas: Yes, great question Nick and good morning. So Mark Davis and his team have been partners with us for really since 2014. And they've really developed and sourced a number of great opportunities for us every year and we have some new development projects getting started with them now. So that joint venture really evolved out of a kind of a strategy where we find buildings off market, they find buildings off market, some kind of fit our long-term strategy and some may require some value-add or lease up or just not ready for kind of our long-term strategic purpose. So truly a way to kind of have two pockets of ownership, so the REIT when it's directly optimistic or idealistic for us and then with Mark for those where we need to kind of combine to purchase. So it just gives us another tool in the toolbox. And we have two joint ventures in place right now. We have the other PMAK joint venture with Remedy that has been very successful and has really another strategic kind of alignment and purpose. So good source of capital, good partners to work with and provides us really maximizes the opportunities for us going forward for the REIT in particular.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the 2021 growth, how do you think about funding that either through dispositions or additional equity issuance? And then how does that play into leverage levels of where you expect to be at the end of this year?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Nick. This is Jeff. So as we talked about in the prepared remarks, target leverage is about 5.25 times. Obviously, we're a little bit under that right now. So we've got a little bit of dry powder to the extent we need to utilize that. But we would primarily think about funding the acquisitions through debt and equity issuance. We have -- we've been doing some opportunistic dispositions, but we don't have a big disposition pipeline for 2021. So I don't think it's going to be that meaningful in terms of funding, it will be mainly through capital markets activity.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks, good morning, I
John Thomas: Hi, Jordan.
Jordan Sadler: Wanted to touch base -- hi. I wanted to touch base on the acquisition pipeline, a bunch, obviously came through nice acceleration in the fourth quarter. And then some rally leads on 2021. But the guidance of 500 suggests that the 4Q pace could potentially continue, would be talk about what you're seeing and where these opportunities come from. What they look like maybe just some characteristics.
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks, Jordan. So this is John. The pipeline is, we're really excited about that the near term items that we, again, have identified are existing relationships, repeat customers, repeat health systems, more and more health systems are really self-developing, building their own buildings. And so kind of maximizing the opportunity where they're constructing those on their nickel, and then kind of pre-selling them to us for long-term, partnership and hold, so very attractive. And that's been -- most of the investments we made in the fourth quarter and in our near term pipeline, or just that. So, not trading with another institutional owner, but dealing directly with the health system themselves. Got some good opportunities in the development pipeline, as I talked about a minute ago with Mark Davis and others, and that was very successful for us last year as that getting better yields, but getting fantastic product, again, for the long-term hold for the REIT.  So there are some portfolios, small portfolios out there trading, it's kind of trading and re-trading and re-trading. And we -- again, we see everything, we looked at those, but nothing of any bulk has been that attractive to us. So we'll grow primarily through the one-off of market relationships.
Jordan Sadler: And on the development opportunities, is that maybe 20% to 25% of what you're looking at?
John Thomas: That's probably about right. So we -- kind of the gross value of what's going on in under construction or kind of in documentation right now is kind of net 60 to 80 million range. So, again, $100 million of gross value product a year is kind of a simple goal, but we'll do more if we can find it.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then lastly, just on the mezz with the landmark, can you just maybe give us a little bit more color on that maybe LTV and the sort of I think the term is reasonably short, it's a sort of two to four-year type deal. But just sort of any other color there will be helpful?
John Thomas: Yes. So there is -- again, we’ve had a long-term relationship with landmark and then the ownership there and have had opportunities with them as well in the past. This is one of the best portfolios of medical office building that he's explored, selling for the last two or three years, but it's one of the best portfolios, it's been around for the last five years, if you will, probably the best since the big deal. And then, the other day, he wasn't quite ready to sell. But he wanted to recap landmark deal. And again, we use mezz as a tool for long-term ownership. So we can't -- yes, he still has control on when that happens. And but we are -- we'll be first at the door through mezz. So plus or minus 10% to the kind of LTV, but it's a very valuable portfolio and getting more valuable.
Jordan Sadler: So the 54 represents about 10% of the capitalization.
John Thomas: That's about right.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. One for Mark just on the OpEx, if I could. I noticed I heard a little bit of description around taxes and COVID expenses, but the 3.5% increase sequentially. Mark is that 4Q pace going to be sustained through next year? Is that we're going to see some moderation?
Mark Theine : Yes. Good morning, Jordan. Thanks for question. And same-store there. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and you just alluded to, the majority of the increase in operating expenses both year-over-year and sequentially was real estate taxes. There's three or four properties that were reassessed and bumped up in Q4. So we think that's kind of limited to that quarter and won't be reflected going forward. But again, while operating expenses were up, our recoveries were also really showing the insulated nature of our triple net portfolio.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And so it was that sort of an accrual for the full year 2020 sort of catch up on those three to four properties.
Mark Theine : Yes. That's right.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
Mark Theine : Exactly.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Mark Theine : Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: And our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the time. Just hoping to piggyback on Nick's question on the Davis Group Joint Venture. John, maybe if you could speak a little bit too about the differences in strategy between on balance sheet and the fund. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe it's sounded like the joint venture with the Davis Group would be more non-core or rejects [ph] type opportunities, just a little bit more clarity on that?
John Thomas: Yes, I think that's a simple way to think about and again, it's there to park assets that are not quite ready for our ownership, maybe kind of through lease up, or there's no development in there today, but potentially for a development project as well. Or it may be an asset that's, again, just not part of our today long-term focus and strategy. So it's, again, think of it as a place to park assets that, again, the kind of the idea evolved out of a seller who had multiple assets, we wanted one and a couple were great tenant, great credit, but just were smaller, didn't really listed our long-term goal. So we kind of parked too in the Davis one with Mark Davis and we got one outright for ourselves. So, it's really just a strategic tool. We like to be responsive to our health systems.  And, when they want to monetize buildings, they don't want to deal with three or four sellers, or buyers, they want to deal with us. And so, again, we view it as a very strategic tool for place to park assets, and/or participate in the value creation that we see in other portfolios out there that right.
Juan Sanabria: And is there a target size for that joint venture?
John Thomas: I don't -- I don't think it's going to be a huge joint venture, but it's 100 million or so now, and, kind of can see a doubling over the next few years. But I don't -- it's -- again, it's just -- it's just one tool in the in the toolbox.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then maybe just on the same store portfolio. Any expectations on how NOI growth should trend in 2021? That would be helpful; just you give some of the other piece parts, any color that would be helpful?
Mark Theine: Hey, Mark Theine here. So start 20 -- let me go back to, 2019 theme store, we started at 3.1% there, and then 2020. This quarter we're at 1.5%. So, this year is a little bit lower than then where we typically are 2% to 3%. But I think that's a really a good place to look at 2021 would be in that 2% to 3% range. As we continue to focus on, tenant retention and bumping leasing, spreads where we can so 2% to 3% for 2021.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Quickly following up on the Davis JV, do you have any defined purchase auctions for the remaining 51%? As some of those properties stabilized?
John Thomas: Great question. I'm really enjoying all this attention on the Davis. So they're great, they're great partners and we're really proud of that. The answer is yes, we have -- we have purchase rights going forward on in that through that relationship. So again, it's a -- we're a minority partner, they spend their time and effort to create the upside value. And again, we'll have the opportunity to participate in that upside value for ourselves or otherwise.
Amanda Sweitzer: That's helpful. And then on the parking revenue, I appreciated the 4Q update. But how much of a drag was parking revenue on full year 2020 growth? And how are you thinking about that recovery in 2021? In the context of your 2% to 3%, same store growth expectation?
Mark Theine: Yes. Thanks, Amanda, this Mark again. So as I mentioned, the same store impact from parking was 23 basis points in Q4. And we've rebounded to about roughly 80% of our normal levels, there's still a few valet services of buildings that are -- that are closed due to COVID. And you know, as those reopen, hopefully here, in the upcoming months, you know, we'll pick up a little bit of that extra margin from the valet services. But paid parking is doing well. And volumes are up at the building. So what we're missing, yes, there's just kind of that incremental margin from valet services.
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay. And then you have the number of how it impacted full year 2020 growth?
Mark Theine : I don't know if I have a number on the full year basis, but I imagine it'd be pretty close to the same.
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, for me, kind of as you think about the supply outlook over the next several years, are you seeing more office owners that are looking to convert to medical office, just given kind of the uncertain demand outlook for traditional office properties today?
John Thomas: Yes, that's a great question. You know, in 2009, 2010, you saw a lot of suburban office go vacant or not or not, you know, occupied in that in that recession. And that became pretty competitive, or at least provided opportunities for conversion, but it also competed with medical office building. If you think about this environment, it's really the downtown CBD office buildings that, might not get fully re occupied after work from home and a move to, the suburbs, from those, those kind of office environments. So, I think, I think it's a very different dynamic, you won't see CBD office buildings, converting the medical or -- you know, really competing with medical office buildings. So, in the suburbs, again, if there was -- if there was vacancy, those are always opportunities to convert those buildings to medical, but you realize the office demand is moving to the -- to the suburbs. So long winded way of saying, I think there might be some opportunities, but when you think about the CBDs that are, vacant or low occupancy those are not typical medical office buildings in this environment.
Amanda Sweitzer: Great. Thanks for the time.
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: And our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning, everyone. Back to the cash same-store NOI for fourth quarter. I mean, with the increase in real estate taxes, don't you get just passed that along? So I guess I'm still struggling with, why just wasn't passed along such that the same store number was better? Or is it just a timing issue and will be passed along in the next few quarters?
John Thomas: So, you're exactly right, the real estate taxes are passed along as part of a triple net expense. So the primary drivers of our same-store growth are the annual rent bumps, 96% least highest in the industry, and we've got, you know, strong rent bumps. So that' pretty much going to be the driver of our same store going forward.
Mark Theine : Tayo, we're going to see a significant increase in property taxes in the states and localities try to recover revenue, and you're going to be more litigious than ever, but that's one of the really strong components of our portfolio is the high occupancy so that which those packs of taxes do pass through. We work hard challenging those making sure the right amount and appropriate amounts to the best we can like hell but, ultimately pass through in our high occupancy portfolio, really -- it's really a premium job to us.
Omotayo Okusanya: But is there a timing difference where you kind of get sick first, and then maybe the past week leading on to the same store artificially depress this quarter? Like, I'm just trying to understand that a little bit?
John Thomas: Yes, it's part it's part timing and part again, the little bit of vacancy we have is that, you know, we have to absorb that, but it's mostly timing.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. Then just wanted to focus on the regulatory situation a little bit. Again, the idea of Biden administration, we have been focused on the expansion of ACA. And this idea of, again, being able to kind of get healthcare close to where you live, and, and things like that, and driving more flow to outpatient facilities. How does that influence your assets that you're targeting, from an acquisition perspective going forward? Do you start to get more interested in all the off campus stuff again, that may still be kind of close to big population centers? And just kind of curious how that influences how you think about your acquisition outlook?
John Thomas: Yes, Tayo know, we've always thought off campus, it was the more important assets long term while on campus, continue to be very important to the overall health care system. But the cost, consumers want to be closer to home. Physicians and other providers want to be closer to their homes and in off campus locations, and as -- COVID is shown why the inpatient facilities need to be preserved for high acuity patients, and, everything else needs to be -- off -- in and out outpatient setting. And if there's no real reason for that building to be next to a hospital, then why isn't it closer to my home, closer to my schools, closer to my workplace. And so that -- again, with 2020, just proved up the thesis that we've had since the beginning of the company. And again, the spread of the ACA, the support of the ACA, the spread of perhaps buying options in those states that haven't expanded the ACA, and funded by this administration in this Congress, again, will further drive more care out about inpatient setting to the outpatient setting. So I don't think it changes our strategy at all, I think it just reinforces what we've been doing since for the last seven and a half years. And then that proved out last year, and it'll be certainly supported by this administration in this Congress.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. And then one more for me, if you don't mind, your comment about your operators sentiments not needing additional government aid is appreciated. Just curious with the current aid, that they have the feed those -- but PPE has to get paid back by certainty, they get the medical advances and to kind of get paid back by a certain date. Is there still a need, though, for those dates to get pushed back to give the operators a little bit more runway to recover? Or if we suddenly do -- six months from now or whatever the timing is, you feel fairly confident that your operators don't face a cash crunch?
John Thomas: Yes. All the systems are actually sitting there with a booked counter liability, if you will. So we see that as part of the kind of overall P&L of the providers in our buildings. So did Congress in a bipartisan way has been pushing back those payment obligations in really the CMS advanced payments already lowered the interest rates, already stretched out the term. So it's not going to be a six month call. And using your example, really surprised about when that's required to be paid back. In fact, there's some bipartisan support to just turn those Medicare advance payments into grants. And so, again, we see it as, just like any other liability on their P&L, and really evaluating the entire P&L, the entire balance sheet is part of both our credit underwriting for new investments, but also our credit monitoring, that Jeff and Q and his team do. And we're up to 92% transparency across our portfolios as we get a real good insight into bed. So there's not going to be any short term impact on paying those bags, and there's going to be plenty of government -- the government can provide plenty of time and particularly how long it takes to get the vaccines out and things like that.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is for Jason [Indiscernible] with RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, looking at the landmark mezz deal, I know you noted the underlying assets are strong, but I was wondering if you could touch on the amount that are on or off campus and then provide any color on what the potential cap rate would be on a purchase down the road?
John Thomas: Yes. All but one are on-campus, they're all fairly new kind of 10 years or younger, but they're all there, they're fantastic assets. Cap rate on the -- there no purchase -- direct purchase options, the seller still has the ownership timing and flexibility of when and if he's ready to sell those buildings. These would be in -- I'd like to say they're going to be real cheap, but they're -- this would be the best portfolio, our best buildings out in the market if anything we're seeing today. So it would be the low-end of the cap rate range the high-end of value.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then I know you noted that there's some smaller portfolios that you've looked at on the market today, I was wondering if you could touch on just what you aren't seeing in those portfolios that you'd be looking at that would make you pull the trigger?
John Thomas: We really focus our business development in our pipeline around working directly with physicians and hospitals, and the developers working with physicians and hospitals that truly a direct purchase with the tenants, the health systems are involved, the physicians that are involved. There is nothing wrong with buying from kind of from other institutional owners, but again, it's partly bad and it's partly -- you don't really get a health system relationship by buying a building owned by the third person who's owned the building, you have a health system relationship, because you have a health system relationship, and that's -- it's really a preference in our targeting. Specific kind of stats would be, the typical things, you look at Walt increases are the rents market, are they in markets that are growing? How big are the buildings, the size of the portfolio, and things like that? What are the strategic alignment with our current portfolio? So the portfolios that have traded have all been fine, fine buildings, fine owners and fine providers, but none have really met our criteria. And yet, as a package, and then, ultimately you're paying a premium. And how did that premium impact your IRR long-term from that. A lot of it's about just the relationships involved.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then, last one for me. I know in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned the CapEx increase in 2021. I guess I'm wondering what type of CapEx projects were put on hold? And how much of that 2021 increase is from projects that were delayed in 2020? And then I guess, going a little further, would we expected them to come down in 2022? As those ketchup projects are completed? Or how should we be thinking about that?
Mark Theine: Yes, Jason, Mark here. So looking back a year ago, we initially put out CapEx guidance of $24 million to $26 million and then adjusted it early in 2020 during the onset to COVID-19. And $19 million was the midpoint of our revised guidance. So we came in right in line with our guidance there. And we did that really to prioritize the projects and safety of the team. And there were a few supply delays in projects like elevators that we delayed into 2021. So a little bit of that is a catch up from 2020. But our CapEx investment has been 8% of NOI kind of on average, well below our peers. And our 2021 guidance also includes some additional TI capital as leasing activity picks up. So a little bit rolling over into 2021, but 2022 probably going to be in line with that with that's $6 million a quarter so.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks, everyone.
John Thomas: Thank you, Tayo.
Operator: And our next and final question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. Most questions has been answered, just maybe as two quick follow-ons to some of the comments on growth. As you think about the pipeline from here, I'm just wondering, given sort of how off campus has held up, are you thinking about any new market sort of to enter, and then potentially kind of some maybe to exit, just anything new on the horizon?
John Thomas: Yes. We don't have any exit plans they're coming. Thanks for the question. We're really focused on growth. We've really kind of mature proven the portfolio the last couple of years. And so it's -- we're really excited about what we've got. And you see it with the performance of 99.6% cash collections in the fourth quarter. So the -- we're always going to have a bias, if all other things being equal between the off-campus and on-campus, as you know, and -- but we've got some great on-campus assets in the pipeline. So again, it's how the situation matches up what's the purpose of the building and what needs to be on-campus, and if it's better served to be off the campus, then that'll be our preference. We're seeing pretty good opportunities like said, but it's kind of back to our old school one building at a time, two buildings at a time and growing the portfolio creatively like that.
Vikram Malhotra: Great. And then just how the off-campuses sort of held up, maybe even better than expectations. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on pricing, how things have changed maybe over the last year and sort of spread on campus? I know, obviously, there are a lot of variances, but just your overall thoughts will be helpful?
John Thomas: Well, Vikram I can't help myself, but to say, we fully expect the off-campus to perform like they did last year. But no, I think you're seeing more and more people attracted to off-campus, because they see, how much better they perform last year, then many on-campus buildings. We're seeing that enthusiasm from other public buyers, and there's a small portfolio out there floating around, it's a very nice collection of mostly off-campus buildings, and great health systems involved in those buildings. And kind of rumor mill is 100 different buyers showed up to kind of underwrite their portfolio. So and pricing is ranging from five to six with all the portfolios that have been out there and trading and again, a lot of off-campus buildings in those portfolios. So I think it's going to continue to compress, but we're still the favorite son of the health systems we believe.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And just your -- as your -- is your impression that kind of cap rate for the on-campus like you just described off-campus just you described versus on? Has that narrowed even further from maybe what it was pre pandemic?
John Thomas: Yes, I think it's only it's probably narrow, but they're still going to be -- if there's an on-campus building, there's probably 150 buyers that show up. So there's still a large part of the capital pool that doesn't understand and appreciate the off-campus like they should, but that provides good buying opportunity for us.
Vikram Malhotra: Great. Thanks so much.
John Thomas: Yes, thank you, Vikram.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached at the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to CEO, John Thomas for closing remarks.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Thank you for joining us this morning. Physicians Realty Trust had another strong quarter with tenants open operating and providing high quality healthcare services. Substantially all providers that lease space from us have stabilized and are paying their contractual rent and obligations as we have collected over 98.4% of our third quarter rent and are now near 99% to the second quarter. We continue to view medical offices the most resilient class of real estate in the market and our portfolio of medical office buildings delivered outstanding results in this quarter. This includes the Physician joint venture tenant that we mentioned last quarter. After struggling to operate and pay rent at the height of the pandemic in April and May they are now back in their offices and have remained current on rent since September. We're pleased to share that we've agreed to a formal payment plan with this tenant for all back rent and charges due obtaining multi-year extensions on a substantial portion of their leases in the process. Our continued emphasis on portfolio quality has distinguished us in this time of uncertainty as we believe our actual cash rent collections lead the industry. The resilience of our tenants and assets has led to more recognition. We are excited that Fitch Ratings assigned a corporate credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook to Physicians Realty Trust. In their commentary Fitch noted that Physicians offers durable cash flows relative to the broader REIT universe and that the corona virus pandemic has not resulted in any meaningful erosion in DOC’s credit profile. We look forward to working with Fitch and the other agencies as we continue to grow prudently strengthening what we believe is our already best-in-class balance sheet.  During the quarter we completed the acquisition of an off-campus cancer center fully leased to Ascension St. Vincent Evansville ministry at a 5.8% first year yield. This asset pairs strong tenant credit with high acuity care all while still being accretive to shareholders perfectly representing our commitment to investment quality. We continue to be selective on new investments, building our pipeline for the year ahead with assets that meet our disciplined acquisition criteria. Our near-term pipeline includes the newly completed off-campus outpatient care facility leased to Ascension's Sacred Heart ministry anchored by their new ASC in Pensacola, Florida. This DOC-funded development is already welcoming patients having opened ahead of schedule despite being constructed during the pandemic and enduring a direct hit from hurricane Sally. We have an option to purchase this facility from our development partner at a first-year yield of 6.25%, which we expect to execute by the end of 2020 pending our normal closing conditions. We're starting to see more opportunities to acquire or finance medical office developments pre-lease to credit worthy tenants as a result of our long-standing health system relationships. We've recently initiated two new financings for developments to commence in 2021 and anticipate more to come. On the home front, we've been cautious with our team with many of our colleagues living in states experiencing an increase in COVID cases. We’re still working primarily from home and as evidenced by our results our team has answered the call and is performing very well doing whatever it takes to manage work, family and in many cases virtual learning for their families. Jeff will now discuss our financial results followed by Mark Theine with the report from operations. Jeff? 
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the third quarter of 2020, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $54.9 million, which was an increase of roughly 7% over the comparable quarter last year. Normalized FFO per share was $0.26 versus $0.27 in the same quarter of last year primarily due to reduced leverage. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $51.9 million an increase of about 9% over the comparable quarter of last year and our FAD per share was $0.24. Our tenants continue to show impressive resiliency to the ongoing pandemic. Our cash rent collection in the third quarter was 98.4% of billed rents consistent with past quarters. We also reached a short-term deferred rent agreement with a health system joint venture that accounted for half of the uncollected total; another 0.8% of billed rents. Of the final 0.8% of rent not collected or deferred about two-thirds of that is currently on a cash basis. Therefore we are not expecting to increase reserves on uncollected rent at all in the future assuming we don't see a wholesale shift in the impact of the pandemic. We believe our insight into our tenant operations is second to none due in large part to our dedicated credit team, which consistently monitors our tenants’ financials. This insight along with the high credit quality of our tenant base has enabled our team to produce sector-leading rent collections. Our investment pipeline is swelled in the back half of the year with well over $100 million of investments executable in the next three to four months assuming a stable cost of capital. In the third quarter we completed $24.5 million of investments at an average cap rate of 5.7%. While we are poised to grow aggressively we will continue to monitor the pandemic and economy like everyone else and adjust our strategy if necessary. Since the beginning of the year, we have raised $340 million on the ATM at an average price of $19.10. We enter the fourth quarter of the year in an excellent capital position with consolidated debt to EBITDA of 4.8 times. Additionally as of 9:30 we had only $95 million drawn on our $850 million line of credit. While we are arguably under levered compared to most of the healthcare REITs sector this is not a bad capital position to be in right now given the volatility we've seen in the equity markets. We also have no material debt coming due over the next three years and minimal CapEx obligations. We are keeping our usual levels of cash on the balance sheet based on the strong payment history of our tenants and see no need to preemptively conserve capital at this point. As John noted, we were pleased to announce that Fitch ratings recognize our conservative capital structure and high credit tenant base with an initial rating of BBB flat that was announced in August. This had the immediate impact of lowering our revolving debt cost by 20 basis points and our term loan cost by 25 basis points resulting in the interest expense savings of $1.2 million on an annual basis assuming a constant revolver balance of $95 million. Our cost of capital continues to improve on a relative basis versus our peers, which will allow us to start capturing more and more of the consolidation action happening in the medical office building sector. Our same-store portfolio generated growth of 0.8%, which Mark will discuss in more detail momentarily. Our G&A was consistent sequentially at $8.3 million as COVID impacts are still slightly reducing our overall expense load. We are currently projecting to end up the year at or slightly below the midpoint of the 2020 G&A guidance of $33.5 million to $35.5 million. Finally, recurring capital expenditures were $5.3 million, which has started to trend up a bit from the beginning of the year as we go back into a more normalized CapEx schedule. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through our portfolio statistics. Mark? 
Mark Theine: Thanks Jeff. Our teams on the ground in our portfolio are healthy and continued to perform well in the third quarter. We remain focused on providing best in class service to our healthcare partners as they work tirelessly to offer compassionate care to COVID-19 patients as well as care for routine patients under enhanced safety guidelines. 100% of our facilities remain open and we have seen nearly all of our clinical lease space resume to pre-COVID office schedules and patient volumes. Tenant engagement in the buildings has also rebounded to near pre-COVID levels. Although the spread of COVID-19 continues to flare up in certain markets across the country our healthcare partners are much better prepared to operate in this new environment with larger inventory of PPE and enhanced social distancing and cleaning procedures. Despite the impact of COVID-19, DOC's operating results in the third quarter were steady. Strong tenant retention, renewal leasing spreads and above average leasing activity were positive signs of the strength and resilience of our tenants and the stability of our portfolio. During the quarter we completed a total of 335,000 square feet of leasing activity, the second highest quarterly volume in the history of the company including nearly 200 and 25000 square feet of early lease renewals. Tenant retention was 85% and renewal leasing spreads were positive 2.2%. Included in these early lease renewals is the multi-specialty practice John described earlier where we were able to successfully negotiate five-year lease extensions on 67,000 square feet in exchange for additional time to pay back four months of pass-through rent and late fees. These leases now extend into 2030 and were renewed early with a positive 3% leasing spread and no tenant improvement allowance or contraction and strong rental rates. In addition to the multi-specialty group, we also opportunistically executed a limited number of lease extensions providing tenants free rent in lieu of TI in exchange for long-term commitments to their suites averaging eight years and two months. While these leases totaled only about 86,000 square feet it's these types of mutually beneficial transactions that create exceptional long-term shareholder value. These leases generate an excellent net effective rent above underwriting, but the free rent does come with a short-term trade-off to same-store NOI growth of approximately $320,000 in Q3. As a result our MLB same store portfolio cash NOI growth was 0.8% due to this one-time concession, lower parking revenue from social distancing limitations within our garages and slightly lower occupancy from one 20,000 square foot suite that was discussed last quarter. Notably our operating expenses for the same store portfolio were flat during the quarter overall, but we did notice a $0.5 million drop in utility expense for the quarter as several of our recent LED lighting and MEP upgrades provided additional lease efficiencies. These savings should be routine. We did have a year-over-year increase of 0.4 million in janitorial expense and maintenance payroll due to COVID-19, which we anticipate the decline over time. Turning to our CapEx investments for the quarter, we once again proactively managed our recurring CapEx investment to 5.3 million or 7% of cash NOI. Year-to-date DOC has invested 13.2 million in recurring CapEx projects and expects to fall within the $17 million to $19 million full year CapEx guidance adjusted earlier in the year. Finally, our asset management team's keen focus on operational excellence and outstanding customer service shine this quarter in the results of our 2020 Kingsley Associates Tenant Satisfaction survey. This year we surveyed nearly 500 tenants representing 4.8 million square feet. Physicians Realty Trust receives a strong 69% response rate despite the ongoing COVID pandemic. Typical response rates for these surveys are between 45% and 55% so a 69% response rate demonstrates the exceptional relationship between our asset management team and our healthcare partners. We also earned a company score in overall management satisfaction a 4.44 out of 5.0 with scores on COVID-19 communication and cleaning protocols exceeding the peer group. I'd like to end by recognizing the outstanding efforts of those on our operations team who have executed consistently during the challenges of the past several months. Thanks to a team effort focused on long-term value creation and growth we had another solid quarter that validates both the quality of our portfolio and our earnings. With that I'll turn the call back over to John. 
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark and Jeff. As we look forward, it appears we may have a new administration, but perhaps a split in congress. History suggests this will not result in any major changes in existing healthcare policy and payment systems, but the new administration can do many things administratively that can expand coverage under the affordable care act and impact the scope of care provided in hospitals and in outpatient facilities. The ACA Bipartisan Legislation and commercial insurers all agree care should be provided where clinically appropriate in the lowest cost setting. Indeed recent CMS proposed regulations suggest eliminating the inpatient only payment system within Medicare entirely thus further incentivizing the transition of care to outpatient facilities like we own. We also anticipate inpatient hospitals be encouraged to transform their facilities and services to prepare for the next pandemic leading to more pressure on hospital capital. These pressures should cause hospitals to consider MLB monetization and more demand for third-party capital for medical office and outpatient facilities. We are prepared to capture these opportunities. We're now happy to address your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Griffin: Hi there. This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. You mentioned the Ascension acquisition earlier, and I'm just curious are you able to give us a sense of what you think the acquisition pipeline is looking like going forward?
Jeff Theiler: Yes Michael, good morning. This is Jeff, we've got about a 100 million either in PSAs or signed LOIs and we've got a good pipeline in addition to that really building for 2021. So I'm not really prepared to predict the size of that pipeline yet. We'll have acquisition guidance on our next call for 2021, but right now we're really excited about what we're pursuing.
Michael Griffin: Thanks. And then, just on the same store NOI obviously you mentioned the impact from this quarter just wondering when you expect it to return to that sort of 2% to 3% historical run rate?
Mark Theine: Hi morning Michael. This is Mark. So the same story this quarter was impacted by some of the COVID related items that we mentioned including parking and the one vacancy that we have in Tennessee and we've got some good leasing activity to help that rebound here as we enter fourth quarter and pursuing the 2021. Our parking revenue specifically, we're seeing rebounding off the lows in the second quarter and the one garage where it's not quite getting this all the way back is really a result of valet services that are just resuming now. So the cars and the patients are there, but there's some incremental margin on valet services that should help us rebound in our same store next quarter.
Michael Griffin: That's it for me. Thanks for the time. 
Mark Theine: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please proceed with your.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. Can you guys talk a little bit more about the leasing dynamics during the quarter? Net absorption did fall a bit. What is your outlook for releasing that vacant space and then have you still seen some of your existing tenants.
Mark Theine: Sure. Mark again. So leasing activity was the second highest quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. A lot of that was early renewals so as you mentioned net absorption did fall a little bit mentioning that same one suite that we're working on leasing up. And then we did have a second largest suite in Atlanta that we vacated because the hospital wanted to take that suite. So that's under construction and we anticipate that being released up quickly. I mean overall, we're just seeing good leasing activity especially as services are being reserved on campus and inpatient and they are moving off campus into our outpatient buildings where we don't have as many public patients there. So it seems good leasing activity there.
Amanda Sweitzer: And then have you still seen your existing tenants look to expand? 
Mark Theine: Yes absolutely. That's consistent what we're seeing with the results of COVID people looking to expand, take additional space of course as for 96% least, but we're working hard to fill up the remaining spaces.
Amanda Sweitzer: That's helpful and then just last question for me last quarter you kind of described your balance sheet management as conservative. Any change in how you would characterize it just given fundamentals of remaining stable.
Jeff Theiler: Hi Amanda. This is Jeff. No. Look I think we're still going to be conservative on the balance sheet. Obviously there are a lot of questions with COVID how it's going to progress through the winter and into next year. So I think it still makes sense to be conservative at this point. We continue. We evaluate it every month and we'll change our strategy when that's appropriate.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Lewis: Thank you. Can you talk about the interest rate on the St. Louis Park as investment in Minnesota? I don't think I saw that. 
John Thomas: It's 8% with options related to the completion of the development.
Michael Lewis: Got it. And then, I just wanted to ask about your comfort with signing a five-year extension to a tenant who's on a deferral plan. It looks really low risk to you since they're current on September and October and there's no TI package so not much to lose for you in the deal, but maybe tell us a little more about the situation and the risk especially in a potential second wave of COVID-19 why they had difficulties the first time and how you're comfortable with that?
John Thomas: Yes. It's a great result for us and it's just it's a very large tenant that occupies a substantial part of space in five different buildings. So the biggest impact on all of our practices that had to either shut down or reduce care, reduce time of services during April and May in particular March and April with the lack of PPE some personal protective equipment, mask, gowns things like that. So that supply chain has really come back strong. There are new manufacturers being that have been established and are opening up in the United States to shorten the supply chain if you will. So we don't think that'll have an impact on, it shouldn't have an impact like it did in April, May. We're wealthy well the system will be able to keep providing care particularly the outpatient off-campus locations because that's where the non-COVID patients needed to go and wanted to go and will continue to go for their care in instead of deferring that. So again it's an outstanding result with that attendance a large multi-specialty physician group now historically very strong. As we've talked about they're part of a their joint venture with the health system and they we anticipate that will continue to get stronger. So we don't see it as a risk of extending those leases in fact is a very positive result with the increase and no TI and no lease commissions, which typically is requiring an individual particular of that size.
Michael Lewis: Perfect and then lastly from me I guess this question is kind of a combination of questions that have already been asked you talked about the pipeline size. You talked about your thoughts on leverage on the balance sheet. As you think about external growth opportunities what's the attractiveness level there thought kind of tying it to your cost of capital versus the yields that are available in the market the competition to buy those assets. How do you kind of think about how you could drive external growth and I think ties in the other questions because it ties into how much leverage you're willing to take, how you use the ATM kind of a big picture question?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. That's a great question. This is Jeff. So when we look at whenever we're looking at new acquisitions we're trying to do two things we're trying to increase the quality of the portfolio and we're trying to drive accretive growth for the shareholders at the same time. So as we look at where our stock price has been trading I guess today and most of the year really there's a, it's definitely possible to accomplish both of those objectives with the pipeline that we see right now and with the pricing that we're seeing right now. So I think we're in a good spot from a cost of capital standpoint to drive external growth and complete our pipeline. To add to that that we're very conservatively levered right now. So we do have the option and the opportunity to execute on certain investments if our stock price temporarily drops because we've got a little bit of dry powder stored up on the balance sheet, but even on a just a go forward basis I think we're in a great spot to continue to grow through into next year for sure. 
Michael Lewis: Sounds good. Thanks a lot. 
John Thomas: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. 
Connor Siversky: Hi everybody. Thanks for having me. So you had mentioned some MEP improvements that drove down utilities costs during the quarter. I'm wondering if this is part of a broader project and then if so what kind of outlays could be associated with it and then is there any expectation for what kind of utilities cost improvements we could see going forward. 
Mark Theine: Yes. Great question Connor. This is Mark. So far this year we've tackled just under a million dollars of LED lighting upgrade and MEP upgrades to just help the overall efficiency on our utility expense and also repairs expense associated with the building. Those projects are typically amortized and passed back through to the buildings, but yet the tenants are still recognizing savings by the overall drop in utility expense. So we've got more of those projects planned in 2021 and again with our triple net lease structure nearly all of our leases are triple net. So the expenses are passing back through to the tenants of the building in this case the savings are passing back through to the tenants of the buildings, but we'll try and recapture some of that on the releasing spreads as well. 
Connor Siversky: And then, one more kind of high level question. I'm thinking back to the survey that you guys published I think it was back in June. I'm just wondering in regard to outpatient versus the inpatient environment. What kind of feedback you guys have gotten on that survey? If you see those trends have continued through Q3 and just any sort of commentary you could offer there? 
John Thomas: Yes. This is JT, in the survey showed what we've always anticipated certainly didn't anticipate a pandemic further enhancing the drive for consumerism for patients wanting to go to more convenient locations and for physicians wanting to be in more convenient locations to their home and schools as well. So we think the evidence is very clear that people don't if they don't have COVID or don't think they have COVID, they don't want to go anywhere near a hospital and it realized itself or evidenced in May and June when their outpatient surgical facilities away from the hospital campuses had had expanded hours to take care of all the patients they couldn't take care of in April because of the lack of masks and gowns. So that has continued obviously that kind of the backlog has been restored and you come back to more normal hours, but if you look at the kind of our balances and things like that it's mostly beyond campus, small on campus tenants that have been slower to kind of get back to full-time schedules and as Mark mentioned the parking revenue again the evidence is that as well. So the traffic flow there is getting back to normal, but it's still not back where it was whereas in our off-campus locations they're full and open and operating. 
Connor Siversky: That's all for me. Thanks very much. 
John Thomas: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason [Indiscernible] with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks. I was wondering if you guys could touch on the pricing of the Ascension acquisition. I know that you had previously been targeting like the 7% to 8% range and this came in below that. So just wondering what you liked about that outside that allowed you to get comfortable with the pricing?
John Thomas: Yes. Jason, I'm not sure that the data point in the 7% to 8%. We quoted 5.8% yields on that first year yield on the Ascension acquisition and our seven day was kind of early in the last coming seven days you may be referring to maybe a long-term IRR calculation that 5.8% is the first year yields not our long-term IRR debt. Long term IRR will be in that 7% to 8% range or more on that asset.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And who are the sellers that are bringing product to the market today? It seems like pricing still remains pretty sticky, but are they mostly still one-off properties or larger sellers starting to come to the market?
John Thomas: Yes. Most of what we're really pursuing right now is one-off off-market opportunities one to two Z kind of acquisitions. So it's a combination of physicians providers that own the buildings that looking to monetize. We've had a couple of deals where the health systems were also involved or all are also involved in the ownership of the asset and then developers and other aggregators if you will kind of out trying to capture pricing in this market, but we think the market is pretty stable. There are lots of good opportunities out there. No real large portfolios that we've seen, but again, where we do the best and is in the direct negotiation with providers and the developers working with those providers to acquire the assets both those examples we talked about today are tied to the Ascension health system the largest, second largest health system in the country. One in Indiana and one in Pensacola and we've continued to work with them wherever we can. 
Unidentified Analyst: Got it and then last one for me what are you hearing in terms of or from tenants in terms of the surgical pipeline? Has that been impacted at all from kind of the increase in cases or where is that trending? 
John Thomas: Yes. I think there's a huge pipeline excuse me a huge uptick obviously in May and June and July to make that for March and April. I think case slows back to kind of normal volumes now so like pre-COVID monthly volumes, but picking up. We're not seeing people deferring care and I think communities even with COVID spiking many locations around the country to worse levels than they were in April and May. We're not seeing any impact on their outpatient care facilities and particularly those away from the hospital campuses. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. 
John Thomas: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time there are no further questions. I'd like to floor back to management for closing comments. 
John Thomas: Yes. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We know it's tough times and we appreciate the audience and the questions and we look forward to seeing you and your clients and other investors during [Indiscenrible]. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Thank you for joining us this morning. Like all of us, Physicians Realty Trust entered the second quarter of 2020 facing a global pandemic that threaten the physical and financial well-being of our families and clients. The pandemic has tested and unfortunately continues to test all of us in many ways. We are proud to report that the DOC team and our health system clients have endured the pandemic remarkably well and continue to serve our shareholders, teammates and the communities we all serve with resilience and perseverance. As a health care real estate organization, the most important financial metric of performance during this time is rent collection. And as of August 3, we have collected 98% of cash billings for rent and operating expenses billed for the second quarter. We've also collected 97% of July cash billings and August is off to a better start than any of the last four months. We continue to work with our tenants who represent the unpaid remaining accounts receivable and expect over time to collect a higher percentage of those remaining amounts. We are pleased to report the largest single tenant, representing 50% of the outstanding second quarter accounts receivable balance is back in our offices providing health care services and has started paying rent again as of August 1. They are committed to getting caught up and we will work with them to get these accounts receivable resolved as soon as possible while they serve their patients. We ended the second quarter with perhaps the strongest balance sheet we have ever had. Jeff Tyler, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review our operating profit and loss and balance sheet statistics in a few minutes. We are proud to report the highest quarterly earnings generally that we've ever had. We also ended the second quarter consistent with our perpetual high occupancy and leasing. Mark Theine, our Executive Vice President for Asset Management will share more details about our operating performance in a few minutes. Mark and his team have done an outstanding job of keeping our buildings open and occupied and more importantly, clean and inviting to providers and our patients seeking health care services. All of our buildings are open and actively serving patients, even if many of our markets have seen spikes in new COVID-19 cases. While we didn't make any significant investments in the second quarter, we continue to build our pipeline and seek new opportunities for investment later this year and in 2021. The investment market is active and consistent with the reliability and strength of medical office real estate, pricing for new investments appears to be consistent with pre-pandemic pricing. In May, we commissioned a consumer survey in five of our largest markets, seeking information from consumers about their preferences when seeking health care services. Over 76% of those surveyed indicated they would rather see a physician in a medical office facility, a mile or more away from a hospital. In fact, 22% of those surveys said they would delay seeking emergency care in a hospital setting out of concern that they would be exposed to COVID-19. These findings are consistent with our long-held interpretation of the data that consumers want convenient access to outpatient care services away from hospitals and when to go to the hospital campus when absolutely necessary. Our rent collections during quarter two are also consistent with these findings, as the providers located in our off-campus medical office facilities, anchored by a health system for the most current and consistent with the rent payments during quarter two. We are very proud of our entire portfolio. But last month, DOC was honored by the international Building Owners and Managers Association or BOMA, which awarded the Baylor Scott & White Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center, the outstanding building of the year for medical office facilities worldwide. This attribute to property management and operational excellence and we honor Michelle Morris, Susan Leinweaver, Mark Dukes and Mark Theine for their leadership in earning this award, but more importantly, what they do everyday for our providers and their patients who need access to our buildings to deliver world-class health care. Physician Realty Trust also completed another milestone in quarter two with the release of our first annual, Environmental, social and governance or ESG report, published on our website. Our Board of Trustees and team are committed to an ongoing process to be transparent regarding our ESG successes as well as areas where we can continue to improve. We want to be held accountable by our shareholders and the partners we serve. As part of our culture, we have also formalized and enhanced our ambitious goals and efforts toward achieving success, in diversity equity and inclusion. We are determined to be leaders not only in Corporate America, but in our society as well. Sadly recent events have once again shown us where we are deficient, as the society. And caused all of us to evaluate, what we have or haven't done and how we can do better in our organization, in our country and everywhere. DOC has always been committed to diversity and inclusiveness, but we haven't done enough. Our culture is committed to leadership and success in achieving our goals and more. Success will make DOC and the communities we serve better for our shareholders, team, our providers and their patients. Jeff will now discuss our financial results. Mark will then share our operating results. And then we'll be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2020, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $56.6 million which was an increase of 42%, over the comparable quarter last year. Normalized FFO per share was $0.27 versus $0.21, in the same quarter of last year. And our normalized funds available for distribution were $0.25 per share or $53.1 million, an increase of 26%, over the comparable quarter of last year. We are pleased to have continued our strong operational performance, despite the ongoing COVID pandemic. And strive to be as transparent as possible during this time, by publishing monthly updates, since the pandemic began to accelerate in March. Our resilient cash flow is due to both our high-quality investment grade tenant base as well as the collaboration between our dedicated credit department and asset management teams, which has enabled us to analyze the financial necessity of each individual rent relief request. And then identify the right action to take on a case-by-case basis. This has led to consistently high rent collections, as John noted in his prepared remarks. On the investment side, we had a fairly light quarter, as we try to determine where pricing will settle out, as investors weigh reduced economic activity, against historically low interest rates. We invested $23.7 million, primarily consisting of construction funding for our existing pipeline as well as a $13 million mezzanine loan, for the development of a building in Columbus Ohio. In order to keep the company's foundation strong, we improved our balance sheet, by raising $99.1 million in the second quarter on the ATM at an average price of $18.07 per share. This brought our second quarter consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to 4.6 times, which puts us in a comfortable position to navigate this period of uncertainty. At the end of the quarter, we had $70 million drawn on our revolving credit facility, which translates to additional capacity under the line, of $780 million. As a reminder we have no material term debt, coming due until 2023 and minimal lease expirations and CapEx obligations, over the next several years. So we believe we are in an excellent position, in terms of liquidity. Finally, we have just under $5 million of cash on the balance sheet as of today, which is a normal amount for us to keep on hand, to fund near-term operations. We don't currently feel we need to stockpile cash-based on our current portfolio performance. But we'll of course keep a careful eye on this, as the pandemic continues to evolve and adjust if necessary. To wrap-up on operations for the second quarter, we generated MOB same-store NOI growth of 1.4%. Our G&A came in slightly under budget, at $8.2 million, as COVID impacts have generally lessened our expense level. At this point in the year, we are trending to the bottom end of our stated full year 2020, G&A guidance range of $33.5 million to $35.5 million. Recurring capital expenditures came in at $4.8 million, which were also lower -- which were lower than budgeted at the beginning of the year. And we remain on track to meet our 2020 recurring CapEx target of $17 million to $19 million that we presented on last quarter's earnings call. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through our portfolio statistics, in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. Our mission to provide better health care through real estate has never been more important. Today, 100% of our facilities are open for care and the majority have returned to near pre-COVID patient volumes. While COVID-19 has continued to change our world, health care workers have heroically continued to offer compassionate care and keep pace with those changes. Similarly our asset and property management teams have quickly adopted the change and collaborated with our health care partners to implement policies and procedures for social distancing, use of PPE, visitor screening, and enhanced cleaning protocol. From an operational perspective, the second quarter can be summarized by strong collection, retention, and execution. DOC's outperformance in terms of rent collection and occupancy compared to our peers further demonstrates the high quality nature of our health care partners and the intrinsic value of our real estate investments. Notably, the off-campus affiliated segment of our portfolio has had the strongest performance in terms of both total percentage collected and pace of collections. This data demonstrates the strength and resilience of these properties ultimately reaffirming DOC’s investment philosophy that the delivery of health care is shifting away from the big box hospitals reserved for the sickest patients to safe and clean facilities in convenient outpatient locations. Moving to strong retention. We completed a total of 179,000 square feet of leasing activity during the second quarter. Highlighted by a 76% tenant retention rate, 2.8% renewal leasing spreads, and positive portfolio net absorption of 15,000 square feet. As part of these lease renewals, we have opportunistically executed a limited number of extensions, providing tenants with free rent in lieu of PI in exchange for long-term commitments to their suite. While these leases only total about 25,000 square feet, it is these types of mutually beneficial transactions that create exceptional long-term shareholder value. We expect MOB retention in general to remain strong for the remainder of the year as providers focus on safely increasing patient volumes, while maintaining safe social distancing. Tourist for new leasing have also returned, primarily with existing tenants looking to expand in hospital systems who continue to plan for outpatient growth. We are actively working with our health care partners on their outpatient strategies, adding 42,000 square feet of net absorption through the first half of 2020 across our 96% leased portfolio. Expirations remain limited for the next five years with less than 9% of the portfolio expiring in any year through 2025. This combination of high occupancy and low turnover results in stable, predictable cash flow and lower tenant improvements and leasing commissions, all leading to more funds available for distribution. This quarter, we proactively managed our recurring CapEx investment to 6.1% of cash NOI or $4.8 million and expect to fall within the $17 million to $19 million full year CapEx guidance previously announced. Our second quarter performance demonstrates not only our unique portfolio, but our ability to remain focused even while prioritizing the health and safety of our team members and those we serve. Finishing with strong execution, I am extremely proud of our team's commitment to operational excellence, which was recognized by BOMA International, who selected the Baylor Scott & White Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center as the outstanding building of the year. To be very clear, this award is not an architectural design award, but rather the organization's highest worldwide honor to recognize excellence in property management operations, policies, community involvement and ESG efforts as judged by an independent panel of real estate experts. These same-property management practices and expectations are evident across all-stock managed properties and highlight another reason why hospital executives routinely select DOC as their long-term real estate partners. As we celebrate the seventh anniversary of DOC this summer, we self-manage six of our top 10 largest markets and continue to grow our award winning property management platform. In terms of portfolio execution for the quarter, our MOB same-store portfolio generated cash NOI growth of 1.4%. A decrease in parking revenue in April and May had a 50 basis point impact on our same-store NOI growth, which would have been about 2% without the lower paid parking volume. Same-store occupancy continues to reflect a 21,000 square foot suite available for lease that was discussed last quarter. The remainder of the portfolio continues to grow according to the annual rent escalations as expected, which averaged 2.4% across the portfolio. To conclude, 2020 has clearly been a trying period for many types of real estate due to both the economic slowdown and physical distancing requirements of the pandemic. Fortunately, for Physicians Realty Trust, we have long-term leases, minimal lease expirations over the next few years and strong liquidity to invest opportunistically. Today, we reaffirm our sincere gratitude and appreciation for all health care workers fighting this deadly disease and to our hospital system partners as we work together to provide a safe environment for health care delivery during this challenging time. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John. 
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff and Mark. As noted briefly already despite the spike of new cases in many of our markets most notably Phoenix, Texas and Atlanta all of our facilities are open and operating including our outpatient surgical facilities. With increased access to personal protective equipment like mask and gowns renewed restrictions on elective or scheduled surgery and procedures have been limited almost entirely to inpatient facilities providing inpatient care for COVID-19 patients.  With stockpiling of PPE by all providers now we continue to hear from our providers that they can serve non-COVID outpatients in our medical facilities while the hospitals focused necessarily on COVID and other emergent care.  We're now happy to address your questions. Jessie? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
DanielBernstein: Good morning. So when I look at the June collections presentation versus the May it's pretty clear that the non-investment grade collections have kind of caught up with the investment grade. So I don't know if there's something specific that happened between the last presentation and now, but what caused that catch up? Was it federal funding? Was it the opening of elective surgeries or pickup in elective surgeries? Just trying to understand kind of that pickup in the collections on the non-investment-grade side which really made a difference in and maybe you're reporting in the numbers versus I think estimates? 
JohnThomas: Yes, Dan. I don't think anything real specific. The vast majority of our space is investment-grade or on the campus of an investment-grade hospital. So I think some of the smaller tenants took a little time to get their PPP loans in place their Medicare Advance Funding in place. But again right now for April we're almost completely -- I mean we have almost no AR for April at this point. And for the whole quarter over 98%. So I think all of our facilities are open and operating and back to working and paying the rent consistently. 
DanielBernstein: Okay. And then I guess the other question is there has been some stress at the hospitals. Are you seeing any additional opportunities in terms of monetizations that might be popping up out there? Or maybe on the development side as well as hospitals probably could use some REIT funding? 
JohnThomas: Yes. I think that's something we'll see in time. Would there have been some hospitals out there marketing at least the idea of monetizing some buildings. I don't think there's been a lot of trades from that perspective. But what we are seeing is some new development opportunities that are starting to gestate and kind of in the market testing the funding levels at this point. So we'll see more of that we think in 2021, but we do have that expectation. 
DanielBernstein: Okay. That’s really all I have. Congrats on the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Q –MichaelGriffin: This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. JT you mentioned in your prepared remarks building up the deal pipeline. Any sense of the size for the back half of the year and into 2021? And then do you see yourself preferring more of the acquisition route or continuing on the mezz loan funding side or kind of a combination? 
JohnThomas: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think it will be a combination. Activity is picking up obviously an improved cost of capital certainly helps in that perspective and the consistency or I guess maybe the lack of volatility that we've seen over the last few weeks and would hope to continue to see from the results we just reported. But we've got both acquisitions development and some mezzanine financing kind of opportunities in the pipeline. And as we just talked about looking for some health system monetization opportunities in 2021. 
Q –MichaelGriffin: Thanks. And just on your current tenant makeup you got about 35% single tenant roughly 55%, 60% multi-tenant. Do you like this mix? Would you prefer more or less exposure to one? 
JohnThomas: Yes. I think the mix has served us well. Some of the single-tenant facilities we're the ones that had the busiest schedules in May and June. But again back to a normal environment. I think it's a good mix for us. And it also kind of staggers out our kind of lease roll as well. So we don't have a fixed percentage in mind. I think we look at all opportunities that we pursue with our existing and future health care system clients. And a lot of the single-tenant buildings in our portfolio are 100% leased to a health system investment-grade tenants. So we feel really good about those. 
Q –MichaelGriffin: Okay. That’s it for me. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Mahotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
VikramMahotra: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just one first a somewhat longer-term question. You obviously saw a big merger in the telehealth space a few days ago. Obviously reported utilization of telehealth has gone up pretty dramatically over the last few months. Just wondering any updated thoughts on either anecdotes from your tenants or just yourself on kind of how telehealth may impact MOBs positively or negatively? 
JohnThomas: Vikram, thanks for the question. It's obviously a very timely explosion in a positive way of telehealth. Most of our clients are telling us it's additional revenue. They're finally getting paid for it. Creates a lot of efficiency particularly for our surgeons and our oncology physicians who can do a quick check of their postsurgical first procedure check in with their patients without those patients having to come into the office. Many of those surgeons are extremely busy in May and June and we're still taking some family time off in July but doing telehealth from their vacation home. So, it's -- I think it's a win-win really across the board. Our portfolio -- while we do have some primary care and some internal medicine and we have almost no behavioral health psychiatry. So, some of those services that have been very kind of prominent in the telehealth world. Most of our facilities are procedural based and investments continue to follow kind of a procedural based environment where physical presence of the patient and the doctor together is required for most of the care. So, we see it as a win long-term opportunity and we also see some opportunity for modifying existing space to facilitate more telehealth in the office. 
VikramMalhotra: Okay, great. And then just maybe a more minute question on -- as you kind of look to do -- as you're doing more renewals maybe even new leases. Anything changed sort of in what tenants or potential tenants are asking in terms of the lease structure bumps? Anything maybe you're looking for in terms of more information or tweaking the lease structure itself? I know you didn't have -- obviously, you had very strong rent collection. But just wondering kind of through COVID is there anything you're thinking about changing or are people looking for any change in the structure of the lease?
MarkTheine: Hey Vikram, this is Mark Theine. So, we've had great leasing activity through the first half of the year. As you know our portfolio just in general doesn't have a lot of lease expirations. But as we approach those renewals we have not seen much change in terms of term. Obviously, we continue to try and push rate 2% to 3%. We've maybe seen a little bit of increase in requests for some free rents at the beginning. But if we do that it's in lieu of TI and a lot of times we're still getting the same term. So, we'll continue to push forward on the 69 leases we get left to renew this year which is about 1.4% of the portfolio.
JeffTheiler: Hey Vikram sorry. I wanted to add one thing. This is Jeff. The other thing that we've really been pushing for obviously we've had great success with our credit analysis of the tenants. So, certainly as we look to new leasing and renewal leasing we're always making sure that we have as much visibility as possible on those tenant financials. So, we can continue to monitor them and make appropriate decisions based on how they're performing quarter-to-quarter. 
VikramMalhotra: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
MichaelCarroll: Yes, thanks. I'm not sure if you asked I got jumped on late. So, I'm sorry if you already addressed this in your prepared remarks but I know your rent collections have been pretty strong around 98% in the second quarter. Can you provide some color on the 2% of tenants that didn't pay rents? And did the company -- how are you treating that within your books? I mean have you increased bad debt? I mean is there concerns around those specific operators?
JohnThomas: Hey Mike thanks for the question. Yes, we did address that in the beginning, but I'm happy to do it again because very positive news. So, about 2% of accounts receivable we have left over for the first quarter. The biggest part of that over half of it is one tenant and they have finally gotten back into their office and are busy again and has started paying rent again. So, we've already picked up some of that second quarter AR from them and we expect to fully collect that and get that resolved with them pretty quickly. So, that's the vast majority of that number. And the balance we still believe is collectable. So, we have not really adjusted our historical bad debt numbers at this point.
MichaelCarroll: Okay, great. And then -- and JT -- and then JT can you talk a little bit about your investment strategy that you are looking for going forward? I know that the balance sheet is much stronger. I know you're talking about a little bit about the pipeline building. I mean do you expect that some of that activity could ramp up here in the near-term or do you think you'll remain a little bit more cautious for the remainder of the year just due to the uncertainty with COVID?
JohnThomas: Yes, we've been conservative Mike. I mean we have really a pretty good pipeline still in place. Pricing and trades that are happening in the market are not -- have not really changed from pre-COVID pricing. Even though cost of capital is still higher than it was in February and March. So it's -- we're being very cautious. We're working more on some 2021 development opportunities right now. We will have some -- I do expect we'll have some acquisitions this quarter and in the fourth quarter. But there still will be a modest amount as we kind of let the market settle down. I mean the fantastic results of our portfolio and really all medical office portfolios that we've seen in the public markets driving a lot of -- even more capital into our space. So, the competition is pretty tough but we continue to work -- more focused on the direct off-market opportunities as the best we can.
MichaelCarroll: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: This is Keegan on for Connor. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. So first off, we saw some pretty positive material through your ESG report, but we're kind of wondering how this is going to affect your CapEx flow in the near future related to your in-place portfolio. Do you see opportunities to increase energy efficiency in some of your existing assets? And if that's the case what kind of timeline are you seeing?
MarkTheine: Yeah. So this is Mark again. Thanks for the question. So first thanks for recognizing the ESG report and all the good work that team has been doing there. We're really proud of the report that we put out this quarter. So as part of that report we committed $3.5 million to CapEx investments. That number is within our $17 million to $19 million CapEx guidance for the year. So if you look at our numbers for the year at the midway point we've invested about $7.8 million. So in the back half of the year we're looking at about $6 million per quarter to be within that range and we expect to hit that. So CapEx team has done an exceptional job at really evaluating and prioritizing our CapEx projects. And as it relates to LED upgrades as you mentioned we did three of those already in the last year with several more in the portfolio. I think one of the interesting things about our portfolio and our leases is that, some of those costs are actually eligible to be passed through and amortized into our leases and our operating expenses. So, we'll continue to invest in our buildings making them better from an ESG perspective, as well as patient environment. So we're on pace and doing a great job. So thanks again for recognizing the ESG report.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: All right. Thanks for the color there. And then to switch gears a little bit here. Obviously, you guys improved your leverage metrics pretty significantly. But in terms of net debt to EBITDA are you comfortable where you're sitting at the moment? And if the acquisition market were to kind of loosen up again, what leverage range could we see through the end of this year and into 2021?
JeffTheiler: Hi, there. This is Jeff. So look obviously we're in uncharted territory here with this pandemic. So we've been taking a very careful and conservative approach as JT talked about on the acquisition front and also on the capital side. So we're really looking at the environment month by month, we'll make adjustments as we see changes in the environment. But I think for right now, you can expect a pretty conservative capital structure and acquisition pace going forward. 
UnidentifiedAnalyst: All right. That's it for me. Thanks for your time guys.
MarkTheine: Yep. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
JordanSadler: Good morning, everybody. Wanted to follow-up on that – on both the capital structure Jeff, but then also on investments. So on the capital structure, it seems at these leverage levels and with this equity. I would argue that you're already in a pretty conservative capital structure position. But are you saying we could see it get more conservative so potentially lower leverage here?
JeffTheiler: Jordan, look at this point in time it wouldn't – we don't think that would be the right thing. But like I said we want to monitor this month-to-month. So it's hard to make long-term projections right now. And so what we're doing is we're trying to be as conservative as we think reasonable for the environment, which right now I think we're at that point. If things deteriorate, I mean, certainly we could be more conservative on the capital front. If things get much better, we could get a little bit more aggressive on the acquisition front. So it's hard to make a long-term plan right now. So we're just trying to stay as safe as possible and as conservative as possible.
JordanSadler: Okay. Makes sense. And then just in terms of investment. I'm kind of just curious on the perspective on whether or not there's an asset management opportunity available. I know that, in terms of pricing is pretty similar to where it was pre COVID but it suggest that there's still really an appetite in the market for these assets that you guys own. Is there an opportunity to sort of prune or monetize stuff you that are not your favorite children? And on the other side of things, where do you see if anywhere opportunity in the market is there any dislocation?
JohnThomas: Hey, Jordan, I think great question. The – I think the acquisitions we're working on again are kind of single buildings not portfolios not widely marketed opportunities but really direct negotiations with health systems or physicians that are tied to health systems and they own their buildings and looking to monetize for various reasons. And then also development opportunities, I think hospitals have learned a lot over the last few months about kind of their infrastructure and their space needs and their kind of parking ratios, and parking the ability to keep patients segregated and things like that. So a lot of that learning is going into some new development plans on existing buildings we have, as well as some new buildings that to be built. And most of those at least things, we're looking at right now are kind of off-campus, health system, affiliated buildings. And as people want to spread out and kind of allocate their outpatient services to the most efficient locations. So that's the – some of the learning and that's driving some of our kind of investment thesis in the near term. But monetizing or selling things, we are – we have very little left in the portfolio that we were just kind of actively like to sell. It'd be a small dollar amount, if we did. We would look at opportunities on a case-by-case basis. The one name that's been performing remarkably well in this quarter has been the LTACHs. And we've long said, we'd like to sell those if we can get to the right pricing on those. In the meantime, there they're paying the rent. They're high yielding. They're driving some good revenue and good profit for us. 
JordanSadler: So just as one last follow-up on the LTACHs since you raised it, I know there was a catch-up on the background Jeff sequentially. So I think that was booked into revenue this quarter. Can you just sequentially tell us what we should expect? 
JeffTheiler: Yes sure Jordan. So you're right. There was a – obviously the LTACHs they're cash basis. They repaid some back rent. They repaid some of the legal fees from the bankruptcy and real estate taxes from the bankruptcy. So there's about an additional $1.4 million of call it nonrecurring revenue this quarter from the LTACH. 
JordanSadler: And what about on the expense side nonrecurring expenses? 
JeffTheiler: Nothing significant, nothing material. 
JordanSadler: Okay. Thank you guys.
JeffTheiler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Kim with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
JohnKim: Thank you, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of any of free rent to your cash same store numbers. It wasn't really broken out this quarter. And if you think, it's going to have a more significant impact going forward? I think Mark mentioned that you're offering more free rent? 
JohnThomas: Yes John. I mean virtually none. I mean there's been a very small amount of kind of trading that as part of lease renewal negotiations and pretty typical either TI or free rent nothing -- no I mean modest immaterial adjustments at all. 
JohnKim: Can you comment on the acquisition environment as far as if you're seeing a lot more product being marketed today? As health systems potentially look to sell asset as the source of capital? 
JohnThomas: Yes. There's only one health system that's been out, what I'd say actively marketing a portfolio of medical office buildings. And to my knowledge it hasn't traded or price. The acquisitions market that we've seen again most of the actively marketed portfolios are trading at kind of pre-COVID pricing and have not been attractive to us at those prices. But again, we've done best and we've grown the company best when we're buying one building at a time, two buildings at a time, in a north market way and that's what we're really focused on right now. So the market has picked up. There've been trades. We have some things active in our pipeline that we're working to get to the finish line before the end of the year and hopefully before -- even some before the end of the quarter. But it's active. The amount of capital coming into the MLB space just continues to come in low interest rates etcetera, it's driving a lot of activity.
JohnKim: And as far as what is your updated views on cap rates on off-campus affiliated versus on campus? And how that's trending?
JohnThomas: Well since we use only one it like the off-campus affiliated buildings, those should be 7s and 8s but the reality is that we're in the 5.5 to low 6 range -- kind of in -- most of the things we're looking at in our portfolio and we really don't break that out between on and off. The off-campus affiliated buildings have been the best-performing from a rent collection. They're the busiest from an activity standpoint. They were slow in April, but primarily because of the rationing of PPE, but now the PPE suppliers have come back. Those were the first open. And frankly that's where care is being provided in those states that are starting to restrict inpatient or surgery and inpatient facilities. If you follow CMS proposals for next fiscal year, they're increasing a number of cases, Medicare is that can be done in an outpatient the number of surgeries that can done in an outpatient setting and incentivizing that with higher reimbursement. So we continue to be very excited about that, particularly the off-campus affiliated buildings but all of our buildings are doing well. 
JohnKim: Last one for me is, in June I don't think you had any rent deferral. I'm wondering if you had any in July or any change in deferral requests from your tenant? 
JohnThomas: No. We've not done deferrals. We've had one major tenant that we were patient with through the quarter has started paying the rent again. They follow -- they tend to get caught up with their -- the accounts receivable that has built up for them in the second quarter. But they're back in obviously in their space and very busy and expect to work that out with them over time. But it's again less than -- a little over 1% of kind of our accounts receivable balance for the quarter and a handful of other small tenants that again we're working with to get called out. We don't have any increase in bad debt and no form of deferrals. We're reporting cash collections. That's cash -- cash bills and cash collected. 
JohnKim: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Gorman with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
MichaelGorman: Thanks. Good morning, guys. John, I just wanted to go back for a minute and kind of get a better sense for what's going on the ground with some of the practices. You mentioned last quarter they kind of backfill the pipeline so that the surgical numbers could continue. We continue to see the national news about cancer diagnoses being down, different diseases the diagnosis rates are down. I'm just trying to triangulate the comments that maybe some of the physician flows are back to pre-COVID numbers with just other things that we're hearing out there. So I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on that and maybe what some of your practices are seeing in terms of like surgical pipeline numbers. 
JohnThomas: Yes. Great question, Mike. So on the surgical pipeline what we heard originally in May and June I think some of the comments you were referencing is that they were extremely busy catching up from March and April. But just weren't sure about how their schedules look in July and August. Right now they're all reporting very strong schedules in July and August as well coming out of July and that the August schedule is full as well. On the oncology side, those were our busiest buildings throughout. They were never really restricted. We had to work with those tenants and kind of facilitate a clean passage way I guess from the car to the treatment facilities, but those have continued to be busy. Obviously, the diagnostic care both in oncology and cardiology. We see in these national numbers has been a major -- will be a major problem over time for patients themselves, but we don't see any slowdown in the number of volume in our facilities. The 100% -- I mean our oncology facilities those tenants were always consistent with the rent and always busy from that perspective if you want to think about it on that side. But I think the public health issues that you referenced. Many of our hospitals are trying to encourage patients to -- they can come into the facility. They can come in with -- don't delay heart care, don't delay cancer care, don't delay routine diagnostics and starting to see a pickup there. So I'm sorry to ramble a little bit. But I think the long-term impacts, we won't know about until next year, but the flow of patients. We were open on Saturdays. There's an inefficiency on the surgical side because they have to get tested in the parking lot before the surgical patients led into the building. But again we're helping to facilitate that. That really works well in the off-campus buildings where we have more space in the parking lot for that kind of activity. So Saturday surgery is pretty common across the board. 
MichaelGorman: Okay. Thanks. That’s very helpful. Appreciate it.
JohnThomas: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional closing comments. 
John Thomas: Again we know it's a very busy day in earnings world, but we really appreciate your time and attention today. I just hope all of you will stay safe. We're all wearing mask and checking our temperature coming into our buildings both as the best practice for our office, but also for working with our health system clients and tenants to help bend this curve back down. So be safe and thanks for your time. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 12:00:00) =====

John Thomas : Thank you, Brad. Thank you for joining us this morning. Physicians Realty Trust entered 2020 with a healthy portfolio and a strong balance sheet and a pipeline poised for growth. We welcome you to our first quarter 2020 earnings call, which we are happy to discuss today. Although, we know you may be more interested in current events. I'm pleased to report the entire DOC team is healthy and working efficiently, effectively and in most cases remotely from home with a small team rotating through our DOC headquarters to keep DOC’s central operations working and performing very well. We are pleased to report that our portfolio of medical office facilities has remained resilient during this difficult time. 248 of our 260 medical facilities have remained open to serve patients without interruption and 93% of our tenants’ suites are currently operational.  These providers are bravely answering the call to treat patients and provide essential healthcare services. We honor their bravery and sacrifice. After my comments, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Theiler will provide a financial report for quarter one with balance sheet updates through April 30; and Mark Theine, our EVP, Asset Management will provide a quarter one operating report, as well as the general update on our operations since April 1. I will then address April and May rent collections before taking your questions.  Prior to the onset of COVID-19, we were gearing up for a strong 2020 of operational excellence and external growth. In anticipation of this growth, we right-sized our balance sheet by raising $239 million of equity in the first quarter very efficiently through our ATM. If the COVID-19 situation intensified in March, we did not and have not since contractually committed any new capital to acquisitions. We completed the conversion of one loan to ownership in Fort Worth, Texas, with a modest additional investment and we continued to fund our development projects. One of our two development projects leased to U.S. Oncology a subsidiary of investment grade rated McKesson completed a certificate of occupancy and rent has commenced. We remained very well capitalized, finished the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times. While we slowdown our external growth in March and April, we expect to be able to proceed with our previously targeted investments once the capital market stabilize and economic conditions add clarity.  DOC's relationship based investment strategy and history of repeat business continues to benefit our long-term business plan. As the medical office owner, we were working with have all agreed to postpone transactions for the time being. As of today, we haven't lost any of the investment opportunities that we were expecting to complete in the second and third quarter or otherwise. Due to this quarantines and consequential economic and capital market uncertainty, we pulled our 2020 acquisition guidance on March 19, while we cannot commit to the timing, volume or investment price of our anticipated transactions, we do expect the opportunity to proceed with acquisition activity at the appropriate time and our pipeline remains robust. Many aspects of the future remain unclear. As you know, the U.S. federal government has pumped trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy with hundreds of billions of those dollars directed to healthcare providers. While the overall financial impacts of COVID-19 are still uncertain for our health system partners. It appears likely that the federal government subsidies in whatever form will not be enough to offset the direct and indirect cost of the pandemic.  One of the most important factors to the recovery of the healthcare system will be how quickly the employment rate improves to offset any potential spike in the Medicaid population. Nevertheless, we believe that the lessons learned from the crisis will improve the efficiency, capacity and appropriate utilization of healthcare services in the U.S. Early in this shutdown, our outpatient facilities including surgical facilities, we're seeing an increase in volumes as inpatient hospital shifted care to the outpatient settings, many off campus in order to prepare for the expected need for their inpatient facilities.  Unfortunately, however, as state and local governments realized there wasn't the testing capability and adequate PPE to provide for necessary, but perhaps non-urgent healthcare services, began to place restrictions on non-urgent care, specifically surgery that can be scheduled and temporarily delayed. While the U.S. has been growing its outpatient capacity for years, we are realizing now more than ever, that our most precious high acuity facilities may best be preserved for complex medical needs like COVID-19. This would naturally lead to the vast majority of healthcare, specifically surgical and routine necessary procedural care being directed to less intensive, modern and convenient medical office buildings, preserving hospital capacity for the most complex medical services and highlighting the opportunity for DOC in the years ahead.  While we don't know the total impact of COVID-19 on these numbers, the CMS office of the Actuary published April 3, its most recent estimates of national healthcare spending in the United States. According to the Actuary’s report, U.S. national healthcare spend is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4% from 2019 to 2028. CMS and the report estimated the national healthcare spending reached $3.81 trillion in 2019. It would increase to just over $4 trillion in 2020. CMS projected that by 2028 healthcare spending would reach $6.19 trillion and would account for 19.7% of GDP, up from 17.7% in 2018. Short-term shocks don't change these long-term tailwinds driven by the growth in the aging population and people generally living longer. There are lessons to be learned by the events of the last three months, most of which we believe will be beneficial to our real estate investment thesis and strategy.  Jeff will now review our financial results for quarter one and then Mark will share the results of his team. Jeff? 
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2020, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $52.7 million, which was an increase of 11% over the comparable quarter last year. Normalized FFO per share was $0.26 versus $0.25 in the same quarter of last year and our normalized funds available for distribution were $0.25 per share or $50.5 million, an increase of 20% over the comparable quarter of last year. As our cost of capital has changed alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken concrete steps to reduce our investment activity. Consequently, in our March COVID-19 update, we went through our previously issued acquisition guidance and as postponed the majority of our deals until we have more visibility on the capital markets. We did, however, complete several investments that were already in process. In the quarter, we invested a total of $19 million with the vast majority of that going towards a 45,000 square foot building in Westerville, Ohio, anchored by the investment grade rated Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center. Once the short-term rent abatement ends following the completion of TI work in June, the investment will produce an initial cash yield of 6.1%. We also converted a $47 million loan investment into the ownership of Texas Oncology's 98,000 square foot Fort Worth Cancer Center and MOB, which is expected to yield 5.5% once stabilized. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we funded the final $4.6 million committed under our Denton, Texas, construction loan and provided another $13 million mezzanine loan for a healthcare building in Columbus, Ohio. In sum, our total year-to-date investments have been $36.6 million. We do not have any other transactions in the closing process at this time, and our only remaining investment obligation is the final $14 million needed to complete our Sacred Heart ASC development. On the capital side, we raised $239 million on the ATM in the first quarter prior to the market downturn at a weighted average share price of $19.57 per share. We utilized the majority of these proceeds to pay down our line of credit, which reduced our consolidated debt to 29% of gross assets and gave us an annualized consolidated debt to EBITDAre ratio of 5.1 times.  As of the date of this earnings call, we have approximately $228 million drawn on our $850 million revolving credit facility, leaving $622 million available to draw and another $30 million cash on hand. Our debt maturity schedule is advantageous with no material term debt maturing until 2023. At the current time, we aren't overly worried about liquidity, but we'll closely monitor our operations month to month and adjust our short-term capital buffers as appropriate.  At this point, I'd like to highlight the additional disclosure we put out this quarter on COVID-19 related statistics. We understand that investors and analysts are interested in how our portfolio is bearing in this uncertain environment. So we have tried to provide you as much information as possible. In this COVID-19 supplement, you can find breakouts by specialties, as well as utilization statistics and projected reopening dates. JT will also provide more details on our April and May collections a bit later in the call. To wrap up on operations for the first quarter, we generated same-store NOI growth of 1.6%. Our G&A came in slightly under budget at $9 million, primarily due to lower travel, legal and other miscellaneous expenses. The current capital expenditures were also lower than budget at $3 million, as we went through our portfolio and prioritized our spending appropriately. And finally based on the rest of the year certainty for uncertainty, we’ve adjusted some of the Q 2020 guidance that was issued on the previous earnings call. I’ve already mentioned, we have through our acquisition guidance in March based on capital market conditions, so that remains withdrawn. We will also leave the G&A guidance unchanged at this point at $33.5 million to $35.5 million for 2020. Our recurring CapEx is expected to be a little lower as we delay some non-essential projects. So our new expectation for the year is $17 million to $19 million versus our previous guidance of $24 million to $26 million. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through our portfolio statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. We delivered strong first quarter results building on DOC’s excellent performance in 2019 and I’d like to start by recognizing the outstanding efforts of those on our operations team, who have executed consistently during the challenges of the past couple months. As you know, we’ve invested a considerable amount of time and energy cultivating a unique culture with talented and engaged team members, who truly care about our healthcare partners and it’s paying dividends now. Despite working remotely and practicing social distancing, our asset management, property management and leasing teams continue to function at a high level and they’ve shown great strength and resilience. Before focusing on how we are navigating through the current environment, I’d like to share a few highlights from the first quarter. DOC’s portfolio at the end of Q1 2020 was an industry leading 96% leased, including 59% leased directly to investment grade quality tenants and their subsidiaries, which we believe is more than any other publicly traded portfolio in the healthcare real estate market. Leasing results in the first quarter were strong with an 86% tenant retention rate, renewal leasing spreads of approximately 1% and positive portfolio net absorption of 26,000 square feet. Looking ahead, DOC has less than 5% of its portfolio scheduled to renew in any year through the end of 2023. We believe the low number of lease expirations should result in lower levels of volatility and net operating income, as well as require significantly less in concessions for tenant improvements and leasing commissions compared to other MOB portfolios with much greater levels of annual lease expirations in this uncertain market. Moving to same-store NOI growth, our 238 properties same-store MOB portfolio generated cash NOI growth of 1.6%. The same-store NOI growth is slightly below our average annual rent escalation of 2.3% as a result of a 20 basis point decline in occupancy in the same-store portfolio, primarily from a 21,980 square foot vacancy at our MeadowView MOB in Kingsport, Tennessee and short term rent abatement at a 17,500 square foot surgery center in Cornwall, New York, which recently renewed for a new 15 year term in Q4 2019. One final highlight from the first quarter, I’m extremely proud to share that both the Baylor Cancer Center in Dallas, Texas and Northside Towne Lake MOB in Atlanta, Georgia earned the regional award for the outstanding building of the year, also known as TOBY from BOMA for their respective regions. These outstanding MOBs demonstrating the exceptional quality of DOC’s portfolio will next advanced to BOMA’s international TOBY competition in June, where DOC will have two of the six entries competing for the top award. The TOBY awards recognized excellence in building operations, policies, management, community involvement and ESG efforts. Now turning to the current operating environment and our focus on the COVID pandemic. The health and safety of our healthcare partners and our team members has, of course, been the top priority. In early March, as the first COVID cases emerged in our markets, we quickly commenced and cleaning procedures and communicated extensively with our healthcare partners and our entire operations team, including an informational webinar featuring DOC Trustee Member, Dr. William Ebinger. At that time, we also formed a COVID task force to review and enforce operational procedures that included but are not limited to janitorial frequency and product selection, scheduling and use of PPE for essential employees, social distancing, signage in building common areas and elevators, air filtration and management of construction activities. Across the portfolios, the entire team worked tirelessly to implement these new procedures to ensure our buildings promote a healthy environment. Nearly all of our facilities remained open during the month of April and the vast majority expect to start increasing patient volumes again in early to mid-May under enhanced guidelines for safe patient care. Most recently, as an example, in Atlanta, Georgia, our largest markets, the Governor has begun reopening select businesses to start rebuilding the economy. As of this week, 93% of DOC’s occupied space was utilized. Those offices temporarily postponing patient visits and not open, primarily includes dentists, ophthalmologists, plastic surgery and physical therapy offices. Interestingly, utilization and profitability at the LifeCare LTACHs also improved considerably during March and April, as the demand increased due to COVID-19 cases and CMS expanded the scope of care LTACHs can provide an accelerated reimbursement payments. Looking ahead, to our leasing outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect strong tenant retention as practices simply remain in place during the COVID pandemic. For the remainder of 2020, we have just 87 leases scheduled to renew representing 2.1% of ABR, but we do expect some leases to extend term early as part of agreement for near-term rent deferral. While new leasing activity could slow in the future, we are seeing a strong pipeline of leasing activity at this time, including some recent inbound calls from on-campus practices to off-campus MOBs as patients and families are hesitant to visit hospital campus treating COVID patients. To conclude, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our team members and those in our facilities first, and using this time wisely to invest in our relationships with our hospital and physician partners during this time of need. The high quality nature of our healthcare partners has never been more powerful differentiating component than it is today. With the majority of our tenant’s investment grade quality and approximately seven-year weighted average lease term remaining in the portfolio. We are well positioned to endure this period. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to JT to discuss our success collecting April and May rent. JT?
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. We know there’s one statistic that more than any other you want to discuss, we are very pleased to report our April 2020 cash rent collection stand at 94.4% of billings. We anticipate collecting most, if not all of the remaining 6% over time. We are already off to a promising start in May with over 74% collected as of May 6, which is consistent with April’s pace of collections. During April, DOC received inquiries from tenants, who represent 21% of our annual base rent or ABR about their options for paying rent during the COVID-19 pandemic. These inquiries largely came from small tenants, ambulatory surgery center tenants and the specialist that performed surgical care like ophthalmologist and orthopedic surgeons hit hard by the national and state limitations on performing non-urgent surgery that can be postponed. DOC has used this period of time to engage with all of our tenants and on a case-by-case basis, assist them with the process of applying for federal paycheck protection program loans and/or Medicare grants and advanced payments. Before the CARES Act was even passed, we had retained two different consultants, each of which are active in medical practice management and the SBA process. These tenants who pursued PPP, medical assistants and other sources of liquidity, we waived lease late fee obligations and patiently worked with our tenants, while they sourced working capital to pay rent through these programs. In the end, tenants representing just over 5% of our ABR have not paid April rent thus far, but again, we believe most, if not all of this rent is collectible and will be collected. We refer you to our COVID-19 supplemental update posts this morning for more details. While our April rent collection for strong and May is off to a good start, we do expect tenants to continue to have constraints on the revenue, collections and working capital for the remainder of the second quarter. Fortunately, with the increase in PPE production, our outpatient care facilities can now start providing surgeries that had been delayed. Many of our providers are reporting full schedules and expanding surgical hours to the weekends as well. By the end of this weekend, the government prohibitions on scheduled surgery had expired for 91% of DOC’s ABR. This is updated as of this morning with the addition of Maryland overnight and is better than reported in our COVID supplement. In addition, as of this week, only two of our buildings are currently closed, one a wellness center lease to CommonSpirit and a small legacy building. Our provider tenants are anxious to care for their patients and get back to work. We’re now happy to address your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thank you. And I also wanted to thank you guys for providing the COVID supplement presentation. Looks like, there’s a lot of good details in this presentation. I wanted to dive into the uncollected rents in April – of rents that have requested for deferral that you deny. Why were these denied and is there concerns on the collectability of the 3% of rents that weren’t paid from this bucket?
John Thomas: Yes, Mike. This is JT. And we hope you are all safe and your family as well. I’m going to ask Jeff to respond to that question.
Jeff Theiler: Hi, Mike. No, it’s a great question. So in April, we received rent deferral or rent questions from about 21% of our tenants. And we have a pretty good advantage in processing these requests, because over the past three years, we’ve really invested an enormous amount of time and resources into building a dedicated credit department that tracks tenant financials actively. And so we have a really good sense of what their usual revenues and volumes are as well as the resources available to pay rent. And so as these requests come in, we put them through a really detailed review process and then we segregate them into tenants that have the resources or aren’t showing enough negative impacts on their business and we think they can still pay rent versus the ones that are really showing significant struggles. And those are the ones that we’re working with and giving them additional time as they avail themselves of government resources, like, the Medicare acceleration payments or PPP loans, those types of things. So the tenants that were rejected or their relief requests were rejected were ones that we had done the credit work on and determined that they had the ability to pay rent.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then the 7% of that you’re in discussion with at least on the April billings. I mean, it looks like the majority of that was already paid. Should we assume that that’s a good starting point for potential? Was it May and June deferrals will come from that bucket?
Jeff Theiler: It’s a great question, Mike. So in the first week of May, of those 7% of tenants that we were working with, about half of them received their government assistance or have since been able to pay their May rent. So I think what probably the way to look at it is, you cut that bucket roughly in half. So 3% or so of the total ABR we’re still working with. And then there’s the other ones have had a successful resolution already.
Michael Carroll: Great. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Theiler: Thanks, Mike.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: And our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Griffin: Hi, this is Michael Griffin on for Nick. I’m just curious you mentioned the States reopening, not central medical procedures starting up again. I’m wondering what your thoughts on how long it will take to work through that pent-up demand for those non-essential procedures?
John Thomas: Yes, that’s a great question. We don’t have a solid sense of that, but again, most of all of April’s work was delayed or deferred. And so some of the facilities that we talked to performed almost no surgery in April. And I have very full schedules are asking us to expand hours into the evenings, open on Saturdays and things like that. So we think May and June will be very full schedules. That’s what again, most of our providers reporting to us. And then the question I think has been how quickly can they then build up a new schedule, is patient returned to the clinical setting, the diagnostic setting, and that we don’t know yet.
Michael Griffin: Got it. And then one more question on deferrals. For deferrals that would be granted, what – what do you – do you have a sense of the length of timeframe for repayment?
John Thomas: We really approach this, as Jeff said, not in a kind of automatic deferrals for any specific requests. It’s been on a case by case basis. We haven’t specifically granted deferrals at all. Again, we – on specific conditions, we’ve waived late fees in anticipation of tenants paying their rent. And we’ve had no tenants, I asked for abatement. No tenants have threatened to not pay. They’ve just asked us for time to pay where they can. And again, we’ve evaluated those on a case by case basis. So I think the one situation we know that they have the best color on kind of wind they’ll get to be able to get caught up is probably a June, July kind of timeframe. But that’s a small percentage of the unpaid billings in April. And very comfortable with that tenant will be able to get caught up if not by the end of the quarter, early in the third quarter.
Michael Griffin: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Siversky from Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Connor Siversky: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for having me on the call. Happy to hear the team is doing well. First question for me, I mean, seeing how the practices typically generate revenue from lower acuity procedures are the ones most affected. And then while it’s good to see that some States are loosening restrictions, I mean, how are you guys looking at the possibility of a second wave of COVID in the fall or winter months? I mean, any commentary here from your team or conversations with your tenants would be appreciated here.
John Thomas: Yes. Connor, great question. And again, we hope all your family safe as well. The issue for the reason elective surgery or scheduled surgery, which I think is a better term was really restricted in those States was the lack of PPE. So they get surgical gowns, the mask, all the things they need just to breathe, protect the – both the healthcare teams, but the patients themselves. Our tenants are telling us that – they have been able to start stockpiling PPEs, with the – as they were set down in April, many of which never saw in their communities, never saw a big wave. And in fact, we’re loaning out some of the PPE that they were stockpiling to the inpatient facilities that we’re starting to see some COVID patients. So that’s the big issue. So they can be, can’t the inpatient hospitals, if they’re the wave and if they’ve got the PPE, they can be a beneficial part of the system versus just shutting down. And so again, our anticipation is that most of the tenants were talking to and provide us return to our in a second wave event, they will have time to stockpile PPE and be able to stay open and contribute to the healthcare system and not just be shut down. But again, that’s – that’d be to volumes and other things outside of their control and our control as well. That’s the anticipated response for the fall.
Connor Siversky: All right, cool. Appreciate the color there. And then I think we’re operating under the impression here, the acquisition market’s going to be muted through the end of the year. And I think it kind of levels the playing field to some degree. Are you guys exploring any new opportunities here? Or can you provide any color on it, kind of your strategic views going forward when it comes to expanding the portfolio in the future?
John Thomas: Yes, I’m going to ask Deeni to comment as well, but just before he weighs in, I said my prepared comments, the good news is most of the pipeline that we had built up in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter, fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year that we expected to capitalize invest in the second quarter and third quarter is still there. And the sellers if you will, the developers and the owners of those buildings are physicians in particular are waiting on us to get through this situation to proceed. And we don’t know what the price will be, but we hopefully can have a meeting of the minds with those sellers and get back to the growth, when conditions arise. Deeni, wanted to weigh in as well?
Deeni Taylor: Well, I think that one of the things we’re doing, we’re taking a very active process to watch all the deals that are in the market. Once you are out there and continue to monitor both who are the sellers and what their expectations are. And as JT has said, we’ve been fortunate that the sellers that we’ve been working with are understand the situation and are holding back as we watch what happens in the market. But we’re watching as close as we can all the deals that are out there potentially coming.
Connor Siversky: All right, thanks for the color there. That’s all for me.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning. I’ll echo Mike’s earlier comments in the COVID supplement. It’s very helpful. So thanks for that. On the investment grade tenants, I noticed April collections, they’re at 97%. Is that normal, like say, versus a year ago? I’m guessing, I would have expected it maybe be more like a 100% given the quality that rent stream.
John Thomas: Yes, it’s a great question, Jonathan. Again, hope all was well with your family. It’s really two subsidiaries of investment grade tenants. One is a very large multispecialty group that’s only partly owned by the investment grade tenant. So it’s one of those unfortunate situations, where they’re kind of caught in limbo between, they’re too big for the PPP program. It’s kind of one of the flaws in the way the PPP was structured and they’re not wholly-owned by the health system. So it’s kind of tricky for the health system to step in and pay rent on behalf of physicians that they are only partly owners. That is the situation I’ve mentioned a minute ago, where we fully expect to get that resolved by the end of the quarter, just because of, as the health system steps in and works with that physician group to get them back busy working and being to get their rent caught out. So we’re fully confident in the resolution of that one. The other is a small ASC. Again, that’s in a joint venture with the health system, health system majority owner and unfortunately, again, similar situation have not stepped into pay that rent. But we expect to get it collected. Again, another kind of flaw in the PPP program or shake shack, did qualify and even though with 8,000 employees, but our surgery center that’s partly owned by health system can’t benefit on their similar structure, because there again had to count the health system employees as well. We tried to get that fixed and round two the CARES Act, but it’s didn’t have quite enough momentum in the Senate.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And on the credit guarantee on investment grade exposure, I mean, you bring it up, I mean, how much of your, I guess, 57% of rent, if you include Northside’s investment grade. How much of that 57% investment grade rent exposure is paid explicitly by the system or is it paid by that physician group that might just be affiliated with the system, kind of like the example you mentioned earlier where maybe that system’s a joint venture owner. So it’s not a fully guaranteeing that least lease payment.
John Thomas: This is not precisely correct, but that 97% you see the paid is more or less the direct payment by the health system percentage, just two unique situations where again, no credit issue, just to structure those two groups made it more complicated in this kind of situation.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. that’s helpful. And then my last one, I know procedures are expected to come back in a hurry due to pent-up demand. But do you see any risks that that some maybe overlooking due to the prevalence of high deductible healthcare plans. Do you think some people could actually put off these electives, the ones that truly are elective to maybe even late 2021 after they hit their minimums and don’t have to come out of pocket so much? Is that a risk that maybe you’re thinking about and your operator and physician groups are discussing?
John Thomas: Yes. Jonathan, that’s a good question. And potentially that’s an issue, but again, these are what will be done in May and June are things that were already scheduled in March – late-March and April. And so again, I think the patients in those cases had already come to the conclusion that they weren’t – the case for any longer. So we’ll see, I think the bigger issue is a gap in backfield and after the search and actually performing procedures to be clear in May and June is, how quickly will patients go back to the diagnostics and kind of fill up the pipeline for late summer and early fall. And again, back to that search question from before, which is the PPP, the PPE to be precise, protective equipment available. And again, our providers are telling us they’re stockpiling now and expect to stay open during a second surge of that COVID in the fall, if that occurs. So great question, but when you don’t see that. Scheduled surgery has always got that kind of seasonality to it, which is, if you get to the early fall and you can wait till the end of the year and you’ve got your deductibles burned out. That’s why December is so good for orthopedic surgeons, so.
Jonathan Hughes: Yes. Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks for your time.
Operator: And our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning. Again, I think some of the supplemental information on the updates are very helpful. With the updates, some of the data you put are just about, when it’s kind of sliced up the rent. Rent collections are pretty interesting. Specifically, it seems like, again, you’ve kind of collected more of your ransom investment grade versus your non-investment grade tenants. You’ve collected more rents from your on campus versus off campus tenants. I’m just kind of curious, is that kind of guiding your decision going forward regarding investments and kind of how you kind of think about underwriting on a going forward basis? And if so, how?
John Thomas: Tayo, we – again, we think the outpatient off campus buildings, have performed very well. The affiliated off campus buildings, which is really the sweet spot of our investment thesis. And we’ve got that – it actually was the best collecting rate we had and 95%. So other than the hospitals and LTACH, which paid 100%. And so we’re very proud of that. But the off campus affiliated MOB, we think it would have been the star in the last six weeks, again, but for the lack of PPE and we think those, again, that’s where patients are going to want to go and not go to the hospital and get mixed up with the COVID cases in that building. So again, lots of reasons for on campus buildings, but we think the underlying thesis has been not only reaffirmed, but we think we’ll grow over time as our long-term view that off campus affiliated MOB is really the sweet spot of our long-term strategy.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. That’s helpful. Then one more for me, again, with hospitals kind of being the lifeblood of your business. Could you just talk a little bit about, again, how you’re feeling or what you’re seeing in regards to all the federal and state aid hospital systems are getting, whether it’s part of the CARE Act or what have you. And whether you have a sense whether that’s actually going to be enough, if they need more aid and what the implications are for kind of rent collectability, if not in April and May, maybe further down the road as a hospital system just to kind of struggling with profitability, especially, as the patient mix of likely to kind of change post-COVID. Just given, we have 30 million Americans who no longer have employment.
John Thomas: Yes, I mean, Tayo, great questions. I mean, no question, all the health systems, investment grade or otherwise have been really pinched. Not only they have kind of high expenses and getting prepared for COVID cases, but also the bigger issue has been the opportunity costs, the lost revenue primarily from surgery that could be scheduled. And again, we think lots of health systems, we’ll see more than ever the benefit of shifting outpatient care and scheduled care to outpatient care facilities in the future to be better prepared for these kinds of things going forward. In the near-term, obviously, there’s a pinch on both the revenue and expenses and the profitability, the federal government pumped a lot of money into it. It’s not pumped enough. Hospitals are still looking for more. There’s going to be a CARES Act four or fourth round of legislation. I’ve got a pretty good summary of that on my desk, most of which seems to be pretty acceptable to the Senate. And so we expect more money there. One of the big issues is, part of the Medicare advanced payments, which just add advances and is a loan. And so hospitals, there’s a fairly large number with Bipartisan support in the house of Congressmen, Congress people looking to convert that to if not a pure grant at least extending the term of those loans and the interest rate, so as not to put pressure on hospitals. Just when everything’s kind of returning to normal to then have a big obligation that they have to pay back to Congress. So well that turned into a grant, that’s probably a 50/50 guess at best or outcome at best. But I do think there’s a lot of momentum to ease the payback periods and payback terms for that part of the Medicare money has been advanced. So bottom line is expect more federal money to come in, expect put more money to go to the States to help, the States offset their Medicaid costs. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, the biggest issue really to your question is how quickly can we get employment back to some kind of normal rates and get those people back on commercial insurance. Again, they have opportunity for COVID right now, but that’s a long-term, it’s really about the employer commercial insurance and that’s the profitability of the healthcare systems. I will conclude that question. Happy to have a follow-up, but I’ll conclude that with we’re in touch with our largest health systems, really all of our health systems, all of our tenants, very routinely as Mark and Amy Hall and myself and Jeff and others have been in communication with them. And again, all of that’s been a very collegial. We’ve been there providing support to them and their buildings and helping to manage the traffic flow with our brave employees and partners that have helped manage that. And then on the front end, at the same time, our health systems are all. Many of which are starting to look for growth opportunities, I mean, I fully expect to see some hospital consolidation coming out of this, fully expect that situation I’ve talked about before that hospitals will employ more physicians access, not less. So some of our hospital systems that are investment grade and have the capability to grow in the future are looking for targets right now for more consolidation. We just think we’ll be part of that and everybody will benefit eventually.
Tayo Okusanya: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: Good morning, and I’ll echo others’ comments that took you and your family and everybody’s doing very well. Let’s put a follow-up on the last comments you made. John, do you see an opportunity for hospitals to increase their monetizations? Assuming this, everybody gets over this and hospitals come back to profitability, but they are losing money today and do you see MOB monetizations picking up and some opportunities from that end coming your way?
John Thomas: Yes, we certainly do, Dan, and again, glad you’re well and thanks for the early morning comment that was helpful. So there are already a couple of the proprietary hospital companies out there looking to monetize some MOBs. There’s one non-profit that we’re aware of that’s looking to the starting the package that they’d been in the process of it, but I think they’re starting to think about accelerating that now. We think a lot of hospitals that we’ve – the systems that we’ve been talking to and are aware of that, we’re thinking about doing developments and funding it on their own or more likely to at least consider using third-party capital, like DOC’s and others. So I think that’s a very real realistic and again, we’re starting to see evidence of it already. And we certainly, that’s where we shine as you know, like we have done with counting spirit and north side and other health care systems over the years, and think we’ll have great opportunities going forward to do that.
Daniel Bernstein: And then the other question I had is in terms of leases, I mean retention rates are higher. We’re hearing of early renewals. I think you’ve made some comments about that earlier in the earnings call here. Are you seeing any change in the terms of the leases in terms of the length of the lease or requirements on TI or rate? Just trying to understand if there’s some early signs there on pressure on rate and maybe charm.
John Thomas: Yes, we had – I wouldn’t say anything unique. I mean one thing we’ve seen again, which is probably just temporary, but may turn into long-term is, hospitals looking for really every square foot of space, they can. In the near term, if they need to spread both their employees out and their – and patients out during this period of time. But I think really more important to your question is, I think what we’re seeing is kind of routine leasing. There’s been obviously a slowdown because of in kind of – I used the word speculative though, where you’re trying to recruit new tenants to a building and you can’t rotate them through or show space currently. But the health system where we’re directly engaged, we’ve had some really nice extensions, renewals, that kind of normal renewal rates and adding some term. We’ll see how the second quarter end. So we could have more space safe leased and end the second quarter and then we’ve ever had, and we have the most safe leased of any MOB portfolio [indiscernble] Dan.
Daniel Bernstein: I think that’s fine. That’s all I have. I’ll hop off. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. Good morning, guys. And of course, hope you’re doing well. So my question relates to a couple of points that we’re dancing around here a little bit and it seems to be two opposing forces in terms of where patient care is administered in the near-term at least. And first, there is a notion that patients would rather not go to hospitals for fear of being, fear of contagion, but maybe then the same for DOC’s offices. And that’s kind of balanced by the political support that you’ve been discussing, which is Bipartisan for hospitals, right. So the liquidity, the capital seems to be there politically. So my question for you is, I guess first on the DOC’s offices, what are you guys doing or what are your tenants doing at the facility level to make patients feel more comfortable coming to the office or coming to their facilities?
Mark Theine: Sure. Good morning, Jordan. This is Mark. So from an operation standpoint in our facilities, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we established a task force to review all of our building operations policies and we’re doing a lot of things on social distancing signage, collaborating closely with our hospital partners, about hours of operations, extending building hours, opening on Saturdays to spread out patient visits, doing obviously extensive cleaning and increasing the scheduling of our day porters within the buildings and adjusting engineering hours, things like that, that we think will help with the operations of the building and ultimately allow our patients and our physicians to get back to operations quickly.
Jordan Sadler: Is there any – sorry, go ahead John.
John Thomas: Okay. So I was just going to add that exactly that which is in, we’re 93% of our spaces have remained open more or less continuously. Now, obviously hours have been adjusted and things like that. And the surgery centers have been temporarily closed or dramatically reduced hours. But operationally, they’ve stayed open, and again, it’s been a learning process and best practices all along some health systems had done it a little bit differently than others. But again, it’s all in a collaborative way. So again, trying to make the facilities as inviting and as you know, signage and communication and hand sanitizer and all the things that you can do to try to make it comfortable. And then there’s screening and then there’s testing. And so screening is about communicating, if you have these symptoms, where to go and then usually that is the where to go is to the testing location, which is in another part of if it’s on campus, the campus or if it’s not on campus, another place. We heard in one of the surgery centers that’s just opened up this week, the cars loving – the person coming in for the surgery literally gets screened in their car. And our temperature check and kind of those kinds of things. Again, that’s the healthcare provider for doing that. So it’s a very collaborative approach. It’s really the providers who set the standard. And in our cancer facilities, segregating, providing kind of different areas for entry for their cancer patients coming in, limiting the amount of visitors, and so 266 buildings, we’ve learned a lot. And again, almost all of them have stayed open the whole time and accommodating that question. But again, it’s going to take time and as we all know, and but hopefully we can be as inviting as possible and material you provided.
Jordan Sadler: And coming back to the restart of elective procedures, because you’ve had a view into it across some of your markets as you’ve highlighted the slides. Can you speak to what you’ve seen specifically in the markets that are currently open? Are those at a 100% plus utilization?
John Thomas: Yes, so – yes, I’ll give you an example. In the Texas market, one facility did a 35 procedure – 35 surgical cases, the first 3.5 weeks of April. They’re doing 75 a week right now. So that’s and then – again, just catching up and kind of their normal case load is 50 to 60 surgical cases a week in a five-day period. So in Texas, one of the things that the kind of the restrictions that are there that’s I think pretty probably placed, I might even in 32 States. So each State got a little bit different, kind of parameters around it. How to open up in Texas, you’ve got to kind of set aside 25% of the facility, for the potential of a COVID patient. And again, that’s where the surgical hospitals and larger surgery centers that have, again, just a little bit bigger physical capacity can actually accommodate more patients more quickly. So that’s a good anecdotal piece. One surgery center where we have a lot of facilities with I think they were – had very limited percentage in April and they’ve commented publicly that they’re back to 50% and look to catch up pretty quickly to ramp it up to a 100%-plus of their normal volume as they catch up on delayed procedures.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you for the time.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jordan.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Gorman from BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everybody.
John Thomas: Hi.
Michael Gorman: JT, I was just wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit bigger picture as you guys look at the healthcare landscape and I was interested in one of your comments at the outset about pushing additional care outpatient obviously and reserving the hospitals. This is obviously a trend that’s been going on in U.S. healthcare for a while, but now we – is there any pushback or any sense that we’ve overdone the drawdown in inpatient capacity in the country. And any discussions on how to make that profitable when there isn’t a pandemic, but also have that capability with the healthcare operators when it becomes necessary? I’m just trying to think about how that could potentially shift provisions of care if we have to keep the inpatient facilities around when there isn’t something for them to do. But we want them there when there is a crisis.
John Thomas: Yes, Mike, it’s a great question. And I’ve always loved ophthalmologist and then based on your influence, but ophthalmologist, they had to close first in this situation. And obviously lots of discussion about both the physical plant health care system and the payment system. Our payment system has been geared for years around procedures and not medicine and has incented, this is – it’s proven out over the last six weeks really incented to move cases to the lowest cost setting. Unfortunate, we didn’t have the PPE to do that and over the last couple of months. So I mean I think there’s a lot of commentary and a lot of legislative debate and intellect and academic debate about that. If you talk to Michael Dowling at Northwell, I was listened to him speak 10 days ago or so, and he was coming about this exact thing says we have to have more ICUs and more inpatient beds for situation like this, but our surgeons are all sitting at home doing nothing, because they can’t come to the facility. And so kind of that balance of kind of a redesign of both the payment system and the infrastructure and as Mark mentioned our LTACHs, which have struggled for years, because they’ve been kind of the stepchild of the inpatient facilities. They are by definition ventilator hospitals and are thriving right now in this environment. So I think it’s going to be a whole redesign of the system preserving inpatient capacity, maybe enhancing the physical design of inpatient capacity and shifting care to more appropriate setting and the payment system is going to have to adapt to that as well. And we’ve seen a lot of changes in, a lot of emergency changes to the payment system like in the LTACHs situation to address the situation, and I think that’ll begin the process of redesigning the system. And I wouldn’t say this as Medicare for all, I’m just saying it, total redesign of the system over time.
Michael Gorman: Right. And I guess my question is, if you also have you heard from any of your healthcare system tenants, and it’s probably too early, they’re still putting out fires, but some eye towards whether it’s off campus or on campus having their outpatient facilities better equipped as flex space for future crisis or future pandemics where they can flex capacity if they need to.
John Thomas: Yes. Now I’ve already started to hear that. And there’s – the architects who are have high volume healthcare work are already putting out, not only white papers but kind of early thoughts around the redesign of, again, both inpatient and outpatient facilities from lessons learned from this. When we had the terrorist events in after September in 2001, the big issue is we didn’t have the ERs didn’t – weren’t set up for patients coming in with a biological attack. And so the ER has got adapted to and became a requirement to have a kind of space set aside for that. That’s a microcosm of I think what we’ll see here. And the other thing is medical office buildings and outpatient care buildings have been built in the last 10 years. We’ve had very little just general office space provided for physicians. It’s kind of been [indiscernble] about procedure rooms and exam rooms and the physician sees you there and brings in a computer on wheels or an iPad to do the – to record all that. There’s no room, there’s no place for physicians to do telehealth in these buildings. And so we think there’ll be a redesign around, the expansion and because telehealth here to stay. It’s just a matter of where it will be conducted. I don’t think it’ll be telehealth from home. I think it’d be telehealth from the medical office building. But we think there’ll be a redesign of our buildings and changes to our buildings and future buildings in the outpatient care setting to facilitate HIPAA compliant, telehealth encounters. And we think that’s a good thing, an efficiency of the system that this crisis has shown can work very well.
Michael Gorman: Thanks. I appreciate your thoughts. I hope you all stay well.
John Thomas: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to John Thomas for closing remarks.
John Thomas: Thank you, again for joining us today. We do hope that all of your families and colleagues are safe and well. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-26 12:00:00) =====

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad and thank you for joining us this morning. Physicians Realty Trust ended 2019 with a healthy portfolio, a strong balance sheet and a pipeline poised for 2020 growth. At the beginning of 2019, we announced guidance of completing $200 million to $400 million of new investments in off-market outpatient medical office facilities. We ended the year with $452 million in new investments which is 95% leased. These investments included our first in California, as well as an innovative strategic joint venture with Kayne Anderson Real Estate and MBRE Healthcare, the largest private non-hospital affiliated MOB owner in the United States. We also launched our first ground-up development with two projects under construction at the end of the year. The average first year yield on all of these investments was just over 6% near the top end of our guidance. We made these accretive investments without sacrificing tenant or asset quality. 83% of our new consolidated assets are leased to investment-grade health systems and their subsidiaries. These investments include our five new medical office facilities in California located adjacent to John Muir Health, Walnut Creek Medical Center. As part of that transaction John Muir Health rated A1 by Moody's entered into a new long-term lease for 100% of that space. During 2019 we expanded our relationship with Ascension, the second largest health system in the U.S. by financing the development of a 48,000 square foot outpatient care center for their health system ministry in Pensacola, Florida. Our financing includes an option to purchase the facility, which is expected to be completed and fully occupied during 2020. Our investments also include an ownership interest in three medical office facilities on Ascension's St. Vincent Health System flagship campus in Birmingham, Alabama through our participation in the recapitalization of a 59 building portfolio with Kayne Anderson and MDRE Healthcare, which included the contribution by us of two of our medical office facilities at market value plus $17 million in cash. This portfolio contains approximately 3 million square feet, 92% is on campus or affiliated with a health system and is 92% leased. We now manage approximately 500,000 feet on St. Vincent's campus in Birmingham, which recently announced a joint affiliation with UAB Health System, the state's highly medical education specialized treatment and research organization, further strengthening St. Vincent's opportunities for growth and success in that market. CommonSpirit, our largest tenant and the largest health system in the United States, continues to excel in their Health Care Ministry efforts and remains a strong DOC partner. Working directly with their leadership team, we transitioned all of our Louisville-based KentuckyOne leases to the University of Louisville Health. This alignment occurred in connection with the university's acquisition of CommonSpirit hospitals in Louisville. The commitment of the University of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, to continue the mission education and research based in these hospitals and facilities is further evidence of the resilience of our investments. We're excited to welcome a new health system client while also reducing our overall tenant concentration with CommonSpirit affiliated hospitals from 19.2% of our annual rental revenue on January 1 to 16.5% at the end of the year. DOC's invest and better strategy is driven by a management team that knows healthcare. For nearly seven years, we've embraced the outpatient health care setting to create a lower total cost and more convenient patient experience. In 2019, we've continued to see momentum in the growth and scope of services delivered in these types of facilities in locations where high quality providers offer outpatient medical services. Clinical science is evolving rapidly to move care out of the hospital and into outpatient settings, improving the quality of care and lowering the cost of that care. Science, convenience and cost will continue to drive more patients to health system affiliated providers in our outpatient medical office facilities. This environment and the exponential increase in the quantity of procedures performed outside of a hospital, fuels our opportunity for growth for years to come. As a leader in the healthcare REIT industry, we strive to maintain and grow a portfolio of exceptional real estate that provides unmatched site to our tenants and strong returns to our shareholders. Since our company's inception, we've maintained a firm commitment to ESG principles as a healthy investment decision and a critical component of our portfolio. With our scale in 2019, we invested approximately $3.5 million in energy management and building system upgrades, produce our current footprint and make our facilities better for the patients, physicians and other providers we serve. These investments also have a direct green return on investment as well. Later this year, we will publish our inaugural ESG report online presenting our social commitments to the communities we serve as well as our best practices in governance, diversity and inclusion. As part of our efforts, we've adopted the IREM Standard for Certified Sustainable Property Management. We've burned IREM certification on eight of our facilities and recognizing those assets for their sustainability features and outcomes. We will be certifying more buildings in the future. 2019 was a very positive year and we expect 2020 to be even better. As we see the opportunity for growth, we believe we can source to make new accretive investments in outpatient medical office facilities this year. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Theiler, our Chief Financial Officer to review our financial results and then Mark Theine will share the results of his team's outstanding performance. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company generated normalized funds from operations of $52 million or $0.27 per share, leading to a total of $190.6 million or $0.99 per share for the full year of 2019. Our fourth quarter funds available for distribution were $46.4 million and $178.4 million for the full year. 2019 was a year of transition as we started to take advantage of higher equity prices and lower debt costs to resume growing the company. Importantly, we continue to rely on the unmatched relationships our management team has built over their careers to source all of our 2019 acquisitions off-market delivering yields beyond those that can be found at adoption. We believe that its advantage which will enable the company to continue to grow its earnings at an above-average pace accruing value to our shareholders. Our $452 million of investments for the year were weighted toward the off-campus assets with specialized space and health system tenants which has been a focus point of the company since inception. This is the area which we have long believed and which all public MOB owners have now acknowledged verbally and by their own investment activity is the future of this industry. Our medical office building acquisitions in 2019 were acquired at an average cap rate of 6.0% and 83% of the space was occupied by investment-grade rated health systems. In the fourth quarter, we invested $274.3 million at an average cap rate of 6.1%. A particular note in the fourth quarter acquisition pool was a 12.3% minority stake in the $1.1 billion joint venture with MVI Realty and a foreign investor. This was not an auction deal but one where we were set out as a partner by the sponsor and foreign investor enabling us to pay a fair cap rate for the JV interest. The ancillary benefits of this deal are even better for our shareholders as we were able to fund a portion of our interest in the joint venture by contributing two assets at a sub-5% cap rate valuation resulting in a $22.9 million gain and 31% unlevered IRR on the sale. The contributed assets are part of the key cluster of buildings in the Birmingham area now controlled by the joint venture with management services at each of the assets to be assumed by DOC increasing our expected return on the JV investment to an unlevered yield of 5.7% and a levered yield of 9.2%. We believe that this joint venture will not only generate above-average returns for all involved but will allow us to leverage our southeastern property management capabilities to source additional deals and put us in the driver seat to the extent that this joint venture decides to monetize into the public sphere someday. As we look out into 2020, our pipeline is robust. If our cost of capital remains at current levels or better, we would expect to acquire between $400 million to $700 million of assets. We have well over that amount in our current shadow pipeline and feel comfortable that we can convert on a sizable number of these opportunities. We would expect cap rates to range between 5.25% and 6.25% and we are committed to finding the majority of our deals at better pricing than we could get by winning an auction or by paying portfolio aggregator significant premiums for their work. We also are likely to continue to invent mezzanine loans with purchase options to seed future investment opportunities as well as pre-leased development projects and partnerships with third-party development firms. Turning to operations. Our MOB portfolio had same-store growth for the year that was predictably volatile, but averaged out to a strong 3.1%. The fourth quarter same-store growth was 2.5% and was generated by contractual escalators and some savings on expenses that Mark will discuss in more detail. On a long-term basis, we continue to expect that our MOB portfolio same-store growth will average between 2% to 3%. We have been funding our projected acquisition pipeline appropriately by issuing $30.2 million of stock on our ATM program in Q4 and an additional $136.0 million following year end. Our leverage ticked up in the fourth quarter to 6.0 on a consolidated debt to EBITDA. However, the stock issuance completed in the first quarter will bring that number back down to 5.5 times. We are roughly at our target leverage range and will fund our 2020 acquisitions with an appropriate mix of debt and equity. As we look forward into 2020 and the relevant data points, I already mentioned the $400 million to $700 million of acquisitions at 5.25% to 6.25% cap rates. We expect MOB same-store NOI growth of 2% to 3%. And finally our G&A is estimated to range from $33.5 million to $35.5 million. We are roughly at our target leverage levels at this point and see a good opportunity to grow the portfolio with a nice balance of debt and equity. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. 2019 proved to be the best year in the history of the company from an operating perspective demonstrated by four key metrics: first, robust MOB same-store NOI growth that averaged 3.1% during the year; second, strong leasing activity resulting in 80% full year tenant retention; third, the continued expansion of our in-house property management platform by 2.3 million square feet in markets with strong geographic concentration; and fourth, well-managed CapEx totaling 6.9% of portfolio NOI for the year. As we enter 2020 poised for accretive growth with a portfolio that leads the industry at 95.9% leased. This metric includes 58.3% leased directly to investment-grade quality tenants and their subsidiaries, which we believe is more than any other publicly traded portfolio in health care real estate. Our 2019 acquisitions were 83% leased to investment-grade tenants and their subsidiaries highlighting DOC's continued focus on investing in long-term quality MOBs with market-leading health care provider partners and strong NOI growth potential. We believe these investments such as our five property portfolio in Walnut Creek, California will provide outstanding returns for year come and represent the standard for exceptional quality for acquisitions in the future. Looking at the quarter, our 238 property same-store MOB portfolio representing 84% of quarterly cash NOI generated year-over-year cash NOI growth of 2.5%. This strong NOI growth was driven by a year-over-year 1.9% increase in base rental revenue and a 7.8% reduction in operating expenses. The reduction in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a $2.5 million decrease in real estate taxes from favorable real estate tax challenges at the Baylor Cancer Center in Dallas and Centerpoint MOB in Atlanta. Year-over-year MOB same-store occupancy was down 30 basis points or approximately 35,000 square feet largely due to one general office lease which expired on September 30, 2019 and did not renew in our MeadowView MOB in Kingsport, Tennessee. This decline in occupancy had a negative 25 basis point impact on our overall same-store NOI growth and we feel confident in our ability to re-lease the space of MeadowView to the anchor medical tenant already in the building or the market dominant healthcare system in the region. Over the long term, we continue to expect our same-store portfolio to drive 2% to 3% NOI growth, as our in-place average rent escalator is now 2.4%. Turning to leasing activity for the quarter, our leasing team delivered solid results in Q4, completing 388,000 square feet of leasing activity with five MOB re-leasing spreads and a positive 83% retention rate. Included in this quarter's re-leasing spreads is a 17,400 square foot surgery center containing significant amortized TI, which was reset to market rental rates. MOB re-leasing spreads would have been a positive 5.3% if this lease were excluded. During the quarter, TI for lease renewals was extremely low at $0.69 per square foot per year and $2.64 per square foot per year for new leases. Overall, we invested $6.2 million in recurring capital investment and leasing commissions in Q4 or just 8.4% of portfolio's NOI. This low investment in capital expenditures relative to our peers is primarily driven by our low lease exploration schedule and is a key differentiator for DOC that enables us to return more cash to our shareholders. In 2020, we anticipate recurring CapEx to be $24 million to $26 million for the full year or approximately $6 million per quarter. Consistent with our plans announced in the beginning of 2019, we successfully executed on the expansion of our in-house property management platform. Over the last 12 months, we have transitioned property management services for 36 facilities, totaling 2.3 million square feet. These markets include Nebraska, Washington, Texas and most recently, Birmingham, Alabama, a market in which we have welcomed Kendra Risse to the DOC family. Internalizing property management not only strengthens our healthcare provider relationships, improves tenant retention and enhances market knowledge but in the case of Birmingham, it also increased our investment cap rate by 50 basis points. We believe the tenant retention starts with property management, the data lease assigned and we are committed to showing our hospital and physician partners through our actions that we genuinely care about enhancing the patient and physician experience. This level of care is evident in several prestigious awards earned by DOC this quarter, including two TOBY Award from the Building Owners and Management Association or BOMA and eight commercial sustainable property designations earned from the Institute of Real Estate Management, known as IREM. We are incredibly proud to share that the Baylor Cancer Center in Dallas and Town Lake MOB in Atlanta won the outstanding building of the year or TOBY Award in their local BOMA markets. The TOBY Awards are the most prestigious awards of their kind in commercial real estate, recognizing excellence in building operations. The judging process includes a peer review of all facets of building operations including energy management, tenant retention, community involvement, emergency preparedness and security. Congratulations to our Dallas property management team including Michelle Morris, Susan Leinweaver and Jolene Wilson, as well as our Atlanta office including Mark Dukes, Tosha Clay and each of our management partners at RTG. Similarly, we are proud to have been recognized for our firm commitment to the principles of ESG excellence, due to the recent achievement of eight IREM-certified sustainable property designations across our portfolio. This highly regarded designation was created to assess and recognize operational excellence. And commitment, to industry-leading sustainability practices. These properties are independently audited by, IRAM to verify a reduction in energy, water and waste usage. To showcase these assets and the rest of DOC's nation-wide portfolio, DOC will soon launch an innovative new corporate website, to improve the user experience for investors', health care partners, and potential tenants. As we begin 2020, we've built a high-quality portfolio that is operating well. And an exceptional asset management and leasing team, that will continue to deliver bottom-line results. Our commitment to relationships and service excellence, for our health care partners is the trademark of the DOC difference. And would ultimately drives tenant retention, cost efficiencies and a profitable consistent growth for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to, John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. And now I look forward to your questions.
Question-and:
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Chad Vanacore: All right, thanks. So, it looks like you're picking up the pace of acquisitions fairly substantially, from 2019 and 2020. So what's changed about this market? And who are the primary sellers that you expect, in 2020? And had that changed at all?
John Thomas: Chad, its JT. I think the fourth quarter pipeline started building up, again with the improvement in our cost of capital. It gave us the freedom to get more aggressive out in the market. But I think everyone of our transactions, in 2019 was off market. And most of our pipeline right now is kind of one-off, off-market transactions with either developers or directly with providers, in the markets that they -- where they're located. So, yeah, there's always a rumor about portfolios coming out. But right now, we're very focused on kind of the onesie-twosie transactions could be very accretive. And we can price in that range, that Jeff described.
Chad Vanacore: JT you also mentioned a little more off-campus, how are you viewing that versus on campus?
John Thomas: We continue to -- it tends to not exclude on-campus, but most of our pipeline continue to be focused on off-campus, where again, they tend to be newer buildings. It's going to be better served by physicians and the providers that are there and more convenient to the patients. So, you'll continue to see that being a focus of our investment efforts. From time-to-time, we'll have a find a good on-campus building that we like with a health system, we want to work with.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And then, commensurate with your improved outlook for 2020 as far as investments scale, you tapped the ATM a fair amount in the first quarter. Can we assume that there's a sizable deal locked in that maybe we might see in the second quarter?
John Thomas: Yeah. Chad. I mean, I think, we tapped the ATM in conjunction with our acquisition volume. So, we generally try to match fund deals when we can. And we'll kind of continue to have that strategy through 2020.
Chad Vanacore: All right. Fair enough. Then, you guys also into JV transaction this quarter. Can you talk about, what you thought was attractive, particularly about these transactions? And then, should we expect more in types of -- in terms of these types of deals?
John Thomas: I think, we have the opportunity to -- the one building that we did at Delaware was a long-standing private investor that we've done in the business, with since the beginning of the company. So we tend to find one or two transactions a year to working with them, and it provides a good opportunity for future growth and building that we'd like to own completely ourselves at some point in time. The NBK and Anderson JV was very exciting to us primarily because of the scale and the opportunity to partner with them. They're high-quality investors in the space. There's foreign investor that they brought along as well. It's a good source of future capital for all of us, but more importantly as we've described this very strategic investment where we own some buildings on one campus. They own this portfolio included some other buildings on the same campus. And we're able to combine the efforts there and I think increase the value for everybody concerned. So the only thing it's just another good tool in the toolbox from a capital perspective. But in this particular case a very strategic alliance that we think will provide some opportunity for future growth.
Chad Vanacore: All right. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
John Thomas: Thanks, Chad.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on some of Chad's questions. In terms of the pick-up, in terms of the volume that you're expecting for 2020, is this the culmination of a lot of off-market sourcing work that you've been doing? And just sort of what gives you the confidence in putting a 400 to 700 number out there today versus where we've been in the last year or two?
John Thomas: Yeah, we got two or three consistent sources of opportunities, one, is our existing health system relationships and we're constantly in conversations with them around the country in their various markets. Two, is the developer relationships we have that have been consistently bringing this business again since the beginning of the county. And we see the pipelines that they have and the portfolio that they've developed. In some cases with our mezzanine financing, which provides some real for option or an option to acquire those buildings once they're completed. So we see a lot of those maturing this year. And then otherwise we just -- like I said with the increase in improvement in our cost of capital, Deeni and Dan and Mark Theine and his team have just been out locating new opportunities for us and the pipeline’s lost in this as well as a result.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. In terms of how this might line up this year with just a ratable assumption makes sense throughout the year?
John Thomas: At this point, I think that's the easy way to model it in Jordan. It seems like -- yeah, that would make sense.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then coming back to the PMAC JV, the wording and the language in the press release -- and John you've referenced it again on the call, but you've assumed strategically important property management of a synergistic portion of the buildings. Can you translate?
John Thomas: Yeah, very simply that's the Birmingham campus, St. Vincent in Birmingham. So very strong -- it's part of the system, very strong hospital just aligned with UAB, which actually is the largest market share in that community, so strong academic environment. So there are six total billings in that campus, five of them are now in the JV. And the other one provides some flexibility to maybe redevelop that with the hospital in the future. So just really good opportunity for us short-term and long term.
Jordan Sadler: You own two, they own three?
John Thomas: We own three, they own three. We've put five of them in the JV together. The other one is outside the JV as we look to perhaps reposition or redevelop that one in the future just provide some flexibility.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. That's helpful. And then, what was the catalyst for the JV from your partner's perspective? What were they looking for? And how did you end up in the mix here?
John Thomas: Yes. So they were looking to recap the entire portfolio and invited us to evaluate that opportunity with them. And in the end, this is a strategic initiative for us, kind of created the impetus and the opportunity, but also just the potential capital, future capital opportunities with them. And then, again their model is to either sell or recap periodically and we'll be at the front of the line when that occurred with this entire portfolio. But again, our primary interest right now is the strategic management that we incorporated into the JV structure.
Jordan Sadler: So where are we in the process -- or where are they in the process in terms of the recap of the portfolio? Is this step 1?
John Thomas: It was done at the end of the year. So, this is just our first disclosure about it.
Jordan Sadler: So they did it basically at year-end, but is this meaning -- have they fully recapped the portfolio now? Because I mean you're coming in, you're putting in $17 million of cash. You'll take a 12.3% interest, but I don't know. I guess my question is were they looking to more fully recap at in terms of refinancing existing debt or be taken out of more equity et cetera? Or kind of good enough for now?
John Thomas: Yes. Jordan, there's a total recap of the portfolio and they brought in again a very high-quality European investors as part of the transaction.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
John Thomas: So, it was fully done at the end of the year and we were just part of the process.
Jordan Sadler: And is there additional opportunity for you to take an incremental stake here? Or is this sort of just a long-term position in this JV?
John Thomas: Yes, I can have everything is on the table, Jordan. That's near term not our focus.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And what are the escalators on the JV.
John Thomas: That tend to be 2.5% and 59 buildings. So, it's building by building, but they range in that 2.5% to 3% kind of consistent with the rest of our portfolio.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
John Thomas: A high-quality tenant base with Northwestern with Baylor and other Ascension facilities, so it's again, a very nice portfolio, a very nice opportunity for us to potentially grow in the future with these investors and also with -- indirectly.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then for Jeff, I'm looking at the $0.27 in the quarter. You've given us some guidance for next year, trying to think how this lines up. But was the 27 -- a pretty pure $0.27? Were there any onetime items related to either the origination of the loans in the quarter or any of the JV transaction? Just trying to see if there are any fees in there that need to come out before we go forward.
Jeff Theiler: No, no fees in terms of loan origination or JV activity. I think, the only thing to be aware of is, we did get that the $2 million of rent payment from foundation El Paso, which is a onetime item since we sold that building. We'll -- we have some of that coming back in the terms of -- in the form of seller financing that we'll earn interest on, but that's a onetime item.
Jordan Sadler: There's $2 million from Foundation in the quarter?
John Thomas: Right, exactly.
Jordan Sadler: It goes away next quarter? Okay. Well, it doesn't go away, but you pick up less in terms of the rent or the loan.
John Thomas: You got it.
Jordan Sadler: Got you. Okay. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Kubicek: Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew. Curious if you guys are expecting to sell any assets, kind of, looking forward and the path for 2020 today. And kind of along that same line, are there more opportunities for sub-5% cap rate sales, similar to kind of the strong pricing you guys saw with the Birmingham JV kind of contribution. Just kind of curious, what you guys are seeing kind of on that side, as you guys look forward with your capital needs?
John Thomas: We think a lot of our assets are worth that and particularly in any kind of portfolio range, but that's, again, not really our focus. As far as dispositions this year, we really haven't scheduled anything. At some point, once the LTACs are stabilized with the new operator there, we would like to sell those. It's not going to be a huge source of capital and it won't -- almost any definition will be dilutive, but it's not a huge number. It won't be that meaningful so -- 
Alex Kubicek: Understood. And then, just one follow-up question on the PMAC JV. Can we speak a little more to the portfolio itself, the locations outside of the Birmingham campus. Average age, other dynamics, any mark-to-market opportunities that were just kind of critical to you guys underwrite, as you approach it. It looks like a really strong partnership. But just kind of looking more with -- looking at more what the portfolio looks like on an asset-by-asset level would be kind of helpful.
John Thomas: Yes. Deeni is going to walk through some of the stats and we'll answer any more questions you've got about it.
Deeni Taylor: Yes. This is Dean. As JT already said, there were 59 assets in there. About 40% of the square footage is in the southeast 30% in the Southwest and about 20% in the Midwest of almost 3 million square feet. If you look at the top 50 MSAs about 86% of the portfolio is in those regions of the U.S., 92% was either on-campus or affiliated. And then, almost 65% of the square footage was with investment-grade tenants. So that gives you a little bit of flavor on it. And we will manage about 25% of that total square footage that's in the portfolio.
Alex Kubicek: That's really helpful color. And then, just one more question. JT, you referenced kind of being first in line down the road of a sale or something was dramatically changed? Is there anything contractual there? Or is it more just a strong partnership that you guys will continue to lean on down the road?
John Thomas: Yes. We have some contractual rights, but it's primarily -- these are health systems that have their own ROFRs on the assets as well and they're existing clients of ours. So as you all know, we've been very fortunate and humbled by health systems bringing us ROFR -- Right of First Refusal that they have from time to time to acquire assets. So, again, I wouldn't expect it to be anything other than that market pricing. But, again, we -- by having the relationships that we already have, with, again, both the investors but also the health systems, we'd expect to be in the front of the line for those assets that we'd like to own long term.
Alex Kubicek: Understood. Thanks for taking my question.
John Thomas: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. What does guidance assume in terms of funding the external growth in 2020, both in terms of equity and debt issuance?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Nick, it's Jeff. So, like I said, we're largely at target leverage right now. We tend to think of target leverage at least in terms of funding, as roughly 65% equity, 35% debt. So for modeling purposes, you could probably put that in there. In terms of long-term debt -- in terms of debt composition, assuming that we fund in that manner, probably at some point in the year we'll have accumulated enough on our line of credit where it makes sense to do a long-term debt offering. And so, those are usually around $300 million. Right now, our long-term cost of debt, I mean, it's dropping every day, but probably 2.9% right now somewhere around there give or take 10 basis points. So that's our funding plan for the year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on same-store expectations of 2% to 3%. Can you break that down between revenue and expenses? And then what sort of occupancy changes you're expecting this year?
Mark Theine: Hey, Nick this is Mark Theine. As we said in the prepared remarks our expectation for the year is 2% to 3% same-store NOI growth for the MOB portfolio that's primarily going to be driven on the revenue side through our contractual annual rent bumps which are now averaging 2.4%. Again most of our portfolio is triple net leased. So where we do get some operating expense savings a lot of that is passed back through the tenants and we try and recapture that in our re-leasing spreads. So we'll continue to try and drive the top line through rent bumps and maintaining that occupancy. As I mentioned we had one a little bit of a dip this quarter in our occupancy. But I think that's just a timing thing. We feel confident that we can get that released shortly.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Mark Theine: Thanks, Nike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah. Good morning, guys. This is Jason on for Mike. I'm wondering what portion of the acquisition range is developments? And how that breakout looks moving forward as you think about acquisitions?
John Thomas: Yes, great question. So we're kind of targeting and we think this is a reasonable amount of somewhere between $50 million and $100 million of new starts per year. We got just over the end of that last year just around $60 million of new starts last year that will come online this year. And so we're targeting at least that much or a similar amount for this year. So in these real system investment-grade credit 100% pre-leased kind of opportunities that we're looking at and we're working on a few right now that would be second half of the year starts. So that's kind of the we think that's a reasonable range based on our balance sheet but also just capital one-off kind of off-market relationship-driven development transactions that we'd like to pursue.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great. And then I'm also wondering if you guys could give a brief rundown of what the fee structure of the JV is like?
John Thomas: Pretty traditional structure between asset management and property management fees. Most of that's coming out of the tenants through the CAM charges as well so nothing exciting, nothing unusual.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks.
John Thomas: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. That's a very strong acquisition outlook out there congratulations. I wanted to focus on two things. First of all, the in-house property management, could you let us know just how much of your -- kind of like how much of your properties actually are being managed in-house today? What kind of opportunity there is to bring the rest in-house in regards to -- so you do get some type of bump from that. So how does that kind of build into your acquisition cap rates?
Mark Theine: Good morning, Omotayo. This is Mark Theine. So really proud of the progress we made in 2019 transitioning several of the markets to the dock property management platform. Today we manage directly about 60% of the portfolio and the remainder of which is single tenant buildings where the tenant does it directly where we've got a very strategic management partner in certain markets where they just have really strong existing relationships and it would be hard to replicate those for our future acquisition opportunities just market knowledge. So we don't plan to bring some of those markets in-house. And then looking forward as the portfolio continues to grow through acquisitions, we think that there'll be many more opportunities to bring in-house management. And the nice thing there is that we'll kind of get this cliff of management fees as well where we'll hit a tipping point of bringing in-house to market from existing properties as well as the management fees from the new acquisitions. And typically on the new acquisitions, the management fee is adding 30 to 40 basis points to the overall cap rate of the acquisition.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got it. So when you do give the guidance of 5.25% to 6.25% does it include that 30 to 40 bps bump on it?
John Thomas: No not really. That's looking at just the market pricing for assets on a one-off basis. Mark is really talking about when you get -- when we get to scale, there's a lot of economies of scale. So like Birmingham again the strategic relationship we have there that created enough scale for us to in-house all of the management there which we previously didn't have. Columbus, Ohio is another market where we've had a lot of growth and gotten to a scale point where we can manage, but we have a lot more growth opportunities there which again the economies of scale in the property management side are pretty accretive. So we don't factor that into the pricing per se, but it is certainly attractive benefit of the in-house management. As Mark said, there's a couple of markets -- three markets in particular, where we have a great management relationship. The data group in Minnesota and Phoenix and then RTG in Atlanta and we have others, but those three in particular markets where the relationship with the hospitals amongst the kind of the two parties is so strong. It's not some place, we would target to in-house asset management. It works well with being conducted today.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then second question -- my understanding is that for HOPD that the grandfathering rule under Section 603 has gone away. So everything is now site neutral. Could you talk about, if that's changing the way the hospital systems are thinking about off-campus MOBs? And if you've seen any big changes in regards to cap rates between the off and on-campus MOB market?
John Thomas: I think I think there's more competition for the off-campus buildings today just because of the evolution of people's thinking and understanding and targeting that more than they have in the past. Technically the 603 grandfathering has not changed. CMS keeps ignoring it and the courts keep telling them on a year-by-year basis that they got to follow the law. So technically that's not the direction. Congress will have to change that. CMS can do it laterally. Now they certainly can make it painful for the hospitals to recover those reimbursements and have so far. But we haven't seen any real change in strategies. We've been working with one hospital that spent a great deal of money to get -- to make sure they got a site within 250 yards of hospital campus, but it's really more about they want to de-camp the hospital so they can kind of re-improve it if you will or improve it from its historical real estate structure. And so they wanted to -- they need the new site to be closer to the hospital. So not changing the reimbursement as they kind of de-camp the hospital and focus on outpatient care and then move forward in the other direction. Most of the new developments we're seeing are off-campus with these health systems. The two we're funding are right now are off-campus.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: Good morning. I have a couple of follow-up questions on the PMAC JV. Is the JV intended to be kind of just static recapitalization? Or are there actually any intentions to grow the joint venture? I wasn't quite clear on that.
John Thomas: That's a great question, Dan. No, there's some opportunity to grow the joint venture. There's a couple of projects under development within -- inside the joint venture, and then there's some provisions around growth of the -- where our buildings are located, where the JV buildings are located to accrue to the benefit of the JV versus in the individual members of the joint venture. So, there's some growth opportunities. But right now that's -- again the focus is for us is around the assets we're managing.
Daniel Bernstein: Thank you. And if you do grow the JV, I assume the -- your equity stake in that JV would just stay about the same? Or is there an opportunity to increase the actual state ownership within JV?
John Thomas: Yeah. It'd be case-by-case. I mean contractually, we'd be required to maintain our interest, but again to be case-by-case as to how those get funded.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Okay. And then the other question is, and this is really far off. But, I mean, you have a 2026 expirations at 24 -- I think it's 24% of ABR, little expirations between now and then. I just wanted to understand if there were any purchase options that are open or will come open that we should be thinking about our modeling say, in the next 24 months. Just don't want to have any surprises that we're not modeling or thinking about.
John Thomas: Yeah. We don't have any purchase options really across the portfolio outside FMB and really more about ROFR, right of first refusal, could drive the sell of building. So, nothing mature in the next 24 months or next 10 years rather than I can think about, or think of. 2026 is a daily focus of Mark and his team and most of that is CHI-affiliated hospitals. And so, you really need to have we're working with them on space planning or new space, or changes to those buildings that usually comes with a change in the lease term to get it out of the 2026 year. So, we'll continue to reduce the concentration of that year to over time.
Daniel Bernstein: Is there a single master lease? Or is each property kind of have their own individual lease but the expirations are at the same date?
John Thomas: It runs market-by-market. So there's essentially a master lease in each market. Each building has its own lease. It's essentially all under one tenant in that local market. And then, again those would all tie to a specific year.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. So, it's not like all of them just go away. If somebody wanted to -- if somebody wants to get out of their lease, it's not like all of them go with, because it's each individual market?
John Thomas: That's correct.
Daniel Bernstein: The risk is what I perceive to be on paper.
John Thomas: Right. No, when we moved all those leases to the University of Louisville. I mean it's just a wholesale change of the…
Daniel Bernstein: Right.
John Thomas: And with the landlord achieve in the name dependent on those leases, and this a supplement and transition. So...
Daniel Bernstein: And I just want to go back to the question on JV opportunities in the future. Are you seeing more and more sellers are looking to do joint ventures versus straight-up sales? Is it – again, this may have been a one-off opportunity. But you did two in the quarter. So, I'm just wondering whether JVs are something that kind of the flavor of the day that people want to do? Or is that really just -- these were just one-off opportunities?
John Thomas: These are one-off. Like I said, the one single deal in Delaware is frankly, they just got to the building what we did, and brought the opportunity to co-invest with them. So, it was part of the -- again, their long-term exit strategy would be ideally to us, as for us as well. The team MACRA was again much -- for us much more focus on the strategic value of that relationship. But also, again, these are good high quality partners, the European investors, high-quality investor and organization. We would look in the future, in the right situation for deploying capital together again. So, one-off situation, but there's a lot of capital out there, as you all know, chasing these assets. And so, there are more opportunities with different rationales to partner with third parties. But we like our cost of capital right now. So that's not our first option, our first choice for deploying capital.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Well, I don't normally offer congrats on costs. But those were good JV transactions, so congratulation.
John Thomas: Actually, we will present.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. That's all I have. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thanks. On your shift to focus more investments on off-campus, I just wanted to clarify, are these going to be more off-campus affiliated with hospital systems? And the second part of that is the shift is this mostly due to pricing? I know you're seeing the cap rate differential between on and off-campus, widening over the last few months?
John Thomas: Yeah, John, I wouldn't just drive it as a shift, as much as it is. We've always had a kind of a bias towards the Off campus, but anchored by a health system and/or large physician group and the multi-specialty or fourth big group being the -- the best example across our portfolio. But, I wouldn't call it a shift as much as it is. We're comfortable kind of concentrating our efforts there. We think the pricing and the returns are better and should be better on the off-campus buildings. And again, not to the exclusion of good on-campus buildings we find from time-to-time.
John Kim: Can you break out your composition of your acquisition guidance as far as -- I think you gave development already, but on-campus versus off and versus the ropers?
John Thomas: We don't think about it that way. But again, I'd say 60/40 off to on and it could be, 80-20 or 95 on top of that, but we don't think about it like that. Right now in our current pipeline, near-term pipeline it's almost all off-campus. So we'll see, how the year plays out.
John Kim: Okay. And final question is can you remind us how you characterize adjacent to campus assets? Is that in your off-campus or on?
John Thomas: Yeah. So it's -- for us on-campus is -- we follow the 250-yard rule just keep it simple. And that again has a reimbursement differential. So it's a good way to -- good rule of thumb to follow and be consistent. So something outside of 250 yards, but across the street would be adjacent.
John Kim: Okay, thank you.
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks, John.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to John Thomas, for closing comments.
John Thomas: Yeah. We appreciate your interest this morning. We think 2019 was a great year. And we think 2020 is really setting up well to be an outstanding year of growth and healthy portfolio for us. So we look forward to seeing you at the various investor conferences in the near-term and happy to follow-up. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines, at this time. And we thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-06 11:00:00) =====

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Along with Brad Page, I'm here with Jeff Theiler, our Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, our Chief Investment Officer; and Mark Theine, our Executive Vice President for Asset Management. We lost a true icon in our business recently. David Emery was a good friend, actually a landlord in my prior life and in many ways a mentor. I will miss him, and we just want our friends in Nashville and his family to know we are thinking of them. We would like to begin this discussion by telling you how much we appreciate our clients, our team and investors. This quarter proved once again the superior nature of medical office facilities, and DOC is positioned better than ever to source opportunities for investment through our vast network of clients and relationships, and we are ready to grow and grow smartly. Our clients include the largest healthcare organizations in the United States and many of the leading physicians and physician organizations in their specialty. Our team includes the many professionals that recently voted Physicians Realty Trust The Best Place to Work in Milwaukee for the fourth year in a row. Our team also includes many professionals dedicated to our mission and values, along with our facility management partners and developers, as well as bankers, capital markets professionals, real estate brokers, and yes, even lawyers who help us serve our clients every day to provide high-quality care and access to care in outpatient healthcare facilities, many of which are recognized as the newest and best facilities of their kind in the United States. We are only six years old, but on four facilitates, they were the National Development of the Year for the year they were built. Our team also includes those who went before us who helped build our company from scratch, especially our founder, John Sweet. Our investors include many of the largest asset managers in the world, as well as dedicated REIT investors and more and more generalists. Our investors include many of you, who represent and devise our primary investors. We appreciate your participation in this call today to commit the time and effort to evaluate our performance, our financial reporting, our veracity and transparency, on behalf of investors who have entrusted us with billions of dollars. We wouldn't be here without you. We wouldn't be successful for our investors without you. Thank you. The third quarter of 2019 went as expected. Some might suggest we exceeded expectations, but not mine. We have high expectations of ourselves and we work hard every day for our clients, our team and our investors. We believe that hard work and the care we show to our clients is one of the primary reasons why when providers have a choice, they choose DOC to own, manage and grow their outpatient care medical office facilities.  Our best-in-class operating platform performed remarkably well this quarter. Our best-in-class business development team delivered creative, accretive and long-term investments for us with existing and new investment grade providers, who deliver high-quality care in their communities every day. Finally, our leadership enhanced and strengthened our already strong balance sheet. We are better positioned for growth today than ever before and we have every opportunity to accelerate our growth going forward.  We began this past quarter with one operator reorganizing, one operator transitioning to a new operating platform, one operator partnering with a superior operating platform, and one health system selling its assets to a university health system. All these efforts have been completed and DOC helped facilitate all of them in a proactive and active way to help make their providers better and better positioned to care for their patients, all while protecting and benefiting our investors.  Jeff will talk about the financial impact of these transitions in a few minutes, but the bottom line is our LifeCare LTAC facilities have a new operator who valued our facilities and our leases so much as we do, and assumed our leases as-is. United Surgical Partners, the owner of more than 300 surgery centers and surgical hospitals in the United States, with our assistance and encouragement, became majority owner of the Foundation San Antonio Surgical Hospital along with outstanding physicians in that community, and that tenant signed a new, 10-year lease with DOC. We have sold the Foundation El Paso Surgical Hospital. Lastly, at the request of CommonSpirit, our largest national client and the largest health system in the United States, we helped them facilitate the sale of their Louisville hospitals to the University of Louisville Health, preserving and enhancing those incredibly important providers in that community who are actively engaged in the medical education of our future providers, as well as research and high-quality medical care. We welcome the University of Louisville Health, who has assumed all of our Louisville KentuckyOne leases, and we look forward to growing our relationship with its outstanding university system and community.  As I've mentioned, we are well poised for growth. I've asked Deeni to provide an update on our pipeline and aptitude for growth. We continue to see and execute on high-quality, off-market transactions. During this past quarter, Deeni and Josh Richmond completed one of the most complex transactions we've made, adding John Muir Health System in Walnut Creek, California to the DOC family. Deeni will share more about that transaction, as well as our development and acquisition pipelines; Jeff Theiler will share our financial results and an update on our very strong balance sheet; and Mark Theine will then share our third quarter operating performance, including the results of our client satisfaction surveys.  The DOC team continues to outperform in customer service, leasing and capital maintenance of our facilities, with a growing focus on sustainability and the environment. This quarter, we experienced an earthquake, floods, hurricanes, and our facilities and response teams all performed well with minimal interruption to service. Deeni?
Deeni Taylor: Thanks, John. As you noted, we've been working on a unique acquisition, and during third quarter, we completed the transaction, which represents our continued ability to develop positive hospital relationships and source off-market opportunities. Approximately a year ago, we began working with a seller of five medical office buildings, totaling 93,000 square feet, that are 100% leased. These MOBs are across the street from John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek, California, part of the East Bay area of San Francisco. Most of the tenants are independent physician practices in these buildings. For this transaction, the seller wanted to partially receive DOC OPU units along with cash at closing. We were able to purchase the MOBs for $34.6 million with about 50% funded with our OPU units. The first-year unlevered yield on this good investment is 6.1%. Also due to the strategic location of these buildings across the street from the hospital, the hospital wanted to work with DOC on the future tenancy of the medical space. At closing, John Muir Hospital, which is a Moody's A-1 credit health facility, executed a 10-year absolute net master lease for all 93,000 square feet with 2.5% annual increases. Ultimately, we were able to acquire five medical office buildings off market at a very attractive price, and develop a long-term, new relationship with a hospital in California, which adds another state to DOC's map. For the remainder of 2019 and into 2020, our pipeline for acquisitions and new developments is strong. We are close to finalizing contracts for more than $50 million in new acquisitions in 2019, and are excited about the new relationships these transactions will have with investment grade health systems. All of these acquisitions are contingent upon typical closing conditions. As we look back on transactions we have closed in 2019 and those we are finalizing, the vast majority are off market. We believe the pipeline for 2020 will continue to be strong as DOC excels in our relationships with physicians, health systems and sellers of medical office assets.  I'll turn it now to Jeff.
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, Deeni. In the third quarter of 2019, the company generated funds from operations of $51.2 million or $0.27 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $51.2 million and $0.27 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $47.7 million or $0.25 per share. DOC showed strong earnings growth this quarter, and resolved the situations that were distracting from the strong performance of our core MOB business, starting with the LifeCare bankruptcy resolution. Our conviction that the strong cash flows from our three LTACs, which were generating around 3x EBITDAR coverage, would insulate us from the negative impacts of the LifeCare corporate bankruptcy was proven correct. Our new operator assumed control of the assets on September 30 on the same lease we had in place with absolutely no modifications. In addition, the operator is saving us economic damages incurred during the bankruptcy process, including legal and late fees, in monthly installments over the next year. We booked at $1.1 million of back rent and fees this quarter, which reverses out all previous charges taken. Our new tenant has an excellent long-term track record in this industry and clean balance sheet, so we expect strong performance going forward. Once there is some operating history, we will begin to report EBITDAR coverages again in the supplement. For our El Paso Surgical Hospital previously affiliated with Foundation Health Care, we have closed on a sales agreement with the doctors in the facility for $32 million. As a requirement for this sale, we collected $2 million of back rent, which will be booked as revenue in the fourth quarter. The $32 million sale price consists of $4.4 million of cash from the buyer with DOC providing seller financing for the remainder under a loan not to exceed 24 months, yielding about 12% per year with fees and interest. This loan is secured by the property and guarantees from the operating entity.  Finally, the other material item on the credit watch list was the San Antonio Surgical Hospital that was also previously run by Foundation. This outfit is now leased to a newly formed JV, comprised of the existing doctors and USDI at rental rates that are nearly identical to the old lease. The team put in a lot of work to get successful resolutions on these minor issues, and we are excited to focus again on the strong prospects that we see for the company going forward. Along those lines, based on successful resolutions of the Foundation of LifeCare assets, we no longer see any materials dispositions happening in the near term, nor do we have any material redevelopment plans for any assets going forward. Our expectation is therefore a return to growth, and we assume the pipeline swell, as Deeni just discussed. So the opportunity in front of us looks promising. Year-to-date, we have completed $257 million of investments and development commitments. We remain on track to meet our guidance of $200 million to $400 million in 2019 and look to exceed that in 2020, assuming similar capital market conditions to the ones we are in today. Overall cap rates on these acquisitions will likely range from the mid-5% range to the low 6% range. We will continue to target relationship deals and the specialized off-campus medical office buildings that we think are fairly priced and most likely to retain value. We are not including any large portfolios in this forecasting estimate, as those tend to attract bidders that will pay prices we think are unlikely to generate adequate returns for our shareholders. Should this competitive dynamic change, our acquisition numbers could be higher.  Our balance sheet remains in great shape, as we are currently levered at 5.6x debt to EBITDA, we issued $52.1 million on the ATM in the quarter at an average price of $17.41, deploying those proceeds into investments that are immediately accretive to our shareholders, while improving the overall quality of the portfolio. We are right in the middle of our target leverage range at this point and see a good opportunity to grow the portfolio with a nice balance of debt and equity. Finally, a quick mention about G&A. We are a little higher this quarter at $8.1 million because of a slight increase in our bonus accrual, but we expect to stay in the target range of $31 million to $33 million for the year, as predicated at the outset of this year. We remain focused on keeping our management costs low. Last year, our G&A growth was abnormally elevated, and while we aren't ready to provide specific 2020 guidance, investors should be expected a minimal increase at most for G&A next year as we focus on levering our cash flow to the benefit of our shareholders.  I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. The third quarter was one of the best operating quarters in the history of the company, as demonstrated by our robust MOB same-store NOI growth, excellent leasing progress, improved tenant credit at several facilities and record-breaking tenant satisfaction survey results. Our better than expected third quarter results represent a further continuation of our focused execution of our relationship-based approach to real estate.  The MOB same-store growth momentum we established in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter with cash NOI growing 3.3% excluding termination fees bringing our year-to-date MOB same-store NOI growth to 3.3% as well. This strong organic NOI growth was driven by a 2.7% increase in base rental revenue from contractual annual rent escalations and improved same-store occupancy to 95.6% from 95.3%. Operating expenses for the same-store portfolio increased 6.4% in the quarter, primarily due to real estate taxes, and were offset by a 9% increase in operating expense recovery, demonstrating the insulated nature of our long-term triple net leases, which generate strong, predictable returns.  A major factor in our ability to drive revenue growth over time is our leasing team's acute focus on tenant retention, in-place contractual rent increases and cash releasing spreads. Currently, the weighted average annual increase for our portfolio is 2.3%, but so far this year, 86% of all lease renewals have contained an average rent increase of 2.5% or greater. For leases commencing this quarter, the average weighted annual increase was 2.7% and our cash releasing spreads were 1.2%. These positive drivers, along with strong tenant retention of 82% and positive 1,200 square feet of net absorption, signal sustainable growth in the years ahead. During the remainder of 2019, just 1% of DOC's portfolio is scheduled to renew with an average rental rate of $23.46 per square foot. And our team has strong leasing momentum in Atlanta, Houston and Phoenix to fill current vacancies. We are also excited to welcome the University of Louisville to DOC's portfolio as our third-largest tenant, and look forward to the opportunity to grow with them in our Louisville medical office building, where we have 35,000 square feet of space available for lease. Although our portfolio is an industry-leading 96% leased, we see areas of opportunity for our exceptional asset management team and leasing teams to collaborate on tenant retention and new leasing to deliver bottom line results. Our asset management team's keen focus on operational excellence and outstanding customer service can also be seen this quarter in the results of our 2019 Kingsley Associates tenant satisfaction survey. This year, we surveyed nearly 450 tenants representing 3.5 million square feet. Physicians Realty Trust received an industry-leading 78% response rate. Typical response rates for these surveys are between 45% and 55%, so 78% demonstrated the exceptional relationship between our asset management team and our healthcare partners. We also earned a company record score in overall management satisfaction of 4.5 out of a possible 5.0, and 92% of tenant surveys gave positive indicators as to their future lease renewal intentions. Thanks to a team effort focused on long-term value creation and growth, we had another solid quarter that validates the quality of our portfolio and our earnings. Looking ahead in 2020, we will continue to grow our integrated management and leasing platform, and are well-positioned to drive operational excellence, consistent same-store growth in our MOB portfolio and support near-term growth through new acquisitions. Our management structure is scalable and will continue to benefit from concentration as we invest in top-quality properties and portfolios in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. We now look forward to your questions. Operator?
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to dig in on Shell Ridge, the cap rate. You offered up the 6.1%. To what extent was that facilitated by the new lease with the health system there? Was there a meaningful uptick in rent versus in place on that renewal?
Jeff Theiler: No. It's a reflection of what we paid for the assets directly. Jordan, that...
Jordan Sadler: It seems like above market.
Jeff Theiler: No. It was -- the lease itself with the hospital was set at local market rates. But the...
Jordan Sadler: No, the cap rates, yes.
Jeff Theiler: I got it. It's a fantastic -- it's very accretive. Right.
Jordan Sadler: And it's just a function of the relationship and structure ultimately you would point to as sort of the driver of that cap rate? 
Jeff Theiler: Exactly. Yes.
Jordan Sadler: And the escalators I think you said were 2?
Jeff Theiler: No, they were 2.5.
Jordan Sadler: 2.5. Okay. I got that wrong. All right. Great. I had a question regarding the disposition outlook. I think, Jeff, you mentioned that you currently no longer expect to have much in terms of additional disposes. Did I get that right? 
Jeff Theiler: Yes. That's right, Jordan. We're really pleased with the resolutions that we've had on many of the assets that we were expecting to sell. So as we sit here and we feel comfortable with the tenants and the credits, we don't think there's a near-term need to sale these assets.
Jordan Sadler: So that basically takes the LTACs off the table in terms of being for sale? Foundation San Antonio off the table? And the non-core MOBs that previously you sort of had teed up?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. That's right, Jordan. And we'd sell them at the right price to the right buyer, but we're not actively looking to sell them at this point. And again, we've got a very small percentage of our medical office buildings that kind of were not long-term keepers. So again, over time we might sell those. But right now, we're not actively looking to do so.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And last one just on the sequential change in NOI looking into 4Q. Jeff, I heard the $1.1 million that was booked in 3Q I think, and then I heard the $2 million related to El Paso I think. 
Jeff Theiler: Yes, that's exactly right, Jordan. Those are -- yes, we'll get the $2 million next quarter and obviously we won't get the $1.1 LTAC payment again in the fourth quarter. 
Jordan Sadler: And those are both GAAP numbers that were booked in the top line?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. It was booked and will be booked, right?
Jordan Sadler: And was there anything else related to life care in terms of a true up or a reversal related to straight line or anything like that? Or is everything else sort of recurring?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, the only other thing that was different between 3Q and 2Q was we got $800,000 of rent, which represented two months of payments, but that will be flat going into the fourth quarter. So there's no other kind of one-time changes going into the fourth quarter. 
Jordan Sadler: But that $800,000 was 2Q's rent that was a catch-up?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, exactly. Right.
Jordan Sadler: So you have to back that out? Is that what you're saying? Or either run rate is fine?
Jeff Theiler: The run rate's as long as you just back out the $1 million payment that we got as catch-up rent.
Jordan Sadler: All right. Thanks, guys. 
Jeff Theiler: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. You did a fair amount of investment activity via loan structure. Can you comment on how big you want this to be as part of your acquisitions going forward?
Jeff Theiler: John, that's a great question. We view loans primarily as a strategic option in our toolbox that just matches with the situation. So kind of think about those like we do development, which is $100 million to $200 million a year of new opportunities, but we're not actively looking for loans as loans. We're looking for medical office facilities to invest in long term. So just a little uptick this quarter because of a unique situation that presented itself and we ultimately hope to turn them into ownership.
John Kim: Jeff mentioned in your prepared remarks no redevelopment plans, and I know that's not a huge part of your business. But is that because you're focused on growing your term FFO or do you not see a lot of redevelopment opportunities in your portfolio?
Jeff Theiler: No. I mean it's the latter. Remember the portfolio is relatively new still, right? And we've acquired a lot of this over the last -- I guess all of it over the last six years or so. So we don't see any buildings that need material rehab or redevelopment. So I just mentioned because some others do.
John Thomas: But John, we're 96% leased so t redevelop stuff, then we got to move people out of a building. And so that's really not in our DNA. But at the same time, we have good strategically located real estate that over time and eventually present redevelopment or enhancement opportunities, and we would expect to do that over time. But it's -- again, at 96% leased, we got to find places to move people to redevelop them.
John Kim: Okay. And then my final question is on your lease expirations next year. It's a modest amount and the expiring base rate is about 5% below the rest of your portfolio. Can you give an estimate as to what the mark to market will be next year on releasing of those assets?
Mark Theine: Yes. Sure, John. This is Mark Theine. So as you mentioned, next year we got 3.1% of the portfolio rolling, so very low turnover in our portfolio. It's about $21.44 per square foot, so as you mentioned, 5% below kind of this year. It certainly will be market dependent, but our leasing team has done a great job pushing rents where we can on our leasing spreads and getting higher contractual escalators. So far this year, as I mentioned, 86% of our leases have 2.5% escalators or more. So hopefully we can continue to push rents and we'll work hard to do that in 2020.
John Kim: Is 5% a good estimate for the mark to market?
Mark Theine: It's certainly market dependent, but rents will continue to kind of grow up 2% to 3% and in markets where we can, we'll try and push that more. 
John Kim: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Mark Theine: Yep. Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya, Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on Jordan's question again: the four kind of major pieces of transition that were happening with LifeCare, the two Foundation leases, other two Foundation hospitals and also University of Louisville Health. I'm trying to understand a little bit better of what's in 3Q numbers and what's the potential pickup or fall off in 4Q associated with these transitions.
Jeff Theiler: Okay. So I'll just kind of walk through. In terms of cash on LifeCare, you had about a $2 million reversal, which represented getting an extra two months of rent payment plus the $1 million back rent payment that we got. 
Tayo Okusanya: And that was all 3Q?
Jeff Theiler: What's that?
Tayo Okusanya: That was all 3Q, right? That was all in 3Q numbers?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, sorry. That's all in 3Q. Exactly. And then for the Foundation El Paso asset, remember back in 2Q, we took a $2 million charge, but $1 million of that was related to Q1. So you get an extra pickup there. And then they also made a $500,000 rent payment in the quarter. So that was the difference between 3Q and 2Q. And then also remember there's a lot of El Paso assets, but the El Paso Specialty Hospital the tenant had, they started paying rent in 3Q too. So that was just under an extra $1 million there. So those are the adjustments from 3Q to 2Q, and then as you go into 4Q, I talked about it with Jordan, but you're going to get that extra $2 million of payment from the Foundation El Paso sale. And that will be recognized as rental revenue because it's a repayment of back rent.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. So that shows up in the 4Q numbers? Okay. The LifeCare -- although you're booking the $1.1 million of back rent as revenue in 3Q, since you're getting this back kind of as a monthly payment over the next 12 months, how do we kind of think about the 10% interest on that kind of receivable? Is that additional interest income to you guys for the next year as well?
Jeff Theiler: It is, but it's not a huge...
Tayo Okusanya: It's a non-material number?
Jeff Theiler: Yes.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay, got you. Okay, that's helpful from that perspective. Then the cash same-store NOI of 3.3%. Again, that's excellent, brilliant number. When we start thinking about 2020 and the sustainability of that number, even if it's not -- even if 3.3% is kind of unusually high. I think again, how do we think about a world where you're putting up numbers on a sustainable basis similar to your peers of 2.5% to 3%?
John Thomas: Mark, next year in 2020, we continue to anticipate the same-store NOI growth in that 2% to 3% there. Portfolio is doing really well, fully occupied. Most of our same stores can be driven by contractual rental increases. As I mentioned, those are 2.3% in the portfolio today. So where we can execute on some new leasing, hopefully we can bump that up a little bit, but we continue to see it to be pretty stable.
Mark Theine: Okay, that's helpful. Then last one, if you would indulge me. Again, the loan investments -- again, it's just interesting to me that again with the loan investments you're getting 6% type of rates on that. And then when you take a fee simple position it's cap rates of 6.1%. Again, with the loans you are high up in the capital stack but you're getting a similar type of return or yield. Does that influence you thinking about doing more loans versus trying to own things outright in a fee simple structure or not really?
Jeff Theiler: Tyle, it's JT and welcome back. We've missed you. Like I said before the loans -- it's a great question because actually we get better yield than 6% on most of our loans. It's always a strategic tool for us and just matching up to the situation and creativity. So the uptake this quarter was a unique situation where we have the opportunity to provide a loan to purchase of a building that has some lease-up opportunity. And then again, hopefully, we don't have any righter option, but we expect once that building is completely leased, hopefully, have the opportunity to convert that loan into a long term ownership position. So again we do it in the same bucket as we do development. So $100 million to $200 million of loans that are high up in capital's deck, higher-yielding and certainly have the opportunity to do more if the right situations present themselves, but it's not something we actively go looking for.
Mark Theine: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Vikram Malhotra, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. So just maybe bigger picture you talked about, no more need for disposition. So arguably, you're now back in a net acquisition net growth mode. So I'm just looking for some guideposts and a sense of the strategy going forward. Last 3 years, you consciously made an effort to move up the quality spectrum. So looking for types of assets, markets maybe give the range of cap rates that you're focused on. And do you still intend -- is the goal to continue to improve or are you happy with the portfolio here?
John Thomas: Hey, Vikram, thanks for the questions. I think the smart goal going forward is continuing to focus on high-quality health system anchored facilities. We've always liked off-campus and we continue to see those as probably the better value options while getting the same kind of credit quality and new construction for the long term that we're looking for. But again, whatever our relationships present themselves, whether they're on-campus or off-campus but I think we're not going to -- we're going to continue the growth of the quality scale, but also just pure growth with the health system relationships. Substantially all of our investments this year in our near term pipeline are relationship off-market opportunities, so that usually presents a better cap rate and a better yield. Then those off-campus opportunities continue to bring better yields than on-campus. So that'll be our focus going forward. The dispositions it'll be more strategic and again, from time to time, nothing is needed but just as we have the opportunity to prove the portfolio and prune we'll prune but no real plans this year.
Vikram Malhotra: Is mid-5 to 6 a good place -- a good number in terms of what cap rates you would be targeting yield?
John Thomas: Yes, in this market I think this [indiscernible].
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, that's helpful. And then just second, some of your peers have partnerships with some of the health systems from a developing perspective, some have been focused on larger portfolios. So there are two questions. One, if you can talk about how you're thinking about partnerships with health systems that over time may lead to a more steady external growth. And then second, if you can just give us a sense of any big portfolios out there in the market.
John Thomas: We need all of our health system clients in relationship to these partners, we have repeat business with virtually all of our top 20 tenant relationships. I think we're in 12 different markets with Common Spirit, the largest health system in the country and continue to have opportunities for new development and acquisitions with them from time to time. So I think all of our health systems like to do repeat business with us. As Mark commented on our customer service satisfaction surveys the return rate in that itself is a reflection of Mark's team and how much attention to detail, how much attention we pay to those relationships and taking care of them. So those are retained and those partnerships come in all kinds of forms. The big portfolios. There's been several portfolios out there trading and it seems or appears, at least as we can tell this, in there's one buyer, in particular, that's buying the portfolios and outbidding everybody for those portfolios, which is fine. We continue to have smart growth, one building at a time.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Babin, Robert W. Baird and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Babin: Good morning. Question on the term loan investment at the Fort Worth MOB building, can you talk at all about anchor-tenant expectations with that building. At least generally how confident you are that that stage will be at least substantially full relatively soon and the extent those tenants are rated, actually that'll be helpful as well. Hoping you give a little color on that.
John Thomas: Great question, Drew. It is substantially leased to two investment great tenants today within 250 yards of a major health system that's an existing tenant relationship. So it's an outstanding building. Like I said, the unique set of circumstances where we provided a loan to the owner of that building and in the long term we have no rights to it but in the long term we hope to have an ownership position in the building.
Andrew Babin: Appreciate that color there. And just one more for me on the foundation, El Paso property sale. Obviously that was pretty more of financing the buyer getting this from you. What confidence do you have? Obviously you have confidence, but is there anything you can speak to in terms of their ability to make you whole on that payment with interest over time? Can you comment on their resources to do that and how comfortable you are there?
John Thomas: That's a great question. Obviously, we'd like to have them find third party financing, but they're part of the ownership of the -- in the majority ownership of both the OpCo and the PropCo. It's a private equity-backed new organization with a couple of other facilities I think in Texas exclusively, but looking to grow so we have every expectation of them paying which certainly have incentives aligned and incentivize them to find third party financing sooner than later. So we have every expectation of that, in the meantime, we get a very large payment upfront plus the background. So we think the future is bright there. The physicians that -- we have a relationship with their -- are very excited about this new partner that they brought in and managed and management is all going well.
Andrew Babin: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chad Vanacore, Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Todd Shaw: Hi, good morning. This is Todd Shaw up for Chad. So my first question is a follow up on the El Paso sale. So you provided seller financing on the transaction, is it your expectation that the buyer will pay off the loan in the next year or so?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, this is Jeff. Because of the interest rates and fees associated with it, we're certainly trying to incentivize the buyer to pay up the loan earlier rather than later. Generally, it's going to take about a year of history to get seller financing -- to get additional financing to pay off the seller financing. Sometime between one and two years is when we would expect that loan to be paid up.
Todd Shaw: My second question is on the same store pool. Is [indiscernible] El Paso in there this quarter? If so, what is impact?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. The same-store number is our MOD portfolio, which in that portfolio is about 91% of our square feet and 86% of our NOI. What we break out separately is the hospital in L-tex. If we included those as the full portfolio our same-store would have been 4.9% for the quarter. So outstanding results year-over-year there.
Todd Shaw: Because you did 1.6% in the first quarter, 3.5% in the second quarter, 3.3% in the third quarter. So obviously you're trending towards the high end of the 2% to 3% range. Where do you think you end up for the full year? And I think I heard you mention that you maintained 2% to 3% range for next year. And given the strong like contractual rent increase you just mentioned, do you expect a flat slightly improving occupancy for next year?
John Thomas: I think the results have been higher for the year. The 3.3% is a direct result of the great team, our leasing team has done to fill some of the vacancies and they've got improved occupancy in the same-store portfolio and then again, continue to push annual rent escalators. So full year -- year-to-date we're at 3.3%. Hopefully, we're going to be at the top end of that 3% for the full year and next year, we'll continue to see stable growth in the 2% to 3% range.
Todd Shaw: Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph, Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. How large was the buyer pool for the foundation El Paso assets? And in your bid did it require seller financing?
Jeff Theiler: I'm sorry. You said how large was the buyer pool? Is that what you asked?
Nick Joseph: Yes. How many bids did you get on the foundation El Paso asset? I'm wondering if any or how many of those bids did not require seller financing?
John Thomas: It was not actively marketed in a process. The physicians until they brought in this new management company a new equity into the partnership. The physicians owned 80-plus percent of the facility and so we've been working with the physicians both to identify and frankly recruit in and bring in additional capital but more importantly management into the OpCo. We're working with them at the same time to facilitate a real estate transaction again to get all the incentives aligned economically between the OpCo and the PropCo and then ultimately for us to move it out. We're talking about the buyer pool. The buyer pool was the physicians in helping them identify a capital partner. Again, both have better operate, manage and growth of the OpCo of the provider but at the same time the opportunities to align incentives and buy the PropCo. So again if it weren't the same buyer coming into both the OpCo and the PropCo bank financing would probably have been easier to finance and identify on the sale to us, but at the same time the facilities have stabilized and operating better than ever. We had other buyers for -- potential buyers to come in and buy both the OpCo and PropCo but, again, the physicians that were there worked hard to pay rent and were on and still are on financial guarantees to us so we're just going to work through that situation. We think it's a great result and like you said, as Jeff mentioned, they have every incentive to get bank financing as soon as they can. In the meantime, we got a very large cash payment upfront to secure our position.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then you talked about the competitive acquisition environment, how different is the level of competition on the loans?
John Thomas: It's been a great question on the loans. For us is not something we're out there actively shopping for so it's just a matter of the off-market relationship nature of our business and strategy. From time to time, we come across opportunities where -- for various circumstances just a pure fee ownership or acquisition then match up the particular situation and we get creative and do alone. So I can't answer the question about what the market size and breadth and opportunity is, which again, is just one of those capital tools in our toolbox to make good creative investments. Again, ultimately, our goal is to own the buildings we have loans on other than foundation of asset which was a sale. But those are -- if we can get a better return on an asset that we traded a low 5% cap rate and we can get a 6% or better return in a secure position. Now, that's not bad option.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Carroll, RBC Capital markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Thanks. And I jumped on late. So sorry if someone already asked this, but have you guys talked about the credit behind the loan on the El Paso sale? Do you have any credit enhancements like personal guarantees or anything like that?
John Thomas: Yes. Mike, those primary were secured by the property of course, right, which is the biggest security. Also guarantees of the operating entity. But really we're getting $7 million in [indiscernible] and equity upfront. We still have a lien on the property so we feel pretty good about the security of that loan.
Jeff Theiler: The physicians have guarantees behind the OpCo lease, again, which the new PropCo owner benefits from. But ultimately we have clarity through to that. And they've invested new capital into the outcasts. It's a much -- a very stabilized situation. Again, we got a lot of security.
Michael Carroll: Then can you update us on what is the actual disposition plan going forward? And I know a few quarters ago, you're talking about how you want it to have an ongoing capital recycling initiative solving the bottom part of your portfolio year-to-year. Do you still plan on pursuing that?
John Thomas: Great question, Mike. Given the near term, we don't have any need to sell anything. We always actively evaluate opportunities for pruning the portfolio. We just don't need to so if we currently sit here, we don't have any plans to sell anything. Again, the all tax and the lower 2%, 1% of the portfolio again, in time we will sell but no near term current plans to resell but we still actively manage and prune the portfolio as they present themselves.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then just last for me and can you talk a little bit about the new health system that's coming into the San Antonio asset? I guess who is the health system? Did they -- I'm assuming that they -- you got a new lease with them. I think you highlighted earlier and the type of credit behind that least now.
John Thomas: Yes, it's United Surgical Partners, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenant Healthcare, which has other hospitals in that market. So great management, great to capital base. They own 300-plus facilities around the United States through great management. They've been in there working with the physicians for over a year and helping to improve just the management operations of that and then ultimately had the opportunity to invest on a majority interest in that facility. So we expect nothing but great things from them. So we signed a new 10-year lease with Identity with the United Surgical Partners as a majority owner.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Daniel Bernstein, Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: Most everything's been answered. I do have a question on KentuckyOne. Is there any CapEx needs in those assets that you might be able to fund?
John Thomas: Dan, great question. When we bought the original portfolio from CHI we spent or we budgeted about $32 million in CapEx for all across the markets. About a year later they decided they were kind of actively look for a new owner for the KentuckyOne asset in Louisville. While we have maintained them, we haven't made major investments in there till -- we never knew who the new owner was in stabilization. So we're very excited about the University of Louisville Health taking over and assuming 100% of those leases and now we can actively manage the bank with a lease pipeline that has been sitting there just with physicians wanting to move in those buildings but just waiting to see who the new operator is. I think both they and the community and we are excited to have the University of Louisville Health in there. As new opportunities present themselves, we'll invest CapEx in those buildings to maintain them ultimately to potentially redevelopment but right now we have only 3% occupancy and looking to lease up the last 7%.
Daniel Bernstein: I don't know if you discussed it earlier at all but are there any redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio?
John Thomas: Yes. That question was asked. The short answer is yes, the long answer is we're 96% occupied, so to redevelop any of our buildings we have to move people out of the building. We have to do that strategically but more importantly, we will do that in a nice relationship way with the health systems to improve buildings to meet their strategic needs. The short answer is we really don't have any redevelopment opportunities or needs but at the same time we'll actively manage those buildings so the health systems can meet their outpatient and off-campus needs from downtown.
Daniel Bernstein: Are you seeing any more requests or discussion about that? In other words, nothing imminent, but maybe you're seeing a pickup in the discussion from hospital systems wanting to redevelop obsolete assets or reposition obsolete assets for more outpatient or something like that?
John Thomas: That's great question. So I would say we haven't bought any obsolete asset but at the same time, some of the older building are [indiscernible] systems. I would say we're bringing them as many ideas as they're coming to us with request probably more. We have some specific situations. We have a couple of hospitals that are in opportunity zones, and so we've had opportunity zone investors talking to us about working together to try to redevelop or take advantage of vacant land near hospitals for various development opportunities. So it's a very active discussion, great question, we just don't have any near term specific building identified to redevelop.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay, that's all I have. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-answer session and I will now turn the floor back over to John Thomas for closing remarks.
John Thomas: Thank you again for joining us today. As I hope you can tell, we're excited about the quarter and the future and great options for growth going forward. We just look forward to seeing all of you in a week and thanks for joining us today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

John Thomas: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. We at Physicians Royalty Trust celebrated the sixth anniversary of our initial public offering on July 19th. We appreciate all of you have been with us from the beginning and those who joined our mission along the way. We invest in -- this past quarter's results from operations reflects our original commitment to you our stakeholders, clients, and team and the results we can achieve when we follow that simple philosophy. We started this company with a focus on the future of healthcare and the evidence is clear and compelling. More and more of the healthcare dollar in the U.S. is being spent on carrying outpatient medical office setting every day. By investing in medical office buildings, particularly those affiliated with market-leading health systems and providers by providing high levels of customer service and attention to detail and by providing a caring approach to everything we do, we delivered 3.5% same-store NOI growth this past quarter across all of our medical office facilities. We just completed our annual customer satisfaction survey and our results across the board are outstanding. Mark Theine and his team are delivering every day working hard to exceed our client expectations. Health systems has the choice to choose their landlord time and time again, Physicians Realty Trust rises us to the top of thire choice. We will continue our relentless effort on growing our already best-in-class medical office portfolio anchored by healthcare systems and providers that are focused on the future not the path of healthcare delivery. The features in the outpatient setting conveniently located for providers, patients, their loved ones, and the services and the technology they need to be helpful. Our strategic mission has been to utilize our long-term relationships with industry-leading health systems to grow and manage what we sincerely and objectively believe is the best portfolio of medical office properties in the United States. We continue to be medical offices, the most resilient class of real estate in the market. In our portfolio of MOBs representing 95% of all of our real estate assets, delivered outstanding results during the quarter. Since our last report, we've also made strategic investments to continue our return to growth in high-quality accretive assets. Consistent with our strategy, we are excited about the expansion of our existing relationships with Ascension, Community Health Network in Indianapolis, Texas Health Resources and U.S. Oncology through our recent investments. We anticipate more opportunities with each of these leading healthcare organizations. But we understand that we have to earn that business every day. That is the DOC Way. Our pipeline is also strong in expenses. We are under contract or close to finalizing contracts of more than $75 million of new investments and look forward to sharing more about these facilities in the associated health systems upon completion of these acquisitions. All the acquisitions are continued upon typical closing conditions. But if closed we will be adding new investment-grade health systems, another state to our map, and new opportunities for repeat business with health care providers you will know and appreciate heading in our portfolio. We're also under our letter of intent or active discussion with a number of other owners and health systems for both monetization and development opportunities and we are humbled by our existing health system relationships that Physicians serve as references for us with these opportunities. Business like life has challenges and one of our influence successful thought leaders successful by every possible measure counsel you not to be defined by our challenges, but to own our challenges, address them, but more importantly, be defined by our success. Our successes far outweigh our challenges and the ratio is not even close. We own our challenges and no one we believe is better than solving them then we are. Our relationships and knowledge of healthcare and engagement with providers, we believe gives us every opportunity to own and address challenges in our portfolio better than anyone. No one has more sense of urgency than we do, and when I'll be really a healthcare provider has an issue with their business. In this context, we are committed to transparency and integrity. Despite encouraging events with respect to each of LifeCare and Foundation El Paso, we determined it was appropriate to elect a conservative application of the recently adopted accounting standard ASC 842 to reduce cash and non-cash straight-line revenues for the quarter as a result of the Chapter 11 reorganization filing by LifeCare and 2019 challenges at the Foundation El Paso Hospital. LifeCare reorganization process is coming to conclusion with a new owner for our tenant which has agreed to assume our master lease as is, and we are negotiating the terms of the sale of the Foundation El Paso Hospital as well. We're not quite to the Goldline there. But we do have other options, if necessary. All four facilities remain open and serving their communities and they know our hearts and prayers are with the people of El Paso. Looking forward, we continue to believe, we will have a very good opportunity to invest $200 million to $400 million of new investments in 2019. For the portion of these investments being new development starts that will have rent commencing in 2020. The DOC story is consistent growth and better and better providers and their affiliated medical office locations. Our assets are 96% occupied. Our stability in our MOB is in our opportunity for relationship driven growth, we believe is second to none. We own our challenges, but more importantly, we do celebrate our success. Quarter two 2019 was very successful and our future is bright. Jeff will now share our quarter two 2019 financial highlights. And we look forward to your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2019, the company generated funds from operations of $40.0 million, or $0.21 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $40.0 million, or $0.21 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution for $42.1 million, or $0.22 per share in line with the previous quarter. I'll spend a little more time than usual discussing these earnings because of the impact of the relatively new accounting guidance contained in ASC 842, which we adopted at the beginning of the year. Under these guidelines straight-line rent receivables must be written off in their entirety unless the lessor has a high degree of confidence that they will collect substantially all of the rent over the remaining term of the lease. With our LifeCare tenant in a bankruptcy process which by definition introduces some degree of uncertainty. We couldn't be confident that we will collect substantially all future rent. Despite the fact of the cash flow generated by our facilities make them highly profitable under the current lease structure. Therefore, we wrote off $3.5 million of straight-line rent receivables reducing FFO by $1.08 per share. Most recent update on the LifeCare bankruptcy process is that yesterday the stalking-horse bidder won the auctions and in terms to honor our leases without modification. However, consolidated sale process actually closes, which is projected to be near the end of the year. We will only recognize the cash rent that we have been collecting steadily since June 1. After the closing, we will likely re-recognize the straight-line rent receivable as revenue. Similarly, we have been negotiating a sales agreement with the Physician Group that has been delinquent on their rent at the El Paso Hospital, previously run by Foundation Healthcare. This agreement would require as a condition of the sale of the tenant repay the six-month past due rent before we close. However, because of the length of the delinquency in rental payments under the new guidance, we decided we couldn't be certain that the deal would close and that we would collect substantially all of the rent so we elected to write it off. Should the deal closes as planned we would then recapture the six months of rental revenue and the straight-line rents receivable would be netted out as a gain on sale. We are in agreement with our auditors on the above treatments, and we believe we are in compliance with ASC 842. However, as seen in this quarter, the new standard can greatly increase the volatility of earnings results on a temporary basis. This is all a brave new world of accounting. So I'm happy to answer any additional questions on this after the prepared remarks. Moving along to investments, we completed $57 million of acquisitions and new development commitments in the quarter and closed on another $47 million of investments subsequent to quarter end. This brings our year-to-date investment activity to $139 million. Looking at the acquisition pipeline, which is weighted toward the back half of the year, we feel comfortable that we can meet the guidance we laid out of $200 million to $400 million of investments assuming favorable capital market conditions. On the disposition side, we sold two smaller non-core assets for a total disposition price of $12.5 million, which was a 6.4% cap rate. These assets generated a gain on sale of $3 million, and an unlevered IRR of 12%. We've made some adjustments to our same-store disclosure to segregate out the entirety of our LTACH Hospital assets in order to focus on MOBs which account for 97% of the NOI this quarter. This also service separate out the volatility associated with the accounting adjustments previously mentioned that will occur over the next several quarters. The MOB same-store pool through cash NOI at 3.5% year-over-year, notably this is inclusive of every single MOB asset we have own during the time frame as we have no assets in our repositioning bucket. We've also removed the slated for disposition categorization. We still intend to sell those assets as demonstrated by the El Paso purchasing sale agreement we are negotiating, but because of the uncertainty over how quickly we can find the best value for these assets, we will now reserve that categorization solely for asset that can be designated as held for sale from an accounting standpoint. Our overall portfolio continues to perform well. It was 96% leased at the end of the quarter with 53% of that space tenanted by investment grade health systems and their subsidiaries. We utilize the ATM in the first two weeks of April to provide capital for our acquisitions raising $17.9 million of net proceeds at an average price of $18.66. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is 6.5 times. But normalized for the accounting write-offs would be 5.7 times. Net debt to gross assets was 33%. Finally, as predicted on the last earnings call, our G&A's move down from the seasonal peak in the first quarter and is consistent with our guidance for the year of $31 million to $33 million. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. The first half of 2019 has been active and productive in managing our portfolio. Our team remains dedicated to superior customer service, the retention and recruitment of high-quality professionals and operating efficiencies to benefit both our healthcare partners and our shareholders. Beyond the 3.5% MOB portfolio of same-store NOI growth that John and Jeff mentioned, three key highlights in the second quarter include improved portfolio occupancy to 96% from 95.4% as a result of 75,000 square feet of net absorption driven by the commencement of the lease of the El Paso Specialty Hospital. Two, continued expansion and profitability of our best-in-class property management platform, where we now manage directly 56% of our medical office buildings, representing 55% of our NOI. And three, well managed CapEx investments totaling a mirror 6.4% of cash NOI delivering enhanced cash flow to FAD. As we enter the second half of 2019, DOC's portfolio is an industry-leading 96% occupied including 53% leased directly to investment grade tenants, which we believe is more than any other publicly traded portfolio in healthcare real estate. High portfolio occupancy not only provides our shareholders with reliable cash flow and strong earnings growth potential, but also benefits the healthcare system and provide our clients who trust us with their facilities. Even further, DOC's extensive healthcare relationships cement our ability to attract and lease space to complementary physicians helping our partners to achieve their clinical and business goals all while increasing access to quality care for everyone. In Q2, 2019, our leasing team completed 242,000 square feet of leasing activity including 127,000 square feet of lease renewals. Total retention was 76%, while our leasing spreads were positive 1.8%. Approximately 93% of our lease renewals this quarter contained in average annual rent escalator of 2.5% or greater as we continue to build our internal organic growth strategy. During the remainder of 2019, just 1.5% of DOC's portfolio is scheduled to renew with an average rental rate of $23.94 per square foot and our team has strong leasing momentum in Atlanta, Houston and Phoenix to fill current vacancies. Consistent with our plans announced earlier this year, we continue to expand our in-house property management platform. Over the past 12 months, we have transitioned property management services at 31 facilities totaling nearly two million square feet in Kentucky, Ohio and most recently Nebraska, Washington State and the Dallas Texas market. During Q3, 2019, we anticipate completing the in-house management transition of the Houston Texas market, which includes four facilities totaling nearly 293,000 square feet. As a result of this growth, we are proud to welcome to the DOC family, Jessie Ramsey, Lesley Taylor, Scott Hedrick, Teri Smith and Jennie Dominic [ph]. All are impressive individuals tasked with delivering the DOC difference every day, which is the outstanding customer service and diligent care healthcare providers expect from DOC. In the six years, since our IPO, which again we celebrated on July 19th, we've not only built one of the best healthcare real estate portfolios in the country. But we've also assembled the best healthcare real estate team. Going forward, we expect continued success from our asset and property management platform resulting in enhanced local market knowledge, repeat investment opportunities with existing partners, profitable operating efficiencies and continued tenant retention. During the second quarter, our construction and project management team also generated outstanding shareholder value by prioritizing capital in second generations and an improvements and facility upgrades totaling $4.3 million or just 6.4% of the portfolio's NOI. This conservative approach to CapEx investment compares favorably to our peers and is driven by our well diversified lease expiration schedule, tenant relationships and the desirability of our medical office portfolio. Rent concessions in the second quarter remained low with TI allowances and leasing concessions of approximately $1.72 per square foot per year for lease renewals and $3.09 per square foot per year for new leases. Lastly as announced in July, we would like to congratulate Mark Dukes, DOC's VP of Asset Management on his election as Vice-Chair of the Building Owners and Managers Association, also known as BOMA International. Mark will serve as an officer for four years, ultimately becoming the organization's, Chairman in 2021.  BOMA is a recognized leader in educating and an informing commercial real estate owners, managers and advocates at the federal and local levels. We are proud of Mark's achievements as a real estate professional and excited for the exposure that this position will generate for Physicians Realty Trust and the Medical Office sector in general. Together with all of the DOC members of the team, we have created an incredible culture of excellence and outstanding portfolio and a successful strategies to maximize long-term per share cash flow returns to our shareholders. With that I'll turn the call back to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. I'm pleased to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Good morning. Wanted to touch base on the pipeline, so I think you're running a little bit behind pace may be relative to sort of the midpoint of guidance not much, but kind of curious, how you think things will shape up in the back half of this year relative to what you're seeing? And maybe you could sort of provide some color around what the activity in the marketplace looks like?
John Thomas: Yes, Jordan, thanks a lot. This is John. The market -- there's a lot of -- there's been several portfolios floating around the market. There has been pretty steady supply of on market opportunities. We really focused primarily on our off market in relationship opportunities and hopefully directly -- working directly with healthcare providers. So the -- as I mentioned in my comments, we've got some exciting assets under contract. As I said we're going to add a new state and a new health system that investment grade and we're very excited about that. We think we'll have some repeat business opportunities with and feel very confident about at least the midpoint of the guidance if not more. We're also finalist in a couple of development RFPs working with some best-in-class developers with those health systems. We feel very good about it. 
Jordan Sadler: Can you elaborate a little bit on the stuff that's under contract in terms of maybe sizing cap rate quality of the system?
John Thomas: Our system is superior. The assets and the sizing I think is around the $75 million number that I've -- that I mentioned and fully leased. Cap rates are around 6%. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, could you maybe speak to the Ascension development or the Sacred Heart development rather that is taking place in Pensacola. The interest rate upfront looks a little bit on the lower side, relative to what we'd expect for sort of a development loan. Could you maybe just speak to the mechanics and sort of -- is that a 4.75% funding for the entire facility or how does this work? 
John Thomas: Yeah, it's pretty simple Jordan. It's a 100% pre-leased building with Ascension or Sacred Heart which is part of the Ascension Health System. So Randy building the local developer group, it was pretty close near ready to start construction. Deeni has spent some time with them and really just kind of replace the capital structure that they were looking at. And the I guess perhaps during the construction cycle, it's a little low. But the back-end yield there's a pricing we'll realize early 2020 or midpoint of 2020. So we're going to get very attractive yield on that investment beginning of 2020. The option to acquire is really the structure, but it's our intention to complete the funding of construction loan and then complete the acquisition on the back-end and see just one way to mitigate the risk which we think is no longer on construction. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay. But you have a fixed price purchase option at this point?
John Thomas: That's right. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then I guess just quickly on LifeCare and Foundation El Paso. Can you maybe speak to the prospects on those sales? I think you're looking to potentially get rid of LifeCare assets once that's all settled. I just curious, if you sort of taken those to market or if you've gotten any feel yet and then same thing on Foundation?
John Thomas: Yeah. So LifeCare is again the bankruptcy process is coming to conclusion. The stalking horse two different stalking horse bidders were identified during the process which is moved pretty quickly. The bankruptcy filing with after our last earnings call and looks like it evolved pretty quickly after this one. The stalking horse bids were finalized yesterday and the winning bidder for our three assets are we've been in discussions with. I understand their operating plan, our assets, particularly our Plano facility is still generating very high cash flow and then the bidders by all accounts pretty excited to have the opportunity to buy them and assume our master lease as is. Again to continue to see is it's still finalizing the bankruptcy court process and then moving toward closing. So, buyers done all their due diligence, they would close very quickly to be conservative, we're assuming the end of the year, but hopefully, it's sooner than that. So, a little bit outside our control but we think it will be a positive result assuming the bankruptcy court process concludes which should. And then the buyer performs on the contract that's in place. On the Foundation, and yes, Jordan….
Jordan Sadler: And then you'd look to sell those assets?
John Thomas: Yeah. We do intend to sell those the stalking horse buyer for -- sort for the OpCo's in our locations is also interested in the real estate and we want to get the bankruptcy court in his closing their closing behind us and then we look forward to this.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
John Thomas: And we will market them as well. Secondly, is the -- on Foundation, and we're very close to a contract with the physician group is there. This kind of long overdue in all candor, but we really do feel we're at the go line in that discussion and moving forward to complete that sale pretty quickly. We do have some others in the background that we'll pivot to if necessary, but we feel pretty confident we'll get that sale completed. But until it's close, it's not closed.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thanks guys.
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kubicek with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Alex Kubicek: Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew. First looking at the construction loans, should we assume the Sacred Heart loan is backed by extensions credit directly or is it more a standalone credit with the Sacred Health Group itself?
John Thomas: Yes. I mean, the leases in place so indirectly the credits there. The loan is guaranteed by the development group, the developing team, its the development company, which is Just a number of high net worth individuals that out there.
Alex Kubicek: Okay. Got it. Thanks for the color. And kind of pivoting there, can you speak to the strategic purpose of that Atlanta and medical condo deal. Are you guys happy owning some residential real estate, or is there a long-term plan here kind of what does it look like?
John Thomas: Yeah. Sorry for the confusion there, it's not residential real estate. It's the medical office building that was divided us into condominium structure when it was built a number of years ago. So it's an incredibly strategic location kind of irreplaceable location and we're in discussions with all the condo owners. We just completed this first stage of the acquisition. At this point, the units we bought are replaced with all leases. So it's a step-by-step structure. We can't -- we don't know when we'll complete the acquisition of all or we will, but that's our expectation.
Alex Kubicek: Understood. That's really helpful. And then kind of lastly, has there been any notable success on the appeals front just looking at Texas and because of, I mean, do you guys really expect tax growth to be a headwind kind of looking into the near and medium-term just kind of looking for what you guys feel as of the temperature in that realm?
John Thomas: Yeah. We work with the firm and have from the beginning that both in the underwriting and the acquisitions, but also post on that tax appeals really every asset gets scrubbed every year and we've had a lot of great successes. Now condo with the rising values in medical office buildings, local tax assessors are running hard and trying to increase assessments. Some acquisitions post some of these portfolio deals, a significant increases in property tax rates. And so it's something we focus on hard everyday and our tenants, it all passes through on our triple net leases, but still the cost of occupancy to our tenants we work hard to mitigate that.
Alex Kubicek: Got it. Thanks for the color. Thanks for taking my question guys.
John Thomas: Sure. Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. I was hoping you could provide some more information on the Foundation El Paso Hospital. Looks like they did not pay their June rent, did you say if they paid their July and August rental payments?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. Thanks Mike. This is Jeff again. They didn't pay April and May. They have been paying rent since June 1.
John Thomas: No. He is talking about…
Jennifer Manna: Foundation.
John Thomas : Foundation. Oh, I’m sorry, Foundation.
Jeff Theiler: Yeah Foundation is behind on rents, so.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then is I guess did you say El Paso is paying their rents currently and the plan would be for them to pay the entire back rent once or if that sale completes?
Jeff Theiler: They've made partial payment for August, but that's part of the finalization of the contract is to just to get rent started paying -- give them to pay rent, while they go complete the due diligence process and closing the sale at which point they'll pay all of 2019 rent.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then can you give us an update on the San Antonio facilities because I know that they were a little bit behind their rent too. It seems like they're in a little bit of a better position and you didn't do the write-offs for them. So what's the thought process around San Antonio?
Mark Theine: Yeah, San Antonio has a buyer for it's currently -- it currently being managed by third-party. There’s a buyer anticipating closing. And we believe that will occur next week on 50% ownership of that facility with the doctors there. As part of that we negotiated a new lease with them, a new 10-year lease for both the hospital and MOB and we expect that to -- that buyers are well-capitalized, well known operator. So we think everything is stable there. And they got slightly behind in the course of 2019 with rent, but have been steadily catching up pretty close. Yeah. Less than two months.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the other assets that are slated for disposition. I know that you I guess removed that category in your supplement this time around. I guess, how big is that portfolio again. And is that going to likely occur over the next 12 months or so?
John Thomas: Other than half of -- we talked about selling Foundation El Paso and the life care hospitals, we're talking about plus or minus $100 million of other assets and frankly we have if they're good assets we have a buyer that's can massively by waiting those, really just trying to match fund and with the use of proceeds. So we expect some closings this -- still this year.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just on same-store revenue, it was up 3.8% in the quarter but same-store occupancy was actually down 40 bps. So I'm wondering what's the contractual rent increase for the MOB portfolio overall. And then were there any other revenue or anything else that made the same-store revenue growth that 3.8% in the quarter?
Mark Theine: Good morning, Nick this is Mark. So we're really proud of our same-store results for the quarter. Again this is -- two more things to keep in mind as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks. This is our core MOB portfolio and it does include the entire portfolio. So there is no held-for-sale bucket or repositioning bucket. As you know our average annual rent bumps is about 2.3% and during the quarter we celebrated the anniversary of the CHI portfolio. So we had about 20% of our portfolio from those leases and in our same-store portfolio, a 1% increase represents about $600,000. So it's really not a huge dollar amount but it makes a big difference in percentage. And so it's really driving the improvements in our same-store this quarter. Our two leases, which had three rent last year and are now paying full rent this year, but, again, really proud of our same-store core portfolio overall as a whole doing really well. We look forward to continuing that next quarter.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. When do the free rent comps burn off to where it will be more in line with the contractual rent increases?
Mark Theine: They already have burned off.
Nick Joseph: Okay. So the third quarter same-store number should be more in line with the occupancy plus the contractual rent increase change?
Mark Theine: That should be right.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just in terms of the watch list you guys put out in early June, I guess with the four tenants and I know we've discussed most of them on the call but are there any unfair changes to the watch list either additions or anything coming off now?
Mark Theine: As we complete the sales we've talked about, I think will eliminate every one of the issues on that watch list this quarter or this year based on the timing of the LifeCare situation but each of those have been -- and addressed pretty thoroughly this quarter.
Nick Joseph: Sure. And any new additions to the watch list?
Mark Theine: I knew that was going be the next question. Not to repeat that definition.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Mark Theine: Thanks Nick.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. So your net debt to EBITDA at 6.5 is kind of above where you held at historically. Given the current dynamics in the market where your cost of debt is going lower arguably, probably at all time lows. Cost of equity is, I guess a little volatile right now. How do you think about operating at a higher leverage level at least in near-term?
Jeff Theiler: Hey John, it's Jeff. So you're right. When you look at the headline net debt to EBITDA, it's much higher than we typically operate. But keep in mind that that's really impacted by a lot of these accounting adjustments, which we won't have next quarter and actually some of them will end up reversing over the next few quarters. So if you normalize that out you're kind of more at the 5.7, which is about in line with the leverage that we've had the last few quarters. So we're probably right near our target leverage. I think we got a little bit, but probably not too much more from here. So whenever we look at these acquisitions and new investments, we look at it using an appropriate mix of debt and equity and make sure it pencils out under those parameters and so we'll continue to do that. And then we'll -- in terms of funding needs we'll -- but you said the cost debt is coming down, so that's getting more attractive. And then we'll obviously look at our equity price and make determinations about whether to use equity capital as well.
John Kim: But have your views changed at all. I mean the net debt-EBITDA obviously does not take into account cost of debt. So, are there other metrics that you look to or have you -- are you more open to increasing leverage level?
Jeff Theiler: I see. I see, your question, because of the lower cost of debt, we run a higher debt to EBITDA. I mean, it depends. I mean the cost of debt is moving pretty rapidly around here as the 10-year drops by $0.20 or 20 bps of yield over the last, it seems like couple of weeks. So I think right now we'll kind of stick with our target of 5% and if it looks like, it’s a sustained move down in cost to debt, maybe that comes up a little bit. But right now I think it's too early to make a determination, because it's so volatile.
John Kim: Okay. And then, can we get an update on Common Spirit. I guess, during the quarter that got the credit ratings confirmed at BBB+ Baa1. Does that change your views as to more investments with the partner, or do you want to eventually reduce concentration risk?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. This is JT. Common Spirit is -- they continue that integration of those two large health systems, I think, is starting to move pretty rapidly, now just the people and teams and the other integrations. We think they're great client, a great tenant across the board. We really look at market-by-market, as whether we'd be comfortable with expanding that, in some of their market that you expect we would expand and we'll have the opportunity to do that, because of our relationships there. In other markets, it's probably TBD. And then from time to time we sell one or more of those assets or would sell some of those assets, again, market-by-market depending on the situation. We're still waiting on the local market to have some clarity on what's going to happen with the hospitals that they have there. We fully expect our MOBs would be fine, but we may have a new client relationship there to work with. So great organization, we think they'll -- the combined organization, the plan they have going forward, it will just -- will make them better and all of our assets better at the same time, but it is truly market-by-market for us.
John Kim: If I could just ask one more, a follow-up on the condo unit acquisition. I guess this is not an ideal ownership structure. So are you basically comfortable that there's a high likelihood that you're going to be acquiring the entire building from the other owners?
John Thomas: Yeah. That's our plan. So it just takes one -- like, brick at a time to condominium structure. So it's one unit at a time but we're in discussions with substantially everybody involved.
John Kim: Yes. Thank you.
John Thomas: Great place and it's worth the effort, worth the time.
John Kim: Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chad your line is now open.
Chad Vanacore: Hello. Thank you. So just one quick question going back to same-store NOI, 3.5%, that's pretty well above the 2.5%, 3% target range, especially given that loiters around 2.5% the rest of the year. Where is that delta? Is that a matter of change in same-store pool or could you really have a 100 basis points reduction in expenses?
Mark Theine: Yes, Chad. This is Mark. So the primary driver of that, as I was saying before is, two leases that had free rent last year that are now paying full rent and operating expenses, so 1% movement in our same stores about $600,000 there.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And then, is it possible to talk about the bidder for the LTACH at this point?
Mark Theine: Yeah, I think, I mean, a little bit. It's a public process Chad. So there's a ton of information in the bankruptcy court filings, if you want to go look, click through it. But it's a one of the original founders of LifeCare has reorganized the company and as capital and is coming back to buy a handful of the assets.
Chad Vanacore: All right. That's it from me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Daniel Bernstein: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask, are there going to be any incremental cost near-term for internalizing some of your management and you still in other metro areas?
Mark Theine: Good morning, Dan. I'm Mark. So internal cost, not really, not many. So we are able to pass through many of the property administration and salaries in our leases that are triple-net. And then, areas where we're not able to pass through salaries, there's quite a bit of opportunity of margin in the fees that we charge relative to the cost of providing those services. So net-net, profitable opportunity for us to bring in-house property management, but also just as important and maybe more importantly is the relationship that we're focused on with our hospital system partners. So getting a step closer to them and gaining that local market knowledge is really important to us.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. What percentage of the portfolios internally managed at this point?
Mark Theine: About 55%.
Daniel Bernstein: 55%. Okay. So there's plenty of runway to bring things in-house and improve operating efficiencies, is the way to think about it?
Mark Theine: That's right, Dan. But don't forget about a-third of the portfolio is single-tenant management fall. So the 55% is -- there's still some market opportunities, but not a lot of the growth that we're providing.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. And you can stop me, if I'm wrong you guys still own KentuckyOne assets, I saw the headlines there were some issues there with you Jewish Hospital perhaps could close and I know if it's still in your portfolio a very small portion of your portfolio but I know if you could add some commentary on what is happening with those assets in the Louisville area?
John Thomas: Yeah. Again, that processes the headline similar ramp for two years and we continue to be in close dialog with KentuckyOne or Common Spirit in particular. We feel very good about a new buyer for those hospitals and/or the other hospitals in town have strong interest in our medical office buildings there. So we don't expect any issues with our facilities.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay.
John Thomas: The buildings that are closest to the buildings that are closest to the Jewish Medical Center itself that we are or next to the two other leading hospitals in the community as well as University of Louisville Medical Center. There's a lot of demand lot of use for those facilities. And I'd say that's worst case scenario and don't expect any occupancy issues.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. One more quick question, I just wanted to go back over the $200 million to $400 million investment pipeline, if you go back over again what is kind of the mix of development versus acquisition and are you seeing some more winnings toward construction loan to own versus acquisition at this point given the cost of capital?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, so again we're about $44 million of that what we've done to date this year is construction commitments, so I guess maybe that's a third of the total. I think that number as a percentage will creep up back – toward the back end where as I said in kind of in final position with a couple of different health systems on new development opportunities that we would participate finding those. So those could be bigger. By the end of the year if we don't – we don't -- aren't aware of those in development number will be quite as big. On the acquisition front as I said, we've got about $75 million under contract in a couple of different location – the best prediction I can make right now is two-third of the acquisitions I think we close this year and third will be development starts that we either under construction or that we win by the end of the year.
Daniel Bernstein: That's all helpful. Thank you very much. I'll hop off.
Jeff Theiler: Yeah.
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the floor over to John Thomas for closing comments.
John Thomas: Again, thank you for joining us this morning. As noted, we're very excited about the success of the second quarter, and look forward to a bright future. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-01 09:10:00) =====

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today. When we last spoke, we informed you of the disappointing closure of the El Paso Surgical Hospital by the operator in late 2018. Both DOC and the on-site physicians learned the disclosure with minimal notice, effectively ending the company's leases on two facilities, a medical office building and a surgical hospital.  Fortunately, we were able to quickly re-tenant the affected MOB under our new tenure lease at terms better than the terminated lease as the physician occupants were reemployed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sierra Providence, Tenet Healthcare's wholly-owned subsidiary in El Paso which to then lease the medical office building. Today, we are very pleased to announce the execution of a new 10-year lease with two separate subsidiaries of a major national health system to lease and operate the surgical facility, including the ambulatory surgery center in that building. The new leases will commence June 1 with rent to begin on July 1. The leases are subject to final board approval by that organization, which we expect to occur early in May.  In total, we have fully replaced the rent loss from the prior leases with a better, more profitable healthcare system more tightly aligned with their positions. While we were happy to work with all of the major health systems in town to explore leasing facility, our relationship with this operator in particular was instrumental in turning an unexpected limit and eliminate it very quickly. We executed this transaction and the new lease efficiently and quickly in a creative win-win structure that benefits the community today and we serve together. Relationships matter, and this is another example of how we invest in better and execute consistently to get better long-term results. We believe in the strength of our experienced underwriting and credit teams and know that even though the most stringent investment criteria will fail to anticipate every tenant to follow. In this most recent circumstance, our credit monitoring process works, proactively identified an opportunity for our leasing team to ensure a positive outcome and preserving shareholder value. While we've continued to work to limit these situations in the future, we hope that you recognize the value in our ability to address them quickly and effectively through our position as the landlord of choice in health care. We eliminated investments during Q1 2019, with all investments made off market with historical relationships that have credit and will produce more opportunities for us in the future. All these investments have first-year yield exceeding 6% upon rent commencement. We continue to believe we will have a very good opportunity to invest $200 million to $400 million of new investments in 2019, with a portion of these investments being new development starts that will have rent commencing in 2020. All of our development starts or due diligence are leased to an investment-grade credit tenant or anchored by an investment-grade tenant, with affiliated physicians or providers in highly pre-leased buildings. We believe culture matters, especially the DOC culture. Our team is dedicated to all our stocks and stakeholders, and we have a teeming environment that works very hard everyday in an inviting location where they want to be with people with whom they want to work. Yesterday, we were proud to be recognized by the Milwaukee Business Journal as the coolest office in Milwaukee, which we believe will plot the quality of our 1893 vintage office and the culture of our team. We welcome your bid at any time. Jeff will now share our Q1 2019 financial highlights. Jeff?
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2019, the company generated funds from operations of $47.4 million or $0.25 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $47.4 million and $0.25 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $42.1 million or $0.22 per share, $0.01 per share less than the previous quarter. The primary negative impacts to our quarterly earnings are the two major items. The first was a temporary vacancy at the El Paso specialty hospital, which generated $725,000 of cash NOI last quarter. The second was the seasonally higher G&A expense that we have historically seen in the first quarter, which was expected and discussed on our previous earnings call. With the interest rate theory of lower for longer taking hold again in 2019, there's the increased equity investor interest in Physicians Realty Trust, which has in turn driven our cost of capital lower and supported our stated acquisition strategy. We invested $20 million in 2 loan investments for the first quarter of 2019 at an average first-year yield of 7.7% and completed a $4.3 million addition into an existing building, which will generate 7% yield. Subsequent to quarter end, we invested another $14.8 million partially funded with OPUs and a 27,000 square foot freestanding ASC in Pasadena Texas, 100% leased through a joint venture of USPI and Memorial Hermann and another $900,000 in a [indiscernible] home we're building in Pensacola, Florida. These new investments collectively yield just over 6%. In summary, year-to-date, we have invested a total of $40 million at an average first-year yield of 7% and remain comfortable with our guidance range of $200 million to $400 million at an average cap rate of 5.5% to 6.25%, assuming favorable capital market conditions. The same assets remain in the inflated predisposition category, with a net book value of $96 million. Some of these assets are in the early stages of sale negotiations, but not yet advanced enough to provide reasonable certainty of sale. Post quarter end, we closed on 2 dispositions that were the results of unsolicited offers for buildings in Tacoma, Washington and Panama City, Florida. The total net proceeds were $12.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $3.1 million. The buildings were yielding a cash cap rate of 6.4% in the most recent quarter and generated an unlevered IRR of 12% during our home period. Our portfolio is 95.4% leased as of the end of the quarter, with 53% of total GLA leased to investment-grade tenants and their subsidiaries. Our same-store NOI grew by 1.5% this quarter. And to preempt the questions we've received in the past, we updated and enhanced our disclosure to allow investors to attract all of our NOI by adding the contributions from assets slated for disposition and repositioning assets. When we included the results of all of those assets, the overall same-store NOI growth would have been 30 basis points higher at 1.8%. As a reminder, the main negative driver this quarter would be the El Paso Specialty Hospital, which has now been resolved and the tenant is expected to resume rental payment for the second half of 2019. This temporary vacancy costs our portfolio of 140 basis points of same-store NOI growth this quarter and will do the same in the second quarter of the year before payments resume. We utilized the AGM in the first quarter to provide capital for our acquisitions, raising $31 million of net proceeds at an average price of $18.61. Our balance sheet remains strong in 5.8x debt to EBITDA and net debt to gross assets of 34%. G&A expense was elevated this quarter due to seasonal factors, but we remain comfortable with our previous projection of G&A for the year of $31 million to $33 million.  I'll now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. From net operational standpoint, the first quarter of 2019 was another period of stable and consistent growth for Physicians Realty Trust. Our relationship-centric approach to asset management continues to enhance the value of our portfolio, resulting in strong internal growth and a continued commitment to operational excellence through our philosophy of invest in better.  Our portfolio is an industry-leading 95.4% leased, including 53% leased to investment-grade rated health systems or their subsidiaries. This unmatched achievement illustrates our ability to attract and lease space to additional physicians, contributing to an optimized tenant ecosystem so that our partners may reach their clinical and business goals while increasing community access to care. This approach is particularly evident in our ability to release the El Paso surgical facility within one quarter, as John previously mentioned.  Our deep hospital and physician relationships, the strength of the El Paso healthcare market and the premier location of this facility all contributed to releasing 100% of the 89,000 square-foot facility on terms similar to the previously in-place leases. In addition to the favorable economic impact of this agreement, we are also proud to include green lease provision throughout the new lease. These terms have become standard in our lease template, illustrating our continued commitment to ESG best practices. With the newly executed lease in El Paso, we expect our occupancy to return to the 96% benchmark for which our company is known. Our $238 million same-store properties representing 89% of the portfolio overall generated NOI growth of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2019. Same-store NOI growth is 2.9% if the El Paso surgical facility is excluded. Over the long term, we continue to expect our same-store portfolio to drive 2% to 3% growth year-over-year as our in-place average rent escalator is 2.3%. In Q1 2019, same-store operating expenses were up 8.5%, almost entirely due to increases in realty taxes. Our corresponding operating expense recoveries were up 8.1%, demonstrating the insulated nature of our cash flow through triple net leases and high occupancy. With confidence and continued momentum, our leasing team also delivered outstanding results in Q1 2019, completing 171,000 square feet of leasing activity with a favorable 2.1% re-leasing spreads and a 74% retention rate. More than half of the leases signed in the quarter contained annual rent escalations of 3% or more, providing strong internal growth for the future. Tenant improvement allowances for the quarter were $2.06 per square foot per year for new leases and $1.56 per square foot per year for lease renewals. Overall, we invested $4.9 million in tenant improvement in leasing commissions in Q1 2019, representing just 7% of the portfolio's NOI. This conservative investment in capital expenditures relative to our peers is driven primarily by our low lease expirations schedule, which is a key differentiator for DOC that enables us to return more cash to our shareholders. Looking ahead, just 2% of the portfolio of leases are scheduled to renew during the remainder of 2019 and no more than 7% of the portfolio is scheduled to renew in any one year through the year 2025. Our lease expiration scheduled is strategically laddered, driving predictable growing cash flows for investors for years to come. Before turning the call back over to John and opening for questions, we quickly like to congratulate Amy Hall, our VP of Leasing, and Jen Manna, our VP and Associate General Counsel, on the new additions to their families and the DOC family. Olivia Miranda Hall [ph] was born April 3 and Sierra Anne Manna [ph] was born April 19. The future DOC certainly looks bright. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark, and 'good work. Thank you, guys. We look forward to questions now, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Carroll: I just wanted to touch on the El Paso leases real quick. I believe Mark indicated that the combined lease is done at similar rents, but the MOB lease is done at better terms. Should we assume that the hospital lease was done at slightly lower terms but net-net, it was better given the MOB results?
John Thomas: On a combined basis, it's slightly better. So slight additional and a slight subtraction, but they average out and, added together, it's more like [indiscernible] we were getting before.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. And then, John, how are you looking at the investment market today? Given the competition in the space, where do you see the most value where you can execute deals? Should we assume most of your investment activities is going to be smaller relationship-type deals like the stuff you announced this quarter?
John Thomas: Yes. We're going to continue to focus on the relationship strategy and with the existing health systems. As we've said, all the investments in the first quarter were done with the existing hospital relationships, so our existing developers and existing health system and provider relationships. So that's always going to be our focus. But there's some interesting items, and this is available now in the market. And where we can expand those relationships and create some new relationships. So as I said in my comments, our guidance is still pretty -- we feel really confident about, and there's an uptick in the capital markets in getting really stronger.
Michael Carroll: And then are there other larger portfolios out there that interest that you think DOC can pursue given the improvement in the cost of capital? Or still the smaller deals are the primary focus?
John Thomas: We look at everything, so it just depends again on the metrics and the strategic value of those opportunities for us. So there's not a lot of portfolios out there that is interesting or exciting to us. We see a lot of one-off opportunities that will accumulate to those acquisition guys.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Then last question for me, can you talk a little bit about the LTACH portfolio? I know it seemed like coverage dropped pretty dramatically this quarter compared to the prior quarter just adding, I guess, 3 additional months to that trailing 12-month calculation. I mean, how should we think about that portfolio? And is there more risk to the LTACHs given that decline?
John Thomas: The LTACH industry has been under some pressure, particularly in the last couple of years with the change in criteria. We feel pretty good about R3. The Plano facility, in particular, is a rock star and does extremely well. It's probably the number one asset in the LifeCare portfolio. The other two have struggled from time-to-time. But they're all having the one master lease, and so we have a good relationship with that organization, but they and other LTACH outside operators are all under pressure right now. So they're certainly something we've continually monitor and evaluated for both either disposition or repositioning. But at this point, Plano really leads the way for us.
Michael Carroll: Okay. Then what drove the weakness in the coverage ratio? The coverage drops about 1.3 from 2x previously, that seems like a pretty steep decline.
John Thomas: Yes. As I said, Plano continues to perform extremely well, but Fort Worth and Pittsburgh, in particular, lagged. LifeCare has made some changes in the Pittsburgh market, which should help to improve the performance there. And they've also added some service lines there. They started to initiate same in Pittsburgh. Again, we're monitoring all three, but Plano really covers us well and we got the corporate guarantee behind that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.
Jonathan Hughes: Glad to see the El Paso progress, I know that took a lot of work. Just one question for me on acquisitions and would love to hear from maybe Deeni or Dan on this. But expected pricing on acquisition this year is in the high 5%, low 6% cap rate range, a little higher from the deals over the prior few years and some of the better pricing I get is a reflection of your relationship network. But on the marketed deals you see, have you seen any change in MOB cap rates over the past 6 or 9 months?
John Thomas: Thanks, I'm going to let Deeni respond.
Deeni Taylor: Jonathan, for marketed deals, we're seeing portfolios in that 5.3%, 5.4% cap rate change. If they were individual assets, it'd probably more 5.5% up to a 6%, but that's what we're seeing with the portfolios in the market.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And maybe a year ago, with those have been more on the low-5 range on the like-for-like basis, which I realize is a hard [indiscernible].
John Thomas: Yes, they were. They could have been that low, it just depends on kind of the relationships that went along with those assets, whether they were health system relationships.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And I mean, is that just a reflection of the fact that interest rates kind of stabilized upwards, higher here or less demand? I'm just kind of curious which drive maybe a potential expansion of cap rates.
John Thomas: But Jonathan, I think this is JT, I think it's a combination of both. Certainly, the capital marketing have approved for the -- we've kind of come out of REIT bare markets from last year and the rates continued -- tend to be more disciplined and long-term thinking on pricing and IRR expectations from the assets. Probably seeing more private equity sellers than buyers right now, but there's still a lot of private equity up there to pursue some of the portfolio. So I think it's just a combination of all of those matters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to just follow up on what happened with El Paso in terms of the income statement, if I could. Jeff, maybe just walk us through sequentially from 4Q to 1Q, what happened and then what we should anticipate in the balance of this year.
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, sure. So 4Q to 1Q, you had a reduction of $725,000 of cash NOI. Part of that, there's a little bit of a write off of bad debt expense in 4Q, so the reduction wasn't the full $800,000 that we expected. But going forward, we're going to add about $800,000 or so to the cash NOI line because they're going to start paying that operating expense as well as part of the...
Jordan Sadler: That's in 3Q?
Jeffrey Theiler: That's in 3Q, yes, sorry.
Jordan Sadler: Plus $800,000 in 3Q, okay. And you said cash NOI declined. Was there also a GAAP NOI decline from 4Q, 1Q?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. There's a decline in GAAP NOI as well, yes.
Jordan Sadler: The same number, pretty much?
Jeffrey Theiler: Similar.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. I just wanted to -- the guidance, in terms of acquisition guidance in the pipeline, pretty significant. I know your confidence is reasonably high. Can we get a little bit of a refresh on where you stand there, JT, and maybe what timing looks like?
John Thomas: Yes, I think we've got a number of banks in the pipeline right now but just kind of moving towards, kind of finalizing LOIs and putting under our agreement. I mean, there's probably more, obviously, at this time of year, we're going to see more in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. We've got a handful of things we expect to close or going to have to contract this quarter. Like I said, we feel pretty good about the total number. And possibly, $100 million or that $400 million are development starts that we'd either finalized and announced already or in the process of finalizing.
Jordan Sadler: And these are largely smaller one-offs, you were saying, or could we expect to see a couple of bigger chunks in here?
John Thomas: Couple of bigger chunks, couple of bigger assets, but we don't expect -- right now, that number is based upon onesie, twosie transactions. They might be $50 million to $75 million transactions, but a handful in the $25 million range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Baird.
Andrew Babin: Given the opportunistic ATM raises in the first quarter, as well as assets slated for disposition, would it be fair to say that maybe the upper half of the acquisition guidance range for the year is -- maybe feels a little more on the table than it did a quarter ago? Or do the ATM proceeds maybe just kind of got a substitute for some dispositions that might have happened this year that maybe now happen next year?
John Thomas: Yes. I mean, look, so whatever we put up in this acquisition range, it's always subject to our cost of capital. Our cost of capital improved in the first quarter. We're able to utilize the ATM, which does put that upper bound of the range in play. We can't fund [indiscernible] either with the ATM or recycling some of our assets slated for disposition. Obviously, we'll reduce our acquisition volume accordingly. But right now, it seems very achievable.
Andrew Babin: Great, that's helpful. And then just a couple of questions on the leasing for the quarter. You mentioned the 2.1% re-leasing spreads. Was that a blended spread with renewals? Or was that just on new leases?
John Thomas: That's on renewal.
Andrew Babin: Okay. And then lastly, just on expiring leases for both this year and next year. How do you feel about where expiring rents are relative to market and should we continue to expect similar takeups than we've seen just last year and the first quarter of this year? Or do you expect kind of any TDAC in either way as those come up?
Mark Theine: Sure, this is Mark. So for the remainder of this year, as I mentioned in the comments, we've got about 2% of our portfolio rolling. The average rental rate, that 2% is $22.29 and then next year we got about 3.5% of our ABR rolling at an average rate of $21.58 per square foot. So I mean, certainly, it's a market-by-market evaluation that we need to do, but those are right in line with national averages for medical office rate, so we expect to renew on similar terms there and we'll continue to push on our re-leasing spreads and building in, in place of players of 2% to 3% to drive our internal growth.
Andrew Babin: Congrats, Mark, on your office design skills being recognized.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: I just wanted to get any color, if there's any updated thoughts post -- or formation of common spirit. Any thoughts on any opportunities with them? Any location that they might be looking to see to, say, move around or to divest of? Any updates there would be helpful.
John Thomas: Thanks, Vikram, this is JT. They continue to integrate that organization. I think integrating it may be faster than most organizations like us would anticipate, but they're still working through some of that as well. So some of the projects we've been working on are on hold, which we would expect in this kind of environment, in the process of integrating their teams. The only thing that we are actively in discussions with them routinely about is global, and they continue to work on the transition of the Louisville, KentuckyOne facilities, Jewish Medical Center in particular. And as publicly noted, they're primarily working with the University of Louisville to transition those hospitals to the university, which frankly would be a pretty positive thing for our MOBs. We feel very confident about the long-term viability and security behind our leases. And we've got some other offers in that market as well. So if that's the one that -- like I said, we don't have anxiety about our leases being maintained there, but we do continue to monitor that as it's where our new operator is going to be and we look forward to that continuation. Other than that, we don't expect any other changes and we expect to continue to garner new opportunities with them, always cognizant of too much concentration in some markets.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the El Paso asset, given the new relationship, slightly better rents, et cetera, if you were to sort of market that today, what would that asset sort of trade for on a cap rate or a per foot basis?
John Thomas: That is a great question. It's certainly stronger than it would have been with the old owner. And I think right now, we're just proud to have this tenant in the building, and we'll collect rent from them. But it's more of those that's in the surgical facilities that's going to be a little higher cap rate than MOB. But mid 6s to 7s would be realistic with the quality of this operator and once we get back in there and take care of patients. So we feel very good about both the NIB accretion and the opportunity to work and collect rent to contribute to our bottom line.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, great. And just one quick question, on same store, Jeff maybe. Maybe I missed this -- or sorry if I missed this. The 8.7% increase in OpEx, was that partly driven by sort of the vacancy? And can you just clarify the occupancy impact into 2Q from El Paso?
Mark Theine: Sure. This is Mark. The increase from operating expenses in the same-store portfolio is almost exclusively driven by the increase in real estate taxes. Q1, as we've reset the accrual of expenses for real estate assets, so other than $2.3 million increase in our operating expenses, almost $2 million of that is realty tax-related, not related to the vacancy of the portfolio there. And then the change in occupancy will be approximately 89,000 square feet added to our occupancy from the El Paso facility, that was not in there this quarter.
Vikram Malhotra: So the 80 bp decline, was that partly El Paso, and then there's something else?
Mark Theine: Almost all El Paso and a couple of small leases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel.
Chad Vanacore: I just wanted to get some more clarification. Mark, did you say that there'll be excess cost in re-tenanting in El Paso next quarter that we should take into account?
Mark Theine: No, sorry, I was saying that the occupancy will come back into the same-store portfolio calculation.
Chad Vanacore: All right. As far as the OpEx, up pretty substantially year-over-year, is there anything in there that comes out next quarter?
Mark Theine: No, it's just property taxes. And again, our expense recovery is also increased, 8.1%, again, showing kind of the insulated nature of our triple net leases.
Chad Vanacore: Okay. And just thinking about same-store NOI, you're up 1.5% this quarter. How should we think about same-store NOI trends for the balance of the year?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, it's Jeff. I mean, look, I think the long-term trends, as Mark said in his remarks, our average escalator is 2.3%, largely leased portfolios. We think, over the long term, 2% to 3% is a good bulk for us, and we're anticipating that.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And Jeff, you've trended below there for the past couple of quarters at least. Is there anything that could get you back above that 2%?
Jeffrey Theiler: I'm sorry, Chad, could you be that question? It's a little...
Chad Vanacore: I'm sorry, same-store NOI, 1.5% this quarter. I think last quarter was 1.3%. Do you have to wait to the back half of the year, where you re-tenanted El Paso to get back above the 2% trend line?
Jeffrey Theiler: I think that's right, Chad. Because we're not putting El Paso in a repositioning bucket or anything like that, so that's going to negatively impact our same-store next quarter as well -- sorry, second quarter as well. So it starts paying rent again in the back half of the year.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And that probably adds about $0.01 per share FFO in the back half of '19?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. I mean, I think that's about right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.
Daniel Bernstein: Just two questions from me. I think, one, I just want to understand the assets that we've sold in 2Q. Is that part of the assets held for sale at the end of 1Q, or are those different assets?
John Thomas: No, Dan, those are different assets. They were just kind of one-off opportunities to reposition all of our assets [indiscernible].
Jeffrey Theiler: Sorry, Dan, just to clarify. So they weren't in the slated for disposition bucket, but they were in that assets held for sale categorization because we have -- we have certainty of sale as of 3/31.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Are you still -- are you actively marketing the 8 assets held for sale?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, yes. We're -- again, we're not in a state where we're confident enough to put them in a held-for-sale bucket in the accounting term, but they are [indiscernible].
Daniel Bernstein: Okay, okay. And then the other question I had was on the, I guess, you talked about, I guess, it was almost $100 million, maybe more, of funding of development. I just wanted to understand, is that all kind of coming in the form of development draws on a loan or are you taking any kind of preferred equity stakes? Just trying to understand the structures that are being considered there.
John Thomas: Kind of above, Dan. So the first couple of projects are kind of the construction loans to developer on a 100% pre-leased building to a credit tenant. We've traditionally used either mezzanine financing or kind of a preferred equity position in the capital stacks, depending upon the circumstances. The needs of the developer and the opportunities set, kind of risk-adjusted returns that we're looking for. So it's really a combination of the above, where we're kind of flexible with the both health system tenant and the developer in the middle, so all of the above.
Daniel Bernstein: What's the typical yield on those investments maybe between the draws and the mezzanine preferred?
John Thomas: So I think the rent constant going forward is 6-plus for this market and kind of mezzanine, single -- 8-plus, again, depending on the underlying credit, but again, we're only focused on investment-grade type tenants on the back end sort of a little bit tighter, but also at the high end of the -- top end of the capital stakes.  Again, we appreciate your time and attention today. We look forward to your follow-up questions and seeing you at NAREIT. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-27 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Physicians Realty Trust's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Bradley Page, Senior Vice President, General Counsel. Thank you. You may begin.
Bradley Page: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. With me today are: John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, Chief Investment Officer; John Lucey, Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer; Mark Theine, Executive Vice President of Asset and Investment Management; and Lauri Becker, Senior Vice President and Controller.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company's CEO, John Thomas.
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This time last year, we told you we expected 2018 would be a year to recycle capital, to place an extraordinary focus on operations, and to position Physicians Realty Trust for 2019 and beyond. We executed on that plan through the work of our talented team, as we focused on investing better. Our goals were largely accomplished through the selling of $220 million of older, less strategically valuable properties throughout the year. Those proceeds were reinvested in the four highest-quality properties in the country occupied by high-quality health system clients in existing relationships. No property better represents this focus on quality than the North Side Medical Midtown medical office building located in the Midtown neighborhood of Atlanta. This 165,000 square foot facility is fully leased through and occupied by Northside Physicians' outpatient services and affiliated medical professionals. This property was nationally recognized by Healthcare Real Estate Insights, our industry's leading trade publication, with a 2018 HREI Insights Award for the Best New Medical Office Building of the Year. This achievement marks the fourth such HREI award winner in our portfolio and we are proud Northside Hospital selected DOC to own that building. In 2018, we evaluated every facet of our organization with a goal to increase revenue and decrease expenses and we accomplished our specific financial goals by 150%. Away from the income statement, our team worked together to define the DOC difference through our mission, vision, and value statements. These efforts illustrate who we are and how we deliver results to our people, our shareholders, our providers, and our clients. DOC's on a mission to help medical providers, developers, and shareholders provide better healthcare, better communities, and better returns. We are dedicated to making a difference in the lives of our team members, investors, healthcare partners, and those who visit our properties. We do this by offering broader and deeper healthcare expertise than any other REIT, by crafting solutions that benefit all parties, and by leveraging our long-standing industry connections to source and sustain the highest quality facilities and tenants in the industry. We articulated our core values with the acronym "CARE." We collaborate and communicate with internal and external stakeholders, we act with integrity, we respect the client relationship, and we execute consistently. By driving our organization to make decisions and manage our investments with care, we will fulfill our mission and achieve our vision. We'd also like to share more about Physicians Realty Trust's commitment to sustainability and the ESG. We have developed a G2 sustainability philosophy, a practical approach in which being green through our capital initiatives equates to a green cash result with cost savings over time. This outlook ensures the integrity and the economic viability, operational efficiency, natural resource conservation, and social responsibility within our network nationwide portfolio. In 2018, DOC spend approximately $2.8 million on sustainability-driven capital expenditure projects within the portfolio. These efforts include LED retrofits, building automation system upgrades, and façade replacements, resulting in both immediate and long-term energy savings. The company also consolidated telecommunication bills, which reduced cost and created cash management efficiencies. In 2018, Physicians Realty Trust was certified by the independent analysts at Great Places to Work. We also earned a spot on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's 2018 list of Wisconsin's top workplaces. The diversity of our employee base remains a top priority for our company. I'm proud to share that women and minorities comprise 23% of our leadership team and 57% of our larger team. On our Board of Trustees, 29% of the independent trustees are a woman or a minority. Because of our commitment to our CARE core values, the company provided over $180,000.00 in philanthropic support to charitable causes nationwide while participating in meaningful volunteer opportunities with our team. We are proud of our ESG progress in 2018, but understand that we can always do more. We will continue to invest in initiatives that improve our overall sustainability performance and support our long-term goals. With this attention to detail and invest-in-better mentality, we ended the year with a high-quality portfolio of medical office facilities. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 96% of our 13.6 million square feet is leased, with 90% of our space on campus or affiliated with a healthcare system and an average lease term of 7.9 years. This focus on quality extends to our tenants, with 57% of our leases being signed by investment-grade quality entities or their affiliates, a metric that leads the medical office space. It's these tenant relationships that are the catalyst for Physicians Realty Trust growth. By working with the best health systems in the best markets, our opportunity for organic growth is second to none. In the past, we had funded new development conservatively. Moving forward, we believe we can generate higher returns by increasing capital allocations to new developments. This strategy includes backing the best healthcare developers who have projects pre-leased at high rates to high-quality health systems. Projects like Northside Medical Midtown in Atlanta is a prime example of this hospital-driven, self-development model. We support these efforts as well. Today, we mentioned the closure of the El Paso surgical hospital. In December, we learned that the operator of the hospital announced they were closing at the end of the year. The hospital was very successful for many years and while the facility had challenges in 2018, the ownership, including Physicians, invested millions of dollars to recruit and employ new physicians in the market, open new services, and upgrade the facility over the last few years. The facility never missed a rent payment but, surprisingly, closed with three weeks' notice and has not yet paid its December rent. Most of the key physicians were both owners of the tenant and employees. Fortunately, the physician tenants were quickly reemployed by a wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra Providence, Tenet Healthcare's wholly owned subsidiary in El Paso, and we executed a new 10-year lease on the facility at terms better than the existing lease. We have a number of national healthcare systems actively evaluating and interested in either leasing or purchasing the now vacant hospital. We have received and are evaluating offers to purchase and/or lease the facility and are confident we will have a new tenant in the facility in the near-term. While a disappointing surprise, the strength of this location in the healthcare market and the physicians historically aligned with the facility we believe will allow us to quickly address the situation. Also, as noted in our press release this morning, we are proud to announce three promotions. Our Board of Trustees has promoted Mark Theine to Executive Vice President of Asset Management, recognizing his strong leadership and growth as a leader in the company. Mark's career began when he was hired by our founder, John Sweet, to help build and run the private company that is the predecessor company to DOC and became an original officer of DOC as a senior vice president upon completion of our IPO. Mark is responsible for managing the daily operations of our portfolio, which has grown from 19 buildings and 500,000 square feet at the time of the IPO to over 250 buildings and almost 14 million square feet today. In the beginning, he managed a handful of internal employees and third-party property managers and, today, due to our growth, directly or indirectly manages over 100 people. In addition, the Board promoted and expanded the responsibilities of John Lucey, recognizing his contributions as our Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer. John joined our organization immediately following our IPO as our principal accounting officer and his leadership and ability to scale our team as we have experienced significant growth has been critical to our success. John leads our accounting, SEC and public company reporting, human resources, information technology professionals, and oversees other administrative responsibilities as well. Among many of John's accomplishments was his decision to hire, mentor, and develop Laurie P. Becker, who rose quickly through the organization. We are pleased to announce Laurie has been promoted to Senior Vice President and Controller. Laurie will continue to report to John Lucey across his many responsibilities, with a direct focus on accounting and SEC reporting. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated funds from operations of $49.9 million or $0.27 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $49.9 million and $0.27 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $44.7 million or $0.24 per share, representing an increase of $1.2 million after adjusting for last quarter's one-time benefit from the lease termination fee. For the full year of 2018, the company generated funds from operations of $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.04 over 2017, and funds available for distribution of $0.94 per share, an increase of $0.01 over 2017. This represents the fifth consecutive year of per share FAD growth, a 38% increase, overall, from 2014's $0.68 per share return. Our fourth quarter investments were limited to $9.8 million of funded mezzanine loans, which will generate a weighted average yield of 8.3%. The company's full-year acquisitions were largely funded by the disposition of 34 non-core assets, with $220 million of proceeds used to acquire $252 million of Class A real estate, highlighted by the $82 million Northside Medical Midtown MOB. It's common knowledge that 2018 was a very difficult year for external growth for medical office building REITs. Our cost of capital was constrained by our share price, which was much lower than warranted for the entire year. In addition, we faced very aggressive bidders for medical office buildings in the private market, both from private equity buyers, who have recognized medical office as a core asset class and, therefore, have lowered their required returns for owning it, and by the large diversified public healthcare REITs, who are rapidly diversifying away from the ever-worsening senior housing industry. Against this backdrop, DOC focused on making significant operational improvements in asset management by directly hiring property managers in Ohio and Kentucky and positioning itself with premier health systems and development groups to partner on their most important facilities going forward. It was because of this work in 2018 that we can now predict $200 million to $400 million of off-market transactions at cap rates between 5.5% and 6.25%, assuming our cost of capital remains favorable. Importantly, the pricing on these transactions does not reflect lower asset quality but rather a recommitment to the off-market and partner-driven growth strategy that has cemented DOC as the MOB owner of choice during the past five years. This proven strategy will enable DOC to build concentration with key health systems and widen our existing lead in investment-grade tenancy, while we reward our shareholders with earnings accretion. We still maintain six assets in our "slated for disposition" bucket, with a net book value of $98 million. These assets are 78% leased and are performing well but we have determined that they no longer fit our core strategy, so we will dispose of them if and when we can get to the right price. Two of these assets were classified as "held for sale" last quarter because of a signed purchase contract but the buyer was unable to secure the necessary financing so they have been removed from that category this quarter. We had very little capital markets activity in the fourth quarter, with just a small amount, $2.4 million, issued on the ATM. Our balance sheet remains strong, with less than $77 million of debt maturing over the next four years, all of which are existing mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA RE is 5.6 times and our debt to total capitalization is less than 34%, providing lots of flexibility. Our portfolio remains highly leased at 96% of total DOA and 53% of the space is leased to investment-grade rated health systems or their subsidiaries. Each of these metrics lead the MOB REIT universe. Northside Hospital, our third-largest tenant at 3.5% of portfolio DOA, does not currently issue public debt but would most certainly be investment-grade rated if they did. Our 96% leased same-store portfolio generated cash NOI growth of 1.3%, excluding the six properties slated for disposition. If we included these properties, the NOI growth would be 1.9%. G&A expense was $6.7 million for the quarter, bringing our total 2018 G&A to $28.8 million, within the expected range announced at the end of last year. Connected in our earnings release and John's address in his prepared remarks, the tenant transition that we are working through at our El Paso specialty hospital and MOB. We have already released the MOB at comparable lease rates and have been working with many interested parties for the hospital asset. But until we are able to finalize a new lease, we will experience a drag on FFO and FAD of approximately $800,000.00 per quarter. In terms of 2019 projections, we've already mentioned the $200 million to $400 million of off-market investments at cap rates of 5.5% to 6.25%, although the timing of those investments is uncertain. We also anticipate G&A expense of $31 million to $33 million, which, like 2018, will be temporarily elevated in Q1 due to expensing of stock bonuses and then tail back down. We anticipate CapEx will be less than 10% of NOI again, as we seek to maximize the amount of rent that flows through to the bottom line for our shareholders. We don't utilize a repositioning bucket for underperforming assets so it is difficult to predict our overall same-store NOI growth for 2019, as that number will be influenced by the speed at which we finalize a tenant replacement in El Paso, but we continue to expect 2% to 3% of cash NOI growth on a long-term basis. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks Jeff. We started 2018 with key objectives for the operations team, including driving organic growth through proactive asset management, improving the quality of our portfolio, and expanding our property management platform. As we look back at last year, we have achieved these key goals. In 2018, same-store NOI growth for the full year was 3.1% or 1.9% if the one-time termination fee at the Fox Valley MOB is excluded. As Jeff mentioned, fourth quarter same-store NOI growth was 1.3%, driven by a 1.8% increase in rental revenues, 20% increase in operating expense recoveries, and offset by an 18% increase in operating expenses. This larger than usual year-over-year increase in operating expenses is attributable to the rise in real estate taxes at the Baylor Cancer Center, as well as MOBs in Austin and Houston. The increase in operating expense recoveries to offset this rise in taxes demonstrates the inflated nature of our cash flow from triple net leases. In 2018, we significantly improved the long-term quality of our portfolio by selling 34 older and smaller assets. These properties averaged 31,000 square feet each, were 82% leased, 25 years old, and only had 27% investment-grade rated tenants. We recycled the capital from the sale of these assets into four new properties totaling 620,000 square feet. These new acquisitions averaged 155,000 square feet each, were 96% leased and only 5 years old, with limited CapEx needed in the future. Three of the four 2018 acquisitions were with existing tenants in the portfolio, demonstrating DOC's position as their preferred real estate owner. Stepping back and reviewing our progress over the last few years, we have improved the quality of our portfolio substantially through both acquisitions and dispositions, including the disposition of nearly half of the legacy IPO portfolio. Simply stated, DOC's portfolio transformation is real. Three years ago, 26% of our tenants were investment-grade rated, compared with 53% today, and 84% of our Top 10 tenancy is investment-grade rated. We believe these new investments will provide outstanding returns for years to come and reflect the standard of exceptional quality for our acquisitions in the future. Speaking of our Top 10 tenants, we would like to congratulate Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health on completing their merger and rebranding under the new name, Common Spirit Health, effective February 1st. Turning to our portfolio, in 2018, we completed over 1 million square feet of leasing activity. In the fourth quarter, specifically, we completed 270,000 square feet of leasing activity, with positive leasing spreads of 3.9%. In total, we completed 146,000 square feet of lease renewals, with an average lease term of 8.8 years, resulting in a tenant retention rate of 53%. The retention rate, however, was 77% in Q4 if you exclude the El Paso specialty hospital that John previously mentioned. We also completed almost 125,000 square feet of new leases, with an average lease term of 11.8 years. We continue to see strong leasing momentum from our hospital partners for new space and the ability to push rent and annual rent escalators in lease renewals. In fact, 90% of our leasing activity in 2018 contained an average rent escalator of 2.5% or greater. We are proud to report that fourth quarter rent concessions were low, with no free rent and very little TI required to renew our existing healthcare provider partners. Approximately 60% of the leases renewed in the quarter did not require any TI and the remaining 40% averaged $1.57 per square foot per year. Tenant improvements for new leases were approximately $2.29 per square foot per year during the quarter. In 2018, we invested a total of $19.8 million in tenant improvements, recurring CapEx, and leasing commissions, or just 7% of the portfolio's cash NOI. The low investment capital expenditures relative to our peers is driven primarily by the physical quality of our buildings we have bought, attention to deferred maintenance, and our low lease expirations scheduled during the year. In 2019, we expect capital investment to continue to trend on course at approximately $4 million to $5 million per quarter. As we begin 2019, we have built a high-quality portfolio, operated by exceptional asset management and leasing teams that continue to deliver bottom line results. We successfully expanded these teams recently by replacing third-party property managers and directly hiring managers to the DOC team in Kentucky and Ohio, markets representing approximately 1.1 million square feet or 15% of our multitenant portfolio. As always, our commitment to relationships and service excellence for our healthcare partners nationwide is the trademark of the DOC difference, ultimately driving tenant retention, cost efficiencies, and profitable, consistent growth for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. We'll now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: First, I want to talk a little bit about the El Paso move out and why did the system decide to shut down its operations and is that normal versus trying to sell the practice? I'm assuming that they were just not very profitable in 2018.
John Thomas: Yes, Mike, it's hard to explain. It was a surprise to us, as we said in my comments. We had about three weeks' notice. And, as I said, they had never missed a rent payment and the hospital had been very successful for a very long time. So, the physicians that were employed there and were also part owners were as surprised as we were. So, can't explain the decision but it was made and, like I said, working with the physicians, quickly moved both their employment and the lease to the medical office facility that they occupied to Tenet Healthcare and have a lot of interest in the facility. So, not a great situation but we think it's short-term.
Michael Carroll: So, it's encouraging that you got the MOB released so quickly. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the interest in the property? I know you mentioned that you may sell or release it. Why do you think you can do it so quickly and do you think you'll be able to get this done at similar value and/or rate as the prior lease?
John Thomas: Yes, we do believe that. And three national healthcare operators are actively touring it, evaluating it, looking at data and due diligence from us, and building a business pro forma around it. El Paso is still a growing community. It's fairly tightly bedded on any kind of bed-to-population standard. And, more importantly, this facility has 10 ORs. It was primarily a surgical hospital and the orthopedic surgeons who were part owners and employees who are still there in the community want to come back and start practicing in it again. So, it's a very desirable location and place, particularly for physicians and efficiency for both inpatient and outpatient surgery.
Michael Carroll: Is the hospital physically opened right now? And if it's not open, is that an issue in terms of trying to sell it or release it?
John Thomas: No, it's secured and locked up and we're taking care of it, obviously, but whoever - if one of the other hospitals in the community opens it, they can open it under their license and do it pretty quickly. If somebody wanted to come in on a de novo basis, it would take a little more time but still wouldn't take too much time. So, the hospital could be up and operating within days, depending on which hospital operator decides to lease it from us.
Michael Carroll: And, finally, I guess, John, can you provide some comments on the new reimbursement change that was enacted on January 1st related to the Section 603 assets? I know that DOC has been pretty optimistic on those properties over the past few years. Does that new payment schedule alter your view on those properties?
John Thomas: No, we still are attracted to off-campus outpatient care facilities, particularly if they are leased to a credit-quality health system, which is what 603 is all about. The AHA, the number of hospitals that are suing CMS over the payment cut, because it's directly contrary to the plain language of Section 603, there's a bipartisan letter that came out of the Senate with, I think, 70 or 80 signatures. I don't think they have any problem addressing the situation if they have to do it legislatively. But bottom line is we underwrite every facility based on what its current revenue and what its current reimbursement rates look like. We're not dependent upon just the statute and the regulatory protection as the basis for our decision. It's really about what are the services there, how much revenue are they generating. As you said, physicians in non-hospitals can be successful in locations like that. So, it's a nice addition with the grandfathered status and we think it's particularly valuable for the long-term renewal rates of the hospitals in those locations to protect that grandfathered status. So, bottom line is we still underwrite every facility and monitor every facility on our current basis based upon what CMS is paying them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: So, it sounds like El Paso tenant clearly wasn't on the watch list and that was unexpected. Are there any other tenants on the watch list that lease large spaces with expirations over the next few years?
John Thomas: Jonathan, I think our watch list and issues that we've had to deal with in the past is healthier than ever and stronger than ever. We certainly evaluate - when we brought in and created the credit watch group and underwriting team that reports to Jeff, one of the things that they went back and did as went through all our leases and started tracking down financials and monitoring that and have visibility on the vast majority of all of our tenants, particularly all of our large tenants of any size. So, that's been a very helpful team to build and they're doing a great job. So, again, still working through the sale of the hospital in El Paso and probably a change of ownership in San Antonio, which will be an enhancement overall, but those issues have been largely taking care of themselves.
Jonathan Hughes: And then on the G&A guidance, maybe a question for Jeff. I think that includes some vesting of maybe restricted shares in the first quarter and that goes back down through the rest of the year. I think we saw the same thing last year. Is this going to be a recurring item that we should be modeling in 2020 and beyond?
Jeff Theiler: Jonathan, yes, that's a great question. And you should be modeling that each year. I think you'll see a very similar pattern.
Jonathan Hughes: And now on the acquisition guidance, expected pricing there is in the high 5% to 6% cap rate range, a little higher from deals in this past year, and you mentioned that's a reflection of your relationship network. But maybe on the marketed deals that I assume you still evaluate, have you seen any change in seller pricing there on the MOBs over the past 6-9 months as interest rates have stabilized higher?
John Thomas: I'd say we haven't seen a meaningful change, Jonathan. I think the four that have traded haven't measured up on a quality basis to, say, the Duke portfolio and there are some high-quality portfolios floating around right now. We'll see what those print at. But, for the most part, I think Jeff's dead on. We're seeing lots of great opportunities with our relationships at the cap rates that you suggested.
Jonathan Hughes: Any interest in large portfolios out there?
John Thomas: Jonathan, we look at everything and evaluate everything that's on the market, but we tend to stay off-market and that's where we find the best value and have the best opportunities with our relationships.
Jonathan Hughes: And then just one more. So, you used the ATM during the fourth quarter. Do you plan to utilize that, in addition to capital recycling from the "slated for disposition" bucket, to fund the external growth guidance?
Jeff Theiler: Certainly, we're going to look at both of those sources as we look to fund the pipeline. We're probably pretty near target leverage right now. So, it's going to depend a little bit on how fast we can generate these acquisitions and the interest that we can get in selling our properties slated for disposition. As we talked about, these are good properties and so we are looking for good pricing on them. So, that's going to factor into what sources of capital we're able to tap.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Quick follow-up on the G&A front for Jeff. I know that the changes in lease accounting, you're expensing more property management type costs that you might have capitalized last year. I guess, can you quantify that impact to G&A and kind of confirm that that's sort of an AFFO-neutral change.
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Drew, I mean, so that is an AFFO-neutral change. As a practical matter, we didn't have a ton of G&A that we were capitalizing in that manner. We started to try to work toward this guidance implementation earlier. So, most of the G&A that you see is kind of an increase in the cost of running the company, increase in salaries and benefits for the best-in-class staff that we have. So, there's some benefit from capitalization but it's not a lot.
Drew Babin: And I guess a related question as well. On the CapEx front, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it would remain, I think, less than 10% of NOI. Looking at your 2018 results, it looked like it was maybe 7%. So, I guess, throwing the 10% out there, is that just sort of a general range? Do you expect the per square foot cost to rise significantly in 2019 or should they stay relatively consistent?
Mark Theine: Drew, this is Mark Theine. Jeff threw out the 10% number but we're really working to manage our CapEx efficiently and be in the $4 million to $5 million per quarter in 2019.
Drew Babin: And just one more from me on the $200 million to $400 million of investment guidance. Does that include any mezzanine or development-type fixed income investments or is that just pure property acquisitions?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, so that's going to be - I guess that would be inclusive of acquisitions, some take-out type deals, and limited development. If we do mezzanine loans, you're going to see interest rates that are well above that range. Typically, our mezzanine rates of return are kind of in the 8% to 9% range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: First question, regarding the acquisition guidance here, just drilling down. Is there line of sight to the $200 million to $400 million that you offered up a specific range?
John Thomas: Yes, Jordan, we've got a pretty good pipeline we're working on so line of sight to the midpoint of that number and expect that to appear pretty quickly.
Jordan Sadler: So, for modeling purposes, mid-year timing kind of works?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I think that's right, Jordan.
Jordan Sadler: And, Jeff, while I have you, the funding, you touched on it here, but what's embedded in the guidance in terms of funding and leverage for 2019?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, so, embedded in the leverage, I guess - or, as I mentioned, we're at or near our target leverage. Right? So, you consider that to be 65% equity, 35% debt or so. So, for modeling purposes, that might be an easy way to do it - 65% equity. The wild card is whether or not we're able to reach agreement on some of these assets slated for disposition. That will obviously affect the amount of equity issued.
Jordan Sadler: The dispos, are they solely related to the six assets in that bucket and does that bucket include El Paso?
Jeff Theiler: So, the assets slated for disposition include the foundation El Paso asset, not the El Paso specialty hospital. That's not in there right now. We don't think it will be. So, those are assets, they've been in there for a few quarters now, and we just determined they're non-core and are looking to sell them. But, again, as you heard in our same-store remarks, I mean, they're performing well so there's not a huge - we're not willing to take any price. We're willing to sell them at the right price.
Jordan Sadler: They've been hanging out here for a while so I'm just curious. Is there an expectation this is a 2019 event or it's just we'll see what happens?
Jeff Theiler: I mean, we thought we had - we were close to selling two of them. We think we'll be close to selling two of them again, probably sooner rather than later. But, again, we're evaluating all prices that come in.
Jordan Sadler: And just to clarify on the El Paso specialty hospital, did you - I thought you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you may sell the asset. Is that right or did I mishear that?
John Thomas: Yes, at least three of the suitors, if you will, who are interested in the facility have inquired about a purchase or a lease. So, we're evaluating those options. We've received written offers that we're evaluating but our primary desire is to lease the facility again. The operators that are evaluating and interested in it are high-quality tenants that we would like to have a relationship with.
Jordan Sadler: And how should we think about the timing of the releasing and the two different pieces?
John Thomas: Yeah. I mean, we think it's quick but it's hard to predict. But we think it's quick.
Jordan Sadler: First half or second?
John Thomas: I think we'll have it resolved first half, it's just a matter of how quickly we can get them back in there and get it open and operating. It can be quick, just depending upon which one of the operators we end working a deal out with.
Jordan Sadler: Lastly, on this term loan in Columbus that you've done in the first quarter, the $15 million, can you shed a little bit of light on that? One of your other investments here, you provided more color on this development loan, I'm just curious about the one that's in Columbus. It seems to have a little bit less detail in the release.
John Thomas: Yes, it's one of our large healthcare developer client relationships who took down some land and is in the process of finalizing the plans, has a lease with an investment-grade tenant. So, at this point, you can view it as a short-term bridge to the bigger development project. But we're evaluating whether or not we'll participate or work that deal out with him on the second project but, in the near term, it's a good investment and well-secured.
Jordan Sadler: Is it an MOB?
John Thomas: It's a large healthcare tenant.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. In your prepared remarks, you referenced taking some of the management internal to the DOC team. Just wondering, some of your peers have focused or emphasized the internal management and they outlined some savings and margin growth opportunities. I'm just wondering, does this signal or is this something you're looking to expand, in terms of doing more internal management?
John Thomas: Yes, Vikram, this is J.T. We're going to continue to, in markets where it makes sense and where we have scale and we can gain those efficiencies. And there are some other markets where we're planning to head in that direction in the near term. I don't think we'll ever find it - in some markets, it's better to work with our third-party partners, like we already do. They're the ones with the existing health system relationships and have brought us into those relationships with them and they're great partners. They do a great job. And in markets where we have scale and otherwise, it's our relationships that we're primarily working through, we're going to continue to in-house where we can.
Vikram Malhotra: Just post the merger, the CHI-Dignity merger, can you maybe update us and provide your thoughts on is there potential rationalization post-merger? Are there candidates for disposition as you've now gone through the portfolio for a while, something, I guess, you may have thought about post the acquisition of CHI portfolio?
John Thomas: Great question. The short answer is no. They don't overlap in any markets today and we had lots of dialogue with them throughout their process of merging and getting their thoughts on which markets are going to support the best and where there might be some markets that they want to exit. So, as of today, we don't have any knowledge of any particular market that they plan to exit and we had pretty detailed conversations with them about this. As you know, CHI started the process of selling Kentucky One before they completed the merger with Dignity. So, they are continuing to process that sale. It's kind of unrelated to the Dignity merger. We've got great relationships with Dignity and the combined C Suite there has a heavy component of the Dignity Health team but a lot of our CHI leadership that we work directly with are continuing on in critical roles in the organization. So, we're really excited about it. We think it's going to strengthen their balance sheet and strengthen their operations and strengthen the overall coverage of our facilities across the country.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just on the development side, given the capabilities, some of your peers, maybe the more diversified ones, have outlined pipelines and partnerships with various systems, some of them stretching a couple of years. I'm just sort of wondering, can you kind of lay out opportunities over the next, call it, two years and what we can think of in terms of development contribution?
John Thomas: Yes, I won't put a dollar value on it but the clients that we have where we've done this consistently over the last couple of years and now that we're funding some development projects more directly with developers, we think the pipeline is pretty significant. I think we announced the one project today. That's with an existing developer relationship and an existing national credit-rated tenant and we think there's a pipeline with that development company and that particular tenant but there's also others, from Phoenix to Texas and other markets where we're actively working with the health systems. And we'll continue to invest in Georgia, where we have fantastic relationships and see more economic growth and opportunity there.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just, last one, just to get a sense of the closure that you announced and then you're back, obviously, pretty quickly. But just given the surprise, in terms of you mentioned they were paying rent, never missed a payment, and suddenly decided to close, what does this mean for both underwriting but, more importantly, just monitoring? You have a new team, a credit team in place. And just what sort of information do you get? Describe some of the interactions that you have with the tenants just to sort of have some sort of heads up that it's not just going to shut down one fine day.
John Thomas: Yes, it's a great question, Vikram. We always evaluate that kind of situation. We've only had a small handful over the five-year life of the company. But, in all candor, we'd been working with that tenant, evaluating and monitoring them, and had been given every assurance that they were kind of continuing on and committed to the facility and the market. And then they did a 180 within weeks and closed. So, it's hard to explain how to change that result in that particular situation. But, like I said, the upside opportunity with the other operators that are interested in that facility are better.
Vikram Malhotra: And this was in December, I believe. Correct?
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: I'm just going to follow up on the El Paso discussion. I know you said you were surprised when they decided to close but now that you've had some time to examine it, what do you think happened? I know they had recent new ownership at the hospital but I'm wondering if there was also new competition in the area or there were reimbursement challenges or maybe something else.
John Thomas: John, if I had a rational explanation for the decision, I would share it with you. I mean, best way to summarize it is that it's a national operator who had one facility in the market and decided to exit the market and do it on a moment's notice. We really had three weeks of notice before they closed the doors. So, it was no expectation at all. The physicians who were employed there and were part owners of the hospital had no notice either. And, like I said, it was a quick turnaround. That is a very strong healthcare market and there are two large, national operators that are there and they're very strong and tough competition for anybody. So, it may have been that they didn't think they could compete with them but they had for a long time and had been very successful for a long time. We really can't explain the situation but, like I said, we've got four good operators that we think will step in there.
John Kim: And on the $800,000.00 per quarter impact, should we not assume there's a termination fee you can collect? And then is it realistic that this would translate into an annualized impact? Because even if you do lease it, it may take some time for a new hospital to come in and take physical occupancy.
John Thomas: Yes, I think we wouldn't anticipate a termination fee. We are pursuing, in their liquidation process, claims, but they're liquidating so we'll have to see how that plays out. But the reason we did quantify it by quarter, in particular, is we think it could be a quick turnaround resolution, but it depends upon which operator we end up working an arrangement out with. And it could be temporary, it could bleed into the year depending upon the ability to get the facility relicensed or brought under one of the existing licenses in town and we think that's a strong likelihood.
John Kim: And then, Jeff, on your prepared remarks, you mentioned on the dispositions, they no longer fit your strategy. And I was wondering if you could provide some color on what those characteristics are.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. So, the disposition bucket includes one small building in Florida that it's just kind of away from the rest of our operations and it's a little bit isolated. So, that's the reason that one is in there. The other ones are in the foundation assets. Certainly, they are some of the first assets that we bought in the history of the company and we've been diversifying away from these surgical hospitals. And then there's an associated MOB with each surgical hospital so it kind of makes sense to sell those as a group. So, those are the reasons that they don't meet our strategy any more.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Chad Vanacore: So, just one quick clarification on the retenanting of the El Paso assets. And so it looks like Tenet Healthcare but they're only renting about a third of the space. What was the makeup of the former tenants and why are we leasing only a third of this space or is there more to come?
John Thomas: Yeah, Chad, so it's two buildings. One's a surgical hospital and one's a medical office building. And to be clear, the medical office building is not on the campus. It's an off-campus building that, primarily, the orthopedic surgeons who were employed by the hospital and were part owners of that hospital occupied at the time this occurred. So, we just turned around, they stayed right where they were, and changed their employment to Tenet and then Tenet signed a new lease on that building. So, the impact of this decision, about one-third of it was the MOB and that's what's been released. So, now we're working through with hospital operators who are interested in leasing and/or buying the hospital facility. It's a surgical hospital so not a huge building.
Chad Vanacore: Just needed that clarification. And then just one other question from me. Sequential occupancy dropped in the fourth quarter a little bit. Were there any other vacancies that came up in 4Q that haven't been retenanted?
Mark Theine: Chad, this is Mark. We actually had a positive net absorption for the fourth quarter, a small number if you exclude that El Paso hospital, but the drop in occupancy that you're referencing is a direct correlation to the El Paso facility.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: Not to ask another question on El Paso but I feel like I have to. You said you weren't going to pursue a lease termination fee and I just wanted to understand. Did you not have something in there that was contractual? And, typically, in your leases, what's the typical length that somebody has to go ahead and give you notification?
John Thomas: Yeah. So, to be clear, they didn't honor their lease, the terms or the financial terms, once they decided to close. So, we will pursue claims and I said I wouldn't expect a lease termination fee. This has been a long-term facility, been well-operated. This operator bought the operator who built it and ran it for a very long time with the physicians there and we owned it before they were involved. So, the relationship with that operator - we didn't have anything extraordinary, credit enhancements, or guarantees from that operator standing behind that lease that they purchased from another party. We typically do and we typically get - particularly if we're making a new investment with a new operator, we would get those kind of credit enhancements. It's a case by case basis. You don't have it with every facility.
Daniel Bernstein: You didn't have any escrows or money you could tap to that lease termination fee then?
John Thomas: The tenant is liquidating. So, as they collect receivables, we're making claims against those receivables like their other creditors.
Daniel Bernstein: And then you made a comment earlier about escalators at 2.5% or greater. I just wanted to - maybe if you could remind us how much of that is CPI versus fixed rate?
John Thomas: A very small percentage of CPI. We've been working those into some leases in this environment. But the vast majority are fixed. And even if there's a CPI, there would be a floor and probably a ceiling banding around that CPI adjustment.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to John Thomas for closing comments.
John Thomas: Yeah. Thank you very much for joining us today. I know there are a number of investor conferences over the next few weeks. We look forward to seeing you at those meetings. Thank you for your time.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for the Physicians Realty Trust third quarter 2018 earnings call. We are happy to report a steady as she goes quarter. Medical office buildings continue to be the strongest performing class of real estate in all economic conditions. Private and foreign capital continues to pour into our space in spite of rising interest rates, keeping asset prices very high, a good and bad phenomenon that inhibits external growth, while also growing our underlying net asset value. In anticipation of this continued inflow of capital, we entered 2018 expecting a year of low external growth, and chose to take advantage of a favorable market by pruning our portfolio at attractive prices while deploying our modest acquisition capital with existing partners. We are well positioned for this period of discipline, with the highest medical office occupancy among all public REITs, at 96%, growing cash flows, and favorable capital allocations. We don't have to grow or take short or long-term risk in different or riskier asset classes to cover our dividend, and we continue to grow our FAD. As we entered 2018, we expected to be selective with new investments and to fund those investments from the sale of older, smaller, less long-term strategically important assets to our long-term plan. The third quarter reflected those plans. During this quarter, we sold $127 million worth of medical office facilities, and deployed that capital directly with Northside Hospital, in Atlanta, Georgia, in their brand new medical Midtown MOB, a 169,000 rentable square foot medical office facility. 82% is leased directly to Northside Hospital, and the building is 98% leased overall without patient services, including urgent care, specialty physician services, radiation oncology, and outpatient surgery. We have a letter of intent signed with a tenant to occupy the last 2% of the space. This real estate is core to Northside's mission and core real estate in Atlanta's dense Midtown, located near Georgia Tech University, the Varsity, and some of Atlanta's most popular businesses and urban residential neighborhoods. We look forward to organizing an Atlanta property tour to share this and some of our other newest and best MOBs with you in the near future. Our first-year yield in this facility is 5%. While expensive, we are pleased that Northside came to us directly with the opportunity to expand our relationship with them. They selected us for this sale leaseback and agreed to a price we believe is very attractive compared to the yield and IRR of other Class A medical office facilities that have traded this year, and over the last two years. In addition, this investment is yet another in our collaborative partnership with Northside that delivers other mutually valuable benefits. We believe this asset will yield strong and reliable growing cash flow for a very long time. Including our relationship with Northside Hospital, we now have more than 56% of our gross leasable space leased directly to an investment-grade credit-worthy tenant or their affiliates. And to our knowledge, this is the highest such percentage in actual gross space so leased in our industry. Fortunately, because of the continued transformation of our portfolio toward the best healthcare credits, we continue to enjoy the benefits of a very healthy portfolio. Healthcare is local, and as we have always believed, the health of our investments is not directly tied to the credit quality of the corporate parent, but the health of the hospital, physicians, and economy where our investments are located, which has been a critical part of our underwriting. We're also very focused on the scope of services in our facilities. Approximately 20% of our buildings are anchored by outpatient surgery, and another 20% are anchored by oncology services. These anchored tenants not only attract synergistic, ancillary, and complimentary services, but are also unique and sticky anchors. Many of these anchors also benefit by grandfathered hospital outpatient department reimbursement status, we call 603. As our growth and strong relationship with Northside demonstrates, we execute our vision on behalf our investors and stakeholders every day with care. We live this out every day as we collaborate and communicate, act with integrity, respect the relationship, and execute efficiently and with a win-win approach to our business. This makes us different and better. In a few moments Mark Theine will share more details about our portfolio's operating results. Mark's leadership running our best-in-class operating platform delivered strong operating results, and we are on track to have our best year ever from operations. Mark and his team have had an eventful quarter tracking multiple hurricanes, and preparing for any recovery that would've been necessary. Fortunately our facilities have weathered those storms well with minimal downtime. Unfortunately, the storm has had a major impact on the regions affected and others lost lives, property, and access to healthcare and other services. Our hearts and prayers go out to all of their clients, patients, and their families as we do our part to aid in the recovery. For the balance of the year, we do not anticipate a significant amount of investment activity as we continue to look for high-quality assets at a price that is accretive to our cost of capital. We remain on the hunt for investment-grade quality tenants and their assets, and welcome opportunities with existing and desirable high-quality health systems who reach out to us to partner with them on the purchase or monetization of their outpatient care facilities. Under the right circumstances we may partner with private capital to make these investments in an effort to meet out clients' needs but at the same time preserve our access to these long-term investments without burning our balance sheet or FAD. A few updates. The Vatican has approved the pending merger of CHI and Dignity Health. Each system continues to work through the details to complete their merger and become the largest health system in the United States, perhaps as soon as the end of the year. Trios and Foundation legacy providers are all paying rent as scheduled, and we continue to expect to sell the Foundation assets. Jeff, will now review our financial results, and then Mark will share more about our operations, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the third quarter of 2018, the company generated funds from operations of $51.7 million or $0.28 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $51.7 million and $0.28 per share. These statistics include the net positive $1.8 million impact of a lease termination at an asset we own in Appleton, Wisconsin. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $45.7 million, or $0.24 per share, which included the $2.2 million cash impact of the same termination. The lease termination fee occurred when our tenant, Fox Valley Hematology and Oncology, was purchased by ThedaCare, an A1 rated health system and leader in that marketplace. We entered into a new lease with ThedaCare, effective October 19th, and added two years to the backend of that lease. So the lease term is now 15 years with an A1 credit rated health system tenant, all in all a good outcome for us. We continue to see strong pricing of the medical office buildings in the third quarter, and we previously announced, took advantage of this pricing to sell a $127 million portfolio to a private equity sponsor. This portfolio consisted of solid assets which we consider to be noncore because they were generally smaller in size, not leased to investment-grade rated healthcare systems, and in secondary markets. On the acquisition side, we completed a transaction that had been negotiated at the end of 2017 for the brand new Northside Medical Midtown MOB, in Atlanta. The longer lead time works for us in this regard as we believe the asset would trade at a better cap rate today than our price of 5.0 stabilized yield. If the acquisitions and dispositions that took place in the third quarter had both occurred at the beginning of the quarter, the net impact to cash NOI would have been an additional $225,000. On the capital market side of the business, we were able to take advantage of the favorable bank market environment to amend and extend our credit facility. We reduced the cost of our revolving line of credit by 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 110. We also reduced the cost of our $250 million term loan, expiring in 2023, by 55 basis points to LIBOR plus 125. Considering the effect of our in-place hedges, this term loan now bears interest at the fixed rate of 2.3%. Our balance sheet remains in great shape this quarter, with less than $100 million of debt maturing over the next three years, all of which are existing mortgages with an average interest rate of 4.5%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDAre [ph] is 5.4 times, and our debt to total capitalization is less than 33%, giving us plenty of financial flexibility to adjust to different market environments. At the end of the quarter, our portfolio is 96.0% leased, with 52% of that space leased to investment-grade rated health systems or their subsidiaries. Our same-store portfolio occupancy decreased by 90 basis points, and generated same-store cash NOI growth of 5.6%, including the lease termination fee on the Fox Valley asset previously mentioned. If we exclude that asset, our same-store cash NOI growth was 1.8%. G&A expense was $6.6 million, as expected this quarter, and we continue to expect to finish the year within our guidance. Finally, a note about FASB Topic 842, we have historically classified the indirect cost of leasing impacted by this guidance in our G&A already, so we would expect no material changes to our income statements as a result of the documents rule in 2019. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics in more detail. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. Solid revenue and FAD growth continue to highlight the company's positive operating metrics. As John mentioned, our asset management platform is delivering steady internal growth, primarily generated from in-place annual lease escalators of 2.3% across the portfolio, and an industry leading 96% leased. Our leasing and CapEx teams helped drive top and bottom line improvements in the quarter as well, including limited CapEx investment that totals just 6.9% of our cash NOI. Our operations team, known for its close hospital relationship, also continued to execute on its plan to expand in-house property management and leasing, laying the groundwork for additional institutional cost efficiencies and generating long-term enterprise value for our shareholders. In Q3, leasing activity totaled 325,000 square feet, including 283,000 square feet of lease renewals, and 42,000 square feet of new leasing. Tenant retention, excluding the Fox Valley facility and the favorable outcome, as Jeff mentioned, is 93%. Rent concessions including TI and leasing commissions in the quarter for lease renewals totaled approximately $2 per square foot per year, and $2.50 per square per year for new leases. The positive cash re-leasing spreads for the quarter were 1.7%, and included average annual escalators of 2.51%. Our in-house leasing team continues to do an exceptional job renewing our existing healthcare partners at market rental rates, and recruiting the right mix of physicians critical to creating the dynamic healthcare ecosystem, and ultimately generating strong returns from predictable long-term triple net leases. Year-to-date, in 2018, this team has saved our investors approximately $3 million in leasing commissions compared to what we would have paid to third-party brokerage companies assuming a 3% commission rate. Looking ahead, we expect this savings to continue to grow as we are proud to welcome two new leasing team members to the DOC team. Audra Cunningham, based in Atlanta, Georgia, will focus on the southeastern portion of the country, brining over 20 years of leasing experience to DOC. Elson Dimaro [ph] based in Denver, Colorado, will focus on the western part of the country, adding her excellent healthcare and REIT experience. Similarly, we added to our property management team this quarter by transitioning facilities in our third largest market, Louisville, Kentucky, and our eighth largest market, Columbus, Ohio to our in-house platform. We are very proud to welcome Barb Bennett, Sidney Turtle, Amy Washburn to the DOC family. All are impressive individuals tasked with delivering outstanding customer service and the diligent care that our team has become known for, also known as the DOC difference. We believe that tenant retention starts with property management the day the lease is signed, and we are committed to showing our hospital and physician partners, through our actions, that we care about enhancing the patient and physician experience. From an overall operations perspective, DOC has never been in a better position to service our healthcare partners, invest in our relationships, and efficiently manage our facilities to drive FAD to the bottom line by keeping occupancy high and our capital expenditures low. Finally, we'd like to take a moment to thank our operation team members and our partners for the tremendous preparation and communication during the recent hurricanes, Florence and Michael. While DOC ultimately had just 8,400 directly in the path of Hurricane Michael, the entire southeastern region prepared well for high winds and severe rain. Fortunately our facilities fared well with very minimal downtime. And we have already offered assistance to some less fortunate healthcare providers who lost their facilities to use the limited amount of space we have available in those markets. Again, we sincerely thank our southeast team for their preparedness, communication, and care. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. We'll now take questions, please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good afternoon guys. Just hoping to start on the acquisition side, there's a couple larger portfolios out there. Just trying to get a sense of where you think pricing is for high-quality portfolios and your appetite to either do it on balance sheet and/or via joint ventures. You kind of threw that out there in your prepared remarks, John.
John Thomas: Yes, Juan, thanks for the question. We look at everything. As we noted, we focus primarily on the higher grade health systems and especially where we have existing relationships. I think the two portfolios that you're speaking of -- or I assume you're speaking of are large enough that they'll probably attract some portfolio premium, but also a lot of interest from private capital. So we would anticipate the cap rates to be in the fives with various levels of quality in each portfolio. So the sizing of that and where our stock price is and cost of capital, if we pursued those it'd probably be with a private capital partner in some level of mix, so.
Juan Sanabria: Great, thank you. And then one for Jeff, on the balance sheet, I think you've got about $430 million on a credit facility. Any plans to trim that out or balance sheet initiatives that we should be thinking about thinking about '19 earnings?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, so that's going to include the $250 million term loan which we have fixed with hedges. So you're really kind of closer to $200 million -- a little bit under $200 million on the line. So, we always think about terming out our debt. We're always in conversations with banks and private capital sources to see where that pricing is. But where we sit today, I don't think it's urgent but it's something that we always look at.
Juan Sanabria: Great. And just one quick word for me, the term fee, so it sounds like you had a replacement tenant, is there any impact on a go-forward basis ex that one-time income on the rent that you're getting from the new tenant versus the old?
John Thomas: Yes, it's really a good situation. The hospital bought the group that was occupying that space, it's an oncology group, and we worked at the hospital to kind of alter the least going forward. We extended it, and the group paid us a termination fee at the same time as we entered into a new lease with the hospital so there's a momentary lapse in occupancy which hits our statistic negatively, but it was a literally a 24-hour impact on the statistics. So we took the fee in hand and had this new 15-year lease with an investment grade tenant. So it's was really a win-win situation for everybody involved.
Juan Sanabria: But the rents are the same?
John Thomas: No, the rents are lower, and that's the balance of the -- kind of economic impact from the old lease to the new lease was essentially made up by determination fee.
Juan Sanabria: Got you. Great, you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the time and the prepared remarks earlier. So, for the most part, the entire portfolio was bought in the past five years. So my question is when you underwrote those properties how did you look at the required CapEx spend at the time of acquisition, and then how did you look at any future lease expirations that may come with some needed second-gen TI spend that could impact your FAD. I know most of your tenants are on longer-term leases so those expirations may be years away, but I'd just like to get a better understanding of expected TI spend in the future.
Mark Theine: So, Jon, and this is Mark. So when we're underwriting our acquisitions we, of course, assume a renewal probability and TI associated with renewing those tenants. And we look very closely what the rental rates are and how we can renew those at least in place, if not continue to escalate them and assume a TI along with those renewals. We also have property condition reports done during our due diligence, and we identify immediate repairs needed as well as strategic capital that we can make enhancements in those buildings. So we layer all that into our underwriting and creating our capital expense budgets. As I mentioned, we're at about 7% of cash NOI this quarter, and that's where we try to budget, is in the high single digits for our CapEx spends.
John Thomas: And Jonathan, just to add, so much of our business is direct relationship negotiated transaction. So our CHI investments, which were approximately $900 million, if you'll recall, we closed a fairly large adjustment to the purchase price to address deferred maintenance, the hospitals had kind of left it in place and have spent that -- most of all that has been deployed now back into the buildings per agreement with the hospital, the seller. So we certainly take all that into account and increases in property taxes as well, which is a very important, critical part of underwriting in these high-price markets, so.
Jonathan Hughes: Yes, okay. And so Mark, is the mid -- this high single-digit as percentage of NOI for CapEx spend next year that's a fair estimate in run rate to go by?
Mark Theine: Yes.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then an extension of that, maybe one for you or John, but are physicians groups and healthcare systems, are they demanding more customized buildouts or configurations than, say, five or 10 years ago. Meaning has the cost of acquisition of a new lease inflated more than construction cost inflation, just curious to hear your thoughts there.
John Thomas: I don't think so. I mean, on a gross dollar basis our buildings, I noted, have a large percentage of outpatient surgery and in oncology facilities which those spaces in and of themselves are more expensive and require more TI. But typically this kind of the TI contribution from us is pretty much the same across the board. And then we work with the tenant to either finance that excess TI dollar or they'll provide it themselves. We just renewed a lease with a large group in one of our buildings, and we put in a million dollars of new TI and they put in a couple of million dollars of TI to convert the space. So it all gets blended in. You got to stay within market rents as you're providing that TI and that's what we do as we change those leases or change the space for them.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, and then just one more. On the lease expirations for next year, granted it's pretty minimal at only 3% of AVR, but where are those rents relative to the market, I think I saw they were a little bit above the portfolio average? I get that it's market specific but just any color there.
Mark Theine: Yes, Jon, and Mark again. You're exactly right, it's market specific. But if you look at it across the whole portfolio in the next 12 months upcoming, our average rate is $22.08, so we're in line with where we think rental rates are for those markets, and we'll work hard to continue to renew those at favorable terms.
John Thomas: Yes, and those are in place, so right now it's an inflationary market, should not catch up to those if they are at the higher end, but also be able to push those rents more than we have historically been able to in the past.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, that's it from me. Thanks.
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Good afternoon. First, wanted to just ask you a question about the capital markets, it's -- I wouldn't say you're trading at a big discount NAV per say, but your cost to capital is not what it was, and obviously it's tough to compete versus all the capital that you talked about that's out there. What are you doing or what are you planning to do to sort of capitalize on the differential or the opportunity there in terms of the assets you own and the valuation of them versus all the capital that's out there?
John Thomas: Yes, Jordan, it's JT. I think as we've demonstrated all year, we've really funded acquisitions -- we've been very selective with what acquisitions we've been doing, and in limited amount. And we funded those by selling kind of some of our older and less strategic assets at pretty favorable pricing that we anticipated would've been available when we bought those assets. So I think for the foreseeable future that will be the primary funding source. So I noted, to do much more volume, if you look to a larger volume or three or four billings in a portfolio, that we would explore private capital partnering, and 50-50, 70-30, kind of whatever blended math it worked from a capitalization standpoint. So, to be able to grab hold of those assets with our clients for the long-term, but do it in a way that doesn't impact the balance sheet. So I don't think you'll see anything different for the foreseeable future. Stock has been acting better, but certainly not today. And I think this market has got a downdraft, hopefully we'll get back to going in the right direction here soon with all the healthcare REIT stocks and equities.
Jordan Sadler: Can you maybe speak to the acquisition in the quarter of Northside, first I'd be curious what the GAAP cap rate looked if -- what the escalators are there? And separately, the extent that you, going forward, if the stock remains down here would you be a buyer at a similar price level going forward?
John Thomas: Yes, I think it's -- again, I think the asset is well worth the price, as noted. Northside self-developed that building and entered into a pre-sale agreement, if you will, with us last year. So main respects -- we look to funding that from kind of our capitalization from last year and then the sale of assets this year. So the fantastic asset, and as said, I think it's reflects off market pricing as expensive as it is. And then, from an IRR perspective, the nice kind of traditional bombs in the lease that get us kind of the high single-digits and the GAAP cap rates are in kind of the high-five range. Jordan?
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, the same-store occupancy, the decline year-over-year the 90 basis points, was that a function of the move out in the quarter?
John Thomas: The dollar was.
Jordan Sadler: Lease termination fee.
John Thomas: Dollar was.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
John Thomas: And it's the same impact, same the renewal or lack of renewal was just replacing tenant with one tenant, ability of the tenant also.
Jordan Sadler: So, and can you just break out the rent that was included in the quarter from that tenant who moved out as opposed to the lease term fee?
John Thomas: Yes. So there is something incremental above the 1.8.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Now so the rents, it actually works out about the same and because the tenant moved out before the end of the quarter, so it's -- as JT mentioned earlier, it's a slightly reduced rent, but there's going to be no net impact between this quarter in the fourth quarter because of the time that the assets sat vacant or not vacant but sat without lease.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Seth Canetto: Hey, good afternoon. This is Seth Canetto on for Chad. Not to be a dead horse, but I did have a question about the MOB, you guys acquired in Atlanta anchored by Northside. I know you said you extended at least by two years, but was there any change to the rent escalators going forward or any other incremental details you can provide?
John Thomas: Two different situations, so the Northside buildings got long-term leases in it, there's no change there. We just -- we bought those with it -- with those new leases in place. The Fox Valley situation, we kind of changed the lease from a physician group that the hospital bought to the hospital itself and then adjusted the rent with a -- in addition to the termination fee and extended the lease term so it's two different situations.
Seth Canetto: All right, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And maybe the --
John Thomas: I'm sorry with the -- and with the same box in that lease.
Seth Canetto: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, looking at the press release, you guys had mentioned the expected yield on that acquisition as 5% upon stabilization that building is 90% lease. So does that assume that the yield is lower than that right now or can you just send me a little bit?
John Thomas: You've got -- we have 1% -- we have 2% of the building. This is not currently leased, we have a letter of intent for that lease, so it's that 2% rule of the Delta, it's minor.
Seth Canetto: Okay. And then, can you guys provide same-store NOI, excluding a lease termination fees but inclusive of the six assets related for distribution?
John Thomas: We don't have that Seth. Those are assets, two of those are now held for sale. So these are assets that were selling in the near-term, so we don't include those in our same-store NOI.
Seth Canetto: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Hey, good afternoon.
John Thomas: Hi, Drew.
Drew Babin: Quick question on the assets sold during the quarter and we talked about the IRR economics of Northside kind of building up to a high single-digit return, can you talk about the unlevered IRR realized on the assets that were sold during the quarter, and then, sort of how you think about and maybe the IRR. You know from this point forward, if you were to continue down those assets and sort of how it compares to the acquisition?
John Thomas: Yes, it's good question Drew. So the IRR and those assets that we sold is also kind of a high single-digit IRR. We felt that the pricing was particularly good right now in the market. So clearly, we felt that by selling it now IRR is going to be a little bit better than if we held it for the longer term and put in the necessary capital and everything to release it, so the return on the assets was pretty much what we had underwritten when we bought them. And we felt like it was a good time to proving the portfolio a little bit, sell assets that what we thought was a pretty good IRR. And then, redeploy those assets into these higher quality investment grade rated anchored systems that we've been looking at. It was noted. I mean, those were older buildings, we're going to require more CapEx over time; this is a brand-new building and again, self-develop on Northside. So no different maintenance, no expectation of capital needed for a very long time.
Drew Babin: Great, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up here, you talked before about potentially selling the LTACH, and I guess have there been bidders out there, what's pricing look like? And should we expect that the LTACH portfolio is kind of sold, maybe rapidly over the next year or so?
John Thomas: And I think that'd be our expectation there. I mean, frankly aren't a lot of buyers for the LTACHs, but they've been performing, reasonably well. I mean, we never had a rent as your payment issue there. We've got 14.8 years left on those leases and lots of credit enhancement from the parent. So, again, we'd like to sell them but we don't feel compelled to do that do at better low prices.
Drew Babin: Great. That's all for me. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks Drew.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Just on the LTACH portfolio, it looks like coverage bounced pretty well this past quarter, do we expect that to be a trend? Or do you think it's going to be stabilizing around that 17 level?
John Thomas: I think it hit the floor and going back to the -- in the right direction. So I think it'll continue to creep, but it's not going to be huge, but it's coming from kind of the expansion of services in those buildings primarily they've been buying that the owner has been buying a lot of home health and generating a lot of revenue from their home health acquisitions. Again, which are complimentary services to the LTACH business, so I think it'll continue to improve and hopefully to talk about in the last question increase the Optum [ph] and to sell those with a good price.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. And then, related to our foundations. I know that's the plan to still sell those assets; they're not included in the one-slated for sale? And if not, do you have a timing, or is that just something that you have targeted to do sometime in the future?
John Thomas: Yes, we've got -- two are in the help for sale and we've been in negotiations and trying to finalize the process to sell those to the physicians that are currently providing services there, so hopefully that's a near-term event and 2018 event but, we can't know for sure, but we expected the -- certainly within the year but hopefully within this current calendar year.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thanks.
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to first get your thoughts on the Fox Valley asset, I don't know would there be a difference in cap rate just given the credit enhancement, if you had sold that building free kind of this -- the 10 move out versus now where you have this hospital, is there a different if you suspect in the cap rate, if you were to sell it today versus…
John Thomas: Yes, no question at all. I mean, we got an investment grade long-term lease and they're now it was a great group that we, if was the physicians themselves we bought it from in a sale leaseback. And then, they later sold themselves to the hospital, so yes, I wouldn't say a substantial fleet different cap rate, but it would be an improved cap rate.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And then, with Northside, you've now done a couple of buildings with them. I'm just wondering from here on, what sort of opportunities exist with Northside on, off campus maybe, is this sort of a tenant where you look to expand with?
John Thomas: Yes, we certainly look to expand with them. We have a great partnership relationship that's primarily different from Deeni's, a prior life to where he developed a couple of buildings with Northside which we now own. And then, I think we have five total buildings that are substantially -- are anchored by or substantially or 100% occupied by Northside services. So we have some development rights to land next to the Center Point building that -- again, it's a building that have Northside purchase and redevelop several years ago. They're in the process of trying to acquire the Gwinnett Health System, which has been approved by the State Attorney General, and they're just working through that FTC and other regulatory approvals for that. So that will be a three building to add to that portfolio if that merger is completed, otherwise Gwinnett stands on its own fine. So North Midtown building we just bought is really their first kind of move to downtown and headed toward the Southern part of the city and counties in the South of Atlanta and we would expect to grow with them.
Vikram Malhotra: Got it. And then just last one maybe for Jeff, just from a fad perspective, where should we expect that to trend over 2019, I know there's obviously the cash impact from the termination, but can you give us a sense of where just a range where it could trend into 2019 then just sort of your longer term target call it two to three years out?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Vikram, I mean I think if you back out the lease terminations fee and you do the adjustments that we talked about with the acquisitions, dispositions for the quarter just to get the timing, you'll see that we're kind of covering the dividend, we're just paying out just under 100%, I think what you'll see is assuming no other acquisitions which I'm not saying that's what we're going to do but you should see our in-place rent escalators continue to grow at 2.5%, so you can put a leverage on that and you'd see just kind of generally fad should be growing at 3% to 4% or so just on a standalone basis and then anything that we do on the acquisition side would be complementary to that. So it's kind of hard to put a target on it because we're not exactly sure what the capital markets are going to give us next year. So we're just trying to take it as it comes.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi, yes, good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to Fox Valley for a second, just from a modeling perspective to make sure what's capturing this out right, could you tell us what the GAAP rent is for the new leases, kind of make sense remodeling going forward, we have the right number in there versus that?
John Thomas: Yes. So I can tell you for a go-forward basis, the cash rent for Fox Valley is going to be just around $100,000 a quarter, little bit over $100,000 a quarter and that's 15 year lease, the escalators on that are 2.5%. So you do sort of understand right now.
Tayo Okusanya: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.
John Thomas: I will come back to you probably. Go ahead, Dan.
Daniel Bernstein: All right. Actually most of my questions have been answered, only one I had really at this point was on Northside, not so much about any of the particulars of the lease but the fact that hospital is selling the asset, maybe how that came about, did they recently developed and want to keep it on balance sheet and decide that they want to go ahead and monetize, given where cap rates are, what other deals they have and maybe is there anything, I should or other should read into that in terms of monetizations in the space?
John Thomas: No, they just like the idea of self-developing it, monetizing it, they've worked with several developers over the years and none of which are available now other than Deeni with us. So they self-developed it, had their partner RTG work with them to do that and then agreed early on in that process and I think was their intention to monetize that at the end and reached out to us to do that. So I said great relationship, they've got a great balance sheet, they have virtually no debt, they don't have a credit rating because they don't issue taxes and bonds and they have very strong balance sheet which they share their financials with us obviously as part of our underwriting but they're not really publicly available.
Daniel Bernstein: Maybe they will buy another hospital you can grow with them now? It's trend of the day, right. The only other question I have was on the 2.5% escalators you just mentioned, are those mainly fixed or CPI what's the mixture?
John Thomas: Those are fixed.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay.
John Thomas: You mean across the whole portfolio, Dan? Sorry.
Daniel Bernstein: Yes, yes, yes.
John Thomas: Yes, I mean those are actually almost all fixed in my remark. That's correct, yes.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. And that's right across the whole portfolio to that 2.5%?
John Thomas: Yes, I mean it's a little bit under across the whole portfolio, I think it's just 2.3 but…
Daniel Bernstein: 2.3% okay, all right. That's all I had. Thanks guys.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Tayo Okusanya. Please proceed with your question.
John Thomas: Hi.
Tayo Okusanya: Sorry, sorry…
John Thomas: Okay, so the new lease is 105 a month in cash and 126 a month in GAAP.
Tayo Okusanya: That's the new. Okay so that's on a going forward basis?
John Thomas: And that's a similar number versus the pro-rata amount you had in your 3Q numbers.
Jeff Theiler: Exactly. That's exactly right.
Tayo Okusanya: So that's number one. And then number two, could you -- I mean thank you for the information about the divinity deal now finally happening I think again we've kind of since another hospital merger get announced very recently as well. I mean when you got kind of feel this consolidation going on in the hospital space, what do you kind of think about that trend in general? And then two, what do you think it kind of means for MOBs and MOB valuation if anything at all?
John Thomas: Yes, so again from our perspective the mergers that we've seen or associated with. We do it very positively; they're not in overlapping markets. There's no rationalization of closing one hospital to benefit another in those particular mergers that we see dignity and CHF particular. And we see combined better balance sheet if you read the credit agency reports on that merger in particular. They know that positive impact to CHIs credit rating from as a result of that merger. So we view that very positively and don't see a negative impact, specifically on any marketer or MOB as a result of the merger. Similarly, like Baylor Scott and White and Herman Memorial in Texas, we have assets with both hospital systems there again they're complementary markets. They don't compete with each other head-to-head. We've got great relationships with those. We think that as positive positively said, from our perspective it's the ones we're involved in. We see as a win, a net win for us and others where, how hospitals in a market that are merging or become closer together like in Chicago. You certainly would see a rationalization that certain sites and locations that would be preferable to other sites and locations and that would have a negative impact on the owners of those sites that aren't selected. So it's case-by-case, I think that you know the driving point is are they in competing or are they in a competing market today or is it complementary. The Northside/Gwinnett merger is complementary as well. It's just adding another region and location where Northside is not currently in and adding a great health system to their existing geographic location.
Tayo Okusanya: Got it. That's helpful. And just one more quick one if you can indulge me, can you just the breadth on the new trios lease as well?
John Thomas: Yes, at least was the new lease cut the rents in half of the first year as part of kind of the turnaround plans that coming out of bankruptcy with the new owner? But then those grow better than average increases over the eight years and get us back to market fairly quickly and then have kind of market resets at the end of each lease which we again would you be going up not down with those market resets, so…
Tayo Okusanya: What happened?
John Thomas: Yes, so this year is exactly. So this year it's about half of what we were -- otherwise expected, so that's not good of course, but we do get substantial increases over the next -- every year over the next eight years, and should they get long-term investments…
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. On the straight-line basis, it's kind of half of what it used to be at least on a near term basis?
John Thomas: That's cash. I mean on a straight-line basis, it's about 60% of what it used to be.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay.
Jeff Theiler: So that's the cap and that's the GAAP.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
John Thomas: Thank you. We look forward -- thanks for joining us today, we look forward to seeing you at NAREIT, and we would like to welcome Baby Bowden, Benjamin Becker to the world. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. On July 19, Physicians Realty Trust celebrated our fifth anniversary as a public company. Like our five-year track record of success, our team in relationships delivered outstanding results during the second quarter of 2018. Consistent with our plans for 2018 announced earlier this year, we have had an acute focus on improving the overall quality of our real estate assets, operating results and relationships. So far this year, we've accomplished all three while also improving our balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have completed $236.4 million of dispositions at favorable valuations while reinvesting $170.1 million of those proceeds to expand existing relationships in newer, higher-quality facilities leased to strong credit tenants while also reducing debt with the balance of the proceeds. We will continue to be selective in deploying capital in this market, but remain very optimistic about our ability to continue to execute and grow in the years to come. We believe we have the best overall portfolio of medical office facilities in the United States, approaching 97% occupancy, almost 90% on campus or affiliated with a health system, and over half of our rentable square feet is leased directly to an investment-grade credit health system. We look for a continuation of this strategy and execution during the second half of 2018, with the potential for more dispositions, selective investments and an eagle's eye focus on operating performance. Consistent with our mission and vision, our ultimate goal is to help medical providers, patients and clients and shareholders realize better health care, better communities and better returns. We do this by offering broader and deeper health care expertise than any other REIT by tracking solutions that benefit all parties and by consistently executing for our long-standing industry relationships to source and sustain the highest-quality properties and tenants in the industry. We are investing in better across our team, our assets and our future. Recently, the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported on the sale of a very high-quality medical office facility in Houston, Texas at a record price. We continue to see a premium bid on medical office assets, especially from private buyers, as in the case of the Houston MOB. And there seems to be no shortage of cash available to invest in the space. We've had the opportunity to pay up more and more of these private investors, but haven't found a suitable opportunity to do so. We do not have to invest or grow for growth's sake and do not see any benefit changing asset classes in order to achieve higher yields. We have best of the long term and while ebbs and flows and government policy can favor one health care asset class over a better in the short term, the short and long-term trends of health care policy and demographic demands continue to support our thesis and strategy that we should invest in facilities that host outpatient care providers, especially providers with high market share who provide carrier locations that attract patients who live and work in favorable locations. For the latest data available, the annual U.S. health care spend was $3.2 trillion, 26% of that spend or $840 billion was spent on outpatient services, with commercial insurance being the largest payer for these services. For at least the 10th year in a row, outpatient business for Medicare beneficiary increased while inpatient business declined, and those trends continue to grow in opposite directions. As a comparison, carry nursing facilities was only about 5% of the annual spend, with government payers, particularly Medicaid, being the largest payer. We will certainly need inpatient facilities and nursing facilities in the future, but more significant growth in care and demand is outpatient services, especially specialized care like ambulatory surgery. Medicare recently proposed enhancements to the payment rates for outpatient surgery as part of their policy to continue to encourage more outpatient services in lieu of more expensive inpatient care and surgery. Health systems continue to shift here to the outpatient setting and off-campus. Off-campus project starts are expected to be 73% of the total 2018 MOB construction, above the four- year average of 15% off-campus. Technology improvements, lower occupancy cost and the requirement for more medical services within the community setting continue to prompt more off-campus development. The 400 projects completed in 2017, 64% were affiliated with hospital systems were on hospital campus, up from 57% in 2016. Health care providers self-develop 69% of the projects completed in 2017, indicative of a trend where providers have ready access to sites and capital for development. CHI, HonorHealth, Northside Hospital and many of our physician group clients have this model and strategy with a long-term plan to monetize the asset with DOC, and we believe more and more providers will continue to do so. In addition to these tailwinds for our core business, we are pleased the report continued progress with the Trios medical office building in Kennewick, Washington. Regional carrier has regulatory and court approval to complete the acquisition of the Trios Hospital, which includes the lease for 100% of the medical office building we own attached to that hospital. We expect ramp to commence immediately upon closing, which we believe to be imminent. As you may have heard, Regional Care and their sponsor, Apollo, have announced Regional Care is combining with LifePoint and taking LifePoint private in a $5.6 billion transaction. According to their public announcement, if they close, the combination of these two companies will create an even stronger health care provider with pro forma 2017 revenues of more than $8 billion as well as 7,000 affiliated physicians, approximately 50,000 employees and more than 12,000 licensed beds. Following the close of that transaction, LifePoint will operate a diversified portfolio of health care assets, including 84 nonurban hospitals in 30 sites. We look forward to working with Regional Care and moving forward with the Trios transition. In conclusion, we have spent the past five years building a great company and appreciate your support. We have evolved as we have grown with an intense focus on our health system and large physician groups, but we remain dedicated to investing in the future of health care delivery, outpatient medical office facilities. Our underlying business is outstanding, and we believe the investor community will benefit long term by long-term investments in our asset class and in particular, our organization. Jeff will now discuss our financial results. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2018, the company generated funds from operations of $51.9 million or $0.28 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $51.9 million and $0.28 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $43.4 million or $0.23 per share. This is our second quarter of demonstrating the strength in our investment activity and keeping our focus on dispositions as we seek to maximize the return to our investors in this difficult market environment. We closed on our previously announced acquisition of a $7 million 231,000 square foot HMG Medical Plaza in Tennessee, which is expected to produce an unlevered cash yield of 6.0%. Having closed on the HMG deal in the beginning of the quarter, it would have generated an extra $28,000 of NOI. Aside from the single acquisition, our portfolio strategy was to take advantage of the strong MOB market by selling a variety of our noncore assets to private buyers. The assets we sold were selected primarily based on relative tenant strength, geography, asset size and core value to the occupying tenants. We closed our first significant disposition, a 15-building $91 million portfolio at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to quarter-end, we sold another 17-building portfolio for $127 million. Since the start of our disposition program in December of 2017, we've sold a total of 35 assets for proceeds of $223 million, resulting in a combined gain on sale of nearly $13 million. The blended cap rate on the combined sales is 7.0%. These were older and smaller assets on average, supposed dispositions the weighted average of our portfolio dropped by half a year, and the average size of the buildings in our portfolio increased by about 3,000 feet. There remains a potential for a few additional asset sales this year as we still have six assets slated for disposition as well as our LTACHs, which we would always consider selling at the right price. However, we currently don't expect to continue our dispositions at the same pace as we did this second quarter. Looking forward, on the acquisition side. We have one additional asset expected to close in the third quarter that has been in negotiations since the beginning of the year, and we continue to review multiple potential opportunities from our health system partners. Importantly, if the current capital market environment remains static, we would expect any proceeds for investments to come from recycled capital or additional debt as opposed to equity proceeds. As John noted, we expect to start receiving rent imminently on our repositioned asset in Kennewick, Washington that is now by leased by RCCH. Once back online, that asset is expected to generate about $700,000 of GAAP NOI per quarter. We issued no stock in the ATM this quarter and paid down our line-of-credit by $8 million. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong, with debt to firm value of 34% and net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5 times. We are extremely well positioned in the rising rate environment we have been experiencing so far in 2018 as aside from our revolving line of credit, 99% of our debt is at a fixed interest rate or is completely hedged with no significant maturities until 2023. Overall occupancy in our portfolio remain the same as last quarter at 96.6%, with 52% of that space leased to investment-grade-rated health systems or their subsidiaries. Our same-store portfolio occupancy increased by 30 basis points, and we had same-store cash NOI growth of 3.3%. As predicted, on the last earnings call, G&A expense normalized back down to $7.1 million, and we remain comfortable with our G&A guidance for the full year of $27 million to $29 million. I'll now turn the call over to Mark and to walk through some of the operating statistics. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. We're pleased to report another successful quarter of operating performance as we continue to manage our properties efficiently and profitably. As we celebrate the five-year anniversary of Physicians Realty Trust this quarter, we are proud to report a robust same-store growth performance and our best-ever tenant satisfaction survey results. DOC's relationship-centric approach to asset management continues to enhance the value of our portfolio, resulting in higher revenue for the quarter and strong internal growth. As Jeff mentioned, our portfolio is an industry-leading 96.6% leased and delivered strong 3.3% same-store NOI growth. The Company’s substantial same-store growth is propelled by a 3% increase in rental revenues, resulting from contractual rent increases and a 30 basis point improvement in the same-store occupancy from 95.6% to 95.9%. The 207-property same-store portfolio operated efficiently as well, was just a 2.3% increase in operating expenses year-over-year. Our asset management team's keen focus on the operational excellence and the outstanding customer service is supported by the results of our 2018 Kingsley Associates Tenant Satisfaction survey. This year, we surveyed nearly 250 tenants, representing five million square feet or about 40% of the portfolio. Physicians Realty Trust received an industry-leading 77% response rate. Typical response rates for these surveys are between 45% and 55%, so 77% demonstrates the exceptional relationship between our asset management team and our health care partners. We also earned a company record score in overall satisfaction of 4.4 out of a possible 5.0, and an overwhelming 97% of tenants surveyed gave positive indicators as to their future lease renewal intentions. Our asset and property management teams should also be particularly proud of the year-over-year scoring improvement in our Catholic Health Initiatives portfolio acquired in 2016. These properties were surveyed immediately following the 2016 acquisition and were resurveyed for the first time this year. The overall management satisfaction scores improved by over 10%, illustrating the value of DOC ownership and property management. During the quarter, we saw a strong leasing momentum, and our team continues to excel at producing outstanding results by using our responsive nimble approval process as a competitive advantage. In the quarter, we completed over 290,000 square feet of leasing activity, including 58,000 of new leases and 233,000 square feet of lease renewals. These numbers include several early lease renewals initially scheduled for 2019. The average lease term for new deals executed in the quarter was 9.1 years, and the average lease term for lease renewals signed in the quarter was 8.8 years. Notably, net absorption for the quarter was essentially flat, with tenant retention being approximately 80%. New leases for the quarter contained an average rent escalator of 2.7%, while renewed leases contained an average annual rent escalator of 2.9%. The strength of our portfolio and excellent work of Amy Hall and our leasing team has allowed us to achieve 3% annual rent increases and nearly 40% of all of the 2018 leasing activity on a square footage basis. Rent concessions for the quarter remained low, with minimal free rents and TI allowances of approximately $1.68 per square foot, per year for lease renewals. And $1.98 per square foot per year for new leases. In total, we invested $6.2 million in capital expenditure or approximately 8% of the portfolio's cash NOI. And as a result of a few large tenant improvements that were completed in the quarter in conjunction with long-term lease extensions. When compared to our peers, these relative low capital expenditure investments are driven by our tenant relationships and the desirability of our medical office facilities, ultimately delivering significant cash flow directly to FAD. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018, DOC has 42 leases totaling 148,000 square feet scheduled to renew representing approximately 1.1% of the portfolio. The average rent per square foot for those leases scheduled to renew is $20.83, in line with national averages for medical office building rental rates. In close, we've worked hard over the last five years to invest in better as the preferred health care real estate owner for hospitals and health care providers, creating lasting value for our partners and shareholders. Our operation team continues to outperform, and the fundamentals of our portfolio remains solid. We are investing the time wisely to deepen our health care partner relationships, enhance operational efficiencies, increase management revenue, proven non-core assets and ultimately focus on driving internal growth. With that, I'll now turn the call to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. Devon, now we will take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, and good afternoon. Wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about the investment marketplace and what the opportunity looks like on the investment front today.
John Thomas: Yeah, thanks Jordan. There is a fairly large portfolio that's expected to hit the market soon. It'd be fairly widely marketed. We have plenty of market opportunities that we're exploring, but in this capital market, we're being very selective. And we have one acquisition pending with an existing client, but the opportunities are there. But as I said in my comments, the private bid is really strong for the high-quality assets and hard to compete with.
Jordan Sadler: So, for the time being we will continue to see you guys buy a little, sell a little here and there until either the private market bid goes away. And then pricing sort of normalizes or was up a little bit or was down a little bit?
John Thomas: Yes. As I said, we don't have to grow for growth's sake. We're just being very selective in this capital market. Balance sheet's in great shape, so right opportunities will deploy capital, if we can find assets at the right price. But the private bid is still strong. It's reflected in Houston. And again, we'll be very selective.
Jordan Sadler: Any update on sort of potential joint ventures or thoughts surrounding may be forming a fund or an alternative vehicle?
John Thomas: Yes, there’s – I mean, there are plenty of parties interested in doing something like that. I think our friends at California announced something like that today. I think there's a lot of interest in private capital pairing up with public, high-quality operators with relationships like we have. So I think that's something that is possible later this year. But again, still the underlying assets got to fit our long-term strategy.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then Trios, I didn't catch, Jeff, if you mentioned the NOI per quarter. That will come online? What was that number?
Jeff Theiler: About 700,000 a quarter of GAAP.
Jordan Sadler: 700,000? That's GAAP?
Jeff Theiler: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And do you know what cash looks like?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I think its 583 just under 600.
Jordan Sadler: And then what are the terms of escalation on that lease? 
Jeff Theiler: They're modest for the first couple of years, Jordan, and then they move aggressively as we get that lease back to market rates out there. So it was part of essentially a blend-and-extend to help that up, we'll get back on speed and excited about RegionalCare and again their bigger operation that they expect to have a LifePoint. University of Washington is also in there. So it's on the road to recovery. It will take a couple of years to fully recover on the reps.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And I guess, lastly, on the portfolio trimming side, it sounds like – it still sounds like the LTACHs are potentially for sale. As the bid there pretty firm in the private market? Or is it – is the bid as spread too wide to close something like that?
John Thomas: We haven't had a bar hit our [indiscernible]. So we’re just exploring it.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks Jordan.
Jeff Theiler: Thanks Jordan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Malhotra: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just curious on the asset sales, is this sort of a result of you relooking at the portfolio. I remember, maybe two NAREITs ago, you had hired someone to relook at credit and portfolio quality. So can you give us a better sense of like what are you actually selling and do the sales include the Foundation assets?
John Thomas: Yes, so Vikram. This is John. Yes, I mean, a part of our analysis is long-term credit quality. These were noncore, smaller assets that, again, we bought at favorable cap rates at the beginning of the company and just had the opportunity to kind of trim the portfolio and look for better uses of that capital going forward.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And are the Foundation assets still held-for-sale or were they included in this?
John Thomas: Yes, I apologize. They were not included. We're still exploring different options with those assets, primarily with the physicians that operate out of those hospitals. They continue to do well, both in San Antonio and El Paso. And we think we'll have more news to share there, but they are still held-for-sale and not included in the dispositions yet.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, that makes sense. And then Jeff, maybe just from a leverage perspective, utilizing some of the proceeds to bring down debt. Where – can you kind of maybe walk us through latest thoughts, what’s your target maybe year-end and maybe the next few quarters? And would you also look to use some of those proceeds that is most of it or the rest of it just to recycle into other assets higher-quality assets?
Jeff Theiler: I think that’s right, Vikram. I think we feel pretty good at where we are from a leverage perspective, particularly after these sales. But we would expect to be recycling these proceeds into additional acquisitions through the rest of the year. I can't imagine we'd really lever up that much, maybe temporarily if we saw something and it was a mismatch of timing. But like I said, I think we've kind of reached the maximum velocity of dispositions for this year for sure. As John mentioned, there might be something, somewhere down the road on the assets that we had held for – slated for disposition. But we wouldn't expect to be selling a bunch more of assets this year. And anything we do sell, we'd likely recycle into new health system-anchored assets just to help continue our relationships with those tenants.
Vikram Malhotra: Got it. So is the current average is a good run rate? And you don't anticipate any more, any major disposition activity for the rest of the year?
Jeff Theiler: That’s correct.
Vikram Malhotra: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Jeff Theiler: Thanks Vikram.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Speight with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Speight: Good afternoon.
Jeff Theiler: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Speight: I just had a question pertaining to your thoughts on the recent CMS outpatient rule. I guess, in regards to your grandfathered assets your on-campus assets than just off-campus assets?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. So the rule – two or three different things, one is the really some enhancements to the ambulatory surgery center rates for non-HOPD facility, that’s something the ASC industry has been fighting for years. So that's positive, those – for particularly physician joint venture to ASCs like many of ours are with ESPR and FCA and others so a very positive move in that direction. On the outpatient rates for HOPD off-campus, so the 603 assets, really no change – unanticipated change there with respect to the grandfathering. I think they do make it probably clear about the scope of that grandfathering, which it covers the services that are being provided at the time that the grandfathering went into effect, which is November 2015. So again, no surprise that clarification. But consistent with that policy inside of service neutrality, they do continue to pay back future locations. And the difference between the physician rate and the HOPD rate for those off-campus facilities. But as I noted in my opening comments, the vast majority of new hospital-led outpatient care facilities are being developed off-campus. And so those services and those rates are being taken into account as part of their analysis of where they want to place those locations. And we continue to see a positive trend. But our 603 assets, we continue to be very positive about.
Kevin Speight: Okay, that sounds good. Thanks.
Jeff Theiler: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. Looking at your most recent presentation, you spent some time talking about the momentum in off-campus MOBs. And I'm wondering if you're seeing more opportunities that are acceptable to you from a risk-reward perspective as far as acquisitions?
John Thomas: The answer is yes, John, because again, most of that is being led by health systems, trying to plant new flags in strong demographic locations and providing more outpatients, more complicated services in those buildings. So the vast majority of our physicians are specialists and providing specialized services in those buildings and not primary care, which is going to see a lot of competition from them, the CVS – Aetna/CVS merger Optum, which employs, I think more primary care physicians than anybody in the country now. So we see – we continue to see great opportunities and again primarily with our developer friends out working with the health system so Mark Davis in Minneapolis and Minnesota and other location and Jim Bremner, both have nice development pipelines with health systems. And many of those projects are off-campus or near campus.
John Kim: As part of this, are you seeing opportunities as far as conversion of retail space into MOBs?
John Thomas: A lot of people exploring that and interested in it because of the – at least, the perceived decline in some of the mall space and retail space and kind of empty boxes that evolved over the last couple of years. But don’t see as a huge opportunity we see this as a selective opportunity from time to time.
John Kim: John, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the joint venture opportunities and pursuing, I think, some acquisitions, I just wanted to clarify that was the case. And also, as part of this conversation, are you also contemplating, contributing or selling assets into a joint venture?
John Thomas: John, I’d say all of the above, I mean but we’re not – we have not executed any joint venture we would talk about it if we had. I think there are opportunity to do so is there, and we think it conversations with high-quality capital partners who are looking for a high-quality operator like us to pair up with. So at least one large portfolio coming to market. I would suspect there’s going to be a lots of private capital pursuing that. And we know it well, they’ve relationships with health systems involved. And we’ll evaluate it. But the underlying investments got to make sense to us for both the short and long-term and that will be the driver, not just doing a joint venture for joint venture’s sake.
John Kim: Fair enough. And last question for me is you may have already covered this, but what were the annual escalators on rents in place today and the leasing spreads on leases executed?
Mark Theine: Yes, the average escalator – I’m sorry, John, this is my Mark Theine. The average escalator built into our portfolio today is 2.3% on average. And in the quarter, our leasing spreads were negative 5% as a result of 142,000 square foot lease that reset back to market out of our 230,000 square feet of lease renewals. And without that one lease, the leasing spreads were positive 1.6%. But the large nature of that one lease recent to market pulled us down in the quarter.
John Kim: Okay. Thanks for the color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yes. I just want to talk a little bit about the disposition that you could complete in the future. And Jeff, I believe you made a comment, and correct me if I’m wrong, that the sales in the future could relate to health systems to improve those relationships to those health systems want to buy your assets? Or how should we think about that?
John Thomas: Yes. Mike, this is John. I think what Jeff was saying as we had the opportunity to recycle some capital into our existing health system relationships was the point he was making there. So we’ve talked about kind of 5% in the portfolio in any given year. Again, just kind of looking for assets that are no longer kind of be in our long-term expectations or not core or in markets that we pare back in. So again, we could sell more this year. There’s a good bid. We got some assets that would be attractive to potential buyers. But I think it’s – that really depends upon if we find the right opportunity to redeploy that capital. Again, as Jeff said, with existing relationships primarily.
Michael Carroll: Okay. That makes sense. And then with the sales that you completed so far to date, I guess, the one – the excluded the Foundation assets. What drove that yield higher? Was it just the asset quality was lower than the rest of the portfolio?
Mark Theine: Yes. Mike, that’s exactly right. I mean, these are the assets when we went through our portfolio and tried to look for assets that were non-core kind of reposition, these were the ones that we came up with. So that drove the cap rate higher. We’d expect, if we did that exercise again and did another portfolio like this, we’d expect better pricing on any kind of second portfolio that we do.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then related to the Trios lease, I guess, John, you kind of indicated that’s going to step up pretty aggressively a few years down the road. I mean, how does that lease really work? Is it the aggressive step up? Will it really get you back close to the old rent? Or is it just above-average bump?
John Thomas: Above-average bump. And over time, it gets us back to the market rent there. So it would eventually get back to the overhead, but it’ll take a few years. And there are several options for extension in the lease that reset it at market at the time. So again, short-term, it’s significantly less than our original lease, but we’ll get back to market soon enough.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then last question related to the LTACHs. I mean, how have those been performing? I know it’s stepped up a tiny bit this past period. Are those trending in the right direction? Or is it going to be bouncing around these high coverage ratios going forward?
Mark Theine: LifeCare is trending very much in the right direction. They’ve made several investments in the home health business and others that really strengthening their overall balance sheet. They’re going through refinancing of their credit facilities right now. Their EBITDA is picking up. So LifeCare as an organization is performing well. It’s still very tight coverages at the asset level. Again, we’ve got three assets and a master lease, and then we have the LifeCare balance sheet behind the entire lease. So we've got to good credit there. The coverages are much higher than we would like, but with extremely high coverage in Plano and kind of average coverage in Fort Worth, and we have had some recent positive developments with LifeCare has been making in Pittsburgh. So again, just not a core asset for us, we would sell them at the right price, but also don't feel pressured to sell them.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Chad Vanacore: Hey there, I've got a couple of quick ones. So on LifePoint, RCCH, Apollo taking over Trios, when do you expect that rate collection to commence? And do you think you could potentially collect any back rent through the bankruptcy process?
John Thomas: No back rent. We do have the potential for some of the rent that was part of the unsecured creditor pool, which we are a part of. And we also as part of the transaction received the land originally that was on a ground lease. So as part of our renegotiation of the lease with Regional Care took or will take control and ownership of the land for fee interest. So we’re positive about that. That was an exchange, again, for the short-term rent concessions that they build over time. We think it's imminent. And so as soon as they close there, the rent commences and they owe us the rent.
Chad Vanacore: So third quarter, fourth quarter, some timing before the end of the year?
John Thomas: 3:00 o’clock, 4:00 o’clock.
Chad Vanacore: Alright, I can't pin you down on that one. Alright.
John Thomas: They’ve got regulatory approval. They've announced it. It's just a matter – I mean, kind of all the paperwork is done. So it literally – it could be 3:00 or 4:00, but it's imminent. It could be tomorrow. We can't predict exactly, but it's imminent.
Chad Vanacore: Okay. And then just on the potential dispositions, you've gotten over $200 million dispositions this year that was sort of your target. So you got around half a dozen held for sale. How should we think about what you want to do with the rest of the year above that?
John Thomas: Their guidance was 230 to 300, I think, that probably big guidance. But again, it's really dependent upon again both pricing, but also use of proceeds. So we're in pretty good shape right now from that perspective.
Chad Vanacore: Alright, thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes, good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to the quarterly results. Again, congrats on the such strong results. The 3.3% same-store NOI, again you talked about the increase in the rent bumps being 3% during the quarter. But you said for your overall portfolio, it's 2.3%. Could you just talk about the quarter versus the overall portfolio what was kind of unique there?
Mark Theine: So Tayo, this is Mark. So in the quarter, we did 233,000 square foot of lease renewals. And where we have the chance lease renewals, we're pushing for 3% today. Our portfolio average is a little bit lower. I mean, some of the acquisitions that we've done have averaged between 2% and 3%. And so on a weighted average, the overall portfolio is at 2.3%, but we're working to move that up when we have the ability and chance to reset rents through lease renewal.
Tayo Okusanya: So I guess when we kind of think on a going-forward basis from a cash same-store NOI growth perspective, just for the rent bump piece of it, is that 3% number sustainable, or is it kind of more about 2.5% based on average portfolio growth?
Mark Theine: I think closer to 2.5%. The portfolio average is much more meaningful and weighted more than a little bit lease renewals that we're doing each quarter. In the back half of the year, like I said, about 1% of the portfolio we’ll be renewing throughout the remainder of 2018.
Tayo Okusanya: Got you, okay. And then just to confirm with all the CMS proposals from – I'm sorry, from about a week ago, there's nothing in there that feel was kind of surprising to you positively or negatively. Will you see it having any huge impact? I mean, the ASC stuff sounds like little bit more positive on, but everything else kind of par for the course and you don't really expect that to real impact.
John Thomas: That's right. I think there were no surprises there. I mean, the slight positive surprise on the ASC adjustment, which is again the industry has been asking for years and trying to move toward more parity, which makes sense for the Medicare program and the commercial insurance to continue to encourage outpatient – this is an outpatient surgery in particular. So, I’d say slight positive surprise overall. and then no real surprise on the HOPD rule
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. And you don’t really expect the HOPD rule to kind of change and again, how many of these hospitals are thinking about moving into kind of – moving outside into, for that into the communities and typing all the off-campus locations?
John Thomas: Yes. We really know, because again, when they’re going off-campus, particularly looking, they’re going off-campus looking for commercially insured patients.
Tayo Okusanya: Right.
John Thomas: And though, and again, they still try to get those services out there and the commercial insurance will attract Medicare, it’s still a much of our reimbursement generally. So, we don’t see a big change there.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay, it makes sense. Again, congrats on the quarter.
John Thomas: Thank you, Chad.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
John Thomas: Dan, there?
Daniel Bernstein: Can you hear me?
John Thomas: Yes.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. We can.
Daniel Bernstein: Yes. Hear me, okay.
John Thomas: Yes.
Daniel Bernstein: I’m just looking at the Kings Ford acquisition, which is large facility on-campus. And how are you thinking about or how is the market pricing, a secondary market on-campus may be good facility versus primary and then the same thing may be off-campus versus on-campus. Is there any change in the market in terms of how the spread between those types of assets, primary, secondary, on-campus, off-campus?
John Thomas: Yes. I mean I think on and off-campus is that continues to compress to similar credit, similar real estate. Again, as we said 73% new constructions is off-campus. And so those are going to be valuable, investment opportunities for us going forward. Kings Ford is a secondary market, I think this is reflected in a very attractive cap rate there, but a credit and a building that and that’s where we tried to hit our price. So, that is very attractive to us, on a risk adjusted basis, we think it’s outstanding.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. And is that asset triple net lease multi-tenant, just wonder to understand a little bit about more of what attracted. It is a secondary market, but what attracted you to that property?
John Thomas: Yes. You can be the huge multi-special physician group. We already have a place with M&A in one of our legacy buildings. One of the first buildings that when you own this part of a public company and they have a great relationship with that group, and that helps systems get a – it’s next to the hospitals got a very unique two-state kind of structure and that’s involved and special legislation was created to keep it there or to create that organization. So, we think there’s a very positive group and overtime, we’ll look for other opportunities work with them.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. And then I saw some comments earlier this week of KentuckyOne, I guess Blue Mountain and KentuckyOne, and that you expect the leases to, I guess, move out to take over those leases. are you expecting any kind of a leakage there on the rent side or perhaps some upside on the rent or explain to you make sure a kind of couple dollars of the basis here?
John Thomas: Sure. It’s a fair question; we expect they’re buying what they’ve entered into a lot of intent to buy the health system. We did 10-year leases with that local hospital system when we bought those assets and we expect those to carry over and their mission critical buildings on the campus of those hospitals. So, say, Blue Mountain and CHI, KentuckyOne performs very well and like it and they’re not – they’re not selling that part of KentuckyOne. So, we’ll provide more transparency there when Blue Mountain kind of completes that purchase. But we expect they need the volumes, they have aspiring changes. We don’t expect they need any and we continue to go forward with them.
Daniel Bernstein: All right. It sounds good. I’ll hop off. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Kubicek: Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew. I’m just looking for a little extra clarity on the aspects, assets still slated for disposition; I’m assuming that that is not including all tax, nor the foundation assets.
John Thomas: It’s just the foundation assets.
Jeff Theiler: And then one additional for it, yes.
John Thomas: And one additional one for it…
Alex Kubicek: And then kind of it sounds like that’s a little up in the air. But I’m – when that all comes to fruition, would you guys anticipate any noticeable movement after all that – say, after the 17 portfolio asset sale on these six tier guys’ expiration schedule looking forward noticeable movement to the lease expiration schedule?
Jeff Theiler: No, This wouldn’t really adjust for too much. Those sales wouldn’t matter too much.
Alex Kubicek: Perfect. And this kind of – this question came up on a call earlier today, but kind of the balance between specialists and primary care physicians, do you guys look at that when underwriting and managing your tenant pool and just kind of curious what your couple are sensor on the matter?
John Thomas: Yes. We focus very much on the specialist, and I think less than 5% of physicians are primary care physicians generally. Orthopedic surgeons are double digits our largest single specialty those are usually paired up with ambulatory surgery center imaging kind of full service outpatient care facility. So very important to us. We spend a lot of time thinking about it. And in looking at kind of the future of healthcare, we think those continue to bode very well.
Alex Kubicek: Perfect. Thanks for the time guys.
John Thomas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Fleming with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. 
Eric Fleming: Good afternoon guys. Question on, can give an update on kind of where things are in development opportunities in pipeline?
John Thomas: Eric, we have – our strategy has always been to partner with kind of regional developers our national developers have that they’ve held system relationships. So I mentioned this before. Mark Davis and Jim Bremner and then others that we partnered with got a pretty good pipeline. All health system anchored buildings that some, which we’ve supported with some capital, but with no developer risk. So CHI is exploring opportunities in some of their markets. And so those health system relationships really bode well. These would be 2019, 2020 delivery. So nothing imminent, and just continue to support those relationships take us.
Eric Fleming: Very good. Thanks.
John Thomas: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, good afternoon. Happy to about cleanup. So not sure if this is a question for sure J.T. or Jeff, but you have made great progress on capital recycling so far faster than I was expecting this year, but if the market doesn’t reward you with a more accommodated cost of capital for growth and say six months or even longer term. What’s the next step would you look at more aggressive capital recycling in addition to what you’ve done this year and the six slated and maybe in the LTACHs? I realize that may create some dilution, but if that’s what’s needed to close the gap to demonstrate your private market value is that something you would entertain?
John Thomas: I think we’ll evaluate that and certainly plenty of opportunities to do that. And still have some other assets that again over the course of the couple years we’d like to prune just as a normal course. 97% occupancy about 14 million square feet very little leasehold. We expect cash flow to continue to grow, Jonathan. So again, at this point, we don’t have to go out there and deploy capital in the short term. And as we look at some of these development projects coming online in 2019 and 2020, we’ll continue to grow that way. But by no means do we think we need to make any major moves right now and be patient. We’ll work through this capital market cycle.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I know, you just talked about development, and you mentioned it at the start of your commentary. I don’t you mentioned any spreads I know you don’t have any of your own development, but what are projects out there if seeing on a stabilize yield basis versus your acquisition stabilized cap rates?
John Thomas: The direct negotiated yields what health systems tend to be a little stronger in those that where there’s you know kind of a widespread RFP process get pretty tight, is kind of acquisition rates on those and 150 basis points from the other.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then just one more question for Mark on leasing and sorry you might have touched on this earlier, but have you increased where you start discussions on lease spreads in escalators relative to say two or three years ago, as the strong demand for outpatient settings has just continued unabated?
John Thomas: Yes, between, mainly between just general inflationary pressures, construction costs, we’re – we just think it as a time and an opportunity to be more aggressive, both on rate and on annual increases. As Mark mentioned, 40% of the new leases this year have 3% increases. And I think we’ll continue to see our kind of 2.5% average kind of continue to lead that.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. That’s it from me. Thanks for the time.
John Thomas: Thanks Jon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to John Thomas, President and CEO for closing remarks. 
John Thomas: As I said at the beginning we’re very excited about that the last five years I’m very optimistic about the future of the organization and continue to invest in our outpatient care facility. Thanks everybody for joining the call.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect you lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-05 12:00:00) =====

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Bradley Page, General Counsel.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s CEO, John Thomas.
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Physicians Realty Trust delivered a very solid and steady performance during the first three months of 2018. Medical office has been and, we believe, will remain the best-performing health care real estate asset class over the long term and is perhaps the best noncyclical real estate there is. As expected, the capital markets have transitioned away from public REIT equity this year driven by material increases in the 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rate just as the tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017. Nevertheless, the underlying performance of our medical office facilities is outstanding as we delivered another strong quarter of same-store NOI growth and excellent results from operations. We’re very pleased with the three acquisitions completed just the beginning of 2018, two of which were previously announced and a third completed in April that was included in our modest acquisition guidance expectations for 2018. We’re also making great progress with our asset disposition and recycling plans and expect to have more details to report later this quarter. As you know, Physicians Realty Trust has been a fast-growing REIT that, in just under five years, has built a $4 billion portfolio of medical office facilities. Our focus has been on outpatient care leased to the largest and highest-quality health care providers, especially those providers with investment grade quality balance sheets. Eight of our top 10 tenants have an annual base revenue and an investment grade rating and the other two have very strong balance sheets without a credit agency report. [indiscernible] these types of credit rating facilities and high-quality providers that are attracting the most capital and, thus, still high prices, primarily with private equity investors. Private equity have raised billions of dollars of new funds for real estate investment in 2018 and cumulatively have hundreds of billions of dollars of total undeployed commitments, many of which are seeking medical office investment. There are several portfolios of medical office buildings currently in the market and one single core facility leased to a very large health system anchored in the top 10 MSA. The process and market rumors are that these assets will price in range similar to 2017, with many expecting the high-profile acquisition to price in the mid-4 cap range. We are still evaluating all potential opportunities, but also don’t see enough value to deploy our capital in these high-profiled auctioned deals. We have always made all market relationship-driven acquisitions a priority and are proud of the portfolio that we have built in that fashion. Two of the three acquisitions completed this year added to existing health care provider relationships and the buildings were developed by and purchased from sellers with which we have had existing long-term relationships. The third facility, a 72,000 square foot medical office facility in Fredericksburg, Virginia, is affiliated with the Mary Washington Health System, increases our penetration in the Mid-Atlantic Northern Virginia DC market with a health system we have known for many years. While pricing is strong and the cost of capital that we source from the public markets remain tight, we will continue to be very selective in this environment. We have an outstanding portfolio with approximately 14 million square feet that is 96% occupied. We expect to grow our cash flow this year and have no compelling need to grow our total assets in this capital market environment. We have, from the beginning, been consistent with our strategy of building a REIT focused on the future of health care delivery, that is a portfolio of health care clients in their facilities where they provide care to patients, young and old, primarily on an outpatient setting where quality tends to be higher and the cost is lower. Our outpatient care facilities tend to have high levels of rate leverage and our provider clients are generating higher margins in those buildings than they can in their inpatient facilities or long-term post-acute care settings. We entered 2018 with a very strong balance sheet and intend to keep it that way. Jeff will provide more details in a minute, but we believe the strength of our creditworthy tenants, our industry-leading occupancy and our average lease term and the credit and geographic diversity of our portfolio creates short-term visions and long-term value, value which deserves and will eventually receive recognition by the credit agencies and the public debt and equity investors, translating into enhanced value for our current stakeholders. As announced earlier this year, we do expect to prune our portfolio in this market and use the proceeds to fund acquisitions to-date and pay down debt. We are pleased with where we are in that process and do believe we will have more to share in the near term as we complete several potential transactions. We’re also exploring other capital and strategic relationships that we believe can benefit Physicians Realty and our long-term commitment to our shareholders. We do not believe we should offer our long-term strategy or our focus on acquiring the highest-quality medical office facilities nor have we changed our opinion about development. We remain quite comfortable with our risk-adjusted return benefits of partnering with the best developers in the medical office space who have embedded health system relationships that take years to foster and blossom. Where a health system doesn’t have such a relationship, we are comfortable introducing our outstanding development partners to them and help them optimize their real estate strategy to fit their needs. We believe this win-win strategy enhances our long-term opportunities and the scope of our options and make us the preferred long-term owner of medical office facilities by health systems and the best medical office developers in the United States. Jeff will now discuss our financial results and Mark Theine will provide more color on our portfolio management and results. Then, we’ll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2018, the company generated funds from operations of $49.0 million or $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were also $49.0 million and $0.26 per share. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $43 million or $0.23 per share. While we continue to maintain active dialogue with health system executives and other sellers in the marketplace, our overall investment volumes slowed from its usual pace as we adjusted the required returns in our underwriting to our current cost of capital. As John mentioned, we continue to see a strong interest in the sector by private capital sources, which is maintaining relatively high MOB asset pricing despite recent weakness in publicly traded health care REIT share prices. We did invest $107.8 million in the quarter, most of which was comprised of the previously announced $71 million Hazelwood Medical Commons building in Maplewood, Minnesota, which is primarily leased to the investment grade-rated HealthEast System; and the $28 million Lee’s Hill Medical Plaza, which is primarily leased to the investment grade-rated Mary Washington Health System. While we are pleased with these investments, looking forward into 2018, we see more opportunity on the disposition side of the capital equation. We will work over the coming year to prune noncore assets and take advantage of the sellers’ market to improve the overall quality of our portfolio. We are in the final stages of negotiation on a 15-building portfolio sale and remain open to additional sales at the right price. Proceeds from the current assets held for sale as well as any future sales will first be used to pay down our line of credit and fund any future acquisitions and then potentially to repurchase stock. In terms of capital activity, we had a fairly quiet quarter. We issued $5.5 million of stock in the ATM early in the quarter, but stopped quickly when the capital markets turned against us. Our investments in the first part of the year were largely funded with our $850 million revolving line of credit, which had $222 million outstanding as of the end of the quarter. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ended the quarter with debt-to-enterprise value of 35% and net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.8x. Aside from our revolving line of credit, 99% of our debt is at a fixed interest rate or is completely hedged and our next significant debt maturity is in 2023. Our existing portfolio remains highly occupied with 96.6% of our space leased, including 52% leased by investment grade-rated health systems or their subsidiaries. Our same-store portfolio performed well, growing at 2.6%, primarily driven by contractual rental rate increases. We work hard to keep our capital expenditures low and we’re able to limit them to roughly 6% of our NOI, enabling us to return more cash to our shareholders. G&A expense for the quarter was elevated, mostly due to the immediate expensing of restricted share grants for the full year of 2018. We expect this to trend closer to $7 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. We are not changing our G&A guidance for the full year of $27 million to $29 million. As we look at the rest of 2018, we will be disciplined in our investment selection and focused on improving our portfolio through operations. We will also, when appropriate, engage in thoughtful and value-enhancing disposition activity. I will now turn the call over to Mark to walk through some of our operating statistics. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. The first quarter of 2018 represented stable and consistent growth for Physicians Realty Trust. Our relationship-centric approach to asset management continues to enhance the value of our portfolio, resulting in higher revenues for the quarter, strong internal growth and a continued commitment to operational excellence. Our portfolio is an industry-leading 96.6% leased with an average remaining term of 8.2 years. This unparalleled figure illustrates our ability to attract and lease space to additional physicians within our facilities, contributing to a robust referral ecosystem that helps our health care partners reach their clinical and business goals as well as increase community access to care. We believe this commitment not only provides our shareholders reliable dividend income and strong earnings growth potential, but also benefits the health system that trust us to operate their facilities. Our dedicated asset management team, led by VP of Asset Management, Mark Dukes, continues to focus on creating greater operational efficiencies, which benefit our health care partners as well. As a result of these efforts, the 215-property same-store portfolio generated cash NOI growth of 2.6%. This increase was driven by year-over-year 1.4% reduction in operating expenses and a 1.3% increase in cash revenues. Reduced expenses are primarily attributable to a decrease in aggregate real estate taxes, insurance, parking lot repair expenses compared to the prior period. These expense savings also resulted in lower recovery income as tenants under those leases represented less than 3% of our annualized base rent. I’ll now talk – I will now turn to an update on leasing activity, a team led by VP of Leasing, Amy Hall. As we entered 2018, only 70,000 square feet of leases across our portfolio had scheduled expirations in the first quarter. This limited number of scheduled expirations resulted in reduced leasing volumes for the quarter. In total, we completed 169,000 square feet of leasing activity, including 36,000 square feet of new leases and 132,000 square feet of lease renewals. These numbers include several early lease renewals initially scheduled for later in 2018. The average lease term for new deals executed in the quarter was 6.9 years and the average term for lease renewals signed in the quarter was 7.9 years. These leases contained an average annual rent escalator of 2.4%. Our leasing team remains focused on creating built-in internal growth through annual rent escalators. To-date, nearly 25% of our leases have annual rent increases up 3% or better. In the first quarter, rent concessions, including TI and leasing commissions, remained very low, with $0.98 per square foot per year invested in lease renewals and $2.29 per square foot per year invested in new leases. In total, we invested $4.2 million in capital expenditures or just 5.9% of the portfolio cash NOI. When compared with our peers, this relatively low capital expenditure investment is driven primarily by low lease expiration schedule during the year, ultimately delivering significant cash flow directly to FAD. Releasing spreads. Our lease renewals in the first quarter were down 2.8%, primarily driven by two leases which represented nearly 1/3 of lease renewals in the quarter. First, a 10,000 square foot surgery center, which was expected to enter into a new lease at closing, was delayed by the health care partner’s internal approval process. Our acquisition underwriting anticipated the rental rate for this lease resetting from $31 triple net to $25 triple net with an 8-year lease term commencing upon closing and 2.5% annual rent increases. Both closing negotiations resulted in an agreement to execute the new lease at $27.50 per square foot. These terms outperformed our underwriting estimates by $2.50 per square foot, but still resulted in a negative leasing spread. The second lease contributing to this quarter’s releasing spread was a 31,000 square foot renewal at a noncampus MOB in Maine, in which the hospital committed to taking 100% of the facility by entering into a new 16-year master lease. This long-term commitment by the hospital system demonstrates the mission-critical nature and superior quality of the facility. These attributes contributed to the hospital requesting only $375,000 in tenant improvement or $0.50 per square foot per year on their renewal as they committed the master lease and the entire building in exchange for rent 5% below their current rate. This MOB is an excellent example of the compounding power of long-term rent growth with limited capital investment required, which we believe is the key to unlocking lasting portfolio value. Despite the trying period and the REIT cycle, our operations team continues to outperform and the fundamental qualities of our portfolio remains solid. We are investing this time widely to deepen our health care partner relationships, enhance operation efficiencies, prune noncore assets and ultimately focus on driving internal growth. With that, Tina, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. Good morning. Why don’t you dig in a little bit to the for sale assets and just broader thoughts on your positioning and processes as you look forward for the rest of this year, given your comments on where the capital markets are and just having reviewing your portfolio? So I’d love to understand sort of the size and value here, the thought process and what’s being sold.
John Thomas: Jordan, good morning this is JT. Nothing surprising. It’s just we’re five years in the life of the company. We’ve acquired a lot of assets. For a period, we’re acquiring about a building a week and the – while the capital markets were open and supportive. So a lot of the assets are smaller, more rural, may have more physicians – tend to be more of a physician tenant base than a health system tenant base. So just an overall continued refocus on the quality and the size of buildings in the larger markets and help this investment grade tenant base. There’s outstanding medical office facilities in what we’re kind of in the buckets that we’ve identified for sale and that we’ve been approached by other private investors to purchase. So good quality buildings, but not long-term contributors to our shareholder value.
Jordan Sadler: Total expected realized value and cap rates?
John Thomas: I think we talked about 5% of the portfolio, $200 million to $300 million kind of total proceeds potentially. I don’t know that we’ll do that large of a transaction or multiple transactions to get to there. Medical office is trading in the mid-6s.
Jordan Sadler: And is that consistent with the portfolio that is currently under contract?
John Thomas: Yes. Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, just commentary on what’s on the market currently, what you’re seeing? I think you alluded to cap rates that are potentially consistent with last year. And I thought – would just love any color on the quality of what’s being offered relative to last year and your – from your perspective and then – and the buyer pool.
John Thomas: Yes. There’s – I mentioned there’s one kind of high-profile, very core asset in a core market and a heavy concentration of health care providers that is attracting capital from all over the world, frankly, buyers all over the world. We do expect that to trade in line or even perhaps even more aggressively than the highest profile assets that we and others acquired last year. The portfolios that are out there, kind of nice enough, I mean, kind of $500 million-ish ballpark kind of portfolio so...
Jordan Sadler: And then, just one on the asset side, the LTACHs. Any commentary on what’s happening with the coverage there sequentially? It looks like it dipped.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Jordan, it’s Jeff. As you know, we’re not in the LTACH business and so we’d certainly be open to selling those assets at the right price. Obviously, there’s been changes in the reimbursement rules, specifically around the site-neutral payment rules that would be phased in, so kind of like everybody else is LTACH covered have increased a little bit. I think for the first time actually in a long time, there’s some positive news on that front where there’s a delay in further phasing in of those site-neutral rules then there’s also this talk about eliminating the 25% rule, which would be a good benefit for the industry and for our buildings as well. So I think we’ve got good momentum, hopefully, in the LTACH business and coverages, but certainly we’re still open to getting out of those assets at the right price.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James.
Jonathan Hughes: Jeff, I think I heard you earlier say you guys raised equity via the ATM in the quarter, but that you guys are trading 9% or so below consensus NAV on average. Can you just talk about how you look at that cost of capital and why you chose to raise equity flow NAV? I think I caught that correctly.
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Jonathan. So we raised like $5 million at the very, very beginning of the quarter. So that was when our stock was kind of trading at 17s, high 17s a little bit. So certainly, as the stock price deteriorated, we cut off the ATM program.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. All right. That’s fair then. And then, looking at the same-store operating expense, they were down year-over-year, but trended up pretty significantly sequentially. Can you just talk about what drove that increase?
Mark Theine: Sure, Jon. This is Mark. Sequentially, first quarter, we do the TAM reimbursement and reconciliation process. So there was some adjustments there as we trued-up the final 2017 TAM reconciliation process. And then, in first quarter, we had a little bit of weather there from additional funds and snow expenses that drove it up just a little bit, but for the most part, as you know, our portfolio is triple net leased and the majority of those expenses pass through under those leases.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. Fair enough. And then, there’s just one more and I’ll jump off. But FFO per share was a little below what I was expecting with the difference not driven by the acquisition timing, so maybe there are bigger issues on my side. But I would find it helpful and I’m sure others would, too, but have you given any thought to maybe giving some components of FFO guidance, maybe not explicit per share guidance, but at least some parameters to kind of help frame estimates?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Jon, we try to. I mean, we give some of the guidance that we have the answers to, right? So like G&A for example, we try to give a full year guidance number for that, which I think, if you look at this quarter, that’s likely one of the reasons that the FFO probably didn’t meet your estimate. It was – we had some kind of unusual G&A this quarter, which we don’t expect to recur over the next three quarters. In terms of acquisition guidance, we used to give it when we felt comfortable with our cost of capital and had good visibility on what we could acquire. In this environment, it’s just really hard to give it. And that’s really the only thing. I mean, aside from that, the rest of our portfolio, we think, should be pretty steady and stable. So it’s – I mean, we try to give what we can and what we feel we have good visibility on, but we also – to the extent we don’t have visibility on something, it’s hard to give a guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Kevin on for Juan. I just had to get an update on Trios. Is that still trending toward a July midyear comeback?
John Thomas: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Go ahead. I’m sorry.
John Thomas: No. Go ahead, Kevin.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. I was going to say, secondly, on development, have you guys seen any increase in activity for your partners within development? And if there are any, I guess, increasing opportunity to kind of do any more mezz lending in ‘18 or ‘19?
John Thomas: Yes, Kevin. So Trios, we do see some light at the end of the tunnel. The core process is – there is somewhat of a big schedule now that, if they stick to that schedule, the sale out of the bankruptcy court to RegionalCare would occur in the third quarter. And so we’re still targeting kind of October 1 as the rent commitment under our revised lease with RegionalCare, but again, we can’t control that. We’re certainly pushing the core – pushing all the other parties to stay on that schedule. So kind of our best guess is October 1 and hopefully that may be a little conservative. On the – I’m sorry, Kevin, what was the question? Oh, development. Yes. I’m sorry. So we are – yes, our development partners are out working with several health systems and kind of predevelopment planning for some nice facilities to be anchored by those health systems. So nothing imminent, but we would expect to have the opportunity to participate in the capital stock with those developers and then the long-term opportunity to acquire those buildings from the back end at our option has been our strategy. So we’re seeing an uptick in planning, so maybe late ‘18, early ‘19, kind of starts with kind of 2020 delivery, our ultimate opportunity on those assets.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Carroll: John, can you talk a little bit about what RCCH’s plan is in Kennewick and Pasco? I know that they just acquired another acquisition or hospital right across, I guess, town in that area. Do they just want to build scale? So should we view that as a positive that it’s more likely that they take the Trios system out of bankruptcy?
John Thomas: Yes, that’s exactly right, Mike. And so they’ve acquired that facility. They’ve had a clinical affiliation with University of Washington, so I don’t want to oversell that as a balance sheet from the University of Washington Medical Center system. It’s really RegionalCare and their asset and their credit, but they’re looking to build a regional system in that market, which we think is a very positive thing. They’re very capable operators and well-capitalized. So we’re pretty excited about working with them and just kind of want to move forward. We always like to remind people that this building never went dark. The physicians have been in the building, seeing patients every day throughout this process. And I think coming out of the back end, the balance sheet will be dried and there will be credit behind the balance sheet and we’ll have a good tenant going forward.
Michael Carroll: And has there been a delay in the timing? And I believe last quarter, it was July. Is it just typical delays in the core process that is pushing it back to October?
John Thomas: Yes. It’s just the branding nature of bankruptcy court and what happens in that process. So we didn’t see a fixed schedule before. We had hoped that the court would push through the process a little quicker, but now we see a big schedule and see light at the end of the tunnel.
Michael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then, can you talk a little bit about the investment market and where cap rates have been trending? I know you put some in your prepared remarks and it seems like cap rates are still fairly low. I mean, who are the buyers out there that are still pretty aggressively bidding on this product?
John Thomas: Yes. Again, it’s well-capitalized private equity and its operators that had been in the market for years. So the kind of companies that are private equity-backed operators out of Chicago are part of the biggest buyers, but there are others. And capital is really coming from all over the world.
Michael Carroll: And are there more assets that you want to put in your for sale bucket? I know you added 8 this quarter. Does that correlate with the size of the sales that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks? Or should you expect – or should we expect more assets to come into that that’s slated for disposition bucket?
John Thomas: Yes, that’s right. So I’d like to say 5% or so of the total portfolio, but we’re talking about smaller assets primarily, so take more of those to get to 5% from a value perspective. So when I talk about 5%, it’s $200 million to $300 million in valuation. Again, if we’re looking at smaller rural market assets, it will take more of those to get to those kind of numbers. But we’ve been approached kind of off-market and would likely market some of these buildings to the investors we know that are looking for these types of smaller assets with a little higher yield. But again, the yields we’re looking at and the cap rates we’re looking at are all – for the most part, are all better than what we thought before, so accretive on a per dollar basis.
Michael Carroll: And should we expect that to be sold this year? And I know – maybe one last one for me real quick is on the Foundation. Is there any update on those sales?
John Thomas: Yes. So the – we’re excited that the San Antonio Foundation facility has fully completed their repayment plan and have been current on rent now for almost 18 months – 16 months. So now we’re being more aggressive. They’re being more aggressive. The physicians there are in discussions about capitalizing their ability to buy the hospital back from us. And so that’s progressing pretty well now. El Paso is now – is on their 13th consecutive month since – of timely and full rent payments. They are still working through kind of opportunity to pay the back rent from 2016. So again, likewise, their operations have hit to a point and a steady-state that there are discussions with them about buying the building back from us are more aggressive. And we think both are actionable in this year and, hopefully, sooner than later.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird.
Alex Kubicek: This is Alex Kubicek on for Drew. We’re kind of just looking for a little more detail on that small land acquisition you guys made in Scottsdale. It sounds like you already acquired the facility. Wondering if there’s any expansion or development opportunity there and what really prompted that move?
John Thomas: No. It was just a second component to an acquisition we did with HonorHealth. Great client and it continues to expand their outreach kind of all around the Phoenix market. So it was just a second piece of the deal that we did with HonorHealth.
Alex Kubicek: Got it. That makes sense. And just another follow-up. Have you guys like considered making a move to fix at least the portion of your revolver balance? I noticed that interest rate jumped about 30 basis points from last quarter. And as you guys continue to pull out in this environment, what are your guys thoughts going forward on using derivatives or loans to make that more fixed?
Jeff Theiler: That’s a good question. It’s Jeff. So we had just over $200 million, $220 million outstanding on the line at the end of the quarter. As we noted in the earnings release, we’ve got some buildings that we intend to dispose of in the near term. So we’re going to use those proceeds to pay down the line versus kind of fix out the interest rate on that. So I’d imagine that, that line balance decreases over the year. And as such, we have kind of a minimal amount of variable rate debt. The term loan – the $250 million term loan, we’ve already fixed the interest rate when we did that deal. So that’s at a 2.87% interest rate, I believe. So we like having a little bit of variable because we’re going to end up paying it down with dispositions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore from Stifel.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Tao for Chad. It looks like you were almost halfway through your 2018 lease expirations. What is the retention rate like for the quarter? And I may have missed this, but what kind of releasing spread do you see? And what about rent concession and TI for the quarter?
Mark Theine: Sure. Tao, this is Mark. So our retention rate for the quarter was 69% as disclosed in our supplement and that was primarily attributable to 12,000 square feet at the mid-coast buildings that I mentioned in our prepared remarks. That faces immediately release from taken over by the hospital, but in our staff becomes added as a nonrenewal and then immediately released, so it has no net absorption impact. So excluding that one space of 12,000 square feet, our retention rate [indiscernible] 78%. And again, our leases continue with [indiscernible] for 3% escalators in our rents when we come up a renewal.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And I have a follow-up on NOI growth. You did 2.6% this quarter. What is the same-store NOI growth if you include the Kennewick asset?
Mark Theine: Sure. If you included Kennewick in our same-store, as we’ve talked about that building extensively, it’s about $1 million impact for quarter. So same-store would be flat there if you included that one. And then, if you included our held for sale and placed for disposition assets, things sort of actually improve 50 basis points positive there. But consistent with our methodology to exclude the held for sale and placed for dispositions, we do not include that even though it would actually help the number.
Unidentified Analyst: That’s helpful. And on the balance sheet, you mentioned that you have like $220 million balance on the revolver. Do you expect to pay that down through dispositions later in the year? Or do you think of replacing that with small permanent capital [indiscernible]?
Jeff Theiler: No. I think, right now, we intend on paying that down with disposition.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And one last technical detail and I’ll hop off. So on Page 11 of the supplemental, so in addition to the 15 held for sale assets, there are also 8 properties listed under the other category. So what are those?
John Thomas: They are primarily the Foundation assets. They’ve been on there for a number of quarters yet. So those are assets that we are actively in negotiations with and trying to dispose of. But I personally don’t have a timetable on that right now, but we’re working towards selling those assets.
Unidentified Analyst: So no guidance on timing for those, right?
John Thomas: No. We can’t give good guidance on timing right now.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One Securities.
Daniel Bernstein: I just wanted to go back to the new leases for quarter. You indicated that the rent bumps were about 2.4% and I know you guys generally push for 3%. So has anything changed in terms of whether it’s become more or less challenging design, new tenants in those 3% bumps or whether you need to put some more CapEx TI, free rent? I’m just wondering what the tenant consolidation in the hospital space where anything has become more challenging or just very specific to those leases and you still think 3% is the right number going forward for releasing spreads.
John Thomas: Yes [indiscernible]. I think 3% is available. And again, in both of those situations, there was kind of long-term – one’s a health system with our party have a long-term lease, part of the building. So it’s really a win-win because we put less CapEx into the lease. So all of the things being equal, it’s a very strong long-term extension with low CapEx and low CapEx over the next 15 years. So 3% is achievable. Construction costs, deal tariffs and everything else and demand, particularly in the southeast with the hurricane and the flood rebuilding, the cost of new construction, new development is going up to a point where we think we may be able to start pushing rents in our existing buildings at a better pace. I think some of our competitors are seeing similar opportunities as well.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Any concerns on your part in terms of real estate taxes? Or is that really just – I’ve seen some place – some states wanting to offset the President Trump congressional tax cuts by increasing taxes on business and real estate. Do you have any concerns about that? Or is that all kind of picked up as far as the triple net structure?
John Thomas: Yes. So on one hand, it’s all part of the triple net pass through. On the other, it’s a very important factor, particularly in underwriting and acquisitions, because in the end, the tenant can only pay so much for the occupancy of their space. And again, the less we’re paying in distributor and real estate taxes, the more triple net ramp we can collect. So very important factor in underwriting. Some of the transactions last year – not in buildings that we bought, but in all buildings – they were selling at high prices and the real estate tax assessment is likely going to go and we have to be prepared to manage through that. But a very important question and something that we’re on top of and aggressively challenge.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Yes. We might want to talk some more about that offline.
John Thomas: Yes.
Daniel Bernstein: And then, one last question. KentuckyOne, the Catholic Health system’s assets near and around Louisville, is there anything new on that in terms of sale of those assets? And any or no impact on your properties?
John Thomas: No impact on our properties. We’ve been in discussions at a very high level with Blue Mountain, who’s publicly entered into an agreement with CHI about the Louisville hospitals. They keep us appraised of the process and progress, but it’s been slow. So we expect that the transaction to be 2018, but we’re – there’s no set timetable. Same thing – well, you didn’t ask this question, but similarly on the Dignity Health CHI merger, again, what we understand and what we’re told by the C-Suite of both organizations is that, that will – that is progressing. They fully expect it to close, but it’s more likely at the end of the year to – for that merger to be completed.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to John Thomas for closing remarks.
John Thomas: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you’ve heard, we believe we have a very steady and strong portfolio of medical office facilities that are performing well. This morning, the DOC team was recognized by the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal as one of the best places to work in Milwaukee. We’re very proud of our team – great team culture as we believe that delivers great service to our clients and great results for our shareholders. I’d like to recognize and appreciate that recognition. And thank you. I look forward to seeing you at NAREIT.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. In 2017 Physicians Realty Trust delivered another record year of value creating growth, while demonstrating the strength of our hospital relationships through the acquisition of some of the finest quality – highest quality medical office facilities in the world.  We invested nearly $1.4 billion in 2017 at an average first year yield of 5.6%. During the fourth quarter Mark Theine and his outstanding asset and property management team delivered 3% same store NOI growth driven by occupancy gains, outstand lease renewals and absorption, as well as attention to operating expenses.  We now have more than 14 million square feet of high quality medical office space with approximately 50% of all of that space leased to investment grade health systems and their affiliates. We believe that more space leads to an actual investment grade healthy system than any other medical office REIT or investor.  85% of our growth space is on campus and we are affiliated with a healthcare system. We believe 2017 with six of our top ten tenants being owned by invested grade credit quality providers. We began 2018 with nine out of the top 11 being investment grade quality. Our success is the result of outstanding relationships with the finest healthcare providers in the United States, our execution, disciplined strategy, experienced team and superior insight into the future of healthcare delivery in the United States. We welcome you to visit our assets and speak to our hospital clients.  Our commitment to operational excellence and asset management has also furthered our repetition as the preferred owner and manager of medical office facilities in the public REIT market and otherwise.  In a moment Jeff will discuss our financial results and Mark will provide more color on our portfolio management and results, but I’d like to share with you our 2017 success story, an update on our opportunities for improvement and our commitments to patients in the long term in this capital market. 2017 was a year for high quality. As of December 31, 2017 we now own more than $4 billion of medical real-estate assets with none more impressive than that 458,000 square foot Baylor Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center in Dallas Texas. This mission critical facility is arguably the best medical office building in the United States if not the world.  Our acquisition of this property was the direct result of our relationship centric approach to investing as we were chosen by Baylor Scott & White to step into their rights to purchase that building. In addition to Baylor, we were in fact invited by a number of hospital tenants to acquire properties through these types of rights during 2017. Such acquisitions include state of the art facilities leased to affiliates of Ascencion Health in Austin Texas and Indianapolis, Indiana, as well as North South Hospital in Atlanta. We are also invited by CHI to expand our relation with them and we did so very successful. CHI has been and continues to be a fantastic partner.  During the fourth quarter all of our investments were relationship driven and off market, expanding seven different existing relationships. These include Ascencion Health, facilities in Tennessee and Indianapolis, USPI and Tennessee in Arizona, North South Hospital and their newest affiliate Gwinnett Health in Atlanta.  We also acquired a brand new on campus medical office facility from Dignity Health in Phoenix, in a strategic and creative structure that enhanced our relationship with IMS, our existing large multi-specialty physician group partially owned by Dignity Health. This acquisition helped further Dignity’s goals of getting the aligned IMS physicians on to their new hospital campus, as well as strategically positioning IMS in the market.  CHI and Dignity Health have announced their intentions to merge and we are excited to explore future opportunities with the new combined health system once completed. We understand they are working towards closing that merger later in 2018. Following our investments in 2017, Physicians Realty Trust now owns 14 million square feet that is 96.6% leased, again with over 50% of that space leased directly to investment grade rated healthcare systems and their subsidiaries. During 2017 the weighted average age of our building improved from 20 years to 18 years and the average size of our facilities increased from 44,000 feet to 50,000 feet.  Our occupancy leads the public medical REIT industry and our average lease term is 8.3 years. Our portfolio is extensive, stable and resilient; a combination which we believe will produce reliable dividends for years to come.  2017 was an eventful year in medical office real-estate, with industry data indicating that more than $13 billion of facilities were purchased, highlighted by three major portfolios that traded at set-back cap rates.  We have grown rapidly since our humble beginnings transforming Physicians Realty Trust to make small scale investor in medical office buildings to their premier partner of the largest and most extensive healthcare systems in the U.S. Through our buildings we help healthcare systems service their physicians, providers and most importantly patients as they visit our facilities for their outpatient healthcare services.  Our operating platform led by Mark Theine improved our operating metrics across the board that focus on people, process and performance. Last year we seamlessly absorbed over 3.3 million square feet in medical office space from new acquisitions. In 2017 our leasing team also created significant shareholder value. Mark will provide more details in just a minute.  Our commitment to service excellence drives retention at reasonable rental rate growth and just as importantly as we saw and realized in 2017, when healthcare systems had the choice of who owns their medical office building facilities on their campus or mission critical off-campus locations, they choose Physicians Realty Trust.  I’d like to update you on Foundation and Trios. As you know, each had challenges last year. We are very pleased to report that Foundation facilities in San Antonio paid all of their rental obligations in 2017 and have made additional rent payments to catch up on their 2016 back rent days. They are substantially in compliance with their lease obligations and we continue to process with them the opportunity to sell those facilities back to the physicians.  El Paso has paid their hospital rent consistently since April 1, 2017 and we continue to work with them to catch up on their prior rent obligations, which have been previously shared with you. The Oklahoma building is stable and we continue to seek to rent the space vacated by Foundation Healthcare, but all of the non-Foundation related tenants in that building have performed further lease obligations.  Trios continues to filter through the bankruptcy reorganization process and Regional Care, a well capitalized hospital operator backed by Apollo Capital, continues to work toward an acquisition of the hospital. We have a tentative agreement with Regional Care to lease 100% of our medical office building, if they are successful in acquiring the Trios Hospital Operations and we understand they are making slow but steady progress in negotiating agreements with all the material parties necessary to acquire that operation, including the Attorney General of the State of Washington.  It’s important to remember that our medical office facility leased to Trios is 100% occupied and never went dark. In fact physicians in the hospital are there today treating patients and serving that community. The same is true with the Foundation Facilities in San Antonio and El Paso.  We added dedicated credit risk expertise to our underwriting asset management team and just as importantly focused our business development and investments more in Investment Grade Health Systems to enhance the overall stability of our portfolio as reflected in the improvements in the credit quality of our cost impacts. These are great improvements for the further, but the positive developments in San Antonio, El Paso and Trios are a tribute to our team’s healthcare expertise and ability to manage challenges.  Congressed passed and the President signed Sleeping Tax Legislation in 2017. These new laws dramatically changed our corporations and pass through entities like real estate investors and their owners are taxed. We are excited that individual shareholders will now have a lower effective tax rate on their REIT dividends, enhancing your after tax returns from owning shares of Physicians Realty Trust. This rate is now an effective tax rate of 29.6%.  Also new limits on the ability to deduct the interest expense without similar limitations on rent expense, potentially enhance the benefit of renting versus owning medical office space for our physicians and taxable providers. These and other changes in the tax laws are a net benefit to the Physicians Realty Trust.  In contrast, the financial markets renewed expectations of economic growth, driven in part by the tax law changes as well the Federal Reserve’s decisions to increase interest rates, as call to investors rotate their investments from REIT equity to more economically cyclical securities. While growth and employment are great for our core business, as our providers gain better and more secure reimbursement, the short term impact of the lower stock price in REITs and as a result of Physicians Realty Trust and all of our REIT peers began 2018 year-to-date with lower stock prices.  History shows us that REITs can deliver attractive total shareholder returns and periods of rising interest rates as real estate can increase in value as a hedge against inflation. REITs with strong balance sheets and low ratios of debt, especially variable debt in relation to their total capitalization tend to fare better.  Physicians Realty is well positioned as we enter 2018 with very little short term debt. We termed that our share term debt with the 10 year publically traded bonds in December 2017 and we have substantial liquidity available to us.  We’ve used this capital selectively, as we continue to evolve and improve the overall quality of our medical office facilities and investments, knowing where and when we can deploy capital accretively and for the long term benefit of our shareholders. Our board and team are committed to patience in this capital market, maximizing the performance of our industry leading occupancy and quality, while also pruning assets that no longer fit our long term plans.  This year we also welcomed and would like to introduce Pam Kessler as our newest Board Member. Ms. Kessler brings 11 years of experience as a Senior Executive of LTC, a REIT focused on the long term care industry and she adds a depth and an excellent council to our broad and her experience and leadership in previous capital market cycles like we are experiencing now is invaluable.  Jeff and Mark will now update you on our financial and operating results. Then we’ll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff. 
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. I’d like to start with a few general comments before discussing our quarterly results. Our company along with the rest of REIT sector has been underperforming over the past couple of months, primarily due to macro economic factors. That’s said, we remain highly confident in our business plan and asset class over the long term. Well it’s true that MOBs has been the best performing healthcare asset class over the past two years. We feel strongly that this outperformance will only continue to grow over time. Therefore we remain optimistic on our core business of owning and operating outpatient medical office buildings leased to premium healthcare systems. After all, our ability to source these opportunities and effectively manage our portfolio has delivered extraordinary returns to our shareholders.  Since our IPO in 2013 we have generated a 69% total return versus a negative total return for the overall healthcare REIT sector. Importantly, our total return during this time period has also doubled that of the overall REIT index and more than doubled that of the composite of our closest MOB peers.  While we have experienced rapid growth in our portfolio over this time, we also truly understand cost of capital. That is why we evaluate every acquisition by our current ability to fund it using a conservative mix of equity and debt. This philosophy makes certain activities like development difficult for us, as we are hesitant to commit to long periods of capital spending when it’s impossible to know the overall cost to our shareholders.  The events over the past couple of months have certainly reinforced that macro factors can quickly and dramatically impact a REITs cost of capital, which can make seemly good developments turn into value destroyers for years to come.  For 2018 our focus will be on squeezing the best performance we can out of our portfolio, while keeping our occupancy high and our capital expenditures low, so that we can distribute that money to our shareholders instead. We will also be flexible in our growth strategy and be conscious of market conditions on our acquisition plans. We do believe however that our relationships in the healthcare industry give us a better chance than any other MOB company, to find the occasional deep value opportunities that meets our cost of capital.  Turning to our quarterly results, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company generated funds from operations of $46.2 million or $0.25 per share. Our normalized funds from operation were $49.6 million. Normalized funds from operations per share were $0.27 and our normalized funds available for distribution were $44.2 million or $0.24 per share. For the full year of 2017 our normalized FFO per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over the comparable period last year. In the fourth quarter of this year our management teams unparalleled relationships in the healthcare industry yielded $387 million of additional investments. These included some of our previously announced [inaudible] generated deals, where leading health systems like North South and Gwinnett exercise their right to choose DOC as a landlord, as they felt we were the partner that best understood the healthcare industry and their business.  Our acquisitions were fairly well distributed throughout the quarter. Had they all occurred at the beginning of the quarter, we would expect them to generate an additional $2.6 million of cash NOI.  In this first quarter of this year we have closed on two additional investments for $100.7 million. We also have three additional acquisitions opportunities that we have been negotiating over the past few months.  We are working towards respective purchase and sales agreement for each of these acquisitions which will total roughly $180 million. We believe that we can fund these deals with recycled capital from future dispositions and our line of credit.  Turning to operations, our same store portfolio which represents 66% of our total portfolio generated year-over-year cash NOI growth of 3%, mostly driven by contractual rent growth and partially offset by increased operating expenses.  Our portfolio remains highly utilized with 96.6% of our space currently leased and our recurring capital expenditures were well contained at only 6% of cash NOI. This all translates into the generation of more cash flow that we are able to return to our investors.  We issued our second public bond in the fourth quarter fixing $350 million of debt at a rate of 3.95%. We issued some opportunistic equity in the fourth quarter on the ATM amounting to $40 million, which was used to partially fund our acquisitions leaving us with only $80 million remaining on the line of credit at the end of the year.  Our debt to total capitalization in the fourth quarter was 31% and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.7 times. We feel comfortable with our current leverage and debt profile, with only 16% of our debt maturing over the next five years.  We came in at almost exactly the mid-point of our $22 million to $24 million G&A guidance for the year, incurring a total of $22.96 million of G&A in 2017. Looking forward, G&A for 2018 should be between $27 million to $29 million.  Finally in terms of the acquisition guidance, we expect a volatile capital environment in 2018 and will adapt to our changing capital costs as necessarily. We are therefore not providing explicit acquisition guidance for the year.  We are confident however that we will continue to have a distant advantage on off market acquisition opportunities through our established relationships with leading healthcare systems, which may lead to some investment opportunity. But as we view the market today its unlikely to reach the volume we have come to expect over the past several years.  With that, I’ll turn it over to Mark who will walk you through some of our operational statistics in more detail.
Mark Theine: Thanks Jeff. In 2017 was the landmark year for DOC with $1.4 billion in total investments, demonstrating the power of our hospital relationships though the acquisition of some of the highest quality medical office facilities in the country. During the year we seamlessly integrated over 3.3 million square feet and 260 new tenants to our ownership.  In total, we acquired 40 facilities this year which were 98% leased with an average lease term remaining of 9.8 years upon closing. Approximately 70% of these acquisitions are multi tenant facilities, now under DOC management, including several of the largest and most complex facilities that we’ve acquired to-date. These properties require the skillful coordination, constant communication and diligent care that our team has become known for, also known as the DOC difference.  In fact the average size facility acquired this year was nearly 55% larger than those acquired in 2016, averaging nearly 83,000 square feet. Similarly, the average age of the acquisitions improved in 2017 by nearly half. From 20 years in 2016 to 11 years in 2017.  Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the credit strength of our tenant base also improved with the 2017 acquisitions, as 49% of our occupancy is from investment grade quality tenants compared with 44% a year ago. Altogether we believe that our 2017 investments will provide outstanding returns for years to come and demonstrates the standard of exceptional quality to expect from acquisitions in the future.  Total same store NOI for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2017 increased by 3%, led by 3.7% growth from multi tenant facilities and 2.2% for single tenant facilities. The same store increase was driven by a 3.3% increase in rental revenue attributable to the increase in same store occupancy to 95.6% from 95.3% in the comparable periods. Same store revenue was also fueled by contractual annual rent escalators that average 2.3% across the portfolio, which is predictable, stable and not influenced by operating results or flu seasons. Looking ahead we expect that our same store cash NOI growth will be between 2.5% and 3% over the next 12 months, unadjusted for any perspective distributions.  Turning to leasing activity, our leasing team has created significant shareholder value by completing over 1 million square feet of leasing activity in 2017. We continued to see strong leasing momentum and our team has produced outstanding results through our responsiveness and streamlined approval process.  Overall in 2017 we completed 840,000 square feet of lease renewals with an average lease term of nine years and a 78% retention rate. Additionally, we completed 224,000 square feet of new leases with an average lease term of 9.2 years. For the fourth quarter specifically we completed 464,000 square feet of lease renewals with an 89% retention rate. Our leasing expense for the quarter were a negative 2.2% as a result of an early blend and extended master lease, but its excluded the leasing spreads for the quarter were a strong 6.15%.  We are proud to report that rent concessions in the quarter are among the lowest in the industry with no free rent and very little TI required to renew our existing healthcare provider partners. In the fourth quarter TI for lease renewals was $0.54 per square foot per year on a weighted average basis. In fact, approximately 75% of the lease renewals completed in the quarter did not require any TI to renew the lease and the remaining 25% averaged $2.10 per square foot per year.  Tenant improvements for the new leases were approximately $4.75 per square foot per year during the quarter. In total we invested $15.3 million in tenant improvement and leasing commissions in 2017, or just 6.2% to the portfolios NIO. The low investment in capital expenditures relative to our peers is driven primary by our low lease expiration schedule.  Our portfolio known for its high occupancy and low turnover will continue to deliver significant cash flow directly to FAD as it requires little tenant improvement and leasing commissions due to our staggered lease exploration schedule. In 2018 we have just 2.9% of the portfolio scheduled to renew and have no more than 8% of the portfolio schedule to renew in any one year through 2025. Our lease exploration schedule is deliberately laddered to staying at lease exploration dates, ultimately driving a predictable, growing cash flow for our investors for years to come.  As we begin 2018, we have built a high quality portfolio that is operating well. With an exceptional asset management and leasing team that has and will continue to deliver bottom line results. Our commitment to relationships and service excellence for our healthcare partners is the trademark of the DOC difference and what we believe ultimately drives tenant retention, cost efficiencies and a profitable consistent growth for our shareholders.  With that, I’ll now turn the call back to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. I’d now be happy to take questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with our question. 
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning; thanks for the time. Jeff, you talked about acquisitions and I think I heard $180 million are under contracts, but are not giving formal guidance beyond that. But it sounds like it’s fair to assume some details will happen. So how do plan to fund those details given the leverage you know will be kind of near the high end of your previously stated target range and its share still traded at double digit discount to NAV. 
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah, it’s a great question Jonathan. So if you look at what we completed in the first quarter plus what we announced as future additional acquisitions that are under some form of LOI at this point, that would bring us right up to kind of close to 40%, which is probably near the top of our target leverage range.  We are planning on – we have assets later for disposition and some other assets that we are thinking about disposing, which I think could fund the majority of those acquisitions in a leverage neutral manner and then as far as future acquisitions over that, you know I think we tried to be clear in the prepared remarks that we are really going to evaluate that, such that it only makes sense at our current cost of equity capital. So we think it will be fewer overall acquisitions or lower overall volume, but to the extent that we do additional acquisitions, they will be value enhancing at our current cost of equity and debt.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, that’s fair and then you know I know you sourced a lot of deals through the relationship network, generally get better pricing because of that. But have you seen any change in cap rates for marketed deals given the rise in rates over the past several months?
Jeff Theiler: I mean all the recent parameters have been in line with last year. Still a lot of capital flowing into this space primarily by private investors. There is a deal in the market now we’re not anticipating into the year, but at the same mid to low five cap rate is the discussion. 
Jonathan Hughes: Is that a portfolio of just a large single asset?
Jeff Theiler: Portfolio. 
Jonathan Hughes: And then just one more, and then I’ll jump off. So with lower external growth prospects focus well kind of shipped internally for growth, and Mark you touched on this earlier, but could you just talk about expectations for specific same store growth opportunities and how that should trend throughout the year within that kind 2.5% to 3% range. 
Mark Theine: Yes, sure Jonathan, good morning. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect that our same store looking forward will be in the 2.5% to 3% range. One of the benefits that we are starting to see as a five year old company is the same store portfolio is increasing in size. 66% of our portfolio is currently in the same store and then have some imbedded growth rate in the contractual rent increase of 2.3%. The same store portfolio is very well leased at 95% or 96%. So we see maybe just a little bit of upside in that, but the majority of same store going forward will be based upon the contractual rent bumps built into the leases.
Jonathan Hughes: Are there any expense savings opportunities in there with the larger company gaining scale on certain markets, you know you can leverage contracts across that portfolio. 
Mark Theine: Absolutely! As we gain concentration in certain markets, we’ll continue to benefit from some economies of scale. Our portfolio is 91% triple net lease or absolute triple net lease. So a lot of that savings will go back to tenants, but we will certainly experience some of that ourselves as well. 
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, that’s helpful. I’ll jump off, thanks for talking my questions. 
John Thomas: Thanks Jonathan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. 
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, good morning. So I want to just come back to the acquisition market a little bit. It sounds like you know there is still – it’s still pretty headed in terms of pricing. What would we expect or should we expect for the $180 million or any other opportunities, given where your stock price is today cap rate wise. 
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, hey Jordan. So for the $180 million, it’s hard to exactly because we are still finalizing the negotiations, but at the point we’d expect the high five cap rate on those acquisitions. And then as we look forward its – I mean look, we are just going to really be patient and see where we are in a cost of capital standpoint, see where the market is shaping out and that’s really going to dictate the volume for the rest of the year. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay, and that’s to be funded predominately from dispositions it sounds like. So are the dispositions… 
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah.
Jordan Sadler: Is that right? 
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, that’s right. 
Jordan Sadler: And so that’s – the assets slated for sale will be in a range of 150 to 200? Is that a fair assumption or is that…
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah, I think that’s fair.
Jordan Sadler: Any additional assets in there? Okay.
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah, that’s fair. I mean there’s other assets. You know the VL Tax for example that we could put in there which we are not really exclusively modeling, but that general range in correct. And the MOVs, I mean you didn’t ask the question, but you probably will. They’ll probably sell in the range of the mid six cap rates. 
Jordan Sadler: In mid six’s, okay perfect! Thanks for jumping ahead of me on that one. It saved me a question. And then the last question I have for you is on Trios. You’ve got – it sounds like something tied up potentially if the bankruptcy goes through with RCCH. What would the rate be or what would the haircut be relative to the previous in place rent?
John Thomas: Yeah, we can’t share that just yet, but you can expect it will be a cut near term with the opportunity to make that up over the long term under renewed lease. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Any anticipation or expectations on timing? It seems like your getting some pretty good progress.
John Thomas: Yeah, we hope it’s alive first. We’ve done what we can control and you we’re just bogged the processes and it’s just clogging through the bankruptcy process and in the State Attorney General’s Office; that’s our expectation, our hope.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, I’m going to hop out of the queue. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks Jordan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Bernstein: Hi, good morning. 
John Thomas: Good morning.
Daniel Bernstein: I just wanted to – I may not have head it, but is the 3% same store NOI growth that you posted this year, that excludes Kennewick. What would be the same store growth if you included Kennewick. 
Jeff Theiler: Yes sir, that same store number does exclude Kennewick. If Kennewick was included, it would have been about a positive 63 basis points. 
Daniel Bernstein: And then the 2018 guidance, is that including anything from getting that back from the Trios Kennewick property?
John Thomas: No. 
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Do you expect – is the expectation that you’ll have some additional rent in 2018 from Trios or is that just too early? 
John Thomas: Yeah, I mean that’s our expectation, that’s what we are just talking about Dan. We hope that we – begins again in July, around July 1. It could be sooner, but could be later but that’s our...
Daniel Bernstein: Okay, so there is a little bit of upside in the same store. 
John Thomas: That’s right.
Daniel Bernstein: If you get through March, okay. And then one other question, in terms of the quality of assets that you are seeing out there and cap rates. You know cap rates obviously as you just said are staying very low and there are lots of private equities. Is there any moment in the A assets versus B assets or on-campus versus off-campus. That might give you a little bit of wiggle room to maybe make some more acquisitions this year? Not that you would dip down in quality, but are you seeing any better pricing and maybe some of those off campus assets at this point?
John Thomas: Yeah, I think even on the portfolios we saw three large portfolios, all trades up five and that did reflect the quality of those assets. One portfolio traded in the mid-sixes, which for a lack of better word, there were some A's and B’s in that portfolio, so it was not as – it was more mixed. So there is some differentiation in the market, but you know cap rates are just compressed across the spectrum, you know for all the levels of medical office. We haven’t seen any movement there.
Daniel Bernstein: Alright, and one more quick one if I can and I’m sure somebody is going to ask it and has that on their list, but given the discount to NAV, what kind of – what’s your thought process on buybacks?
John Thomas: I think our broad will consider picking it all out, options with proceeds from dispositions, but right now it’s not an expectation.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay, that’s good. Thanks very much for the color guys. 
John Thomas: Yes, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
John Kim: Thank you. So your multi tenant MOB is now consist of 59% of your portfolio and that’s up from 54% last quarter. Do you have a goal of where you want this to go to? 
John Thomas: You know John, that’s a great question. We’ve had a lot of discussion about kind of the science of the asset mix between single and multi tenant. We are benefiting and Mark’s team is squeezing a lot more return out of the multi tenant buildings right now, but they are highly leased. So, I don’t think we have a specific target on multi tenant versus single tenant.  We do have specific goals to continue to move up the healthcare system on campus or affiliated to 90% or more, we are 85% today. So we have some room and opportunity there and as we see acquisitions throughout the year, whether they be single tenant or multi tenant, you can expect them to be highly leased and occupied by credit grade to help the system.
John Kim: You know I was going to ask about that. Because the single tenant you have higher occupancy mostly likely lower CapEx, which you highlighted in your prepared remarks and so I was just wondering how you balance the benefits versus the potential higher growth in the multi tenant assets.
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, I mean it certainly goes into the underwriting and the pricing of the assets.
John Kim: Okay, and then I think John you mention the willingness to expand your relationship with Catholic Health. You know currently they are 19% of your revenue. I’m just wondering, are you limited by the credit rating agencies to have any tenant more than 20% of your sequential portfolio?
John Thomas: I wouldn’t say specifically limited, but it is something that we manage to and are very cognizant about. As you know CHI is really 12 different tenants, 12 different credits. We think about it that way, but we also think about the aggregate as well. So today being – and being with the health which they are merging with is the higher credit rating for CHI. So it’s going to be an enhancement of the total balance sheet once those two come together. So, once they do complete their merger, we’ll think about those as one aggregated tenant and show that, but at the same time each market stands on its own from a credit perspective. 
John Kim: Do the rating agencies look at it as one entirety or multiple entities? 
John Thomas: No multiple. 
John Kim: Okay and in this quarter you had an impairment of $965 million. Was that related to Kennewick or assets held for sale or maybe something else?
Jeff Theiler: To be clear John, not to correct you, its $965,000, and yeah, it was tied to one small asset that we sold, but we just sold it out at a loss.
John Kim: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with you questions. 
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for talking the question. Maybe just stepping back, you know a couple of years ago you sort of embarked on this transportation if I may say that, but it was trying to take the company to a level where – or the portfolio to ‘higher quality or lower cap rate or different markets.’  I think you also sort of over the last few months said that you’d start disposing some lower quality assets that would maybe just get the portfolio up. Given sort of where we are with the market in general, obviously lot of it is not in your control. Can you maybe just talk us through over the next, assuming we stay in a very bumpy environment, sort of where are we in this process today and what can you do over the next 12 months to maybe keep that direction. 
John Thomas: Yeah, so I think as we shared Vikram and good morning, the – we have $180 million or so kind of under contract as well, the deals that evolved out of the fall and as we sit here today we fully expect to fund most if not all of it through dispositions. So there will be a slight dilution. We just shared that those dispositions would probably be in the mid-sixes range, most likely in the acquisition or in the high fives just under six.  So slight dilution in cash, but a substantial improvement in quality and again towards the evolution of where we want to go and continue to go. But we have a very strong stable portfolio and as Mark pointed out, it’s going to – we expect that to grow 2.5% to 3% this year on cash flow. We are in a fantastic position being in this cycle and we’ll be patient for the long term. 
Jeff Theiler: Vikram, just to add on. I mean the bad thing about MOB pricing being so high right now is it’s hard to buy things, but the good thing is that its earlier to dispose of assets. So we are really trying to take advantage of the market where we can.
Vikram Malhotra: Yeah, that makes sense. And then just on the – just going back sort of Trios, you sort of highlighted maybe mid-year is when you start getting income back. Just maybe update us on the broader portfolio, anything else that stands out, that’s been on the watched list, anything you are monitoring?
John Thomas: No, I mean brining in the credit analysis mid-year last and kind of improved process internally. We significantly improved overall AR in our process and kind of understanding of what’s going with our tenants and with [inaudible] of asset management and financial review. So we are really excited about the stability of the tenant base overall. 
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, great. Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. 
Chad Vanacore : Thanks and good morning. 
John Thomas: Hi Chad. 
Chad Vanacore : So I was just thinking about your cash punching experience in the quarter compared to contractual rents. Were there any other slow payers out there other than Trios and then you mentioned Trios, it’s 100% occupied, but I don’t think you recognize any rents for them in the quarter. So what is the back rent currently owned?
John Thomas: Back rent on Trios, when we stopped incurring it and wrote off a straight line two quarters ago, we can get you that number.
Jeff Theiler: But we don’t anticipate collecting that back rent Chad. 
Chad Vanacore : Okay, but Jeff on any other slow payers out there that maybe put your cash collections at lower than your contractual rents?
John Thomas: Not material. 
Jeff Theiler: Nothing material, no.
Chad Vanacore : Alright. Just one more from me, on dividend payout expectations, it looks like you are running in mid to 80% of FFO. I mean should we expect you to continue around that level for the foreseeable future? 
John Thomas: Yeah, I mean Chad look, it’s always something that we are evaluating every quarter. You know certainly if you have really accretive acquisitions, you are able to raise that dividend faster. So it’s hard to say through the balance of the year how fast we can grow. Our AFFO, a lot of is just depending on external growth. So you know we’ll evaluate it and we think we are at a pretty good level at this point. So we’ll continue to evaluative it through the rest of the year. 
Chad Vanacore : Alright, I’m going to sneak one more in here which is on cap rates. So you said that, you did in the quarter – at lease during the first quarter some acquisitions in the mid to low 5% range. You seem to have LOIs, you can call it mid to high 5% range. Previously you expected I think 5.5% to 6% cap rates going forward. Are we still in that range or is that range maybe widened out a little bit?
Jeff Theiler: I would say we are still in that range, the mid 5.5% to 6%. 
Chad Vanacore : Alright, that’s it from me thanks.
John Thomas: But obviously you know where we see opportunities, but again we are going to be patient with seeing that thing.
Chad Vanacore : Got it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Carroll: Yeah thanks, just a few quick ones on Trios. I think there are still a lot of questions on them. But I know Regional Care has been working on acquiring Trios for several quarters now. Is there anything specific heading up that deal or is just a slow bankruptcy process?
John Thomas: It’s a slow bankruptcy process. They kind of have three major creditors if you will. Goldman Sachs owns the hospital real estate and we own the medical off building leased to the hospital, and then you have equipment vendors and then you have other creditors, unsecure creditors out there and then you have I think most of the staff in the hospital, the nurses and others are unionized, we got to work though that and ultimately you got the attorney general of the State of Washington to sign off on it. So painfully slow and you know we are being patient because we executed our deals and are moving forward very quickly and this is just the process of a government entity bankruptcy. 
Michael Carroll: Okay, and then if the doctors are still residing in the – and operating within the MOB right now, correct me if my wrong, you are not collecting any rent from them. I guess why is that if they are still making money doing their practices. Are you able to collect rent on that?
John Thomas: No, I mean the bankruptcy process stays off cash flows and mange through bankruptcy. So, at some point the bankruptcy court and we’ve asked – you know we’ve made motions to compel this. You know a lot will require the creditor and the debtor, excuse me, to confirm the lease and start paying rent or reject the lease and move out. That’s not their intentions. The bankruptcy court is again really focused on this sale process and really just kind of stayed all cash flow.  So they do pay their operating expenses so there is now negative drag on ROI. They pay their – its expensive paying taxes or otherwise they are paying that, but the benefits of the bankruptcy process for them is the situating we are in. So we are certainly filing motions in trying to force the process and force the hand. But the best conclusion we see at this point is Regional Care, finalizing the deal, getting approval and signing a new lease with us. 
Michael Carroll: Okay great, and then just last question, can you talk a little bit about the L Tax? Have you seen improvement there? I know that the coverage ratios has just kind of held steady at that one-four type level. What’s the outlook for those assets?
John Thomas: Yeah, we are seeing improvement there and I’d say that the conversion to critical or to clinical criteria, I think it kind of bottomed down from a reimbursement perspective and made operational improvements otherwise and pursued new lines of business.  So like there is a very strong management team and operation and – we have the full credit of the entire organization, not just our three assets and of our three assets one is – probably one of the two or three best performing L Tax in the country and stilling on a very valuable piece of land in Plano, Texas, you know North Dallas. So it’s kind of a mixed bag, but we don’t have any credit concern issues there, but on the other hand we would sell them if we got the opportunity to. 
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. 
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning. A quick question on the amount of rent recouped from the foundation during the quarter. Could you tell us what that amount is and how much is left in terms of what’s owned beyond the current rent they are paying?
A - John Thomas: Yeah, so San Antonia for the most part is kind of fully caught up. They will be this quarter. I mean they are kind of at the end of their payment plan to make up that rent number. The Foundation, El Paso had about a little over $2 million in back rent that they – while they have made improvements in changing management, they haven’t made enough improvements to start making catch-up payments, but we are working with them on several different ideas to get that down. So very focused on it, but a little over $2 million is kind of the lot number, maybe $2.5 million in total. 
Drew Babin: Okay, and a quick question on the rating.
A - John Thomas: They have been cash-only throughout ‘17 and as I said, El Paso in particular has been very consistent with the rent since April and San Antonia never missed a rent payment and made extra rent payments. 
Drew Babin: Great, that’s helpful. A quick question on new MOB lease underwriting. Has anything changed from the beginning of ’17 until now in terms of kind of call the occupancy cost to the tenant in the way leases were underwritten. Are we getting to point where the rent is paid to the MOB landlord or are getting to be a more relevant part of the expense structure of tenants or was it still pretty low when the grants came in? Thanks.
John Thomas: Yeah, I think it’s a percentage of kind of their operating expenses and still – they are still pretty low and you know it depends on what’s in the space, cancer center space, it’s going to be much higher. It’s just clinical, orthopedic clinical space is going to be much lower. But as a percentage of their revenue lines it’s still 5% to 10% generally had moved.
Drew Babin: Okay, and one last one just on investments. I looks like to me it’s a very small, looks like a mez investment during the fourth quarter. Could this be the start of something larger where we might see more aggressive investments in the mez space rather than acquisitions this year or will it just kind of be a steady drip going forward?
John Thomas: Yeah, I think they are probably – you might see more throughout the year. We are seeing a lot of health system led development plans coming together. So Mark Davis and Jim Bremner and Cornerstone is kind of the three developers we worked most closely with and we will have the opportunity to put the mez capital out funding, helping them to fund those healthy system anchored development opportunities that again ideally will be completed in 2019 and we’ll have the opportunity to purchase those, get a capital market support there, and so we’ll probably see a little uptick there, but it’ll still be a very small percentage of our asset base.
Drew Babin: Great, that’s all from me. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Fleming with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. . 
Eric Fleming: Good morning. The question I had is with the cap rates that you are talking about and low outlook on the investments. Any opportunity to get more aggressive on dispositions rather than just the 10 you got outlined. Could you go deeper? 
John Thomas: Yeah, we can go deeper. I mean I think we think about 5% to 7% of our portfolios is something that we have filtered through and identified as potential disposition. So again, depending upon the marketing and pricing, some of those are strategic dispositions and some are people approach us opportunistically and that’s how some of the dispositions we have in process came about.
Eric Fleming: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. 
Jordan Sadler : Sorry, as a follow-up to that last question which is, so would you consider carving out or is there an opportunity to carve out a larger size $300 million to $500 million type size portfolio from the legacy DOC portfolio to sort of continue this march to improving quality and then maybe seeding some of the demand out there for these types of assets?
John Thomas: I wouldn’t expect it to be that large. I mean we certainly could, I mean we take advantage of pricing, but really 5% to 7% is really kind of the top end of what we see is, it would be strategically well positioning in the portfolio. We are not suggesting only 85% of our portfolio is high quality. We think it’s much higher than that. 
Jordan Sadler : No, I’m sure it’s very, very high. 
John Thomas: That just seems large. Again, I think we’ll keep our options opened. But we certainly would have the opportunity to do that Jordan, but I wouldn’t expect to see it get that big.
Jordan Sadler : Okay, and then on this – you made a comment in your prepared remarks regarding renting versus owning benefits and I’m just curious its probably early in the game here, but are you anticipating significant portfolios coming to market for sale and is there anything that sort of early talks. I know some of the hospitals for example have high leverage and as a result of this tax change your only obviously able to deduce a certain amount of interest expense of which some of these hospitals would probably be hurt relative to their effective statutory tax rate. So is there an opportunity that you are seeing specifically or is it just kind of make sense to you?
John Thomas: I think it’s more in the make sense category right, but I think more and more operators are getting a better understanding of that and two years from now in that interest limitation is substantially, just substantially higher. The limitation is much stronger in a couple of years when it goes from EBITDA to EBIT and so you know I think people are planning out the future, it will certainly come into their process. 
Jordan Sadler : Okay and then lastly and I’ll hop off , as it relates to Trios, RCCH announced their public-private partnership with UW Medicine which RCCH is still operating the hospitals, but it is supposedly in Washington and Alaska and then in Idaho. Would you expect Kennewick to be one of the candidates for this partnership? 
John Thomas: We think that’s critical to their plans for that hospital and certainly part of our influence in our decision to work with Regional Care and are excited about it. 
Jordan Sadler : Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with our question. 
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just one but on G&A, I think I heard that was expected to be $27 million to $29 million this year; that’s up about 15% from the 4Q run rate. Just what’s driving that increase? Sorry if I missed that in the prepared remarks.
Jeff Theiler : No, that’s alright Jonathan, this is Jeff. You know we are implementing that ASU 2017-01 which is a different way of accounting for business combination. So some the expense that we previously had under acquisition expense gets shifted over to G&A and that’s about $4 million. So that really accounts for the vast majority of that increase. And so importantly it’s not a change in any expenses, it’s just the shifting from acquisition expense into G&A.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, that makes sense. Take care. Thanks, I appreciate it.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to hand the call back to management for closing comments. 
John Thomas: Yeah, thank you again for joining us. As we said, we are very excited about the results for 2017 and look forward to kind of steady as she goes in 2018. Got a great portfolio, great balance sheet and great team and we are all optimistic about the future, but at these times we will be patient and put in what we can and deploy capital where we can do it accretively, but look forward to speaking with you soon. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the Company's CEO, John Thomas.
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning.  The third quarter of 2017 was phenomenal. We had another successful quarter of new investments and operating results and our land was sharp and well addressed by our favorite shareholder. During this quarter we invested $190 million in an average first year cash yield of 6.4% in very high quality medical office facilities. Mark Theine will address our asset performance delivered by his high quality DOC's team in a few moments. In addition to those transaction previously announced, we are excited about our new client Midland Health and Midland Texas and Aa3 investment grade hospital that leases along with our longstanding multi side client United Surgical Partners at a very high quality medical office facility in that market. We invested $30 million in our 64,000 square foot medical office building anchored by Midland Health and United Surgical Partners which had 23% of the building and Midland Health occupies 77% of the building at a total first year cash yield of 6%. This building is less than 2 years old. Midland Texas is the heart of the Permian basin that has oil and gas reserves expected to last long beyond our items. With 11 USPI anchored facility and we added a 12th building anchored by USPI with their partner Ascension Health earlier in this quarter and Franklin, Tennessee which includes an ambulatory charges in our owned and managed by that partnership between USPI in St. Thomas, as well as local physicians. This 26,800 square foot facility is a 100% leased with half contained with surgery center and half with some occupied by physicians [indiscernible] surgery center. Our first year cash yield in that investment is 6.7% with building three years old. DOC has always been focused on high quality that is also accretive. The market has been trying to define quality and we would humbly suggest recent efforts to define quality have adopted DOC's definition. So how do we define quality? We believe the most important factor in accessing the quality of a medical office building our health system affiliation, credit quality to tenant, age of the building, occupancy, market share as a tenant, average remaining lease term, size of the building, and the client services and mix of services in the facility. There are other factors that came in important of course that may or may not be relevant to the quality of the facilities depending upon the circumstance. For example, a medical office full of physicians and services that not require close proximity to an inpatient hospital to be successful may be far higher quality than an on campus building especially at the locations proximity to the patients that is the customers that will make the providers that is our tenant successful. Medical office facilities anchored by an orthopedic group of surgeons which includes chronicle space, imaging space, outpatient surgery and physical therapy space in a location convenient to ensure [indiscernible] is not only relevant real estate but high quality medical office space regardless of health system affiliation. Peachtree Dunwoody Medical Center in Atlanta's Pill Hill is at this building. It just happens also to be anchored by an adjacent hospital system as well our client notes that hospital which has its own ambulatory surgery center in the building at 603 assets. Barriers or convenient to access for patients, barriers to entry for competition and payer mix of the patients can all have an material impact on the quality of building, as well as the economic condition and supply of the host market. EBITDA coverage and quality of management of the tender are also material to this analysis and measures of quality especially of single tenant facilities. The goal of course is to deliver the highest and most reliable total shareholder returns year in and year out with both earnings growth and net asset value that is share price appreciation. As we have built DOC from the beginning, we have sourced primarily off market and through direct working relationships with health systems C suite and physicians over 250 facilities including almost 14 million rentable square feet. In 2013, 81% of our acquisitions were on campus or affiliated with the health system at an average per share yield of 8.6%. With no credit rated health system included in our top 10. 2014 and 2015 saw a similar focus on facilities that were on campus or affiliated with the health system with per share yield continue to compress 7.6% in 2014, 2015 were 6.9% on average. Due to the focus on higher quality as our cost of capital allowed us to be more competitive for these higher quality facilities in larger markets, as well as the increase flow of capital seeking medical office facilities. 2016 was transformative in both the size and quality of our portfolio. Highlighted of course by the largest single modernization directly with the health system. The $700 million invested by DOC in nine markets with Catholic Health Initiatives, a BBB positive rate of health system. Not only are these facilities mission critical to the CHI hospitals, CHI hospital credit leases more than 90% of the rentable square feet with a mission lease term of 10 years and annual rent increases of 2.5%. As we are coming on the anniversary date of that acquisition, we are proud that our per share yield has grown from 6.2% analysis to the date of the acquisition to approximately 6.4% in hindsight, picking a 20% basis points of yield through leasing and better assets management and we expect more in the near term. Our tenant satisfaction scores across this portfolio and the health system leadership is off the chart. In fact, CHI was so pleased by our integration and management of these facilities. CHI presented 50 more facilities to consider for modernization in 2017. Working directly with CHI C suite, we selected 13 more facilities 99% occupied located in several new and existing markets and invested another 157 million at an average per share yield of 6.8% completing the purchase of the last five facilities and the most recent third quarter. CHI credit hospital lease and occupy 93% of these facilities. We now lease more than 3.1 million square feet to hospital affiliate with and control by CHI which is approximately 24% of our portfolio and 19% of our ABR. In 2017 year-to-date we’ve invested approximately $1.1 billion at an average per share yield of 5.6%. The compression in cap rates has heavily influenced by the capital flow from around the globe seeking to invest in medical office buildings and in particular the Duke Realty portfolio that was auctioned and sold this summer. We of course were handpicked by three credit rated health systems to step in to their rights to purchase what we believe is a five best buildings from the Duke portfolio including the Baylor Scott and White 468,000 foot Baylor cancer center at the heart of Baylor's flagship hospital in Downtown Dallas Texas. As a result, Baylor Scott and White with an A3 investment grade rating is now our third largest tenant and McKesson with a Baa2 credit rating which own U.S. Oncology that leases a large portion to Baylor Scott & WhiteCancer Center and two other facilities we own in the DSW market is our fourth largest tenant. We also added two additional Ascension Ascencion Health affiliated facilities rated AA2. Those buildings on the campus of St. Vincent Carmel and St. Vincent Fishers in the Indianapolis market are very high-end suburbs. And we are now own eight facilities with more than 628,000 rentable square feet on Ascension Health campuses. With more than 50% actually leased directly to the Ascension Health owned hospitals in three different markets. Because we count tenants in our top market by market, no single Ascension Health market has cracked our top 10 but at least one market Indianapolis is close and we expect based on our contracted pipeline, will join our top 10 tenant list in the fourth quarter. We also acquired the Duke, hospitals preferred DOC process. Two more facilities anchored by and leased the North South Hospital, which does not have a credit agency rating but its balance sheet and operating performance support provides what we believe would earn an investment grade rating. During the third quarter we announced the Gwinnett Health System, an A3 rated health system in Atlanta and exercised its rights under rights of first refusal to purchase three medical office facilities from the original developer owner [indiscernible] who had agreed to sell those buildings to another REIT. Gwinnett agreed to new leases and expanded their total direct occupancy such that when we purchase these three buildings in cooperation with Gwinnett Health System, our first year contracted yield was expected to be approximately 5.5%. Northside Hospital and Gwinnett have agreed to merge and are working through the Attorney General of Georgia for the regulatory approval which we both expect to receive. On a combined basis we have six facilities in the Northside Gwinnett Health System with more than 735,000 square feet with more than 400,000 feet leased directly by the hospitals themselves. That would be approximately little over $8 million in first year ABR which makes them of our top four tenants. During the third quarter we added yet another out market medical office facility leased entirely to HonorHealth and A2 credit rated health system. We now have more than 240,000 feet leased directly down HonorHealth and we expect more. Also during the third quarter our partner Mark Davis sold to us another two great medical offices facilities, well leased and anchored strategically by Hospital Systems in the Vikings market in connection with our pending purchase of a 148,000 square foot Hazelwood Medical Office building on the campus of Fairview Health, an A2 rated health system, St John's campus that Mr. Davis developed. He will be contributing this new facility to DOC's LP in January 2018 in exchange for DOC LP preferred OPUs. Quality is health system affiliation. DOC has more than 30 credit rated health systems leasing space from us. Quality is more than 95% leased occupancy, far more than any other publicly traded medical office building on earth. Quality is more than 8 years average lease term remaining. If you are a hotel or apartment owner of student housing owner, perhaps short term leases are good but lease commissions still in improvement and lease concessions on typical medical office buildings renewals and new leases is a material impact on funds available for distribution. Not to mention a hedge on reliable rising dividends. Quality is actual health system credit on the lease, not just a building on or adjacent to a hospital campus but actual credit quality health system that desires to lease this space. Quality is high margin services in your facility. Orthopedic and neuro-spine surgeons are the single largest division specialty in our facilities. Our largest non-health system specialty across the board is orthopedic surgeons. Our products lease space across the country from us. Quality is a health system calling you to exercise or write a first refusal when anyone other than DOC has the opportunity to buy the real estate in an auction. Quality is actual same store in a wardrobe. By our own transparent metrics we have approximately 80% of our total portfolio on campus or affiliated with the health system. We want that number to be 90%. We believe this level of health system affiliation will deliver optimal and reliable and growing shareholder returns. To have you achieve optimal portfolio our quality. One can think about high quality assets from a developer and we have great redevelopers feeding us newer, larger health system lease facilities like Mark Davis, Jim Bremner and Cornerstone Health with more to come from each of them. More importantly when C suite executives at that largest health systems in the United States invite us to meet them to partner with them, we get excited about the future and our continued opportunistic grow and grow with very high quality medical outsourcing. Deeni Taylor now had three such meetings in the last week. As DOC enters its fifth year, we will continue to execute our strategies that we have since day one to buy the highest quality medical office facilities that are accretive short term that and that will deliver the liable rising dividend overtime. After yesterday’s release the tax from the U.S. house, happy with tax rate on the dividends paid that reached to 25% consistent and growing cash flow translate into higher dividends overtime should be even more valuable. Briefly, since we first shared the challenges with Foundation Health facilities at El Paso and San Antonio Texas, the physicians in particularly we practice each of those locations have worked hard to restore those facilities with a historical success and each has paid their rent every month since April and each continues to work hard to reduce their bankrupt balance this due to us. Lastly, our Medical Office Building in Kennewick, Washington has occupied by Physicians and Services and treating patients even today, that are important to their community. While the hospital, the leases the building premise has been challenged, the real estate at hospital is owned by a member of Dow Jones industrial index and we are working with them to find solutions for future that facility. We cannot tell you when we will be again collecting rent on that building but we remain confident that the building is now on viable but will be continue to be valuable assets for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Jeff and look forward to your questions and answers. Thank you.
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you, John. In the third quarter of 2017, the company generated funds from operations of $45.2 million or $0.25 per share. Our normalized funds from operation were $47.4 million. Normalized funds from operations per share were $0.26 and our normalized funds available for distribution were $42.8 million or $0.23 per share. Year-to-date our normalized FFO per share of $0.77 represents an 8.5% increase over the comparable period last year. In the third quarter of this year our relationship acquisition strategy resulted in $190 million of additional investments. Our big partner acquisition volume involved after market repeat deals with health systems like HonorHealth and CHI at attractive valuation, a testament to the focus and intention we have devoted to these tenants in our previous transactions. We have able to watch everything we’re able to pick-and-choose acquisitions as our senior management healthcare experience and our existing relationships with healthcare system executives make us a preferred owner of medical office real estate. But we have seen several medical office building trades at very low cap rates over the past few months, we have purposely stayed away from the high prices portfolio deals. Instead we've increased our focus on off market acquisitions such as the brand new 148,000 foot development that we entered into a contract to acquire in Hazelwood Minnesota. The building is anchored by Fairview health which has raised A2 Moody's we will be closing on the building in early 2018. We are also distinguished by our ability to work cooperatively with health systems as we did during our transaction with Gwinnett healthcare system that is merging in Northside. That system decided to exercise the right to first refuse on a portfolio deal and then modify their lease terms to attract DOC as their landlords.  Gwinnett/Northside with the DOC would be the best partner for them as they continue to expand their presence in the Georgia market. Our reputations are true partner continues to provide more and more opportunities to acquire mission critical assets for healthcare systems that are looking for trusted landlords and bringing these strategic assets into our portfolio provides a tangible benefits to our shareholders. In general our asset acquisitions were concentrated in the latter half of the quarter. For modeling purposes, had we acquired all the third quarter acquisitions at the beginning of the quarter they would have contributed an additional $1.8 million of cash NOI. Turning to operations, our same-store portfolio which represents 66% of our total portfolio generated year-over-year cash NOI growth of 2.3% driven by contractual rent growth. We continue to have the most highly utilized MOB portfolio with 96.6% of our space current released. These four buildings allow us to generate strong renewals spreads from out tenants with minimal concessions as Mark will discuss in more detail. Additionally, the drag from our recurring CapEx including tenant improvements and leasing commissions are the lowest in the sector at about 5% of NOI. These all translates into generation of more cash flow that we are able to return to our investors and re-deploy and accretive acquisitions. As usual our balance sheet is strong with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.8 times and debt to total capitalization of 27% we closed our 20 million share offering that we announced in late June in the beginning of the third quarter which is provided funding for third quarter acquisitions and beyond. We had no issuance on the ATM in the third quarter and retain roughly 215 million of capacity on that program. In summary we are in excellent position to continue to build out and enhancement of our portfolio in accordance with our previous guidance. Finally just briefly touch on G&A our G&A for the quarter was $5.9 million which puts us at $16.8 million for the year and on pace to meet previously discussed guidance range of $22 million to $24 million for 2017. With that I’ll turn it over to Mark who will walk you some of our operations statistics in more detail.
Mark Theine: Thanks Jeff. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating performance for our existing portfolio as we continue to operate our properties efficiently and profitably. As Jeff mentioned our portfolio in the industry leading 96.6% lease and delivered a solid 2.3% growth in NOI in our same-store portfolio. This growth includes a 3% increase in rental revenues and a 4.8% increase in operating expenses in our same-store portfolio that is 95.5% leased.  For the first time this quarter 45 facilities of the initial Catholic Health Initiatives portfolio entered same-store and as a result the same-store portfolio now represents 66% of our overall portfolio up from 55% of the portfolio in the previous quarter. The performance of this creates on our portfolio continues to outperform our initial underwriting on a trialing 12-month basis the portfolio yield is 6.4% compared to our underwriting of 6.2% and we expect improvements in these number at the Springwood and Woodland medical office buildings in Houston Texas have several leases commencing shortly. Over the last 12 months, our team has worked with CHI in a global hospital leadership team to these markets to exceed expectations in the transition of these facilities to our ownership. This structured relationship have left us becoming one of their preferred real estate partners and recently resulted in the opportunity to complete a direct off market follow up transaction of 13 facilities its only 157 million at a 6.8% first year unlevered yield of which five of these buildings is holding $33.7 million closed this quarter end of August. Over the last year and half our relationship with CHI has only strengthened producing far better results than we could have anticipated this early and we look forward to continuing to demonstrate why the preferred partner for hospital modernization. During the quarter we also saw strong leasing momentum and our team continues to accelerate producing result by using a responsiveness and quick approval process as a competitive advantage. In the quarter we leases 130,000 square feet including 97,000 square feet of lease renewals and 33,000 square feet of new leases. We’re leasing spreads on the 97,000 square feet were positive 6.5% primarily driven by our ability to push rent in certain buildings that nearly or completed leased. Our retention rate for the quarter was 72% as a result of 38,000 square feet that did not renew but was offset by 33,000 square feet of new leasing in the period. Notably the rate per square foot on the space which was not renewed was $17.81 compared to a rate of $20.79 for new leases completed in the quarter representing an improvement of roughly $3 per square foot. Nearly half the space that was not renewed in the quarter is located in one building in Phoenix Arizona and we already in discussion with a urology practice and analogy practice to take approximately 10,000 of the 21,000 square feet that was vacated in that building. Rent concessions in the quarter remains very low with no free rent and approximately $1 per square foot per year for lease renewals and $5 per square foot per year for new leases. Looking forward to the remainder of the year we have about 20 leases totaling only 60,500 square feet scheduled to renewal. Beyond 2017 we have no more than 6% of the portfolio scheduled to renew in any one year for the next seven years to 2024. Our lease expirations scheduled is deliberately laggered to stag lease expiration days ultimately driving very predictable growing cash flow to support reliable rising dividend for years to come.  Looking ahead in 2018 we will continue to growth our integrated management leasing platform and are well positioned to drive operational excellence consistent same-store in our NLD portfolio and support outside growth of new acquisitions. Our management structure is scalable and we’ll continue to benefit from concentration as we invest in tough quality properties and portfolio in the future.
John Thomas: Thank you, Mark. We now look forward to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: I was just hoping you could speak to the same-store NOI growth you're excluding 11 assets, I think there was a bit last quarter and just the impact of those assets now excluded in held for sale and what drove that change in those assets now that are not part of that non-core appoval?
Jeffrey Theiler: We have been talking about for a couple quarters now that the desire proven very bottom of our portfolio. So what we did as we come through and we look for assets, we felt were really non-core assets and these are really smaller assets and most often the secondary markets may be we’re talking a lot of a couple million dollars. So we did as we want to provide a picture of what the go-forward portfolio is on a same-store basis and exclude the assets that we think we’re going to get rid of in the next quarter. So that was the thinking behind it, it's very similar to every other REIT that does with that way and so just want to provide visibility on what we think the go forward portfolio is.
Juan Sanabria: Were there any bad debt or collection issues at those assets that would have skewed the same-store NOI results other than like trio's and foundation stuff that we know?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, they’re so small it’s not material.
Juan Sanabria: And then on just the balance sheet, I guess pro forma for the announcement pending acquisitions where it's leveraging and kind of how much that capacity do you have kind of above and beyond that relative to your leverage targets?
Jeffrey Theiler: So we feel really good about our financial position Juan. Obviously we did that big share offering at the close of the beginning of this quarter. So that put us in a really good spot to acquire our assets this quarter and really kind of prefund the pipeline that we have going into fourth quarter. So going through our announced pending acquisitions, will probably put us right at about 35% debt to assets which I would say is kind of right in the middle of our target range. We've got some ability to go up from there on a short-term basis if we want but really keeps us in a comfortable leverage position.
Juan Sanabria: And then as we start to think about the pipeline and for 2018 latest thoughts on kind of where we should expect the average cap rates for transactions to be with the seemingly less of a focused on kind of the price your portfolio transaction just for the prepared remarks?
John Thomas: We continue to find - as I mentioned several acquisitions in the 6% range but again the highest quality assets health system anchored new or bigger long-term stronger buildings in the mid-five today and one building in a time kind of acquisition market. So 5.5% to 6% is really kind of what we see. So far today we’re about 5.6% on 1.1 billion invested so far this year and kind of see the end of the year closing at that kind of range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: So I wanted to touch base just on the expenses they spiked up a little bit more than I anticipated on a same-store basis and threw up a little bit higher than trend. What sort of drove that in the quarter?
Mark Theine: So the couple of things that drove the increase in expenses in our same store. As you know that the expenses were up 4.5%. That's primarily driven by increase real estate taxes, especially at the CHI buildings where the buildings have been reappraised in this first year since we acquired them. And it’s also result of some operating increase expenses at those buildings, as we have executed on our plans to improve some differed maintenance items. Now that where we owners of these buildings.
Jordan Sadler: Will the growth rate subside or that will sort of continue through for the next few quarters or so?
Mark Theine: I think it will subside a little bit in the quarters to come.
Jordan Sadler: And then I guess Jeff, on the balance sheet. Just curious where you stand on longer term financing, bond deals so what are your thoughts here?
Jeffrey Theiler: So, certainly as we look out into the quarter, the fourth quarter. And we've got, we've announced the bunch of pending acquisitions. That will put our line up over $300 million. And I think that’s a good point, where we start looking at longer term financing options. So I think that’s something we definitely consider this quarter or early next quarter. And right now, when we talk to the Banks, it seems like the rate is probably just over 4% on a 10 basis. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
Jeffrey Theiler: Public bond offerings.
Jordan Sadler: And is it 10 year?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: And the loan investments in the quarter, if I might. Was that anything specific? Was it multiple or one single larger deal, any color you could share there?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. So, the loan investments there were kind of two. That the primarily loan investment was in a deal that’s portfolio of assets, where we put in a loan for the opportunity to acquire four of those assets out of that portfolio at cap rates that we think would be fairly attractive before to exercise that option. Like we always do, we made it optional of such that we have the opportunity but not the responsibility to exercise that option. And so we'll evaluate that at the time along with our cost of capital, whether it makes sense to go ahead and acquire those buildings in full.
Operator: Our next question is coming from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Over the last few months you've been adeptly acquiring assets that refers the heavily marketed transactions. Do you think this is strategy that could be replicated on future transactions? So what do you think buyers will be trying to preemptively address this?
Jeffrey Theiler: I don't think its strategy for say, I think our strategy is to align ourselves and have fantastic peaceful relationships that have. My cellphone number and Deeni's cell phone number, Dan Klien's cell phone number. And when they see those opportunities, and want to pick the owner their real estate or have the opportunity to pick the owner of the real estate, we're getting those phone calls. So, I think we're very excited about how it's worked out this year. And I think our strategy is to align ourselves for the best health systems in the country. And then in each case the health system they called us and invited us to participate with them to buy those buildings back. And as Jeff mentioned, sometimes they have to extend the leases or expand and improved the leases to make it attractable real estate trust as well and they may did. As is more and more health systems consider monetization the real estate or developers, there build most mostly for health systems seek to sell that. I think we'll have more and more opportunity to do so but, in our strategy is to align ourselves best health systems. And then fortunately we get the phone call and they have opting to buy the real estate back.
John Kim: Can you just elaborate on that, besides the relationships that you have? Is there anything as far as more favorable lease terms or rights or anything else that you provide in healthcare systems?
Jeffrey Theiler: It’s about too much favorably. Certainly that we provide is the relationship and then frankly Mark Theine and his team have developed in a very short period of time. A very high quality level of service and performance of the health systems want to have managing their buildings and keeping the billings attractive to their physicians and for their patients, and expanding their services. So that’s what it's about.  And it's also actually keeping the buildings lease to physicians and identifying physicians and services to come to the building. Again that make the health system more profitable if you will and providing more services overtime. So that's the reputation we have and the reputation is growing and while more and more health systems are making those phone calls to us.
John Kim: And then this quarter your off-campus exposure declined by 2%. I think John in your prepared remarks, you said you wanted to reduce your off-campus exposure in your portfolio. But earlier in your commentary, I thought that you were kind of suggesting that you were more open to invest in off-campus moving to real estate looks good. Given the location where people live I'm not….
John Thomas: Yeah to be clear, we don’t want to necessarily reduce our exposure to off-campus. We want to increase our exposure to off-campus, to help facilities lease to physicians. I think we have more, what we call 603 assets than anybody as far as we know. And those are off-campus assets leased up to health systems that have a reimbursement advantage under the current system. We look at the real estate, each building on a case-by-case basis, is anchored by health systems, that anchored by high quality physician group. And it did in the best location to make it that building itself and then providers and that building successful.  So again, on-campus is some of the biggest and the best, the newest buildings we bought particularly this year are on-campus. But they’re on-campus leased high quality health systems. Again many of these would do the rental process. And I think most of you all know, we’re going to may read in Dallas in a couple of weeks, we’re going to host investors to visits the Baylor Cancer Center, which we believe maybe the best medical ops facility. Certainly not in the country maybe in the world itself.  So it’s not about reducing exposure of off-campus, it's but increasing our exposure to high quality health system, anchored facilities in locations that make them most valuable that they can be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning everyone. A quick question, it’s not a big part of your portfolio, but with your hospital and your LTACH exposure the coverage's came down a little bit this quarter. Just kind of curious how you’re kind of thinking about those assets in regards to longer term? Whether they’re going to continue to be the part of the portfolio? And how do you kind of thinking on dealing with that?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes Tayo, that’s a great question, good morning. So the LTACH themselves life care itself has responded very well to the changes in reimbursement in the LTACH reimbursement scheme in Washington, or coming up at Washington. That's the coverage at those levels, at those facilities which is the appropriate way to report it. We do have the entire life care balance sheet and P&L as credit behind those leases. So we’re very comfortable with the future of the rent coming in on those facilities.  But those and surgical hospitals themselves as well, which we have about six in the portfolio continue to be less interesting to us going on long term. We have the right opportunity to sell those, we probably would. And again we can focus and increase the exposure, as John was asking earlier about to outpatient care services period. The LTACH’s doing fine, we had the bumps with the two foundation facilities which you know about. But they have recovered very well because of the alignment the economic alignment that positions most facilities and teams going forward. But those are things that are probably we would sell them at the right price, but at the same time don’t expect to grow in those types of deals.
Omotayo Okusanya: And then second of all, any update with the Dignity Catholic Health Merger. And what that may mean for some of the Louisville Kentucky assets?
Jeffrey Theiler: So there’s kind of two separate things going on. One is the continuation of the Dignity Health and CHI merger discussions. We don’t have any kind of new update other than their continued work. It’s very complicated and particular with the Church involved and the necessity of working through all the various catholic the religious sister that sponsor those facilities. But as far as we know that those discussions continue and move forward in a positive way. And we’re excited about that. We don’t think there is any market overlap between Dignity and CHI that would call some rationalization of closing or moving in different directions on hospitals and particularly that medical office buildings that leased to CHI.  We also has some dignity health relationships and facilities and we’re excited about the opportunity to work together with those.  The Lobo hospital, the Lobo Kentucky part of CHI in Kentucky is going through a process. And to sell those facilities is going to separate apart from the Dignity. And to our knowledge, kind of the three leading candidates to purchase those hospitals with all the at least one of which is in existing client. I'd say but it's two of three are existing clients. And we are really excited about the opportunity to grow our relationship with them and if they move forward and purchase those facilities. Again our buildings in the Lobo CHI market are mission critical to each of those hospitals. And so we are very confident about the future of that. The Lexington market within CHI is not for sale. And we've been working, I recently met with the CEO of that hospital, which is kind of several hospitals, kind of Lexington and staff of theirs. And we continue to see great opportunities in that market working with CHI and with that hospital leadership in particular. 
Omotayo Okusanya: And then lastly from my end on the acquisition front. Couple of these larger moving portfolios out in the market. I wondering whether these assets that are attractive to you guys and kind of what you kind a think about them. 
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah there is some attractive portfolio is out there. I think we are really focus right now on our in our existing hospital relationship and growing those relationships in the kind off-market growth of our portfolio primarily. We started to look at everything that goes to market or comes to market and evaluate those and consider appropriate for us or not and obviously price matters. So I think we'll see continued high quality assets trading at very strong parts particularly in the portfolios that are floating around. And then if we can pick off assets one or two at a time having those portfolios or otherwise we’ll continue to do that. 
Operator: Now our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. 
Vikram Malhotra: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Sorry I dialed in late, maybe I missed this. Is there any update on the situation that Trios?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah I mentioned Vikram and good morning. So, Trios the hospital since continuing work through the Chapter 9 process. Our building's full of physicians. Our building that’s on the campus of that hospital system is certainly important to the hospital, but our building is actually extremely valuable and strong as an outpatients care facility in and of itself. So we've been working with some potential buyers of the hospital, looking at a way to recapitalize that facility the hospital facility itself. And working with our medical office building, which is full of physicians or seen patients today and very busy.  There really is no other [indiscernible] building in community for those physicians to move through. So and that’s kind of we’re looking at on a long-term basis, as a very strong buyable facility that should perform well, with or without a hospital next door. We're working with potential buyers to recapitalize the hospital and continue the mission of Trios. But there is another great health system in town that we wouldn't mind working with as well and under the right circumstances. 
Vikram Malhotra: So just to clarify but on the last income. What are you expecting over the next, is it over the next few months and then next year?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yeah it's hard to know. I think our best guess is we won't collect any rent through the balance of this year from that facility. We are collecting a small amount from independent physicians who lease some space in the building, but the primary tenant in that building are physician's employee but the hospital. And again if some happened at the hospital that went away, we expect those physicians to obviously stay in practice and continue to provide cares in different ownership structures.  So, 2018 as we have been messaging, as soon as we can expect the rent to restart. When and what term we don’t know, but we are working again but both tenants of the building themselves and potential buyers of the hospital to do that as quickly as possible.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just a clarification. You've talked about quality quite a bit early on. Just on same-store NOI growth, given sort of the mix of the portfolio geography wise and lease structure wise. Do you see a view sort of the 3% level as a sustainable number or is there something unique about the portfolio, that might sustainably keep you under or over that?
Jeffrey Theiler: We think 2.5% to 3% is what we and you should expect. But the potential opportunities in some quarter for outside is there are numbers but 2.5% to 3%. If you look at CHI hospitals themselves lease about 25% of our portfolio and it's 19% of our ABR. I mean those leases are fixed at 2.5% for the next 10 years. So that gives you a pretty good run rate Vikram, of kind of what’s market and what we can expect. Again we're 96% lease, so we don’t spend a lot of money and time leasing small amount of space. We focused on the health system and leasing larger space to them for the long term. And then getting their expectations market is come to 100%.
Vikram Malhotra: Got it and just last clarification on the additional assets marked for sale of held for sale. Are there any CHI assets in that?
John Thomas: There is one small CHI asset is in that right, Mark?
Mark Theine: Yes, we had local buyer, 1031 buyer approached us proactively. What mainly we're considering selling but the price was attractive, so there is just one CHI building in that.
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, interestingly, and we have the right to do that appear that appeared. And then B, CHI themselves we approach them about that opportunity in this building that they're in or leasing, but long term are committed to either so to get opportunity to fund.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel.
Chad Vanacore: So I wanted to certain back on that couple of trouble occurred in portfolio of Trios and Foundation. Are they both excluded from same store NOI?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes.
Chad Vanacore : All right and then did you recognize any rent on either in the quarter? And where were that compared to international rent on each?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, we did. So, we didn’t recognize rents on Trios as we have talked about this quarter and last quarter as well. Foundation we recognize the same rent that we've recognized last quarter of $1.6 million. They continue to pay their existing rent and also make a back rent that they all have. So that's been consistent.
Chad Vanacore : And just thinking about in 2018,as Trios works its way through bankruptcies you start getting turn around rent again. Was that about $0.03 a share impact?
Jeffrey Theiler: Well, it depends. It depends what kind of rent you are getting from Trios in 2018.So we were getting roughly $4 million of revenue from Trios prior to the Bankruptcy. So, it will be somewhere around there we think.
Chad Vanacore : All right and then just talking about acquisitions in the quarter. And going forward do you expect something mid-5% to 6% and this quarter, all the yields for the most part were up above 6%.Are there any other opportunities in the pipeline like that? Or it just be conservative going forward?
Jeffrey Theiler: So, we have got some 6% plus. Look our high quality health system opportunities. Again these off market transactions. We're still continuing to get those higher yields, but 5.5% to 6% is probably range for the foreseeable future. Again if your backlog.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Carroll: I have a quick follow up off of a Tayo's question related to the L-type portfolio. I know John, you previously mentioned that you expect the profitability to improve at those assets with the addition of a burn unit. Is that’s still the case and should we expect those coverage ratios to stabilize because of that?
John Thomas: Yes. We have three buildings in a master lease, Mike. And one does extremely well, one does okay, it can better than average, and one just kind of float to long. Between the three of them it's a wide spectrum of how profitable they are, but they're all in our mass release. They are a, comfortably able to pay the rent, but the possibility is like in general is improving as they kind of rebalance, restructure their clinical service lines. And then comply with the LTACH rules themselves to take advantage about their opportunities. On the STACH basis short term to keep your hospital outpatient services like wound care as you mentioned.  So, like I said. There are long term assets and we expect the profitability improved. And it's a great management team that we work with there. 
Michael Carroll: So the mitigation from the LTACH patient criteria that could still be a benefit as we go in the 2018?
John Thomas: Yes I think so. That's what we expect. As I mention before though, we're not going to expand in LTACH business. And we think there are some good opportunities to sale those assets favorably. 
Michael Carroll: And then Jeff, can you provide us more details on your prepared remarks about pruning the portfolio. Should we assume at DOC going to be more aggressively selling assets in 2018 and 2019?
Jeffrey Theiler: No, again I think it’s a something that is the natural evolution of the company. When we talk about pruning, so we added 11 assets to or we have 11 I should say total assets in and slated for disposition .And so, every quarter we're just kind a going through a portfolio and making sure that we're concentrating on the right markets, the right buildings, the right healthcare system affiliations and disposing of asset that don’t meet those criteria. So, it will be more, and it used to be almost zero. So it will be more than that, but I wouldn’t expect it's going to be massive amounts of the portfolio at any one time. They will just be a kind of slow continuous process. 
Michael Carroll: So more on these one last two type properties that at $4 million apiece?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes that’s probably right Michael. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.
Daniel Bernstein: Thanks for taking my call. So, I just want to try to understand some of the risk in the portfolio and lease expiration see in the next year or two? Are there any single tenant leases that are expiring, and are there are any purchase options there? Just trying to get where there is can be any potential for leakage of earnings there?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes Dan, thanks for the question. Mark can respond.
Mark Theine: Sure, Dan. There is a one single tenant property next year just coming up from our expiration. We actually have leased out for signature on a nice lease renewal there. So that hospital committed to five additional years there. So, that’s the only single tenant property in the near term role there. And like I said on the call, there’s no more than 6% of our portfolio renewing in any one given year of the next seven years. No purchase option. 
John Thomas: We don’t have any purchase option at all in the portfolio Dan?
Daniel Bernstein: Now I appreciate that. And then the other question has on development. You've obviously created some development relationships out there and others. And are you thinking about funding development directly yourselves or is it mainly you're going use your relationships to buy those assets when they're stabilized? Just trying to understand how you're going to utilize those relationships and what kind gives you market on the assets relative to straight up purchasing assets. And whether it's betting of otherwise?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes Dan, that's great question. We have consistently, as I said from the beginning of DOC that we're not going to create a development engine, Deeni, and I, Mark and others on the teams have all the capability to do that. So we're sourcing good development opportunities, but we like to work with our the development firms that, that’s what they do day in and day out. They have hospital system relationships in these regions and a long track record experience that can deliver this buildings. Developments [technical difficulty] heavily preleased buildings. We like to focus and attention to those development firms. And people at Mark Davis and Jim Bremner, Ted Burge, all have done a great job, medicating the risk and then bringing us new high quality buildings lease to those health systems.  So what we have done to-date is capture a little bit of that kind of wholesale versus retail spread through some Mezzanine financing, without taking any developed risk and without taking incurring or both being responsible for any debt incur to build the buildings. We like this strategy it could change overtime. Hospitals are getting smarter and smarter, but what they pay third parties to develop buildings and then they are leasing a 100% of it. So in the end we just want to own the building once it's once it open and occupied and the rent commences.  Don’t expect any changes in our strategy, we continue to and we continue to put up Mezzanine capital to get an option to buy those buildings off-market once that finished. 
Daniel Bernstein: Do you typically have any kind of rights to first look or is that again they just prefer you to be the buyer. 
Jeffrey Theiler: It varies kind of developer-by-developer and in some cases hospital-by-hospital. Because sometimes hospitals are self-developing themselves and then looking the sale to them as once this completed. So it's really case-by-case basis. What we like to do is to keep the optionality and not have the obligation about the building. Year from now or 18 months from now. On the other hand we can get some yield there in the construction cycle in the structure of our Mezzanine loan. So, it’s a good win win. And in any of that we believe we're getting the building, the few weeks executed on like Hazelwood with Mark Davis we believe, we're getting off-market pricing on those. But also got some yield during the construction cycle. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. 
Drew Babin: Looking forward and I apologize is I missed this. Was there anything onetime in terms of catch up payments in foundation or otherwise that was booked in the third quarter?
Jeffrey Theiler: The San Antonio facility used to make kind of scheduled catchup payments. So Antonio got it's essentially a quarter behind the fourth quarter of 2016.So they've been making additional payments essentially if each month backing up those rent payments. So we've got a schedule worked out with them and expected to get caught up I think early in '18 is the current schedule.  El Paso is a little different with the doctors there and kind of capitalize the facility. So they acknowledge and are working hard to try to get on a schedule to make catchup payments, but they were two quarters behind. So the hole is a little bit deeper. The good news is that they've consistent with our scheduled run every months since April 1. And we continue to be patiently work with them, but acknowledge and they have committed to. And we expect to hopefully to catch up that rent. It may be in the process of sale of the building that we get caught up. But we don’t book that income. And it will be on a cash basis when it comes in. 
John Thomas: And just for a couple numbers around the catch up for San Antonio. So they were behind by about $1.2 million. They've caught up about $750,000 of that and they have another $400,000 or so to finish up.
Drew Babin: And then just quickly on the expense growth run rate. Obviously it was a little high his quarter. It sounds like property taxes were part of that. Do you expect the property pretends pressures to kind a continue next year? I assume the operating expenses of are we back down, but as the tax so that was kind a catch up towards valuations of new [indiscernible]. Is there a pressure that you think might kind of road that 2.5% to 3% revenue growth somewhat is a full suite of NOI?
Mark Theine: Sure, Drew this is Mark. I can jump in. As we've just mentioned, every time we acquire a building, buildings are reappraised and by the local municipalities and often times we see operating expenses jump up because of that. Most of that is pass through in triple net leases. 98% of our portfolio is triple net leased so it passes through to the tenants. But there is a little bit of exposure that we have through, at last very little vacancy we have or the very few growth leases we have. So that is resulted in operating expenses ticking up just a little bit. And we use a firm nationally on behalf of all of our clients to challenge those property taxes right from the get go. 
Operator: Your last question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo Okusanya: Thanks for indulging me again. Just a quick question when I take a look at the total portfolio percentage leased is higher than your same-store portfolio today. And I know you've kind of been buying a higher quality asset for the past year or two. As more of those assets move into the same-store pool, is it fair to assume you start to show better same-store NOI numbers?
Jeffrey Theiler: Tayo, I'm Jeff and Mark also responded, we’re happy to let you double do it today. As the CHI portfolio only part of that has rolled in. So there’s a heavy influence [technical difficulty] By the hospital in those terms. So that’s going to continue to add influence and consistency at that 2.5% number. But Mark, do have any other color?
Mark Theine: Yeah, I think as Jeff said about, our portfolio overall is 96.6% leased in many of those properties have the 2.5% ,same-store portfolio of 95.5% leased. So I don’t think that just because there’s more occupancy. There is still a lot of the same locked in contractual ramp ups in the properties that we’ve recently acquired. 
John Thomas: So thank you everyone for joining us today. I hope you appreciate, we continue to build a very high quality of portfolio. That's going to provide consistent returns. Look forward to seeing you in Dallas in a couple of weeks. If you have not received an invitation, we look to our Baylor Cancer Center and discussion. Where a lot of there have some Baylor executives there. Speak with executives there to give you their impressions about that building and the future of the Baylor Healthcare System which is very bright, as well as their experience working with us in contrast and comparison to other REITs that they work with. So let Jeff know if you not got an invitation. And love to see you and look forward to see you all at Nareit. Thank you for spending the time with us today. As we focus on our portfolio and leasing up our buildings and meeting with our C suite executives, we think that’s the best use of our time. And don’t spend a lot of time touring others buildings and trying to measure how close they are to the hospital. We focus in our occupancy and our rent growth and the quality of our portfolio is best serve by spending time with our C suite relationships and growing and improving that for shareholders. Thank you for the time.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We're proud to announce another very successful quarter of growth, continuing our long term strategy of partnering directly with high-quality health systems and physician groups. We acquire their mission-critical medical office facilities in a manner that provides them the capital they need to grow and thrive while building a portfolio that will create long term value for our shareholders.  The DOC strategy remains unchanged since our IPO, creating value through our relationship-based investing, earned through our unique understanding of health care operations from inside of the building and out. Our pipeline has never been more robust, driven by these long-standing relationships directly with health system leaders and physician at valuations that are accretive on both on NAV and FFO basis for our stockholders.  We continue to demonstrate the strength of our relationships with premier health care systems, including the Baylor Scott & White Health, Ascension Health, Northside Hospital and Catholic Health Initiatives, proving that when health systems and providers have the option to choose their real estate capital and operating partner, they will choose Physicians Realty Trust.  All in all, we completed $588 million of new acquisitions in the second quarter at an average expected first year cash yield of 5.3%, representing the highest-quality real estate we've acquired. We continue to grow intentionally and intelligently, not just for the sake of growth.  So far in 2017, we have increased our gross real estate assets from $2.9 billion to $3.8 billion and our total portfolio square footage has increased 16% this year from 10.9 million to 12.6 million square feet.  Our portfolio occupancy continues to lead all publicly traded MOB REIT and has increased from 96.1% to 96.3% this year.  The average age of our buildings has improved and the average size of our buildings has improved from 44,000 to 48,000 square feet.  We continue to build scale in key target markets that we know well and that offers strong local economies. After the completion of all announced acquisitions, our largest single market will be Dallas, Texas which is the fourth largest MSA in the country. Our second largest market will be Atlanta, the ninth largest MSA and our sixth largest market will be Indianapolis, the 34th largest MSA in the country.  Perhaps most importantly, the credit quality of our top 10 tenants has improved substantially. We began the year with CHI-KentuckyOne as our one largest single tenant by annualized-based rent and now CHI-Nebraska leads our top 10, with Baylor Scott & White joining the list at #3 and McKesson's U.S. Oncology is now our fourth largest tenant. Our HonorHealth relationships in Scottsdale, Arizona has expanded, moving them to seventh in our listing of top 10 with more assets coming. Upon closing of our announced transactions with the prominent health -- Atlanta health care provider, Northside Hospital, we project that Northside will join our top 5 tenants list as well  Investors from around the world are increasingly recognizing what we have believed for years, medical office space is not just the most attractive asset class for resiliency and long term cash flow and healthy real estate but across all classes of real estate. This realization has resulted in a very competitive acquisition environment. As values have increased, we believe our strategy of partnering and cultivating long term relationships with the best health care providers will help us maintain a robust acquisition pipeline of attractive, off-market, on- and off-campus medical office facilities. We believe this will enhance the quality of our portfolio while maintaining our track record of making accretive investments for our shareholders.  Since our IPO in July of 2013, Physicians Realty Trust portfolio has grown by approximately $1 billion per year from a portfolio of $150 million to nearly $4 billion today. Our growth originally limited by a relatively high cost of capital, started with finding arbitrage opportunities with smaller assets in secondary markets. While that strategy served as well, our cost of capital today is competitive with our peers across the health care realty space, allowing us also to pursue value among the larger, newer, Class A real estate facilities in key markets.  Four years of hard work in the building of our DOC culture have led us to our second quarter investment opportunities. In particular, we're proud to have acquired several of the best MOBs in the country, including the Baylor Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center built by Deeni Taylor and Jim Bremner in Dallas, Texas and 2 Ascension St. Vincent facilities in the Indianapolis MSA.  The Baylor Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center is particularly impressive. Developed by Jim Bremner and our Chief Investment Officer, Deeni Taylor while they led the Duke Healthcare development team, this may be the most impressive and valuable medical office facility in the United States. With approximately 460,000 square feet, the Baylor cancer center was completed in 2011, rated LEED Gold by the U.S. Green Building Council. The building is 95% occupied, with the largest not-for-profit health system in Texas, Baylor Scott & White, rated Aa3 by Moody's, leasing approximately 55% of the buildings. McKesson's U.S. Oncology physician group, rated Baa2, leases 40%.  In addition to hosting Baylor's oncology clinics and outpatient space which includes 4 linear accelerators, the facility is also home to Baylor's world-renowned transplant surgeons and clinics. The facility is the center of the Baylor University Medical Center campus, Baylor Scott & White's flagship hospital located in downtown Dallas, Texas.  Cancer center is connected by a sky bridge directly to Baylor's T. Boone Pickens Cancer Hospital. But you won't have to just take our word for how impressive this building is, we intend to host an investor and analyst tour of this facility in conjunction with the upcoming November NAREIT conference in Dallas. So be on the lookout for your invitation.  Like Baylor Scott & White, who chose Physicians Realty Trust as their preferred real estate partner, Ascension's St. Vincent's Hospital, rated Aa2 by Moody's and the largest not-for-profit health system in the United States, exercised the ROFO option to partner with DOC for 2 of their real estate properties. These properties, located in Indianapolis, include an 86,000 square foot property on the campus at the St. Vincent Carmel Hospital and a 100% leased MOB on the campus of the St. Vincent Fishers Hospital, St. Vincent's newest hospital in Central Indiana. Established in 2013, the Fishers Hospital specializes in pediatric specialty care in conjunction with the on-site Peyton Manning Children's Outpatient Center.  As previously announced, we've entered into purchase and sell agreements to acquire 2 multi-tenant properties affiliated with Northside Hospital in Atlanta. One of the 2 properties comprises 363,000 square feet on campus, while the other is off-campus in a strategically important location with very attractive demographics.  As part of the deal, Northside Hospital also granted a certain development rights to some of the last available real estate on Atlanta's Pill Hill medical market. Those rights were not available as part of a larger Duke portfolio transaction. The acquisition of the Northside MOB is expected to be completed during this third quarter of 2017.  Finally, our execution in a very successful integration of last year's roughly $700 million portfolio investment with CHI gave us the opportunity to acquire another $157 million in high-quality facilities with this system in an exclusive off-market transaction valued at a 6.8% cap rate. These 13 buildings total 677,000 square feet, are 99% leased, with 93% of that represented by new, 10-year leases and 2.5% annual escalators with the applicable CHI hospital. The average age of this portfolio is 10 years, with the price of this investment being the brand-new, 129,000 square foot on-campus CHI health clinic building in Omaha, Nebraska.  CHI is the third largest not-for-profit health system in the United States and we're pleased to have worked in direct negotiations with them to expand the relationship with this latest acquisition.  All in all, our disciplined and relationship-based investment approach has once again brought us the best possible outcome, outstanding, A+, high-quality medical office facilities without the all-or-nothing approach required in a typical portfolio transaction.  The scope of opportunities available to Physicians Realty Trust has changed, but the strategy of sourcing the best possible facilities for investment through our relationships with health systems and physician groups has not. In fact, the number and quality of our relationships continues to grow every quarter as our reputation for partnership and customer service with providers continues to spread.  Our asset management team's keen focus on operational excellence and outstanding customer service is proven in our just completed Kingsley tenant satisfaction survey. We surveyed more than 400 tenants, representing over 2.5 million square feet and are proud to report that we received an industry-leading 64% response rate while beating the Kingsley average index score in every major category. Typical response rates for these surveys are between 45% to 55%, so 64% demonstrates the close relationship between asset -- our asset management team and our health care provider partners. DOC's score of 90% for both management satisfaction and responsiveness beat the Kingsley REIT average. Best of all, only a handful of tenants throughout the survey indicated their intentions of not renewing their lease. Just as we have worked hard to leverage our relationships to grow, we have also worked hard to maintain and enhance our relationships and reputation as the preferred health care real estate owner of hospitals and health care providers.  Before Jeff reviews the second quarter financial results, consistent with our commitment to transparency, we want to provide an update on Foundation Healthcare and Trios.  With respect to the foundation assets, San Antonio and El Paso are each making their regularly scheduled rental payments per their leases and have done so throughout the entire second quarter. The business for each surgical hospital is improving and we're optimistic that the operations, management and improvement plans are working for each.  San Antonio has begun paying additional rent payments to get caught up within the next 12 months with the fourth quarter 2016 rent payments and 2016 real estate taxes that are due. El Paso is paying their currently scheduled rent and did so throughout the second quarter and we continue to work with them on plans to recoup the 6-month arrears on rent, representing the fourth quarter 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.  We continue to work towards the disposition of these 4 buildings as well as the Oklahoma City Foundation asset but can't yet provide definitive timing or pricing information. Due to the current rent payments, we're recording cash revenue for each of these buildings and currently do not anticipate future additional accounting charges related to them.  In Trios, the Kennewick, Washington medical office building, as we have shared over the last couple of months, Trios Health system in Kennewick, Washington has struggled this year and, unfortunately, as of May, has not been paying rent in the medical office building we own which is attached to their new hospital and leased to them for 30 years. As of June 30, 2017, the hospital government agency filed for Chapter 9 reorganization with the intention of reorganizing and emerging from the reorganization process with an improved balance sheet.  Trios is a local community hospital mission-critical to the city and they are working on a turnaround plan, including, most importantly, with HUD, to refinance the hospital's debt which should provide substantial relief to their cash flow. They are also considering potential strategic transactions.  Because we can't project when they will be paying rent, we elected to take a $2.8 million charge this quarter for past accrued straight-line rent which we disclosed during our recent offering. We will not be booking any revenue in this lease until we get more certainty of payment as we work with them on a resolution through the Chapter 9 process.  After considering revenue not recorded during the quarter, the total impact to earnings due to the Kennewick delinquency was $0.03 per share for the second quarter, with the forward quarterly impact being approximately $1.2 million per quarter in lost cash revenue until resolved.  While we're disappointed in the current status of this asset, we remain optimistic this investment will be accretive long term to DOC. And note, neither the hospital nor the medical office facility has ceased providing services to this community.  Jeff will now discuss our results for the second quarter. And after that, we'll address any of your questions. Jeff?
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2017, the company generated funds from operations of $32.6 million or $0.20 per share. Our normalized funds from operations were $37.9 million. Normalized funds from operations per share were $0.24 and our normalized funds available for distribution were $34.2 million or $0.21 per share.  As John discussed in his prepared remarks and as detailed in our June press release, our tenant in Kennewick, Washington ceased paying rent and has entered into Chapter 9 bankruptcy. While we strongly believe in the value of that building, we did not collect the full second quarter of rent and wrote off the previously recognized straight-line rent asset for a total charge of $4.1 million or about $0.03 per share.  Our acquisitions this quarter totaled $588 million and we purchased some extremely high-quality medical office buildings, including some that would be widely considered as among the best in the country. The average first year expected cash yield on these investments is 5.3%. Our relationship strategy of investing continues to pay dividends for us and our pipeline continues to build. As a result, we recently increased our acquisition guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for the full year of 2017.  In terms of timing, the vast majority of our acquisitions took place at the very end of this quarter. Had we acquired all of the second quarter acquisitions at the beginning of the quarter, they would have contributed about $7.5 million of additional cash NOI.  Turning to operations. Our same-store portfolio which represents 55% of our total portfolio, generated year-over-year cash NOI growth of 1%. This number is heavily impacted by the loss of the Kennewick rent in the second quarter. We continue to believe that assuming reasonable capital expenditures, our MOB portfolio can expect to achieve 2% to 3% year-over-year same-store NOI growth on a long term basis.  Our overall occupancy remains the best in the sector at 96.3%. Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.9 million and should trend a bit lower in the second half of the year as we benefit from our 8.5-year average lease term and our less than 1.2% of GLA rolling in the remainder of the year. Our balance sheet is the healthiest in the sector and was fortified by our 20 million-share follow-on stock offering in early July which funded our second quarter acquisitions and prefunded our acquisition pipeline. We also issued just over 4 million shares through our ATM program in the second quarter of this year.  At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-total assets was 38%, but pro forma for our July equity offering, this ratio would have been about 28%. We're in excellent shape from a capital standpoint going forward and have more than adequate debt capacity to fund the rest of our 2017 acquisition pipeline.  Turning to our dividend. In the second quarter, after closely examining the situation in Kennewick as well as our projected earnings growth, the board recommended an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.005 per share, bringing it to $0.23 per share.  Finally to briefly touch on G&A, our G&A for the quarter was $6.25 million which puts us at about $11 million for the year and on track to meet our previously discussed guidance range of $22 million to $24 million for 2017.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. From the beginning, our mission has been to very selectively cultivate a pure-play medical office building portfolio with our best-in-class operating platform to produce reliable, rising cash flows and dividends for our investors that will endure all economic cycles. Our strategy is intact and thriving.  Now we'll be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: So just sticking on or focusing on tenants. Any thoughts around the planned sale of some of the KentuckyOne Health assets? Does that impact you in any way? And just once again on the tenant question, can you give us a sense of your exposure to 21st Century Oncology?
John Thomas: Yes, sure, Vikram and good afternoon. So CHI announced earlier this summer and they had shared it with us before they announced it, that they were going to sell their Louisville-based hospitals, not the Lexington hospitals which perform very well, but the Louisville facilities themselves. They hired, ironically, Morgan Stanley to run a process. I think they've had a fairly large number of hospitals, both for-profit and nonprofit, including some of what we understand to be the largest health systems in both spaces across the country, are looking at the possible purchase of those buildings. We believe the operations in those have deteriorated historically and from their historically very strong position. So we think new management, I think, CHI, concluded a different management would -- could be very successful there. So we think it's going to be a positive for us. The leases that we have there are mostly with the hospitals, any buyer would have to assume those leases as well as part of the transaction. So we're monitoring it and look forward to working with the pending potential owner there. It's 4 buildings that are 100% occupied there. On 21st Century -- excuse me, not 4 buildings. On 21st Century, we have 4 buildings, about 45,000 square feet that -- 3 of those buildings are some of the most successful practices within the 21st Century Oncology organization. So the bankruptcy there is at the corporate parent, not at these individual locations. We had actually recently negotiated long term extensions on those leases and believe those will be executed in time. So 100% occupied, currently about 8 years on the lease, but we have extensions pending. And they're currently paying their rent and always have as -- on time and schedule.
Jeffrey Theiler: And Vikram, this is Jeff. It works out to about 0.5% of our annual base rent. So it's a pretty small number.
John Thomas: Yes.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And then just one other bigger-picture question. Developments, obviously, become more of a focus some of your peers now. Just maybe update us on your thoughts, sort of acquisitions versus trying to kind of maybe follow a development route given where we're in the cycle.
John Thomas: We have great relationships with developers. We recently announced that Jim Bremner is restarting his development firm and we'll be working closely with Jim. We work closely with Mark Davis, John Klauzada [ph] at Cambridge. We're real excited about the developer relationships where they have the local relationships with health systems. They get pre-leased buildings. And typically, if we have the opportunity, we might provide some low-risk, but nice-yielding mezzanine capital and have the optionality but not the obligation to purchase those buildings upon completion. So we think that's the right strategy for a public company and for us and really maximizes our opportunities with those developers that have health system relationships. And then Deeni and myself and Dan Klein and our old team really actually source development relationships, then we find developers to hand those off to and then deliver them for the health system client and then bring us back the opportunity to purchase them later. So we think it's a good, low-risk strategy but maximizes the opportunity.
Operator: The next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Curious, coming back to Kentucky for a second. I think in June, you had a $38 million portfolio under a letter of intent. I was curious if that was in the pending acquisition still.
John Thomas: Oh, the Lexington, yes. So we're still working with the physician group there. In fact, they moved that transaction forward, but we're not yet closed. So probably -- I mean, it'll be third or fourth quarter at the latest, but...
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then on sort of the pipeline, what's the appetite from a pricing perspective for some of the higher-quality assets? Obviously, for some of the highest-quality assets, so you're seeing the sub-5% cap rates you guys have executed. Should we anticipate that that's now in the range?
John Thomas: Now what you should still anticipate and what you'll see more of sort of our pipeline is really as good and the highest quality it's ever been. Cap rates have tightened and we paid for an incredibly fantastic quality, as we've pointed out and will show you when we tour the buildings in Dallas. But we're seeing a lot of opportunities in the mid-5s to 6% cap rate range and I think the rest of the year is going to look more like that. We don't think it's necessary to dip below 5% for outstanding quality unless the quality and other ancillary benefits of those relationships prove out, but we're seeing plenty in the 5.5% to 6% range.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then just one for you, Jeff, on -- oh, sorry on Foundation. What was the rent that was paid during the quarter on Foundation? And is that -- was that a full quarter's run rate?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. So between the three different locations, it was about $2.3 million and that's a pretty good run rate for at least the foreseeable future. It does include a $330,000 catch-up payment that San Antonio has been making that they'll make through the end of this year. So that's a good run rate for at least the next couple quarters.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And that's what you're booking in the top line, the $2.3 million?
Jeffrey Theiler: Correct.
Jordan Sadler: And same -- staying on Trios, just a clarification. I think you said you took a $4.1 million charge in the quarter. That's also running through the top line. And so what portion of that? Was it the $2.8 million that was onetime?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, the $2.8 million was onetime, that's exactly right. And then there's $1.2 million that's not recorded rent. So -- but the $2.8 million is the write-off of previously booked straight-line rent.
Jordan Sadler: So sequentially, you need to pump that up by $2.8 million, okay.
Jeffrey Theiler: Exactly.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James.
Jonathan Hughes: Can you talk about the 3.5% NOI growth in the quarter that excludes Trios and what drove that and then also the 60% retention rate which is kind of a bit lower than I would have expected?
John Thomas: Yes, Mark?
Mark Theine: Sure, Jon, I'm happy to. So in the same-store analysis, we had some successful lease-up of a few buildings. Our Peachtree Dunwoody Medical Center, as we've talked about in previous quarters, we've done a great job of re-leasing the building up to 95% with leases signed and some of those tend to be taking occupancy in the fall and continuing to pay rent there. And then a couple other buildings, our Nashville MOB and HonorHealth building and Napoleon. So it's really all lease-up driving our same-store this quarter, in addition to our annual average rent bump of 2.4% across the portfolio, that's really driving that up to 3.5%.
Jonathan Hughes: And then the retention?
Mark Theine: Yes, retention rate, we re-leased 60% and what's driving that down is really one lease. It's the Oklahoma City Foundation mass re-lease which we terminated. Now we entered into a new lease directly with the group of physician subtenants in that building. So it had no impact on our leasing -- on our overall rent rate. But it -- on the retention rate, it hurts that -- sorry.
Jeffrey Theiler: Found that statistic. The other thing I want to mention was the other part of that retention rate, Jonathan, was the expiration of space in our corporate office building which we intend to occupy. So we essentially let them move out.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. So a bit of it was planned?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes. So it's just under 80%. I think it was 78% without those 2 items.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, yes, that sounds more like it. Okay and then turning back to Trios and sorry if I missed this, but is there a chance of recovering that $5 million or so in annual rent from the parent? Any plans to maybe sell that asset if an offer comes to you as part of their restructuring and that process that they're running?
John Thomas: Yes, Jonathan, this is J.T. We'll evaluate all those options. We certainly intend to recover as much of their past due rent as possible and non-paying rent going forward during the bankruptcy process. Right now that hospital and that market supports -- still supports this investment to get their balance sheet corrected and get back to the kind of historical run rate that they had and that we underwrote when we did the transaction. We really re-evaluated and looked back at everything we looked at in our underwriting and it's hard to say -- other than the fact that they ultimately had a major misstep this year, it's hard to say we wouldn't have made that investment again. And going forward, we'll just evaluate all options and see who they -- if they become a part of a bigger system, it may create more opportunity for us and maintain and start recovering not only the actual cash rent but back on straight line as well. So we'll just have to let it play out. Our expectation is probably nothing gets recovered in 2017 while it goes through the bankruptcy process. And hopefully, it's resolved by 2018.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. All right, just one more for me. The assets slated for disposition were paid at kind of like $100 million, $125 million at the start of this year. Is that bogey still standing? Can we expect a similar pace in future years?
John Thomas: Great question. So we're still working -- most of that is the -- are the foundation assets. We're still working with the physicians. They've been focused on operational improvement and doing a great job while, at the same time, having ancillary discussions with us, secondary discussions with us about purchasing those buildings and working with capital providers and banks to evaluate that option. So we still think that's the route that those will go. We don't have anything signed today. And I think we're getting to a point in time in our -- in the life of the organization. We just had our fourth anniversary. we'll start looking at kind of on an annual basis assets for disposition to, again, just totally or do -- continue to enhance the quality of the portfolio and appropriate grooming.
Mark Theine: Yes.
Jeffrey Theiler: And Jonathan, sorry, this is Jeff. Just to jump in. That $100 million to $120 million, part of that was the $4 million portfolio in Georgia that we sold already for about $18.5 million and that was about a 6.8% cap rate.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Carroll: John, can you talk a little bit about how your investment strategy has evolved over the past few years? I mean, obviously, you've been going after lower-cap rate assets over the past several quarters. I mean, how do these deals differ from the ones that you completed 2, 3 years ago?
John Thomas: I mentioned that in my comments, Mike, is that early life of the company, we had a relatively high cost of capital. So kind of working with our relationships but really more focused on secondary markets because that's where we could find attractive opportunities, again, that were accretive with our cost of capital. But as we've grown and investors have supported us and our cost of capital has come down, we still follow our relationships into secondary markets. But the best health systems, the mass populations are in places like Dallas and Indianapolis and Atlanta, Minneapolis, Columbus, Ohio, Phoenix, Arizona, all great markets for health care and so as our cost of capital has improved, again, same strategies, working with great providers in those markets. But those tend to be more expensive places. And as investors from around the world have pumped capital into the space and are chasing these assets, the value has obviously increased, reflecting the 4.5% cap rate on the Duke deal and then the 4.7% on the -- what we believe are the 5 best assets in that portfolio that came to us through the ROFO process. So I think the strategy is the same. Strategy is intact. So obviously, we've got to make investment decisions that are accretive to our cost of capital. And sometimes, things come with the relationships that don't necessarily have a day 1 yield or acquisitions that don't have a day 1 yield. But when you get outstanding development rights which we would work with a third party to develop future buildings, accretion comes out of the transaction that way.
Michael Carroll: Yes. And so I guess would it make sense to go through your portfolio and identify some noncore assets and do some noncore asset sales?
John Thomas: That's what we were talking about with Jonathan just a minute ago and I think we're getting to point and decide. We have 275 buildings now, so evaluating whatever -- I think, say, the lowest 10% of the portfolio and evaluating those for potential disposition is something we'll start doing more routinely and annually and we'll talk about those type of decisions and give guidance if and when appropriate in the future. One thing I wanted to mention as Mark was talking about our same-store performance, 4 of our 5 best same-store performers this quarter were all -- are all off-campus but strategically located, health system-anchored medical office buildings. So again, we still continue to believe on-campus is great and valuable, but you can have very successful off-campus buildings that are more convenient for patients and physicians and continue to be where health care is going and where you -- where we think we need to be investing as well as on-the-campus are great hospitals.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. And then I guess last question, Jeff. Can you kind of talk about the CapEx assumptions that we should think about going forward? I mean, what's the breakout between your current CapEx and TIs? And what's a typical TI package for the leases that you signed?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, so I'll let -- I'll turn it over to Mark for the TI packages because we did have some statistics on that for renewal and new leases. And I know you have them right there, Mark.
Mark Theine: Sure. So CapEx for the remainder of the year, we see somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 million to $5 million per quarter in kind of recurring CapEx for the next 2 quarters. And then on leasing, for new leases this quarter, we actually had a very great quarter for 16 new leases that average 10-year terms and 3% annual bumps, with an average of $27 per square foot for TI. So that's $2.70 per square foot per year. That's a bit light than what we normally average, around $5 per square foot per year. And then on the renewal side, we completed 32 leases in the quarter with an average of 6.4 years at a 1.9% average increase and about $1 per square foot per year for the TI portion there. So great quarter, up over 300,000 square foot of leasing. That's on pretty attractive terms.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Vanacore of Stifel.
Chad Vanacore: So what do you have to see -- and this is in light of you doing some sub-5% cap rate deals. What do you have to see in either property or tenant that makes you want to pay that premium price?
John Thomas: Well, the credit, the opportunity for growth. As I mentioned, the 5 buildings we bought are anchored by Baylor Scott & White, Ascencion, both Aa, high investment grade, still aggressively growing health care systems in great markets. If you hadn't been to Dallas lately, it's -- I think there's something like $5 billion for the corporate office under construction right now already leased. So it's a thriving market. And Baylor Scott & White, this is the anchor facility of the State of Texas, the largest non-profit health system. So -- and then future opportunities that we believe will come out of those relationships as well. I think you know I was General Counsel there. Deeni and Jim Bremner built that building on that campus. I just -- it's hard to imagine a higher-quality real estate investment in any asset class than that building. The two in Indianapolis are similar ones, both on thriving hospital campuses and fantastic demographics in the suburbs of Indianapolis. And then Atlanta just continues to grow as well and Northside Hospital has one of the strongest financial balance sheets of any hospital in the country and they continue to grow aggressively. They're already a nice tenant of ours in the Peachtree Dunwoody building. This building that Deeni bought and redeveloped for them at Centerpoint [ph] is right behind it. And kind of cohesively, those 2 buildings strategically work well -- very well together kind of in tandem. And then the development site, theirs is really the last piece of developer land anywhere near those hospitals. There's 2 other hospital systems right there. So all those are the attributes that led us to see the opportunity even at that high price. We also got lease enhancements as part of the transaction to make those cap rates even more valuable to us going forward. So those are the kind of things and ideally growing with the relationships. But the -- we see and we still see a ton of opportunities. Cap rates seem compressed, but we still are seeing a lot of opportunities in the 5.5% to 6% cap range. So I think that's more the norm. And when we get down lower, there's going to be something else there that's going to drive us to pay the appropriate price.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And presumably, the recent acquisitions, they're high quality and good markets. So what kind of annual rent growth should we expect on those leases?
John Thomas: Those are all in the 2.5% to 3% range. The cancer center has got 17,000 feet that's vacant and we've got active leases in discussions on those -- on that space. So 17,000 feet. A building in some markets, it's 5% of this building, so it's not a huge driver of future NOI growth there on top of what's already in the building. But Baylor has got other expansion plans on or near that campus which, hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to work on.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And then any opportunities for operating cost savings there or maybe increase your NOI a little bit?
John Thomas: There's some potential. We already have other assets in Dallas and get some synergies out of the property management team that's there. Baylor requires you to use -- it's really an outsourced engineering service, but they require you to use their service at very effective cost then I'll pass it through to them anyway. But the property management there has Asia's outstanding; and b, she has a lot of strength to kind of manage the region for us in addition to that building. So yes, definitely on synergies. Same with Atlanta.
Operator: The next question is from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America.
John Thomas: Juan? You're on mute.
Juan Sanabria: I'm sorry, I was -- yes, sorry about that. Just a follow-up question on cap rates. You guys have come back a bit since your equity raised Cap rates, at least in our numbers, on an implied basis seem to be at the top end of your kind 5.5% to 6% target range. So is the message that you're still unchanged in terms of that 5.5% to 6% despite kind of a step-back in your cost of capital? Or is that kind of more fluid? As your cost of capital changes, your kind of focus deal-wise kind of goes along with your cost of capital?
Jeffrey Theiler: It's Jeff. Yes, I mean, look, we -- it goes without saying we're -- or we try to say it anyway, that all of our acquisition guidance is dependent on maintaining an appropriate cost of capital. So on the one hand, it's very fluid and we're always looking at our cost of capital in conjunction with evaluating any deal. All that being said, we think we can still do accretive deals for our shareholders at the 5.5% to 6% cap rate range. And so we're comfortable with that right now and -- but we evaluate it on a daily basis.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then just tenant watch list. Obviously, Trios just happened. Anything else that kind of stands out of your mind that is worth flagging as something else that may be an issue down the track? Or any way to quantify that watch list in any form?
John Thomas: Now -- Juan, this is J.T. The foundation in Kennewick are the 2 of our 275 -- well, 5 Foundation buildings and the 1 Kennewick building. So you've got those 5 buildings and we've been very transparent about the issues there. Across the portfolio, we evaluate all tenants routinely and don't see other material issues, so -- at this time. So things can change, but we don't have any material issues that we're concerned about.
Operator: The next question is from Jared Wagner [ph] of BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: It's John Kim actually. So I had a question on your CHI assets, either the ones you bought recently this year or the ones that you've held for a year. How comfortable are you that these are assets that are long term holds for CHI as they go through their merger talks with Dignity?
John Thomas: Yes, John, thanks for the question. But we -- the original portfolio that we bought last year had brand-new buildings and some buildings that were older but on-campus of their affiliated hospitals. So over time, we'll evaluate that -- those assets. We have no restriction on being able to sell or reposition those buildings if and when appropriate. For the foreseeable future, we made that investment expecting long term holds. But in some cases, we did underwrite as part of the transaction kind of shorter hold periods on some of the older assets. In the new ones -- new portfolio, the average age is 10 years. But really, as I mentioned, the price -- the portfolio is brand new in Omaha, Nebraska. So a strong region for CHI, one of the strongest that they have. And so we expect those assets -- so we really -- we evaluated a lot more buildings than the ones we bought and decided not to buy others and had a good process with CHI to try to get the proceeds -- lower proceeds they were looking for but get the higher-quality assets that we could. So new 10-year leases, 2.5% increases in those. And we expect them to perform and be in our portfolio for a long time.
John Kim: So for some of those older assets that you may decide to sell together, how does that work under the master lease agreement?
John Thomas: There's no restriction at all on us being able to sell any building that we bought from them, one at a time or multiples at a time. So some of those older ones are -- in the original portfolio were actually in that Louisville which is going through the sale process. So maybe an opportune time as part of that to sell them or reposition them with the buyer that comes into there. But we'll just evaluate that as that process plays out. As far as the potential merger with Dignity Health, we don't have any new updates there. I'd say we continue to expect and continue to hear from CHI management that they expect that transaction to move forward, but it's not a done deal yet. They don't overlap with any markets. You can probably read the tea leaves that selling the Louisville market is probably something that they came to the conclusion together to do that. But otherwise, their intentions are and they've told us as part of their process, that they don't expect to close any hospitals or to move out of any other markets, so.
John Kim: Okay. And then can you just elaborate on what your relationship will be like with Jim Bremner going forward? I know you discussed it a little bit earlier in the call, but it doesn't sound like what -- sound like it's exclusive. If you paid on a retainer basis. Or how does it work?
John Thomas: Yes, Jim -- we like Mark Davis, who we have a great partnership with as well. Very similar structure. We have a consulting agreement with Jim that provides some incentives for him to help us on some acquisition opportunities and to source some acquisition opportunities with us. But his developments and development firm is, I'd say, independent of ours, but we do have some opportunities to participate in. And like I said, it would be in the form of mezzanine debt and most likely in transactions that he sources or that we source with him, with organizations, again, like Baylor and other health systems where Jim has great relationships as does Deeni and myself, so.
Operator: The next question is from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.
Andrew Babin: If I remember right, last quarter you talked about 2% as kind of the bogey for renewals and re-leasing spreads going forward. Would that still be a good modeling assumption as we go through the next couple years?
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, I think that is a good modeling assumption, Drew.
Andrew Babin: Okay. And then a follow-up question just on the deals closing in 2Q and 3Q. Longer term and I'm by no means asking for guidance, but do you think that maybe 2.5% to 3.5% same-store NOI growth kind of on a run rate basis a couple years out is something that's potentially achievable given kind of the characteristics of some of the assets you bought more recently?
Jeffrey Theiler: Well, look, I mean, I think any time you're buying high-quality assets, you've got the opportunity to grow NOI at a higher rate over a longer period of time. I mean -- but you're somewhat limited in the sense that you're acquiring leases intact. So I think that we continue to say 2% to 3% NOI growth is pretty much the standard for medical office buildings. We think we'll be, over the long term, right in that range. I think if you're looking out after these leases expire but are -- there's the opportunity to perhaps roll up more than you might otherwise. But that's years out. Our average lease terms is 8.5 years. So over the long term, yes. Over the short term, I think it's really a 2% to 3% NOI growth story.
Andrew Babin: Okay. So a lot of that growth isn't necessarily in scheduled rent bumps but more just in the re-leasing opportunity in the future and just being able to maintain a higher occupancy rate? Is that fair?
Jeffrey Theiler: That's fair. Yes, that's fair.
Operator: And our final question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo Okusanya: You've done slightly under $1 billion of acquisitions for the year and guidance is $1.22 billion to $1.4 billion. So you still kind of have a fair amount of deals that you're expecting to do. Could you just kind of talk about what you're looking at? Are they portfolio transactions? One-off transactions? And kind of what you're hoping to add to improve the overall portfolio.
Jeffrey Theiler: Yes, Tayo, so what you're going to see for the rest of the year is some really high-quality, off-market, hospital system-anchored buildings, some on-campus, some off, again very similar to what we bought for the -- in the first 9 months but the -- more in the 5.5% to 6% range. So we know -- we provided that range for the guidance. We feel good about that range and we have a balance sheet fully capable of executing on that guidance without raising additional capital.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you, that's helpful. And then just the Foundation MOB in Oklahoma City. Any reason that is no longer under purchase agreement? Did that transaction just not kind of come to fruition?
John Thomas: Yes, the physician group and a couple of local businessmen in Oklahoma City that they're working with to buy it slowed down their process. They're looking for -- frankly, they're looking for -- trying to figure out their use of the -- the old Foundation space is no longer occupied there and that's that lease that we terminated during the process. So we entered into a direct lease with that group for their space as opposed to the sublease under Foundation. That lease has a purchase option in it on the terms that we originally negotiated. So we expect that transaction may still come about. But at the same time, we have the freedom to sell the building to somebody else and we've had an inbound inquiry and kind of working through terms with that buyer as well. So the -- again, we still expect that -- it's a nice building in a great -- good health care location. We do expect to sell it but obviously can't guarantee that.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.
John Thomas: Again, thank you for joining us. And as we said at the opening, look forward to receiving an invitation to come visit the finest medical office building in the country in downtown Dallas, Texas, 2 -- one of -- 2 of the best health care tenants you could ever want to have. And we look forward to seeing you there and look forward to your calls. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

John Thomas: Good afternoon, thank you for joining us for the Physicians Realty Trust first quarter 2017 earnings call. We are very pleased to share our results for the first quarter, our disciplined growth strategy continues to enhance our operational scale and platform as evidenced by our outstanding operating results for this quarter. Our portfolio is now more than 96% occupied among the healthcare REIT industry. We believe that high occupancy not only provides our shareholders with reliable dividend income and strong earnings growth potential, but also benefits the health system and provide our clients to trust their facility. Our ability to attract and lease space to additional position within these facilities, further to help them from clinical and business interest while increasing access to care for everyone. Our relationship with Catholic Health Initiatives or CHI and the integration of their outpace of medical facilities into our platform has been outstanding, and the CHI portfolio continue to perform better than expected. This quarter we made over $248 million of new investment including some of the best investments we have made in the short history of Physicians Realty Trust. The 127,000 square feet Strictly Pediatrics Specialty Center in Austin Texas featured in our supplement is one of the best medical office facilities in the country. It is a 100% leased anchored by a Seaton Healthcare which occupied more than 50% of the building and also features space lease by DELL Children's Hospital. The only freestanding pediatric facility in the Austin region. Our teams are in the trustiest positions to own and occupied the building with our exceptional reputation as the MOB Owner of Choice. And we were able to execute on a creative acquisition structure which address the goals of physicians as a whole and individually. This quarter we also acquired a 72,000 square feet Harper Healthcare MOB in Connecticut. The 95% leased MOB is anchored by Harper Healthcare and the Hospital of Central Connecticut which leases 60% of the space for comprehensive outpatient cancer care. The remaining space is least physicians providing oncology services and a dominant orthopedic practice in Harper Connecticut. This is a lightly marketed acquisition that we acquired through the owners. Our discipline and focus on enhancing the overall quality of our medical office portfolio with premium quality acquisitions at the right price will build long-term value and earnings for our organization. Last quarter, we announced guidance expecting to invest between $800 million to $1 billion in 2017. We are well on our way to meeting those expectations. Our best-in-class operating platform delivered an outstanding 6.7% same-store cash net operating income during the first quarter and even after adjusting for some exceptional onetime positive event Mark Theine and his team delivered 3.5% same-store cash NOI. Mark will share more about our operational performance in a few minutes. As we progress to the second quarter and the reminder of the year, our balance sheet couldn’t be stronger. Our first quarter included another milestone event as we issued $400 million of a inaugural expected grade bonds at excellent prices. We also had a successful $300 million equity raise which Jeff will discuss in few minutes. We would like to provide a quick update on the foundation and healthcare facilities. As we reported last quarter, foundation and healthcare facilities El Paso, San Antonio and Oklahoma City began struggle in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we announced reserves related to their ability to pay rent. We are pleased to report that El Paso Hospital has been recapitalized and operations have improved. The hospital resumed paying their normal monthly rent on April 1, and we expect them to pay rent at schedule going forward. Further we are working with the physicians on the collection of background as well as the potential sell of the facility through the physician group. We are also pleased to report that the San Antonio operators have paid rent every month this year and we are working with them on a scheduled plan to recoup the unpaid rent from 2016. Finally, the Oklahoma City’s MOB remains under a binding purchase agreement and on track to complete the sale under their contract. We cannot provide any assurance that it will close, but we are optimistic about privilege. All-in-all, we are pleased with the progress of the foundation portfolio and we will provide update, if we went, we complete to sale if each of those assets. I’m sure, you are all aware of a new high watermark in evaluation of Medical Office Building that were set this week. While, the overall price pay for these assets exceeded our disciplined approach to underwriting evaluation. The interested portfolio generated confirms we always believe. Medical Office offers the best risk adjusted return in healthcare real estate and perhaps in any real estate asset class. We are optimistic as ever about our growth in the opportunity in front of us. We are focused on investing on the highest quality in Medical Office, with the highest quality of health systems and physicians. As we do, we remain firmly committed to transparency with our investors and are proud to do so as we seek long-term support for our long-term business plan, which will benefit our health system plans and physicians. We see every opportunity to continue our high pace of growth growing intelligently without undue risk, while maintaining the strong balance sheet to answer the call from the hospitals and physicians we work with providing them the capital they need to execute on their clinical missions and business. I will now turn it over to Jeff to discuss our financial results. Jeff.
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated funds from operations of $34.1 million or $0.24 per share. Our normalized funds from operations was $39.6 million, normalized funds from operations per share were $0.28 and our normalized funds available for distribution were $35 million or $0.25 per share. We again has demonstrate outstanding earnings growth for our shareholders with year-over-year growth of 27% in normalized FFO per share and 25% in FAD per share, compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to find great value on the acquisition front in the first quarter closing on $248 million of investments at an average first year cash yield of 6.0%. This quarter’s acquisitions represented outstanding quality at truly outstanding value. Our best-in-class acquisition team continues to do the hard work sourcing deals that will create value for shareholders on both in earnings and net asset value basis. Had we acquired all of these assets at the beginning of the quarter, they would have contributed an additional $2.4 million of cash NOI. Our people is strong and we remain confident that we will be able to source the $800 million to $1 billion of acquisitions that we guided to for 2017. Turning to operations, our same-store portfolio, which represents about 54% of our total portfolio, generated year-over-year cash NOI growth of 6.7%. while same-store cash NOI growth is a number that tends to vary from quarter-to-quarter. The variance this quarter is largely than usual primarily due to tenants taking occupancy and our Nashville Medical Office Building. Absent unusual item, our portfolio generated 3.5% same-store growth. Leasing activity on our portfolios an outstanding with 96.5% of our portfolio leases. This fits our strategy of keeping our buildings full. Full buildings create a vibrant atmosphere for our tenants, as well as value enhancing referral patents, is one of the operational philosophies that we believe distinguish us and make us a favorite partner of many healthcare systems. Mark will provide more detail on operations in a few moments. As usual, our balance sheet metrics ranked as the best in the sector, as we fill to fund building the company in a methodical way with the priority of keeping the strong fundamental capital base. We achieved 17.25 million shares of stock and overnight offering in the first quarter raising net equity proceeds for the Company of $301 million, which fully funded our first quarter acquisitions. At the end of the quarter, we had debt-to-total capitalization of 24% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.4 times. Our $850 million line of credit is fully available and as at quarter-end we had a $117 million of cash on hand. We also entered into the public bond market in the first quarter with our $400 million inaugural bond offering in March. We were able to upsize that offering from our planned $300 million raise due to the high investor demand and we were able to price the coupon at 4.3% truly an outstanding result for the company. With access to both the public and private debt market and our loyal equity investor base, we believe the company has never been as well positioned on the capital side as it is today. I’ll now turn it over to Mark to provide some additional commentary on operations.
Mark Theine: Great. As Jeff mentioned, DOC began 2017 at the same fast pace where we left off last year. our portfolio now totaled more than medical office building poised for continued strong growth and operational excellence. The first quarter of 2017 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in our portfolio with nearly 143,000 square feet of new or renewing leases are executed. Due to the leadership of Amy Hall, DOC’s VP of leasing and Dave Domres and Mark Dukes who lead DOC’s asset management teams our industry leading occupancy for the full portfolio is 96.5%. Our same-store portfolio saw an increase in occupancy of nearly 1% from 95.4% to 96.3%. This tremendous leasing momentum drove a 6.7% growth in same-store net operating income year-over-year. Excluding the initial lease up as Jeff mentioned in our Nashville MOB, our same-store portfolio grew at a solid 3.5%, once again driven by the increase in occupancy including several new leases and lease expansions completed at the Peachtree Dunwoody Medical Centre in Atlanta, Georgia. As you may recall, DOC required the Peachtree Dunwoody Medical Centre, a trophy 603 assets totaling 131,000 square feet in February of 2014. Situated on Pill Hill, a concentrated cluster of three hospital campuses, the facility was 95% leased with an average lease term of 5.3 years at the time of purchase. Just over a year ago, we reported the Northside Hospital would be vacating approximately 18,000 square feet of the building effective March 31, 2016 due to retiring physicians and a planned consolidation of its place in an adjacent hospital owned MOB. The vacancy is not only lower the Peachtree Dunwoody’s occupancy to 80%, but it impacted part of our 2016 same-store results to around 2% at the low end of our expectations. I’m proud to report that over the last 12 months our team has worked hard to identify, negotiate and execute yearly 21,000 square feet of new leases to backfill that vacated space and more. Additionally, we completed several early lease renewals which today expand the average lease term remaining in the building to over seven years. With leases signed for 96% of the building, only one suite is still available totaling about 5000 square feet and multiple parties are touring that space. Over the last year, we have enhanced the healthcare ecosystem and referral pattern within the building by completing leases for orthopedic, cardiovascular, surgery, ophthalmology and internal medicine practices. As build out suspended improvements has completed and rent commences in the second and third quarter of 2017. We anticipate the building will generate unleveraged cash yield about 7% and also a sizable increases in year-over-year cash NOI growth. These results were not only customers but the hard work of our leasing and asset management team, but to the superior location and quality of the building. Peachtree Dunwoody’s transformation is just one example of Physician Realty Trust’s dedication to excellence as we continue to maintain and expand our nationwide portfolio of high quality facilities integral for the delivery of healthcare and the community. Looking ahead for the remainder of 2017, DOC has 97 leases totaling 369,000 square feet scheduled to renew. The average rent per square feet of these leases scheduled to renew at $21.14 in line with Nashville averages for medical office building rental rates. Beyond 2017 lease expirations do not exceed 4.7% of the total portfolio in any one year over the next six years through 2023. This well balanced and later lease expirations schedule is intentional and strategic as we work to drive reliable rising cash flows and investor returns in the years to come. Our reputation as a trusted partner to our position and providers is central to this growth strategy. And our leasing and asset management teams are dedicated to providing outstanding customer service to earn these lease renewals. Ultimately having long-term value and returns for shareholders and our stake holders. With that, I'll turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you mark and great work this quarter. We will wait for [indiscernible].
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Just a question on cap rates, I know you talked about a new high watermark for the Duke portfolios sold to HTA but how are you thinking about cap rates? Does that reset the market anyway? Cap rates that you have been paying for acquisition have come down your 6% for the quarter but how should we think about cap rates for the remainder of the year and just annually?
John Thomas: Juan good afternoon I think I mean we will have to see how that plays out. We have got a nice pipeline, some of the average - in the first quarter what we have been focused on in our current pipeline is met 6% to 6.5% range, which is again reflecting very high quality as well as we talk about the two buildings that we feature today. So we will see how it plays out overtime, but it does reflect it’s a high valuation medical office buildings should attract, market capital are interested in them, but again we have got a very good pipeline and those type of numbers and we are going to continue to pick our plum in those branches. Let's see how it plays out.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then just on foundation, any sense of potential proceeds or how should we think about potential dilution from those assets if they are sold and if you could comment just on the cap rate on the Georgia assets that were sold during the quarter?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, so Juan its Jeff, we are negotiating prices on El Paso and San Antonio foundation assets, the Oklahoma City assets is pretty low cap rate right now, because there is vacancy in there. But I think on Georgia assets, it was a fix - that’s right 18.2 million and that helped to improve average age and occupancy of our building that’s all in those four applets.
Juan Sanabria: Okay and just one last quick question from me, I don’t know if I misunderstood, but are you saying the 2017 lease expirations are basically in line with market? And if that so, how should we think about kind of 2018 and 2019, are those in line with market as well or above or below?
John Thomas: Yes, this year $21 in line with market averages. Over the next two years in schedule we have in our supplemented a little bit below that and so we expect to continue to grow our ramp at 2% to 3% a year on renewals.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks guys.
John Thomas: Thanks Juan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks guys. I wanted to just follow up on the pricing discussion a little bit. So based on your recent high quality acquisitions versus recent market portfolio transactions, what would you call a portfolio premium today?
John Thomas: We have always thought about it being 50 basis points may be higher 100 basis points in this context. So we have seen assets trading sub six, we are best-in-class building just bought] just below six. So that’s 5.5 to 6.5 range should be pretty solid for best-in-class MOB.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And I know obviously recent transaction may reset some expectations, but I guess coming back to your pipeline, is it possible on a one-off basis to be able to generally back fill or complete what is in your guidance for acquisitions, similar type of quality the way you did in the quarter at the stated gap rates that you just mentioned the six, 6.5?
John Thomas: Yes, I think that’s where our focus is going to be and we feel pretty good about that. So again best-in-class single assets may go below to six number, but it will have a five in it and like I said I think on the average maybe the low end goes a little bit below six. But just the loss about opportunities between that numbers second half.
Jordan Sadler: Are these assets that you acquired in the first quarter, can you just characterize ground lease versus fee and then 603?
John Thomas: 603 and fee, the two we featured. Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Both okay, and fee interest. Okay and then as it relates to the same-store NOI, the 3.5 is that a sustainable metric, so excluding the Nashville lease up?
Jeff Theiler: No, Jordan it's Jeff. No, I think we pretty consistently said that absent kind of unreasonable capital expenditures we would expect our portfolio to grow between 2% to 3% on same-store basis. But it varies, I mean sometime it’s a little bit higher, sometimes it’s a little bit lower. But on the average we would expect 2% to 3% or so. I guess that saying that in the future quarters it might be down a little bit and average out 60 basis points or 75 basis points lower.
John Thomas: Hi, Jordon so again just looking back at our all the investments that we have in the supplement only Creighton University Medical Center which is a brand new building and sort of the last major component of the original CHI transaction that’s only one of on the ground lease with the CHI hospitals in that market Creighton University Medical Centers.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then lastly if there any update or insight you might be able to provide on sort of the dignity CHI obviously nothing on their specific transaction. But in terms of your relationship and discussions with them?
Mark Theine: Yes. We don’t have any more to add, but as far as we know that the discussion continue and we think if it didn’t - all-in-all at the positive both to credit and our future opportunities, good relationships with both systems. Our IMS assets in Phoenix are tabbed, IMS is essentially owned or partly owned by Dignity. So all-in-all, a good thing we don’t hope that they will complete that merger, but opportunities is there continue with both of the questions.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. On the Duke portfolio sales, you guys don’t need as asset as long as anyone. Do you have any interest in teaming up with the hospitals on any of the purchase options?
John Thomas: Hey John. We cannot respond to that question, we can’t respond to that.
John Kim: Okay. No response maybe of both.
John Thomas: Either, no response.
John Kim: Okay. On the mortgage side, mortgages that’s expiring this year, can you just remind us on your plans on how you are going to repay that debt or maybe utilize additional mortgage debt. And maybe where do you see mortgage debt in your asset today versus the 4.3% on the unsecured that you recently raised.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Hey, John its Jeff. I mean as a general rule, I’m not sure to some reason not to - we tend to repay our mortgages when they come due. So, we don’t have very much expiring this year. I think we only have about $30 million, $31 million. So, we anticipate that we will pay these mortgage off as they expire and then bring those top reasons to our unencumbered pool and use them far against on and unsecured basis.
John Kim: Okay. And then I'm sorry if I missed this, but leasing spreads, what are you seeing as far as releasing spreads on your portfolio either what you have already accomplished in the first quarter or would you expect for the rest of the year?
John Thomas: Yes, for this quarter we renewed 25 leases about 87,000 square feet. Our leasing spreads were 2.1% and that’s the normalized taking out three leases that we did a mark-to-market and extended as part of an acquisition and we put those in our underwriting upfront at the beginning to lower those as far as the acquisition.
John Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi, yes good afternoon good to see all the acquisition activity going on. Most of my questions have been answered, but can you just feel it’s a quick update just on the not often talks about part of your portfolio which is a LTACH on the hospital portfolio kind of what is going on with that stuff simply because there is lot of noise around that area?
John Thomas: Yes Tayo this is John. So the LTACH continue to go through their transition to clinical criteria, the coverage which has been our supplement crawls our three LTACHs, this last quarter was 1.6% which is down. The Plano facility continues to really knock it out of the park, that Forth Worth and Pittsburgh facilities are kind of generally flat. So those are all three in a master release with corporate credit. We feel good about our rent but we would like to see coverage being higher of course. The hospitals again that’s really, again just to be clear we just don’t serve the hospitals on top of the LTACH or separately from the LTACH. They are all in the 2.5 coverage some aside I think. So and they all continue to operate well. again with the exception of foundation which those are operating well today, but you know had poor performance in the fourth quarter and going into the first quarter.
Tayo Okusanya: Got it and that’s helpful. Thank you, good quarter.
John Thomas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Good afternoon. A question on 603 assets, are you seen any evidence yet in terms of you releasing or pawn explorations or just out any acquisition market. 603 is value enhancing for the assets or enticing stronger renewals spreads if you are kind of or is it too early for that?
John Thomas: I think it’s generally too early, the most significant 603 leased that we renewed again we renewed at the high end of our expectations in very large part because that we knew that the hospital was not going to vacate their space because of the 603 rule. So again, straight at the end market that’s still at the high-end of market in that renewal and got a long-term lease and Mark did a great job at that. As far as cap rates, we haven’t seen a big change there, we are very attractive to those at qualification and those buildings of that quality, but again we’ve always been more comfortable going off campus and most [indiscernible] physicians and hospitals we work with. So we will see how it plays that overtime, we think it will strengthen the assets.
Drew Babin: Okay, and one question on G&A. This quarter G&A was below 9% of NOI and about 15 bps of assets, both kind of low levels relative to where you have been and kind of the consistent decline there. Is that the same sort of run rate we should expect for the rest of the year or might we see G&A kind of an proportionate basis decline further.
John Thomas: No, you know I think that we guided the 22 to 24 for the year. You know obviously we’re running a little but under that right now and my guess is we’re kind of more in that guidance range. So I expect it will pick up a little bit through the rest of the year.
Drew Babin: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you very much.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you. Just to clarify the portfolio premium comment that was interesting. So are you seeing high quality individual properties are probably in the 5.5 to six or 6.5 range and then if there was a very high quality portfolio, the premium could be 50 to 100 basis points?
Jeff Theiler: I think that’s pretty fair.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And are you aware of any sizable portfolios out there and that you may be looking at?
John Thomas: No, our regular business is that the ones [indiscernible] so again we are not aware of anything on market, it's a big portfolio.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. Then just curious that the growth or any metrics you can share between your single tenant and multi tenant properties in terms of releasing spread or just NOI growth, any metrics that - are there any differences between the two that you have seen over the last quarters or so?
John Thomas: Yes, for this quarter the single tenant assets in the same-store portfolio grew at 4.9% and the multi tenant property grew at 8.3%. Then multi tenant property include the Nashville MOBs so that one is a bit accelerated this quarter. But normally we see our single tenant portfolio growing right about 3%. Many of those buildings are fair lease back transactions but we have been able to structure the lease upfront and we put 3% in [indiscernible]. And the multi tenant buildings on a more normal basis is usually around between 2% and 3% as Jeff had mentioned before.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay and just to clarify on the expiration near-term, is there any skew either way in multi versus single?
John Thomas: Almost all multi tenant, we don’t have many single - I mean any single tenants in 2017 and maybe one in 2018 so almost all multi tenants.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just last one, just on the watch list or tenant held, just wondering if there is anything you have heard in any of your top tenants. I think [Trio’s] (Ph) has been in the news a little bit on maybe one or two of their assets, but any additional color would be helpful?
John Thomas: Other than foundation which we - again feel it positive turn around there, Trio’s has been in the news a lot. They are working through a refinancing of their hospital which will make a huge impact. They have got a balance sheet issues that can get solved if they can [indiscernible] significantly if they can refinance the hospital though that or otherwise. So [indiscernible] but otherwise operation and - we continue to work with them, but expect to find a long-term. It will work with them as a good partner in short-term.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Chad Vanacore: Alright, thank you. So what are some of the one items that [indiscernible] same-store NOI growth is 6.7%?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, so the biggest onetime items for the 6.7% NOI growth is, we have the Nashville Medical Office building, tenants took occupancy of that and it rolled into our same-store this quarter. So there is a bump up from a previously vacant building or some of occupied building.
John Thomas: That was 37,000 square feet of lease. But there was not on last year, that is now included this year.
Chad Vanacore: Okay. Got it, but typically we are expecting in somewhere in the 2% to 3% range.
Jeff Theiler: Yes, with some other occupancy gains elsewhere in the portfolio as well Chad.
Chad Vanacore: Okay.
John Thomas: So positive [Multiple Speakers].
Chad Vanacore: Alright. And then I was just thinking about your FFO, how did the timing of your equity in debt financing impacted FFO through the quarter?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. I mean, clearly, any time you are exactly, it’s going to be a little bit diluted pure FFO, as well as terming out to the debt on a 10-year basis. But we’re always look at our company and trying to build it on a fundamental basis, could be in a good position to execute on. So we felt that the ability to clear out of our line of credit completely, put a little bit of cash in the bank. As we look at our people. Right now through the rest of the year kind of set us up for the best possible value creation opportunity for our shareholders. So we took a little bit of FFO on dilution budgeting in those long-term capital moves.
Chad Vanacore: Alright. And then did you mentioned that the Foundation Healthcare were becoming a little clear. And you took right off last quarter and there was about two million uncollectable. Is it possible that gets reversed?
John Thomas: No. Chad, we’re working with the physicians to recover some of that. And we are also working with them both in San Antonio and El Paso about the building back form a – probably the resolution gets all weld into one solution there. But again right now our San Antonio is operating very well and El Paso is recapitalized and the business has improved. So we’re optimistic but we don’t know, we will see how it plays out.
Chad Vanacore: John, what is improving on day pacific volumes or is it collections?
John Thomas: So El Paso had of volume and collection and San Antonio had a collection problem, so both are getting resolve. Foundation Healthcare in an out of itself is no longer involved in the management of ether facilities and collections have gone up and improved in both.
Chad Vanacore: Alright. Well thanks for taking my questions. I’ll hop back in.
John Thomas: Okay. Thanks Chad.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathon Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Hey guys. Good afternoon. So in the press release mentioned CHI deal is performing better than expected and its touch on its earlier. But can you just talk about what is driving that outperformance relative to your underwriting and maybe quantify on a yield basis, how much is outperforming?
John Thomas: Yes. Jon, it’s leasing and leasing both vacant space and renewals better than expected and also better management of the expense controls and really high customer service that we’ve delivered to health system and their physicians. And we think on a 12 months basis, we look more like 6.4% to 6.5% versus our underwritten 6.42%.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. It’s helpful. Thanks. And then earlier you also mentioned G&A expectations for the year, but I saw a news article recently mentioning 10 to 20 employees being added to that headquarter this year. I assume that’s baked into your expectations?
John Thomas: Yes. That’s baked in.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And in terms of external growth, how much do you think you can acquire before headcount needs to be materially increased?
John Thomas: I mean, I think on a proportionate basis, we get a lot of scalability. And it’s not a significant headcount increase over our guidance for this year.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then last one, any markets concerning you from a new supply standpoint. And then also if you could just comment on recent articles mentioning mall space, shadow supply for medical office tenants? Thanks.
John Thomas: Yes. We don’t see any real competition from the model side that’s something that had been going on for three years, the [indiscernible] physicians groups and others, kind of we have them, but we don’t see that is a little competing supply with our hospitals and physician groups we basically own a couple of buildings that were the end of results of that kind of readapted use, but we know there is sustainable our trend if the fact and then that’s going to...
Jonathan Hughes: And then any mortgage from pure MOB?
John Thomas: Oh I'm sorry, yes from the department standpoint. No, I think the market is seeing a little bit uptake in the development like Minneapolis that’s - one of the biggest developments there with our partner Marc Davis and we think that’s the supply - health system us to anchor development that hopefully we have an opportunities to work with Mark in the future.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. That’s it for me. Thanks guys.
John Thomas: Thank you.
Jeff Theiler: Thanks, Doug.
John Thomas: I appreciate everyone for joining us on the call today. And thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Physicians Realty Trust fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. We are pleased to report a record-setting year for Physicians Realty Trust. We completed almost $1.3 billion in new investments in 2016 and our consistent fast growth in medical office facilities continues on into 2017. Our best-in-class operating platform delivered 2.6% same-store net operating income during the fourth quarter. We’re very pleased with our fourth quarter results. During the fourth quarter, we invested $227 million including expansions in our relationship with Scottsdale’s HonorHealth system, and United Surgical Partners. We’ve also invested over $100 million already in 2017 in very high quality medical office facilities including investments leased to credit rated health systems in Dallas, Texas; and Harper, Connecticut; and investments in suburban New York City through a sale leaseback with an outstanding, very large multispecialty physician group. We now own nearly 11 million square feet that is over 96% leased for an average lease term of approximately 8.5 years. We’re well on our way toward another strong year of growth. Mark Theine, our Senior Vice President of Asset Management will provide an update in a few minutes on our fantastic integration of the CHI medical facilities. We’re getting very positive feedback from our CHI hospitals, physician and other provider tenants on the service provided to them under Mark’s leadership. His efforts and our entire team’s attention to the operational excellence as well as new and renewal leasing is producing far better results than we anticipated this early in a relationship. We’re establishing a new high standard for medical office asset management as we help our clients as they meet the clinical needs of their patients. We are different, and we seek to earn the trust of our hospital and physician tenant clients and believe over the long-term that not only feels our growth but also our ability to earn outstanding same-store operating results. In our industry-leading occupancy of 96%, the fourth quarter represents the sixth straight quarter of positive net absorption of space available in our portfolio. 2017 brings us to a New Year with a new U.S. presidential administration and Congress focused on healthcare policy and tax policy. We are monitoring each closely. Our Chairman is former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, who is actively involved in health policy discussions. While we expect changes, at this time, we expect more change to occur in the Secretary’s power to make regulatory changes than a wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act. As details are being worked out, we see efforts to retain many of the benefits in the ACA that will help expand the insured population, including the funding for that expansion, with efforts to preserve Medicaid expansion and incent all states to participate in some level of Medicaid expansion by providing those states more flexibility in how they provide that coverage. Whatever happens, it continues to appear that any changes that might affect existing coverage available, will not go into effect for several years. We continue to believe that aging demographics and the strength of the U.S. employer-based insurance market will continue to drive strong demand for outpatient medical care delivered in outpatient medical office facilities like ours. The vast majority of our physicians’ hospitals continue to perform very well with high volumes. Unfortunately , we have shared today that one of our hospital management company clients experienced challenges beginning in the third quarter of 2016 which became much more acute in the fourth quarter. Foundation Healthcare, an organization that has a long history of success, beginning in 1996 and operating very strongly for almost 20 years, suffered unexpected operating losses in the second half of 2016 due primarily to lawsuits and management’s focus on a hospital investment in Houston, Texas. We had no involvement in that Houston asset. Unfortunately Foundation’s lawsuits and attention to that hospital impacted their ability to support their physician joint venture hospitals in El Paso and San Antonio, Texas that we own. To be specific, Foundation’s attention to cash collections declined significantly in the fourth quarter. We’ve been working with Foundation and most importantly, the physician co-owners of those hospitals in San Antonia and El Paso to transition management and eventually Foundation’s ownerships in each of those hospitals. The physician co-owners in San Antonia and El Paso continue to support the hospitals and ended 2016 and began 2017 with the strong volumes and revenues. We continue to believe, both can and will recover as both our open and operating as they have continuously for years and we expect to work through both situations positively moving forward. Nevertheless, with our commitment to transparency and appropriate accounting, we took the charges for the fourth quarter we announced today and putting the charges against the MOB foundation leases from us in Oklahoma City. We are pleased to report, we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of that facility, that MOB for $15.3 million, a $1.6 million gain on our current basis in that facility. While we can provide no assurance that that sale will be completed or that the there will be a successful transition of Foundation’s ownership interest in the El Paso and San Antonia surgical facilities, we are working hard with the local physicians to accomplish a satisfactory result in each location. Both El Paso and San Antonia have special legal status as grandfather physician owned surgical hospitals, which makes this particularly attractive to other hospital management companies as well physicians who seek to own such hospitals. We’re excited to share much more positive news. We’ve shared with you over our three-year history our own examples of healthcare consolidation that we believe benefit the medical office real estate investments we have made. More than 10 years ago, we invested in several facilities in Bloomington, Indiana, owned by and now leased to Premier Health, a leading large multi-specialty provider group located in that community. The group announced last week that they’ve agreed to join Indiana University Health, Moody’s Aa3 rated health system, more commonly known as IU Health. IU Health provides care through their own network of hospitals and outpatient facilities across the state of Indiana. Premier joined IU Health’s facility at Southern Indiana Physicians which includes 265 employee providers and 19 specialties including 11 primary care centers in the South Central region of Indiana. We’re very happy for Premier and the new partner with IU Health and look forward to working more closely with them, as IU Health assumes our leases as part of the transition with Premier. Mark will share more about discussions with CHI and Dignity, about an alignment for their respective organizations. With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jeff Theiler to discuss our financial results. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company generated funds from operations of $34.6 million or $0.25 per share. Our normalized funds from operations was $38.2 million, normalized funds from operations per share was $0.27 and our normalized funds available for distribution were $34.2 million or $0.24 per share. For the full year 2016, the Company generated normalized funds from operations of $128.5 million and normalized FFO per share of $0.98, which is roughly 7% over 2016. As John mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we reserved $3.7 million for uncollectable rent and prepaid expenses associated with four properties, whose tenants were affiliated with Foundation Healthcare, a company that is currently undergoing a restructuring. The fundamentals underlying these assets remain strong, and we’ve had substantial interest from healthcare companies that wish to partner with the physicians in the building. We also believe however that a compression in cap rates for these assets and the quality of these facilities in markets, particularly the surgical hospitals, makes it an opportune time to put them in a disposition program and recycle the capital into newer and more strategic buildings. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we closed on $227 million of investments at an average first year yield of 6.8%. Had we acquired all of these assets at the beginning of the fourth quarter, they would have contributed an additional $2.4 million of cash NOI. We’re seeing more acquisition opportunities than ever through both our existing healthcare system relationships as well as the more traditional marketed deals, and feel comfortable issuing full year 2017 acquisition guidance of $800 million to $1 billion, assuming stable capital market conditions. Turning to operations, our same-store portfolio, which represents 51% of our total portfolio, generated year-over-year NOI growth of 2.6%; primary drivers of this growth included a 20 basis-point increase in occupancy and contractual rent increases. We expect to be able to achieve 2% to 3% year-over-year same-store NOI growth on a long-term basis. So, this quarter is representative of that range. We had another quarter of net absorption of 23,750 feet on the leasing front, as our team continues to make excellent progress leasing the portfolio, now at 96.1% occupancy. We have a modest level of lease expirations in 2017, amounting to just under 4% of the annualized base rent of our overall portfolio. We’ve had a strong start for leasing in 2017. Leasing spreads so far have averaged 5.1%, and we expect total leasing spreads for 2017 to average around 2%. We continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt to total capitalization around 27% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.1 times. We issued $2.6 million through our ATM program in the fourth quarter of 2016 and have just over $297 million remaining on the ATM program. Our balance on the revolving line of credit at the end of the year was $401 million. And we expect to convert much of this balance to long-term fixed rate debt in 2017, as we have been doing ever since we achieved our investment grade rating. Finally, we continue to make significant progress on scaling down our G&A costs relative to the size of our portfolio. Our total G&A costs for 2017 were $18.4 million, which was below our previously stated guidance range of 19 to $21 million. With that, I’ll turn it over to Mark to provide a progress update on the CHI transaction. Mark?
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. As John mentioned, 2016 was a transformational year for DOC with $1.3 billion in real estate investments, including the Catholic Health Initiatives hospital monetization. We are honored to have been chosen by CHI to acquire 53 mission-critical medical office buildings leased primarily to CHI’s affiliated hospitals in 10 markets. This was not only the largest-ever hospital monetization of medical office buildings but also the first step in establishing a long-term partnership with CHI. In choosing a partner, the healthcare system was focused on selecting a long-term owner who understands healthcare operations, has first-class property management experience, values, relationships, and shares the same commitment to high-quality patient care. We are proud to be that partner to CHI. To-date, we have completed the acquisition of 49 of the properties in the CHI portfolio, representing 3 million square feet. We have two facilities located in Omaha, Nebraska and Fruitland, Idaho respectively yet to acquire in 2017, and we elected not to purchase two facilities during the due-diligence process. The Omaha, Nebraska facility is a newly constructed medical office building, 100% leased by CHI’s affiliate, Creighton University Medical Center. Upon completion of its construction in the first quarter of 2017, we anticipate purchasing the facility for $33.4 million. Later, in 2017, we anticipate closing the Fruitland, Idaho facility, which is 100% leased and under contract for $4.5 million. Our team has worked closely with CHI and its local hospital leadership teams in each markets over the last six months to complete the acquisition and exceed expectations in the transition of these facilities to our ownership. We are proud of our team’s unique ability and hard work to underwrite, close, and transition property management and leasing services for the portfolio in such a short amount of time. In the six months since the majority of our acquisitions were completed, we have outperformed our underwriting expectations and leasing projections, all while executing our business plans and expanding our asset management and leasing platform. On an annualized basis, the CHI portfolio has outperformed our initial underwriting of a 6.3% cap rate by 20 basis points and is yielding a 6.5% unleveraged first year return. These results are driven primarily by 30,000 square feet of new leasing, which has increased the portfolio’s occupancy from 94% at closing to 95% today. Additionally, through a number of early lease renewals, we have extended the average lease term remaining for the CHI portfolio from 8.37 years at the time of closing to 8.44 years today. We have strong leasing velocities to fill a significant portions of the 156,000 square feet available in 2017, primarily in the Houston, Texas and Louisville, Kentucky markets. In fact, in the last week, we signed a 26,000 square-foot lease with a large physician practice to relocate that group to our newly constructed 101,000 square foot Spring, Texas facility located near Exxon’s world headquarters and located in the large parts of the Houston MSA. The lease will commence on July 1, 2017 and is a prime example of our ability to structure unique, creative deals that add significant value to the hospital and the patients. Local hospital executives at CHI previously identified this very important physician group as an ideal component to complete the healthcare ecosystem in the building, but the group still had two years remaining on their existing location. As CHI’s real estate partner, we are able to facilitate and early buyout of the physician group’s existing lease in exchange for a long-term mutually beneficial lease commitment in our facilities. This lease arrangements would have been difficult for CHI or any other hospital to complete on its own without a specialized and nimble real estate partner. Looking ahead in 2017, we will continue to grow our integrated management leasing platform and are well-positioned to drive operational excellence and consistent same-store growth in our MOB portfolio. Our management structure is scalable and we’ll continue to benefit from concentration as we invest in top quality properties and portfolios in the future, ultimately producing outstanding total shareholder returns year in and year out. Finally, as reported last quarter, CHI is exploring discussions with Dignity Health to align their organizations. If the organizations were to merge, the joint organization would have $27.8 billion in combined annual revenue and would create the nation’s largest not-for-profit hospital company, ahead of Ascension with $20.5 billion in annual revenue. The geography of CHI and Dignity Health locations complement one another with no geographic overlap of acute care facilitates. While we remain close with the senior leadership at the CHI in Denver, we do not have any additional information to share at this time. Our relationship with CHI has only strengthened over the first six months of our partnership, producing far better results than we could have anticipated this early. And we look forward to continuing to demonstrate why we are the preferred partner for hospital monetization. With that, Rob, we’ll be happy to answer any questions at this time.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to follow up on the acquisition volume guidance. And just sort of given the context of one of your comments, Jeff, regarding more opportunities than ever, can you maybe give us a sense of where that’s coming from or where you guys think this transaction volume acceleration has stemmed from? Does it have anything to do with the sort of the CHI-Dignity discussions or is it -- or maybe just as a function of your success with the CHI portfolio? Any sense would be helpful.
John Thomas: I think it stems primarily from the success of that transaction, the CHI transaction. We’ve got a lot of trade bust, [ph] not only in the MOB investment world but in the hospital world as well. So, we’ve got a lot of inbound calls from health systems and that is evolving to continuing discussions. So, we’ll see how much -- if there’s more monetizations like that, to be clear nothing specifically related to the Dignity Health, CHI discussions. And as Mark said, we remain close to situation but we don’t know if that transaction, that merger is going to happen or not and really don’t have a time schedule from them on decisions there, so But, good volume and it’s reflected by both Hartford Medical and large physician sale leaseback and just out of sight of New York City and we just see a lot of great opportunities at very attractive high-quality real estate and really expect, absent any major capital market changes that we’ll be able to get that acquisition volume again this year.
Jordan Sadler: And then, as it relates to this year-to-date activity that you guys discussed, it does look like the overall size and quality have crept up the cap rate; ERGO [ph] has crept down, looks like an average of a six cap on 100 million plus you’ve done to-date. Is that sort of more along the lines of what we should be anticipating for the 2017 pipe?
John Thomas: Yes. You could continue to expect us moving up the quality scale. Again, we’ve been very proud of all of our investments to-date over the last three and half years. But, as our cost of capital has improved and our name and frankly reputation amongst hospital systems and physician groups has continued to spread, we’re just seeing more and more attractive opportunities of bigger, newer, -- bigger markets health systems, affiliated opportunities.
Jordan Sadler: Is there a cap rate range that we should be expecting, is it like in the 6 to 7?
John Thomas: Yes. I think 6 to 7 is probably about right. Last year, we were about 6.6? Yes, little higher than 6.6, heavily influenced by the CHI investment, as Mark pointed out. That was a 6.2 on in place and we’ve already moved that up to 6.5 with Mark’s leadership in both leasing and expense management in that portfolio also. But 6 to 7 is what we’d expect to see this year. The tenure has spiked a little bit from last year; it’s kind of still a lot of capital, chasing the assets, a lot of foreign capital coming on through those [ph] platforms to chase the asset So, again, the best healthcare and real estate is medical office and people recognize that.
Jordan Sadler: And then just one clarification on Foundation, can you break out the 3.7 for us? What does that represent entirely? You gave a little bit of insight in the release in terms of which buildings it comes from, but how many months rent versus prepaid expenses versus deferred rent, how does this break out?
John Thomas: It’s 1.1 with respect to the Oklahoma City asset, which we also entered into the purchase agreement to sell that is rent and property taxes. And again, Foundation has potentially withdrawn from that facility. They’re subtenants in the building and that’s where [ph] we’re working with [indiscernible] members of that group. The…
Jeff Theiler: So, Jordan, just to kind of roughly break it out, just under 2 million of that is rent that was not collected, we determined to be not collectable, and that represents the majority of the fourth quarter of four of these buildings. Once they had some property tax expenses that we had paid and had accrued a reimbursement for that we didn’t get -- that was call it 0.5 million, actually a little bit more, 600,000, and then there’s some revenue that we didn’t record in December as we realized that this would uncollectable, and that’s the balance of it.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just hoping you could talk briefly, Jeff, about balance sheet plans. I think you referenced a debt issuance to term out the revolver at some point this year, kind of what the options you’re looking at from timing and as well as any views on equity at this point?
Jeff Theiler: Sure. Hi, Juan. So, yes, when we ended 2016 with just over $400 million on a revolving line of credit, we’ve -- since we got our investment grade rating and started terming out debt with -- in the private market with AIG [ph] at the beginning of last year, that’s really been the strategy to try to -- to fix our debt as quickly as possible into long-term fixed rate bonds. Beginning of last year, the private market was far more attractive than the public market in terms of bond opportunity. I would say this year that it’s much closer. And so, I think we’d evaluate the public market very, very carefully as we think about terming out debt. I think for inaugural issuers, it’s actually a really, really good time right now. So, I would expect to see something hopefully early in 2017 on the public bond side.
Juan Sanabria: And any thoughts on equity at this point, how comfortable are you with kind of the current leverage and show we expect secondaries or these ATMs?
Jeff Theiler: We communicated our target leverage level to be about 30 to 40% debt to assets; we’re probably 33% debt to gross assets right now. So, certainly well within our target leverage range. Certainly, we always look at equity as we put out $800 million to $1 billion pipeline, it’d be hard to acquire all of that without any equity. So that’s something that we always look at and we could always to -- the ATM program, we have plenty of capacity on that or the secondary offering market at some point. But it’s something we’ll evaluate, although we’re under no pressure to do anything in the near term.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then second question from me just on Catholic Health, some of their numbers haven’t been -- at least the headline numbers as robust as I guess we would have expected but any sense of how their kind of turnaround, now there’s some management changes there, how that’s progressing and expectations or an update and expectations for rent coverage levels from CHI?
John Thomas: Yes. Juan, it’s JT. They’ve had some good success. I think the COO retired and they brought in another gentleman who’s -- his primary focus is on the strategic operational plan. And they communicate pretty frequently with the bond market about progress there. So, continue to have book lawsuits [ph] across system wide but the revenues continue to be strong and growing. Kentucky just -- Juan that large dollar’s reflective of their management -- clear management of risk just got a net positive payment from the ACO that they participate in the Louisville and Lexington markets. So, lots of things going and there is still lots of opportunity for improvement. I think we’ve talked about it before, but just on the supply chain in particular, just a very modest improvement in their supply chain as a percentage of revenue, more than covers in the aggregate our annual rents, I mean very modest chain. So, we see a continued very positive improvement, and no concerns -- or see any concerns in drops [ph] in rent coverage to pay a rent [ph] to the local market.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. John, with regards to Foundation, did you indicate how well the three assets in San Antonio and El Paso are currently performing?
John Thomas: They all had -- they all finished the year well. San Antonio had a really blowout month in December. And it actually had pretty strong revenue last here between its issue or actually our issues related to lease payments there have not been revenue or volumes, it’s been on the cash collections, which is function of the management that the Foundation didn’t provide. El Paso was performing well throughout the first half of 2016; they lost some profitable ancillary business at the beginning of the third quarter and then lost a physician participant that set them back. So, El Paso is a little bit more of a revenue and exacerbated by the cash collection’s issue. San Antonio is performing very well. And El Paso, we continue to believe is performing strong right now. I’m actively engaged with the physician leadership there, week-by-week, day-by-day basis and continue to see a lot of positive movement there. So, just working those through transition, both management and the Foundation’s ownership interest, but we continue to see right things and right opportunities there for them.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then is the preferred path to sell those assets? And if so, can you give us some color on who are the potential buyers of those types of properties?
John Thomas: Yes. We have the purchase and sale agreement with the Oklahoma City facility. We’ve been approached by both physicians and institutional investors in both San Antonio and El Paso for those real estate assets. And so, as we work through this, again, this is -- these are both fine hospitals, physical plants, both in good markets, they’re both in attractive markets, so lot of players. So, really help facilitate in working with physicians that help facilitate a smooth transition and then the positive outcome for everybody. We just thought it was time to move these to a disposition status and expect to work through a sale in an orderly fashion on both assets. It could be one buyer or my expectation is two different buyers. And again, the physicians may be involved in or more situations.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then, sorry, if I missed this. But, did you guys mention about the LTAC portfolio and what’s the driver there that pushed those coverage ratios lower?
John Thomas: Yes. So, the LTAC has been going through patient criteria conversions in the Medicare rules. That’s something that we knew about when we bought these assets, work for the management team to evaluate what the impact is going to be there. So, they may get changes or evolve to comply with those rules and kind of manage their business to outside of the patient criteria where they can drive additional revenues. Plano, for example, set a very successful wound care business. It’s really ancillary, it’s complementary to their existing service line and the physicians that refer patients to them. Unfortunately, they’re trying to move that same ancillary service into Fort Worth facility, and that has taken longer than expected. So, the drop in our coverage is all attributable to Fort Worth. It’s still doing fine, it’s still a good facility and good location. But obviously we’d like to see in the aggregate, and that’s a master lease, those three facilities, Pittsburgh, Fort Worth and Plano, it’s all under one master lease. And we’d like to see the Fort Worth coverage improved and we expect it will. And then Foundations continues to -- excuse me, LifeCare continues to focus on other ancillary opportunities in Pittsburgh. They’ve expanded some of the service lines, again complementary to those long-term future business in that facility. And hopefully, we’ll start seeing the benefit of that in the near-term. This year, don’t expect any issues. We think the management team is very focused on improving and increasing EBITDA. They clearly had an impact on EBITDAR and EBITDA across the organization, as well as the patient criteria with revolving through it in a good way.
Michael Carroll: And then just lastly, I guess or two quick ones, do you expect the 1.7 is the low point in the coverage ratios and what’s the average rental rate bump on those leases?
John Thomas: Those have CPI increaser and also a kicker and in extraordinary revenue year, we haven’t been able to get -- or got opportunities to get the kicker but they increased at a floor of 2.25%, CPI [ph] has not moved more than that. So, I think we have a ceiling of 3.75.
Mark Theine: That’s right.
John Thomas: Correct Mark? So, 2.25% in those. Mike, we wouldn’t expect coverages to drop there. Plano does extremely well, as I mentioned. And again on a master lease perspective, the coverages continue to be strong but on a facility-by-facility basis, we monitor closely. We don’t expect it but we can’t say that that’s a problem.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jonathon Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Just touching on Foundations more, you mentioned collections deteriorated pretty rapidly with those assets. Was there a deterioration in admissions as well? And are you seeing any similar trends in any of your assets? And if so, have you taken steps to prevent this going forward, like rent relief?
John Thomas: So, San Antonio, the volumes have been very strong, the payer mix has been very strong. One of the good and bad things, I’d say, our mix in San Antonio is that a lot of -- in the industry called PI work, personal injury work, which is accident victims who come in and ultimately look into an insurance company, not an health insurance company but insurance company that is involved in settling claims related to that injury. And those usually collected a very-high percentage of net revenues; they’re very profitable. The downside is a longer time -- take longer to collect those receivables. So, San Antonio is investing part of their issue but they ended the year and have a strong year from a volume perspective in any event. Again, El Paso had a drop-off in volume, really beginning mid third quarter and exacerbated by the kind of fourth quarter and lack of management attention from the Foundation level. But in the volumes, ended the year and so far this year looks strong both in locations.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, thanks for that. Is this year’s asset sale pace something we might expect to see for the years ahead, as you maybe prune the portfolio or is this just a one-off year?
John Thomas: I think, this is the beginning of a long-term practice that we would continue to prune the bottom, some bottom percentage or be opportunistic. And frankly we think, focus the case with the assets that we put in the business and bucket so far this year. And Mark Theine -- four of the assets are -- that we announced today, moving into that, four of our legacy assets that we [indiscernible] And there are some really good leases and good tenants in those buildings but they’re -- it’s time for kind of start pruning some of those assets out, smaller and older -- smaller communities. And Mark Theine has done a nice job, not only with the leasing and continued leasing and management of those facilities but actually working through the process to -- where the buyers have approached us about those, and move forward very positively. So, I think this is a beginning in the trend you’ll see. But for this year, I wouldn’t project to be more than a 100 million but that could change.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then, sorry, if I missed this, but could you remind us of the amount of MOBs that CHI owns that would fit your investment criteria?
John Thomas: Well, they own several hundred more, I wouldn’t say -- they range from brand new to old small little buildings in rural markets. So, it’s a very large opportunity, additional opportunities there, but we don’t know we’d have a catalogue of buildings [ph] Jonathan. But I’d say, there’s lots of opportunities for Class A assets that are anchored by or leased 100% by CHI.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, thanks. And then, I’ll just -- one more and I’ll jump off. Touching on the question earlier about debt issuances, has the upcoming change to the Barclays index were only issuances of 300 million or more will be included, change your assumptions on that front and could you give us some color on pricing you think you could achieve on expected debt issuances?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Jonathan, it’s Jeff. You’re exactly right. I mean, I think what that change to the index eligibility criteria does is it bumps up the minimum amount of debt that you’re going to issue -- that you don’t want to issue to get a great execution. So that used to be a minimum 250, now it’s a minimum of 300. So, I think as we look at the public markets, we’re always kind of looking at it with that minimum in mind. In terms of pricing, it’s I think right now in the public markets, probably anywhere just above mid 4.4, 4.5 to 4.75, somewhere in that range I think would probably be a reasonable pricing assumption. 
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then, what about like if you did private notes and you opted not to go the public route?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. So, if you did private notes, I think the volume is lower, the amount you can issue is probably lower, unless you get a lot of interest in the private market. I think you’re probably capping out closer to 200 there on a deal. And the pricing is probably pretty similar right now, it might be a little bit inside of that, but it’s not as much as it used to be at the beginning of last year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thanks. Good morning. John, I was interested in your comments that any changes to the ACA and impact on existing coverage will not occur for several years. Is that a consensus to be among your tenants and partners?
John Thomas: Yes, I think so. And I think the hospital industry’s really rallied around a focus on Medicaid expansion what has occurred and the desire in those states where it didn’t expand, so some kind of expand. So, I think that’s where the hospital provider were always focusing their attention. But as I mentioned with Tommy’s engagement, we have other Board members close to Capitol Hill as well. We stay pretty engaged in real time discussions that are there. So, there is only so much you can -- or just stepping back, I mean, there is only so much you can do to the reconciliation process. So, the idea of just completely wiping out the Affordable Care Act and completely replacing it in part or all or even repairing and if some would like to say, it’s very difficult through the reconciliation process. So, absent some getting nine or I guess eight democrats and a few Republicans who’d be resistant to major change without significant alternatives to keep the ensured, to keep the benefits of what’s current of the ACA but also address the deficiencies. So, as I mentioned, Secretary has a lot of power under the law, but that’s tweaking things with the regulatory process. So, SCHIP is up for renewal this year, so that’s something that bipartisan [ph] way is vehicle for potentially some bipartisan changes. But, it’s not as easy as it sounds by its [indiscernible]. I think the hospital industry is focused on Medicaid expansion. We have analyzed our portfolio, it’s ironically right at 50%, is in the states that expanded and the 50% of the states that didn’t expand. And we didn’t use that as an underwriting or targeting of analysis, just a way to forecast. Kentucky being probably the most important where they did expand and Texas been maybe most important where they did not -- Texas did not expand.
John Kim: Okay. And then, can you comment on competition, as you look through for acquisitions? It seems like it’s been a renewed focus as far as growing MOB portfolios for the big three healthcare REITs. But, I’m wondering if you could also just comment on whether you’re seeing more of those companies or other capital sources, as you look through acquisition?
John Thomas: Yes. I’d say, in many respects, our unique approach and somebody -- one of our let’s call it proprietary approach is we don’t see a lot of competition and lot of our transactions because it’s mostly one-off direct negotiations with physicians and hospitals and developers. But, generally, in the market, private equity backed is probably by volume is the biggest buyer out there other than us. Amongst the big three, I think probably two of the three, their assets declined in 2016, want to probably get a renewed focus on MOB, bumping into them a little bit more. But, I think the big competition is right now as private equity backed. We did the largest transaction directly with the hospital system, but it was a very large transaction that was a new player into the market and [indiscernible].
John Kim: What about like pension funds and foreign capital or maybe some new entrants into market?
John Thomas: Yes, a lot of interest by both. And again, they’re primarily trying to do JV and come in through one of the operating platforms that today winds up with other private equity firms. We have friendly conversations with players like that all the time but you have pieces fully loaded for capital, so we haven’t seen the advantage to do any JV today.
John Kim: Jeff, you mentioned the G&A came in for the year $2 million for your guidance, but have you provided guidance on this for 2017?
Jeff Theiler: I think, John, for 2017 as we look at it, we’ll continue to scale down G&A as a percent of assets. It will probably be somewhere in the $21 million to $23 million on a full year basis, which I think equates fairly well with the other MOB peers in the space.
John Kim: So, that’s an increase, but you’re just saying that as far as cost initiative that there’s still some ongoing components of it?
Jeff Theiler: No, I mean, it’s an increase. As we build our portfolio, clearly, if you’re growing a $1 billion a year, there’s a lot of build outs you need to do to support that acquisition pace and to make sure you’re integrating the properties well, you’re accounting for them well, you’re taking care of the tenants. So, there’s always a fair amount of infrastructure build with every new acquisitions, particularly if you are increasing acquisitions on a multi-tenant side as opposed to a single lease side where there’s just a lot more work to do for each.
John Kim: And then, one last one, four of the six assets held for sell out with Foundation Healthcare, and I just wanted to clarify does that eliminate your exposure to Foundation, if you sell these assets?
John Thomas: If we sell all of those, we have no other exposure to Foundation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.
Chad Vanacore: So, just thinking about going back to the operational issues at Foundation, is this related to out of network billings, or is this an issue with third party contractors collections or anything else, what would you say?
John Thomas: Yes. So, again, different payer mix at each location. San Antonio, you can call the PI work out of network but that’s really not kind of the strategy there; it’s just doing the payers, the different type of insurance companies. El Paso, fairly traditional payer mix; they have -- both of these are contracted leases; [ph] it’s not a -- neither one is relying on out of network strategy where it’s difficult to collect period. And then Foundation provided centralized billing offices to each of their affiliates and without CDO, [ph] so Foundation internally didn’t collect the revenues fast and additionally the share; that’s improving but it’s also transitioning to a third-party…
Chad Vanacore: And then, just thinking about the rent collections, right now, you won’t be booking any revenues from these properties or can we expect more write-offs down the line?
John Thomas: At this point, we recognize the fourth quarter, we’re still working through both situations and in San Antonio -- there is two different situations. San Antonio has a lot of revenue to collect; El Pas has less. But, we’re hopeful that this is a one-time event but we can’t make any assurance of that. But that’s where we are focused on right now, the transition. And again, if they get collected, the revenue gets already been generated, then this should get back on track and move in a positive way.
Chad Vanacore: And then just the thoughts on, your thoughts on additional dispositions that aren’t related to Foundation, what are you thinking as far as the facilities that you teed up for sale?
John Thomas: Chad, I’m sorry, I couldn’t quite understand your question.
Chad Vanacore: Okay. I am saying what was the thought process behind the dispositions? When you’re looking to prune your portfolio, what are you taking into account?
John Thomas: Yes, some traditional factors. I mean, the four legacy assets have a nice tenant base, one of them got out of Northside [ph] lease for over 10 years. It’s one of the kind of the best core assets we had as part of the IPO but it’s also kind of a one-off in far north suburban Atlanta. So, again, does it make sense in our continuing for synergies and asset management going forward, these are all older buildings. So, again we’re kind of prune and move the average age of those buildings down. So, those are natural criteria. Again, the whole -- I should say easier but more interesting and maximize the value for selling buildings with still good lease term and get tenants in them and all of those meet that criteria and frankly just represent a good price. But that’ll be -- we’ll apply screen across the entire portfolio and look for opportunities where we’ve got one-off assets and don’t see any opportunity to grow, either in that market or with that client and also average age and size will weigh into those decisions.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Craig Kucera with Wunderlich. Please go ahead with your questions.
Craig Kucera: Hey. Good morning, guys. You had a pretty solid retention rate this quarter, and I appreciate the color on the lease spreads you’ve achieved and what you’re expecting to see. But, how are your discussions going with the 4% or so rolling over next year and kind of what do you think -- what kind of retention rate you think you’ll have?
Mark Theine: Yes. Thanks, Craig; this is Mark. In 2017, as Jeff mentioned, roughly 4% of the portfolio scheduled to renew; it’s about 116 leases in total. We feel very positive as we sit here today about the retention of those tenants. We don’t know of any at this point that are not planning to renew but our traditional retention rate has been around that 80% mark, and we’ll continue to try and achieve that goal in 2017.
Craig Kucera: Okay. Going to the dispositions again, I know you’d mentioned that you thought this was a good time to sell because cap rates are compressed. What kind of cap rates you think you will achieve on the assets that you’re selling?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Hey, Craig; it’s Jeff. So, I think the way we modeled it out is we’ve got two purchase and sell agreements that are already in place. So, as we look at that 100 million to a 125 million kind of valuation range, we include those numbers, the 18.3 million on the Georgia portfolio and the 15.3 million on the Oklahoma City portfolio. And for the remainder of the assets, we kind of look at a cap rate range that goes up to low in the low 70% cap rate on a average. So, that’s you know kind of the high end of that range, the low 7% gap rate. So, we feel pretty good about being able to sell the assets somewhere within that range. And just for clarity, the bottom end of range is essentially what we paid for the assets, not the net book value, but the actual purchase that we’ve had.
Craig Kucera: Got it. And one more for me and I’ll jump back in queue. I just would be curious as to your thoughts on where you’ve seen cap rates move since the election and the move in the tenure?
John Thomas: I’d just say, with move in the tenure, there is so much capital on the other side of the supply side and capital investing in medical office to keep cap rates, I’d say fairly stable but also best in class assets are going to correct below 6, and top markets, the top health systems in the mid 5. So, we’re seeing lots of opportunity in the 6 plus range and that’s where we like to be. But, like Hartford and with other assets, I’ve noted, very attractive long-term opportunities, really assets like that improved the quality of our portfolio and over time we will continue to move all the portfolio a bit more like that. So, 6 to 7 for us, may crack that at appropriate time, and for capital [indiscernible] and we’ll see some -- expect to see some mid-5. Last year, the NorthStar -- Starwood portfolio traded at a something like a 5, 6 separate. So, there are buyers out there that are moving valuations in that range -- to that range.
Operator: The next question is come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple from me. First of all, I was trying to reconcile your $0.27 number versus $0.30 consensus for fourth quarter. And it seems like the biggest -- the big jump in operating expenses. I may have missed any comments that you made earlier on, on that. But could you just talk about the increase in OpEx and how would you think about OpEx in 2017?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Hi, Tayo; it’s Jeff. You’re right. I mean, the big jump was the OpEx in the fourth quarter, and that was $0.025 per share, that was related that the Foundations reserves that we took on rent that we considered uncollectable and prepaid expenses that we considered uncollectable. We always hope to get some of that back but that was the difference in the fourth quarter.
Tayo Okusanya: So, the charge you actually made it to the OpEx line?
Jeff Theiler: We made it to the OpEx line and we -- and it rolled through into normalized FFO; we did not exclude it.
Tayo Okusanya: Excellent. Okay. That’s helpful. And then, number two, 2017, you talked about cap rates and transactions between 6% to 7%, I think when Jordan asked. But, just kind of given your movement towards higher quality assets, should we be thinking cap rates are closer towards 6 like your January deals or could you just kind of give us more of a kind of a tighter range what we should be modeling in 2017? That would be helpful. And also what cap rates are expecting on the 100 to $125 million of dispositions?
John Thomas: Yes. So, on the -- Tayo, I think it’s a fair question. I think if we focus more on more on the higher quality, it’s going to be more in the 6% to 6.5% range than the higher in the range. But we still see lots of great opportunities in the higher in range that still meet very high quality standards for us. So, maybe 6.25 to 6.5 if you’re modeling but again, I think in the end, we’ll be blending out at 6.5 on just our day-to-day core business.
Jeff Theiler: On the dispositions if you model between 7 and 8, you’ll probably be 3 plus. [Ph]
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks everybody for joining today, the great questions, and we appreciate it. And I would like to recognize our Founder, John Sweet who started this Company many years ago as a private fund, working with Theine, retired at the end of the year and really left. He hasn’t left us completely but left and help build a great organization that we take forward and look to make it even greater. So, we just want recognize John Sweet and his retirement and look forward to continue to work with him when we have the opportunity. And in that connection, as part of our succession planning for John, Deeni Taylor has been promoted to Chief Investment Officer and Deeni was -- and John both, were huge parts of our success last year in our growth. And I just want to recognize Deeni and their promotion. And then, lastly we are thrilled as we announced earlier to supplement John Sweet’s opportunities with many elections around the country, we are excited to have Dan Klein as the Deputy Chief Investment Officer working closely with Deeni and myself. So, just want to recognize that. We look forward to seeing you soon and working hard during this quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-11-02 12:00:00) =====

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Page, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Thank you sir. You may begin.
Brad Page: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust third quarter 2016 earnings release conference call and webcast. With me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer; Deeni Taylor, Executive Vice President of Investments; John Lucey, Chief Accounting Officer; and Mark Theine, Senior Vice President of Asset and Investment Management.  During this call, John Thomas will provide a company update and overview of recent transactions and our strategic focus. Then Jeff Theiler will review the financial results for the third quarter of 2016 and our thoughts for the remainder of 2016. Following that, we will open the call for questions. Today’s call will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They are based on the current beliefs of management and information currently available to us. Our actual results will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict.

Our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations and those anticipated or implied in such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of some potential risks, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s CEO, John Thomas.
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the Physicians Realty Trust third quarter earnings call.  We are pleased to be able to report to you another strong quarter of operations. While we intentionally slowed down new business development during this quarter as we focused on the integration of the Catholic Health Initiatives or CHI portfolio, we still recorded $177 million of new investments, $137.5 million of which was unrelated to CHI.  We’ve also completed $30 million of new investments already in the fourth quarter none of which are affiliated with CHI and added important new hospital system relationships in northern Michigan. We now own more than 10 million square feet of high quality medical office space, that is almost 96% leased for an average lease term of almost nine years. Our team’s attention to detail and focus on tenant satisfaction has produced a remarkable integration of the CHI medical office facilities and early feedback from physician tenants and the CHI hospitals has been very positive. These efforts and our executive attention to operational excellence as well as new and renewal leasing is producing far better results than we could have anticipated this early in the relationship.  We are determined to set a new high standard for medical office asset management which starts with sourcing, underwriting, investing and then managing the best medical office portfolio in the United States. We believe that this will produce outstanding total shareholder returns year in and year out. Year to date we have acquired $1.1 billion in high quality medical office facilities and increased our percentage of assets that are on campus or affiliated with hospital system to 79% from 74% at the beginning of the year. As we look at the balance of 2016, we anticipate closing on one additional CHI facility during the fourth quarter. After this closing the final building to be acquired in the CHI portfolio is a new medical office building in Omaha, Nebraska which will close upon completion of construction in early 2017. The expected investment will be $33.4 million and will be a 100% leased to CHI’s Creighton University Medical Center upon closing.  We also have a strong pipeline of anticipated closings still to complete as well as a nice start to building 2017 pipeline. 2016 has been transformational year for Physicians Realty Trust and we're not done. We've crossed several milestones, including two separate long term unsecured investment grade debt private placements, crossing 10 million rentable square feet of medical office space, completing the largest direct monetization of medical office facilities in U.S. history and rounding out our senior management team with particular attention to asset management and leasing. These accomplishments have further strengthened our foundation of operational excellence.  As long as the capital markets remain open, DOC shares present the opportunity to own a high growth organization that can source, underwrite and acquire the best medical office and outpatient care facilities across the United States, while still being able to focus most importantly on delivering outstanding results from the assets we already own. We take pride in our relationships and ability to generate repeat business from our clients who trust us with their facilities, trust us with their physicians and work hand in hand with us to serve their patients. We believe that philosophy and delivering on those promises will serve us and you well as we achieve outsized growth and outsized long term financial results. We're sure many of you’ve seen the news that CHI is exploring discussions with Dignity Health to align their organizations. Dignity Health, formerly known as Catholic Healthcare West is a Catholic faith based health care system based in San Francisco which is a major inpatient presence in California, Arizona and Nevada with services in over 22 states. CHI operates in 19 states. The synergy and complementary strengths of each organization appear compelling while there is no geographic overlap at their hospital system acute care facilities.  We have relationships with and a great deal of respect for Dignity Health with our most important relationship being with IMS, the multi-specialty physician group partially owned by Dignity in the Phoenix, Arizona market, where we own over 400,000 square feet of medical office space, we bought from the IMS positions and anchored by Dignity Health IMS positions on long term leases.  At this time and after discussions with CHI senior leadership we do not have any additional information to share but also remain confident in the future of our CHI relationship, the value of our CHI medical officer facilities and potentially an increased opportunity to grow with CHI and Dignity combined entity.  We recently had a stewardship meeting with CHI’s C-suite and are more excited than ever about the opportunity to partner with them, their operational plans, their focus on expenses and supply chain management and strategic plan. There remains an enormous amount of opportunities for them to strengthen and further their mission and for us to continue to grow our relationship over time. Yesterday, CMS issued hospital outpatient roles specifically addressing Section 603. As expected, even HOPD moves out of their grandfathered off-campus location to another off-campus address, they will lose their grandfathered higher HOPD rates absent rare extraordinary circumstances, like a destruction of the building or a seismic event. Losing a lease is not an event like that. The rule also allows hospitals that acquire other hospitals to retain their grandfather status -- grandfather 603 assets. All as expected and all very positive for a nice portion of our assets.  Finally, next week our country will have the privilege and duty to elect the next leader of the free world. Whomever is elected will inherit the US healthcare economy that is growing faster than any other part of the economy, fueled by an aging population and technological leadership and the advancement of care across all disease conditions. While many have struggled recently, the need for access to care and the pressure to lower costs from consumers, payers and the government alike will only continue to push care out of the hospital and to lower costs to help patient settings that offer higher quality, more convenience and increased access. It's estimated that the U.S. health care economy will grow from approximately $3 trillion this year to over $5 trillion in 2014, an average annual increase of about 7%. This growth will fuel growth in outpatient care and the demand for outpacing care medical office space. We are well positioned with our hospital physician relationships and partners to capture this demand for the benefit of our shareholders.  With that, I will now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. 
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. In the third quarter of 2016 the company generated funds from operations of $33.5 million or $0.24 per share. Our normalized funds from operations was $37 million. Normalized funds from operations per share was $0.27 and our normalized funds available for distribution were $32.9 million or $0.24 per share. In this quarter we closed on $177 million of investments at an average cap rate of 6.8%. Had we acquired all of these assets at the beginning of the quarter they would have contributed an additional $1.9 million of cash NOI.  With the closings of Spring Ridge MOB, Gig Harbor Medical Pavilion and Midlands One Professional Center this quarter we now have just two properties remaining to close in the CHI portfolio. We are pleased with the volume and quality of investment opportunities our team continues to source and as a result we are comfortable raising and tightening our previous acquisition guidance of $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion for the full year 2016 to a revised guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of investments for 2016.  On the operations side, our same-store portfolio which includes every asset that we have owned for a full 15 months period generated year over year NOI growth of 1% with no change in occupancy. Our same-store portfolio currently encompasses 48% of our total portfolio and NOI growth can be volatile from quarter to quarter. We expect to be able to achieve 2% to 3% year over year same store NOI growth on average. So our third quarter result is below our target range.  There were two primary factors that influenced this result. The first was an operational issue relating to the continuing impact of the early 2016 move-outs we saw at our Peachtree Dunwoody building in Atlanta, which reduced our same store NOI growth by 60 basis points this quarter. The good news is that of the 18,000 feet of leases that expire this year at Peachtree Dunwoody, about 12,500 feet has already been re-leased at significantly higher rates. Tenants take occupancy in this space at the end of the year. So we should see the positive impacts from that starting in the first quarter of 2017. The second factor impacting our same store NOI growth specifically this quarter was a one-time accounting related adjustment. We booked a property tax credit for our Columbus Georgia asset in the third quarter of 2015 which led to a $0.2 million increase in property expense for the comparable period this year, resulting in an 80 basis points negative impact to our same store NOI. Turning to financing. In August we drew the seven year $250 million term loan from our $1.1 billion credit facility, which based interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 180 basis points. We entered into a swap arrangement with our banks to fix our annual payments at a rate of 2.87% for seven years. We also issued a $75 million private debt placement that was split into three equal tranches that were 9, 10 and 11 years. The weighted average interest rate on this financing was 4.17%.  From an overall balance sheet perspective we ended the quarter in excellent shape with debt to total capitalization around 20% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.3 times. We also implemented a $300 million ATM program in August which provides additional flexibility for us with respect to issuing equity. The program replaced our previous $150 million ATM program that we terminated earlier this year. We have not issued any shares through our new ATM program.  Finally our G&A for the quarter was $4.9 million bringing the nine month total to just under $14 million. We remain on track with our previously announced G&A guidance of $19 million to $21 million for the year.  With that, I will turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Camille Tan : Hello, this is Camille with Juan. Rule 603 was finalized yesterday. What are the implications for the real estate landlords?
John Thomas: The 603 final reg, is that about [ph] Camille?
Camille Tan : Yes, I was just wondering whether the implications for real estate landlords. 
John Thomas: Yes, so the great news is as expected. This is the final reg which provided some additional detail and clarity to the proposed reg which for an off-campus medical office facility that is leased by a hospital and the hospital uses that space for a hospital outpatient department that was in existence and they were billing as an house allowed patient department [ph] in their space as of November 2, 2016. And that hospital can continue to bill at higher reimbursement rates under the old Medicare regime for possible out-patient departments are off campus, bringing new facilities going forward, they can't built at that higher rate, in fact in some cases it’s substantially lower, if they open up at a new hospital outpatient apartment off the campus with the hospital. So the really big deal and what finalized the reg yesterday which is -- those grandfathered locations and we own about we think 53 of our medical office buildings, are what are called grandfather 603 assets. What the final ruling said yesterday is if the hospital moves out of that building in the future, in other words, they don't renew their lease, unless they move back to the hospital campus they will lose that higher reimbursement rate.  So for us as landlord obviously we’re always working with our hospital partners and expect them to stay in our buildings forever. But this led to an extraordinarily sticky building with the landlord in an important development. And again if they move out of their location because they don't like the lease, they don't like the rent, they don’t like us, they'll lose those benefits. So again we expect to retain those hospitals regardless but very positive development and the final rule again solidifies the importance of that grandfather status to us.
Camille Tan : And can you give us an update on cap rate expectations heading into 2017 and whether your quarterly acquisition pace what is it likely going to be going forward?
John Thomas: So cap rates have continued to stay for kind of the best in class assets, and general top markets has stayed around 6% for best in class assets, and we're still finding a lot of nice opportunity between 6% and 7% in some of the Boston market or California markets you might go below 6%. We haven't seen much change in that really this year and in the near term don’t have a real expectation of the change in that range. As far as kind of our pace of growth next year, again very much capital markets dependent. We will issue guidance on acquisition guidance in February in our next earnings call. But generally we expect to be able to source, underwrite and close $200 million, $250 million a quarter. But again much of that for the future right now as a relative is the capital markets are open and we can source and acquire that that kind of volume.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of the Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Landon Park : Hey guys, this is Landon on for Vikram. Just wanted to start out, .I was wondering if you could take us through any of your exposure to CYH, I know they are listed as a tenant but I'm not sure how big and any sort of interesting trends you're seeing at any of your other hospital partners either positive or negative?
Jeff Theiler: Thanks. Great question, we have one building that’s leased a CYH hospital down in the villages in Florida. In fact, it’s an outstanding newer medical office building. They actually paid rent early and have been pretty routinely early into that facility so we have a very positive relationship with CYH but generally it’s not a very large exposure financially.  Now they really are final organization, a great relationships there. They have great hospitals that perform very well, they've had tough time last year -- in the last year but several of our hospitals. So again like any large national system they've got some hugely successful hospitals and some that are not performing as well. So this is -- actual size of that building is 28,000 square feet, so we get 10.5 million square feet today, less than one percent – actually less than even half a percent of the portfolio. Okay, again but it performs well, it’s on those great Florida locations, or the parking lot is striped and for golf carts versus cars. 
Landon Park : And then I'm just looking at maybe same store NOI growth this quarter was sort of low single digits right around 1% How should we think about that going forward now that portfolio is obviously a lot bigger and maybe more stabilized? And I guess on that same note in terms of renewals what kind of overall releasing spreads are you seeing in the portfolio around?
Jeff Theiler: I'll start with the same store and I will turn over to Mark for the releasing spreads. But certainly on the same store we target to 3%, we talked about that a lot. It came in underneath that that level this quarter and so we really we want to make sure we understand why part of it. We talked about the last two quarters which is the Peachtree Dunwoody move-outs. I mean that problem is solving itself -- I think it's resolving itself very well actually and one of the advantages of having that that great building is that you have a lot of tenant demand for that space. That was a temporary blip but it takes a little bit of time to lease that space up. By the beginning next year we should be in great shape there.  And then the other item was an accounting adjustment and that's going to happen from time to time and agreed our portfolio is getting bigger at 48% of the overall in terms of the same store bucket. But still it’s surprising and even property tax adjustments on one building can make insignificant difference in NOI. So we feel really good that we'll be back in the 2%, 3% range here shortly and continue on that pace. In terms of renewal spreads, I am going to turn over to Mark.
Mark Theine: Thanks, Jeff. We've seen a lot of leasing activity in the third quarter here, 169,000 square feet of leases renewing or new leases in the portfolio which is our fourth quarter and role of positive net absorption. On re-leasing spreads, about 80% retention rate for the quarter and releasing spreads as Jeff mentioned continue to be positive 2% to 3% as we're working on lease renewal here across the portfolio. 
John Thomas: And just to add, Landon, on that Peachtree Dunwoody space that we have new tenants, those releasing spreads are actually up 14%.
Landon Park : And just sorry quick follow ups on this just. Are you expecting here that low single digit releasing spreads to continue and then on the same store the expenses, did those changes more or less run through expenses because you're picking up more costs associated with certain assets?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, I mean some of the expenses again was that property tax adjustment that showed up the big increase, the same store so that through that off a little bit or a lot I should say. We think expenses will moderate from that 7% level back to something more in line with the rental growth.
John Thomas: Landon, one thing, you asked about any other problems. We don't see any problems with any of our major tenants that, the all tax as we talk about the ports we have one -- we have three all-tax leased to one provider life care which really does an outstanding job but as we've mentioned before they're going through a change in reimbursement structure this year with criteria going into effect. So their EBITDAR coverage is down slightly but that was expected and again they’re performing very well. And I also noticed in light of other news the last twenty four hours we don't have any exposure to Adeptus and we don't have any exposure to freestanding emergency departments at all. So it's been an asset class that we've been monitoring but have not invested in.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Wolf with Stifel. 
Aaron Wolf : Hi, just a couple quick questions. So it looks like G&A as a percent NOI ticked down quite a bit in the quarter. Is this something that we can expect to continue due to operating leverage going forward?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah, I mean I think just in general our G&A was higher than our desired run rate starting the company -- over three years old. So we always had to build an infrastructure to support a company that we thought could grow and grow significantly over a long period of time. So as the company matures and as we continue to add more assets and gain more efficiencies I think you will continue to see that G&A ticked down either as a percent of assets or percent of NOI or whichever metric you want to look at. 
Aaron Wolf : And, in terms of the deals you're pursuing, what types of buyers are you encountering -- foreign investors? Private equity? Other REITs?
John Thomas: And most consistent buyers we bump into these days are private equity -- private buyers, we don't see -- some of them may be getting capital from foreign investment, but we don’t see any direct foreign investment, there is an RFP class at all, I think there's growing interest by sovereign wealth and other foreign pension plans if you will, pension funds. But that's where the competition is coming from. We've seen a little uptick in activity from other health care needs but again so much of our business off market, we don't bump in anybody in that context. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Johnson Hughes with Raymond James. 
Jonathan Hughes : Hey guys, good morning. Earlier, you had mentioned that West Coast cap rates, some can be below 6%. Can I take that as an indication you're looking to go west, given you don't have any exposure there now?
Jeff Theiler: You know, Jonathan, like you once did, every once in a while we look at California because that’s such a big state and big population but then declined to invest there. So we'll be there at some point, we really like the Seattle market and got a big program there through CHI but we think some assets recently in California just passed kind of our underwriting standards so. Again big state, big population so we mentioned they're going to help with what's going on with them and potentially with CHI, that may create an opportunity for us with them there. So like I said we're in 30 states today and there's really no state we won't go to in the right underwriting standards.
Jonathan Hughes : And then I guess one on underwriting -- when you look at acquisitions, do you underwrite ground-leased assets differently, and if so, what's the spread on a comparable asset, not subject to a ground lease?
Jeff Theiler: We underwrite the effect of the ground lease, most ground leases are with hospitals, most ground leases are there's about the hospital controlling, kind of use of the building. So again it’s really a case by case scenario. John, we have 50 ground leased there so.
John Thomas: 55 – yes, 56 ground leases. The new accounting standards requires to record those I guess differently now and there's more disclosure about the ground leases that in the end we’re going to work at hospitals or you’re going to have deal with ground leases. We're very comfortable that all of ours is long term and the issues around restrictions are things we get comfortable with the hospital, lot of the CHI controlled ground leases. It’s hard to say we underwrite it differently. Obviously it’s always nice to have a piece of the deal. But I wouldn’t say that they drive the major cap rate, this is a general rule cap rate differential. 
Jonathan Hughes : And then just one more, I've asked about risks to medical office in the past and not much out there besides maybe some macro factors but I've come up with a new angle here. We've heard more commentary about some strip centers, backfilling empty small shop space with medical office tenants. Does this represent a potential supply threats to the say 20% of your off campus unaffiliated property. 
John Thomas: It’s adept over use of subscription versus than going on for a long period of time. We actually own a few additions, bought kind of in partnership with physicians and then rehab for them and it's really a nice cost effective way to access points at existing locations. We are working with a hospital system today to acquire a meaningful portion of a Class A kind of retail location that we are acquiring with them the physical building. So I won't say it's a threat. I think supply across our space and in our top ten markets we're just looking at this data. And I think in any market we have the 2% or more of new supply coming online and in some of that supply we already have our hooks into the developer -- working with the developer, have some long term opportunity to acquire that. So just on seeing real supply risk right now in our markets. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Michael Gorman with BTIG. 
Michael Gorman : Thanks. Good morning, guys. John, I just wanted to go back to the 603 assets for a minute, and kind of tie that into the cap rate discussion. As you've gotten more clarity on the impact of the 603 and the final regulations, have you seen any changes in the cap rates on 603 assets that are in the market?
John Thomas: Historically off campus assets have attracted less investors, has discovered the bias for kind of the on-campus off-campus bias. I talked a lot about that you know historically, so we haven’t really seen a major impact on cap rates. And in theory it should. These are very strong as we talk about, and we’re really excited about the 53 we have and the prospects at least from not only renewing the lease but getting kind of top of the market rental rates out of the strength of our position and the hospitals need to stay there. So over time I think as more and more people find the advantages to the off-campus locations, you’d see something there and 603 would be an important factor.
Michael Gorman : And then, can you just give a little bit of color on kind of what percentage of the pipeline that you're looking at right now is off-market, and maybe what percentage would also be subject to maybe like an OP Unit deal?
John Thomas: I think currently in our pipeline and you're looking at it, it’s 55%, 60% is considered off-market or likely market, and – Mike, the other question, sorry, it was what?
Michael Gorman : Sorry, just kind of what percentage would potentially be an OP Unit deal?
John Thomas: Fairly small number right now, we got a couple of deals where the doctors have asked about -- I mean we actually had a seller reach out to us just directly asking us to evaluate purchasing their building in an OP Unit context. So it hasn't been as active as it was early in our life. Hey, interestingly many of the acquisitions we just completed was actually a 368 reverse triangular corporate merger, this doctor group owned a really nice building in an S-corp and for several reasons in context they wanted OPUs but this worked out even better where we can just use our straight public shares and do a stock for stock merger. So in fact, the same kind of capital for an OP deal but it's actually using our public shares and doesn’t affect a partnership. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of John Roberts with Hilliard Lyons.
John Roberts : Morning, guys. Sounds like you -- I know you probably don't want to give this out right now, but it sounds like you've got a pretty good indication of early year pipeline into 2017. Any thoughts on what you're looking at for the full year, similar to this year? Or do you think you might see less due to higher price, competition, et cetera?
John Thomas: John, great question. So we routinely say and we don't think anything changing this as of today which is we’re going to build and find again and source and underwrite and close 200 million, 250 million a quarter. We don't see anything today that would change that at the same time we're not issuing that as formal guidance for next year. I think the biggest qualifier to that is whether the capital markets are open and not. So I guess in August we will provide some formal guidance for the year but as we sit here today I wouldn’t think of being consistent with that expectation. 
John Roberts : I know you've got the ATM open, any thoughts on potential use of that?
John Thomas: John, I think the ATM is a great tool to use in conjunction with follow-on offerings. So it's something that we evaluate every quarter, we look at where our stock price is both on an absolute basis and where we think it is relative to our competitors and decide whether that's something -- we will also obviously look at our balance sheet and any kind of use of the capital we have coming up. We put all those factors together and then make a decision as to whether or not to issue equity and then from that we make the decision whether or not we think the ATM is a better use or better means of issuing equity or follow-on offering. So that's kind of what all goes into the mix and we evaluate that quarter to quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jeff Gaston : Good morning guys. This is Jeff Gaston on for Jordan. So a lot of my questions were addressed earlier but I was just hoping you could clarify when you're looking at your investment pipeline. Are you seeing any -- I guess any year and selling pressure or more deals starting to shake out or become viable with changing interest rate expectations?
John Thomas: There’s probably been some volume uptick because of the uptick in interest rates and people trying to capture this kind of the current cap rate environment. I think that offset -- the interest rate changes is offset by the kind of more and more capital coming into the space and pressuring supply and demand and dollars looking for assets. But we haven’t seen anybody rush for capturing tax benefits before the first of the year. Nothing like that. So that may change but don't expect it.
Jeff Gaston : Sure, and then I guess one last, pretty minor thing. Looks like HCN sold an $80 million portfolio during the quarter, and they sold it at like a 7.9% cap rate. I was just curious if you guys have taken a look at that, and what you thought of the assets?
John Thomas: As you know, there was 3 to 3.5 years where certain people in the room were involved in creating that portfolio. So if they were assets that we wanted, when we asked about them and exclude others.  End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
John Thomas: Again thank you for joining the call this morning. It was an outstanding quarter and as we look to closing out an outstanding year and going into next year, we look forward to seeing everybody at NAREIT and give us a call if you haven’t gotten on our schedule yet. Thank you again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the Physicians Realty Trust second quarter earnings call. We just celebrated the third anniversary of our initial public offering on July 19 and are very pleased to report record results of the second quarter of 2016. In just three short years, we've grown from 19 medical office properties valued at about $124 million to 222 high quality well diversified facilities representing total investments of more than $2.6 billion in 29 states. This growth is fuelled by a strong investor base, strong personal and professional relationships with outstanding healthcare systems, excellent physicians and other providers, and a team of hardworking smart people dedicated to building and managing a best in class medical office portfolio and operating platform. Our incredible team of professionals and partners that completed substantially all the Catholic Health Initiatives or CHI acquisitions we announced in April with only four of the 51 buildings left to acquire, three will close during the third quarter while the other one will close later this fall or early 2017 after construction is completed. We are proud of our team's unique stability and hardwork to underwrite, inspect, document and closing the acquisition of over 50 facilities this quarter investing $680 million over just three months time. In addition to the CHI portfolio, we also completed a handful of smaller acquisitions during the quarter all of which are organic off-market growth opportunities with existing clients or relationships including one lease to CHI’ KentuckyOne Health that is adjacent to another facility we own and leased to them in Kentucky. We also added another addition to sentence in St. Vincent's East Hospital campus near Birmingham, Alabama. Jeff will review our financial results but needless to say our growth and attention to operations continues to produce very good results. We were opportunistic in the third quarter to access the debt and equity capital markets demonstrating our commitment to financial strength and prudent growth. On April 11, we completed our eighth and largest follow on equity offerings with net proceeds of approximately $443 million. We appreciate the continued support from our loyal and growing investor base in this oversubscribed offering. The net proceeds from this follow on offering fuelled another record quarter of strong growth investing almost $680 million primarily driven by the substantial completion of the CHI investment and the handful client relationship acquisitions we completed. With our new debt, facilities and placements Jeff will describe in a minute, we have strengthened our long-term balance sheet and are well fueled to continue our outsized growth as we continue to source opportunities through our relationship business development model efforts some have called proprietary. We are also pleased to announce we have strengthened our asset management teams as well with the addition of Mark Dukes, VP, Property Management who will be responsible for the primary nationwide management of all of our CHI facilities. Mark has a long history in medical office management coming to us from Duke Realty and Mark was most recently recognized by his peers as one of three property managers of the year by the Building Owners Management Association or BOMA. We've also added Amy Hall, VP of Leasing. Amy joins us from the CBRE, in Louisville, Kentucky and has a strong history in medical office leasing, planning and real estate in general. With over 1,000 leases across our 200 plus buildings, Amy's leadership and focus on both renewals and new leasing will strengthen our property operations and our financial results. Amy joined us July and is already produced several new leases and process for our vacant space in CHI KentuckyOne facilities as well as many pending renewables. We are very pleased to welcome Amy and her leadership. All totaled, our portfolio has grown to almost 10 million square feet of on and off campus medical office facilities with just over 95.7% leased with an average lease term of 8.6 years. Many of the off-campus buildings are new and strategically placed in sub- markets with strong insure demographics and providing comprehensive outpatient services and procedures. We believe 50 of our buildings are anchored by hospital outpatient departments for HOPDs, in existence as of November 2015 and thus our grandfather 603 assets. These assets represent approximately 30% of our current NOI. As grandfather at HOP is located in our 603 assets, these tenant providers are eligible for higher Medicare reimbursement, the new locations established of the campus at the hospital provider. CMS recently issued proposed regulations that state the provider will lose his grandfather status if they move the HOPD out of the grandfather building location. In our case, the buildings we own. We anticipate the potential loss of HOPD reimbursement will enhance the desire of these tenants to remain in these locations, again our buildings and we’re more likely than not renew the relations at reasonable fair market rents. We would like to address the anticipated general industry classification system changes that will go into effect in September. When real estate becomes it’s own sector within capital market indices separated for the first time from financials. Green Street Advisors believe that this event is a driving visibility in new investment. According to Green Street the US mutual fund industry is dramatically underweight real estate. REITs have been the best performing assay class since 1998 with a 10% annual return and this underweight strategy will come under pressure when the S&P 500 and MSCI indices are rebound. Estimates range that generalized investors are underweight REITs by somewhere between $40 and $100 billion and some portion of this imbalance will eventually work its way into REITs. Several sell side research analysts believe that the fundamentals for medical office buildings remains the most attractive among all healthcare real estate assay classes. Underscoring the importance of medical office within the evolving healthcare delivery system, hostel admissions in the context of population levels are declining while the ratio of outpatient business has been steadily climbing over the past two decades. According to the American Hospital Association hospital admissions have been declining by approximately 1% per year while outpatient visits have been increasing by more than 2% per year. Rising healthcare costs have led medical service providers to offer increasingly more outpatient services especially medical properties. Hospitals are typically associated with high cost treatment while outpatient facilities in many cases are able to facilitate lower costs and more efficient patient treatment. Insurance companies and government health care providers have also formulated reimbursement policies that favor these less expensive outpatient care settings. As a result of these changes, we have been spending more and more time of generalist investors, some of which have no really exposure and others of which are seeking more information specifically about healthcare real estate and healthcare REITs. We believe these fund flows should flow into healthcare REITs and in particular pureplay medical office buildings as the most recession resilient and most potential growth without material government pay risk. Medical office buildings in the macro sense also have the lease risk for new development competition as most new development - as much of new development is replacing old hospitals or penetrating new markets not necessarily creating competition for existing medical office stock. As a high growth pureplay medical office REIT investor with the highest occupancy and more stable releases with 96% leased for 8.6 years on average. Physicians Realty Trust is the most attractive healthcare we believe or any asset class REIT that generalist investors consider as they initiate REIT investing and eventually getting their investment allocations in line with the gigs industry reallocation. We ended the quarter with 39% of our space either on the camps of the hospital or anchored by health system, up from 73% last quarter. This continues to demonstrate our disciplined plan to continue to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio and our long-term commitment of building and managing those platforms as we increase this asset allocation percentage to at least 90% in the next two years. With that I will ask Jeff to review our financial results and balance sheet management.
Jeff Theiler: Thank you John, we are pleased to report another solid quarter of operations. The company generated funds from operations of $26.3 million or $0.19 per share. Our normalized funds from operations which adds back acquisition expenses was $29.5 million. Normalized funds from operations per share was $0.22, an increase of about 5% over the same period last year which is a pretty remarkable number considering we pre-funded our large CHI acquisition with our $443 million equity offering in April. Our normalized funds available for distribution were $27 million or $0.20 per share. In this quarter, we closed on $680 million of investments at an average cap rate of 6.3%. $616 million of this activity was related to the CHI transaction and the remainder consisted primarily of medical office buildings sourced through existing relationships. Our acquisition closing skewed toward the end of the quarter with a second tranche of the CHI deal closing on June 30. Had all of our second quarter acquisitions closed on April 1, we would have had an additional $7 million of cash NOI. We are pleased to be largely through the closing of the transformational CHI deal and look forward to focusing our attention on the acquisition opportunity ahead of us. We remain comfortable with our acquisition guidance of $1 to $1.25 billion for 2016. On the operations side, our same-store portfolio which includes every asset that we have owned 15 month period generated year over year NOI growth of 1.7% with the 10 basis point decrease in occupancy. Contractual rent escalations were responsible for the majority of the NOI increase offset by the lease expiration move out of the other North side tenant in our building in Peachtree Dunwoody building in Atlanta, Georgia. But we don't like any moveouts, the Peachtree Dunwoody building is a premier building in Atlanta with strong leasing potential. We will have back filled about one third of that space already by September and have some significant traction for a large chunk of the remaining space. We had a very busy quarter on the financing side, we started the quarter with our April issuance of $443 million of equity, our largest equity raised to date which was primarily used to fund the CHI transaction. This has enabled us to close the majority of that transaction as well as certain other acquisitions while keeping our debt to assets at 25%. Which is considerably lower than our peers. Also on the equity front we are process of negotiating a new $300 million ATM program in order to provide some additional financial flexibility. Moving to debt, in June we entered into a new credit agreement that increased our revolver size by $100 million to $850 million and provided the option to draw $250 million seven-year term loan at a rate of LIBOR plus 180 basis points. We do that term loan in early July and immediately entered into a swap arrangement that fixed our payments at an annual rate of 2.87% over the next seven years. The term loans used to pay down revolving line of credit, so as we sit here today, we have $158 million outstanding on the line with additional capacity of $692 million. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. At the quarter end, our debt to total capitalization was 18% and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times. We expect to continue to issue long-term fixed-rate debt in the second half of the year. We will evaluate both the private and public debt markets for this activity. Finally our G&A for the quarter was $4.9 million bringing the six month total to $9 million. We remain on track with our previously announced G&A guidance of $19 to $21 million for the year. With that I will turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Operator, we’re ready for questions and answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Hughes: Can you just talk about the outlook for quarterly acquisition volume now that the CHI deal is closed? I know you maintained the range and touched on this earlier but I think there might be some concern about a slowdown in this pace as we approach 2017.
John Thomas: Hey Jon, this is John Thomas. We communicated in the past, we tapped the brakes a little bit just while we integrated CHI and had such massive investment in work to do to complete that investment this quarter. The pipeline for the rest of the year looks pretty good and I think we feel good about the guidance that we are not previously announced 1.2 to 1.25 billion. Could surprises to be more but we feel good about that guidance and I think the pipeline for ‘17 particular about relationships is also starting to build, so, for now, we will issue 2017 guidance later but still feel good about the pace and the opportunity.
Jonathan Hughes: And speaking on relationship have any other large national health care systems reached out to looking for a deal similar to CHI or had any discussions?
John Thomas: There's been a lot of interest from the hospital industry about the CHI opportunity.
Jonathan Hughes: I will leave it at that and then I will just ask one more and I’ll jump off but last quarter you gave some color on pricing for potential debt raises and obviously did the term loan last month, but could you give us an update where you can think you get priced debt today, given the tenure dropped 30 basis points since your last call and the fact that one of your MOB focused peers recently issued some pretty attractive tenure notes.
Jeff Theiler: Jonathan, it’s Jeff, the tenure is bouncing around quite a bit, right now I’d guess we'd been in the low 4s probably in the private market, if we were to do public market offering its hard to tell as an inaugural issuer but probably that same ballpark, so I would guess the very low 4s.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Kucera from Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.
Craig Kucera: Just want to follow up on the question regarding the balance sheet, Jeff when we think about the back half of this year, you just did the term loan, do think a private placement is likely to take out the rest of line of credit or you more likely than not just continue to use the line?
Jeff Theiler: I think that we are really going to be focusing on keeping our debt termed out particularly as we look at the interest rates that we have right now. So it’s certainly likely that we are going to use the long-term debt markets and again I think the private debt market is a great spot for us, we've got a great relationship in that area that we can build on pretty easily. And then, as we look toward the back - the end of the year certainly the public debt markets if they remain open would be a good option for us as well to expand the number of capital avenues that we have available.
Craig Kucera: And I wanted to go a little deeper into some of the details of the smaller acquisitions you did this quarter, the medical village facility, it looks you bought about 9 million, it has yielded a 9.3, what’s the entire pool of the yield approximately?
John Thomas: The entire relationship is as much larger couple of buildings under construction but one of the things that’s so attractive to us about it was the great cap rates and kind of the aggregation of independent physicians altogether who aggregate those medical village [indiscernible] Orlando market, so pretty excited about it, I think most of it outflows this year at some point but that was just the first two buildings in the relationship.
Craig Kucera: So do you have a field then, is the entire pool going to close it north of a 9 or it is kind of several closer to your kind of what you do more typically right around high sixes low seven?
John Thomas: No, these will be in the low eights, but the first to get the closed were older buildings being rehabbed substantially the newer buildings trying to get a tighter cap rate, but it’s overall the rate for the relationship.
Craig Kucera: And how long is the renovating period on the Children Hospital, MOB in Milwaukee?
John Thomas: Six months. It is a beautiful facility and a great new relationship for us that Mark Theine and John Sweet worked hard to develop.
Craig Kucera: And, one last run from me, with the land purchase you did in Jackson, Tennessee, how do you think about cash on the cash returns on expansion in MBOs, are you hearing from many other tenants that are looking to expand their building?
John Thomas: And that's exactly what that is, a small investment of land, so we can expand that building which has a surgery center in it, [indiscernible] expansion ramp once it’s developed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Just first on the same-store NOI trends, now that you have a decent size pool in the same-store portfolio. Can you maybe just give us your sense of what you expect over the next few quarters and just how the components would stack up, I’m just trying to get a sense of where the trend is relative to your peers?
John Thomas: Sure Vikram, so you are right, our same-store pools continuing to grow, we have 1.7% growth this year, that was disproportionally affected by an additional move out that we had in Peachtree so we had two of the North side tenant vacate the Peachtree Dunwoody building so that’s what dropped it down a little bit. We would expect certainly over any kind of reasonable period of time that you are going to be in the 2 or 3% same-store growth arena, so we would expect rental revenues to kind of increase to a more normalized 2%, 2.5% and operating expenses to probably start increasing a little bit.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just on tenant retention as you look out in ‘17 and I don't know you don't have a lot of leases over the next few years coming to you but as you look throughout at ‘17 just based on early discussion, do you have a sense of where tenant retention might pan out?
John Thomas: I mean it's hard to know exactly where it's going to pan out in 2017. I mean we've talked a lot about 80 to 90% retention rate goals, if you eliminated that Peachtree Dunwoody move out from this quarter we would have been 84%. So we think it's probably going to be 80 to 90% but it's not the definite right now.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just last one on CHI, just walk us through you plans or as you’ve looked to the portfolio so what are in your minds the more riskier part of the portfolio especially in light of this several downgrades credit downgrades that we’ve see recently?
John Thomas: Vikram this is John Thomas, so, that was not unexpected, Fitch just kind of caught up with the other agencies, if you read that S&P report you get a substantial detail about kind of their evaluation of the long-term prospects frankly for a credit upgrade there are two key components of that one was the recapitalization which was what are transaction did for them and in the second was just the operating history to see they are kind of strategic operational improvement plan go into effect. So, it was no surprise to us we had done our own individual and gone to third party to work with us on an individual region by region analysis and certainly some room for improvement, global being [indiscernible] lowest North Dakota and Houston area being part of the strongest regions within that platform, Seattle being very strong but even in [indiscernible] we had four times pro forma EBITDA coverage and had a lot of new leasing activity particularly with Amy Hall joining us and one of the reasons we are so excited about her. So we feel very good about the long-term prospects and where they’re heading.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just to clarify, so you’re still in the camp of more of the portfolio remain as there is very little dispositions at least over the near term?
John Thomas: That's right, we don't have any attention to the selling thing there are some buildings that over time probably get redeveloped or replaced but in the near term they are producing good NOI and anchored by CHI and our own campus so we feel good about even the lesser of the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Just kind of hitting on one of the earlier questions, any change in sort of market cap rates given lower treasuries and maybe more uncertainty in other areas of health care which I know you touched on in your prepared remarks, kind of where do you see the typical bread-and-butter deals penciling out from a cap rate perspective?
John Thomas: Hey Juan, this is John, I don't think even at the lower tenure and [indiscernible] cost, we still are seeing lots of opportunities again between six and seven. There are certainly people pushing for sub-six particularly in big coastal markets but we still very good about the high quality we are finding and again for the year, weighted heavily by the CHI transaction, which is in place at 6.2%, we still feel good about, averaging about 6.5% for what we see in front of us. So, you'll see some 6s and as we mentioned, we got the 8s, which are brand new buildings down in Florida, that overall we still feel and see lots of opportunities, again ranging from 6 to 7. But as you move up the quality scale, like we continue to try to do, again, you'll see more in the low-6s.
Juan Sanabria: And then just on the balance sheet with the new ATM, have you guys run the numbers on what potentially you could issue on sort of quarterly basis, I know the blackout is kind of different from period to period, but any sense of what you could potentially do on a run rate basis?
Jeff Theiler: Yeah. Hey Juan, it's Jeff. We haven’t and I guess that's because we haven't really contemplated just turning it on and leaving it on. I mean I think we want that ATM to have the flexibility to match fund acquisitions when appropriate or get a little bit of equity here and there. I don't think it's going to be a deviation from how we typically fund, which is follow-on equity offerings, particularly when associated with a big chunk of investment volume. So we haven't really run that analysis. I can certainly talk to you about it later if you like.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. Great. And then just on CHI. How do you guys think about the total exposure, I think it's 25% to 30% of your portfolio, do you think of them as each individual separate health systems or is it really one whole thing where there is a parent guarantee that kind of overlays over the whole?
John Thomas: Yeah. Good question, Juan. So technically we have, if each region is our tenant, and that's where the credit is and the credit risk is, we do think about the aggregate, which is approaching 29%, but the corporate super parent, if you will, which is the rated entity is not a direct obligor on the leases. The only real direct obligation they have from a balance sheet perspective are the bonds that they issue in the aggregate [indiscernible]. So, again, that's what we did individual credit analysis of each region and as I said, even the worst region is 4 times EBITDA coverage and kind of a BB, kind of implicit rating from a rating agency perspective. So, that's why I think you'll see in our supplement, we're breaking it out, so our largest tenants, our top 10 tenants now are -- several of those are individual regions within the CHI and that's technically where our credit is and technically where the risk and the exposure is.
Juan Sanabria: And what was the blended coverage for the whole CHI portfolio that you guys expect?
John Thomas: It's close to 10, if not more. We kind of look at it on individual, some regions are in the teens and again the worst is 4 plus.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: Thanks. Hey, John. How much of your time has been taken up completing the CHI deal and has that kind of impacted the size of the company's investment pipeline currently?
John Thomas: Mike, kind of like your home town Cleveland Cavaliers, we've got an outstanding team between Deeni and Mark Theine and John Sweet and others who are still out there sourcing opportunities. Mark has spent an enormous amount of his time, integrating this transaction and with Mark Dukes that, this great addition that again it worked with Mark or Deeni Taylor previously at Duke. So it hasn't slowed down at all, in fact with one of the advantages of our kind of proprietary model, we're able to kind of pace out and move some of the transactions back into the calendar year when we can pursue them more aggressively. So, as I mentioned here in my opening comments, Jeff and I frankly have been spending a lot of times with potential new investors focused on the [indiscernible] classification and so it's a good balance, but I'm still out there knocking on doors as well.
Michael Carroll: Okay, so I guess in your comments and you said that you’re kind of taking a step back to complete the CHI deal that was more of your choice, just trying to integrate such a large transaction and less of the size of the pipeline and the amount of effort you guys can kind of go out there and find deals?
John Thomas: Absolutely, we just move things from the second to the third quarter and as sellers in relationships that we work with to be patient. To my knowledge, we haven’t lost any opportunities and just kind of spreading them out over the back end of the year. Again, CHI was so important to us, we are so important to build other hospital systems that might be calling that we had a extremely high quality integration and first day on the job, managing those -- building those physician relationships and I said Amy Hall started July 1, she was actually working on new leases before she started and that's been a very positive impact.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then can you kind of give us some color on the type of deals that you are currently pursuing today, I mean should we be thinking more of like CHI, I mean?
John Thomas: We missed you Mike.
Michael Carroll: Yeah. Can you kind of give us an idea of the type of acquisitions you’re pursuing today? I mean, are you still kind of looking for those 7 cap type deals or you’re kind of moving up the quality spectrum looking for cap rates in the mid-6 type range?
John Thomas: Operator?
Operator: I’m sorry. The question guys cut out there. We'll move onto the next question, that's from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thanks. Looks like you made your second executive.
John Thomas: John, can you hear us? John Kim?
John Kim: Yes. Can you hear me? Hello. John. I think there is an issue with the connection, operator. Hello. It will make for a great transcript.
Operator: I'm sorry. Your line is live.
John Kim: Hello. John, can you hear me? Hello.
Operator: I'm sorry. Mr. Page, your line is live right now.
John Kim: John, can you hear me?
Operator: Yeah. Okay. We'll go on to the next question. That's from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Hey, guys. Can you hear me all right? John Kim, can you hear me? It's a joke. I could hear you. Operator, I don't think that the management.
Brad Page: Yeah. If there is anybody talking here, for some reason, we can't hear you. So...
Jordan Sadler: Operator, can you hear me?
Operator: I can hear you, I can hear you, Mr. Sadler. I'm sorry.
Jordan Sadler: So I can hear you, but management can't hear me.
Operator: I think they can hear you. Why don't you go ahead and try and see if they can answer your question. Mr. Page, are you there?
Jordan Sadler: John, Jeff, can you hear me? They can't. John who? John Kim? Just see operator. Yeah. The management team can't hear me, sir.
Operator: I think they can hear you.
Jordan Sadler: I just asked them and they didn't reply. I don't know if you're listening on a different headset. John Thomas, Jeff Theiler, can you hear me? Anyone? Theiler? Sorry, operator. I can't hear.
Operator: Okay, I don't think for some reason they can hear the questions. One moment.
Jordan Sadler: I think you are on it now.
Operator: Rejoining the speakers.
Jordan Sadler: John Thomas, can you hear me?
John Thomas: Yes, we can hear you now.
Jordan Sadler: Hey. It’s Jordan Sadler. Nice to be with you. Hi, there Sorry about that. Not sure what happened. This is your second quarter earnings conference call, isn't it?
John Thomas: It is.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, great. Then, I’m at the right place. I was going to ask you about just the cap rates that you guys were seeing. I can't remember if that quite got answered, I think it was being asked by one of the other callers who you couldn't hear, but I was curious if you’re seeing better opportunities in the market at all, and whether or not you guys were licking your chops a little bit, given the fact that the 10-year has come down a little bit and maybe there is an opportunity?
John Thomas: Yes. So we did answer this, but we're happy to do it again. So we still see a lot of really good opportunities, particularly our cost of capital has improved and we would like to be better, but we’re seeing lots of opportunities between 6% and 7%. I think for the year, we’ll probably end up about 6.5% on the aggregate, but heavily influenced by our CHI at a 6.2, kind of going in place cap rates. So there are some portfolios out there that probably continue to push at 6 and people looking for sub-6, particularly in kind of core coastal markets, but we’re excited about the opportunities we see and we continue to move up the quality scale and we view that as newer buildings, bigger buildings and on and off campus, but fairly helpful systems, which is going to drive those cap rates to that range, but 6% is still a good number, best in quality for us and we've got an 8 in the pipeline that are brand-new buildings that works out.
Jordan Sadler: And, the pipeline, how would you characterize it, I mean would you be trending towards the high end of this guidance range still?
John Thomas: Yes. We feel good about our guidance and being able to accomplish that. We have plenty of fuel to do that and we can do that through that, but without increasing our debt levels to anywhere that we’d be uncomfortable with, but we feel good about the guidance as it is, and if you get lucky and do a little bit better, we could push some things to the first quarter 2017.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then someone asked you earlier about dispositions and I think specifically in the CHI portfolio, but I was kind of curious as you anniversary here, third-year, anything within the broader portfolio that you’d look to pair asset managed out over time?
John Thomas: Yes. I think we’re probably getting to a time, scale and we probably did a little bit more proactively, we don't have anything held for sale today. We sold two of the legacy buildings from the original portfolio last year and there are some older buildings that are still producing nice NOI, but 2017 might be a year that start doing a little bit more of that, nothing in the CHI portfolio, do we have any attention to sell in the near term, but there are some opportunities there for some redevelopment or repositioning some assets and over time, there will be some pruning, really, the whole portfolio, but out of CHI as well. There are also some brand new buildings and some high-quality on-campus buildings in that portfolio, we expect to own for a very long time.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then just one for Jeff there, on the debt to EBITDA, you guys reported 4.2 times, is that a pro forma statistic that or do you have a pro forma statistic that reflects full quarter’s run rate of CHI?
Jeff Theiler:  [Technical Difficulty]
Jordan Sadler: What was that last part?
Jeff Theiler: Mid-3% range or so, mid-to low 3%. [Technical Difficulty]
Jordan Sadler: No worries. Okay, thank you. I'll hop back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. I thought I’d said something that might have pointed you or something. Okay. So it sounds like you made your second executive hire from Duke. Any thoughts on their appetite to sell MOBs?
John Thomas: We can't speak to what Duke will do, but we’re excited about our team, and they developed and/or managed their portfolio. So we’re anxious to hear if you find anything about it.
John Kim: I know you said in the past that you want to have G&A at about 1% of assets, is that still the goal as you’re heading into 2017?
John Thomas: Yes. And we are under that now and kind of managing that. Jeff will get more precise.
Jeff Theiler: Hey, John. It’s Jeff. We think that our G&A is going to be in line with everybody else's that operates the same kind of business. So as we get bigger, we expect it to drift under 1% of assets like the other pure play MOB REITs. So I think you could just plot it on that kind of a line of G&A assets versus overall assets.
John Kim: I'm just wondering because you've doubled the size of your portfolio in the last 12 months and it sounds like you’ve made some recent hires, but is that going to pick up over the next 12 months?
John Thomas: The team has grown a lot for the implementation of CHI, particularly on the property and asset management side. A lot of that is reimbursed through our rate cap charges in the leases there. So it's, kind of on a G&A basis, it’s not only net neutral, but just positive, so there is still some G&A growth, but not -- it’s disproportionately lower than the growth in asset base.
John Kim: Okay. John, you mentioned conversations with general equity investors, can you shed some light on your conversations as far as how they’re viewing valuation and the disparity, not so much with your company, but with healthcare REITs in general, the disparity between NAV premiums and maybe multiple discounts? 
John Thomas: I would say it's interesting the kind of the range of education and understanding about REITs, generally in health care REITs and specifics on, some are just learning. So obviously we think MOBs are not only the best asset class, but we and the other MOB REITs are probably undervalued in comparison. So we think there is a lot of relative upside there as I mentioned before in our comments. I think some of them will come in thinking there is higher valuations, but we do a good job and we work hard to kind of help them understand where the opportunity is we think as MOBs.
John Kim: And in comparing MOBs with some other asset classes, can you discuss or estimate the EBITDA coverage of your entire portfolio or maybe an occupancy cost context. I know you don't really look at it that way, but can you provide maybe a range of what that might be?
John Thomas: Yes. So on our highly specialized facility, which is fairly small part of the portfolio, our LTACs are in the 3 plus EBITDA range or sort of hospitals are 4 to 5 times EBITDA range. I mean, very good coverages and very low Medicare exposure, no Medicaid exposure. So you distinguish that from skilled nursing in particular and kind of the supply bubble and other senior housing, again MOBs should stand out as the high-growth in the most stable asset class in healthcare.
John Kim: That's great, thank you. 
Jeff Theiler: And I will add, general medical office space can be 10 to 20 times, it just depends.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Chad Vanacore: Hey. Good afternoon, all. So, on some real questions, just some follow-ups to my colleague’s questions. What should we expect in the balance transactions for the back half of the year, is it weighted more to the fourth quarter or is that ratably over the second half?
John Thomas: I think it's -- third quarter will be, we feel good about it. I think it's probably more in the fourth quarter and the pipelines will try them out, but kind of a regular REIT business, we feel very good about.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And then same-store NOI growth dipped under 2%, was that really due to the prior period tenant loss or is there something else going on there that we should be aware of and then where do you think it trends in the back half of the year?
John Thomas: So that one tenant was a biggest impact and we talked about it last quarter and it’s two tenants that were related to each other, one expired in the first quarter and the other one expired this quarter, and I think the trends continue to be in the right direction for the rest of the year.
Chad Vanacore: All right. And I think I’ll stop there and I’ll talk to you guys later
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Just a quick question around section 603 since we haven't talked about this in a while, but CMS did put out some information about their OPPS proposals for 2017, and it sounds like they are talking about grandfathered, what to call it, outpatient departments or the hospital providers, they won't be able to relocate and there is a whole bunch of other restrictions. I'm just curious, has it changed your mind about how you think about buying off-campus versus on-campus MOBs or none?
John Thomas: I don't think it changes. I think it enhances. I mentioned this Tayo, in my opening comments, that regulation is, we expected that interpretation and as had some insight into that, and again if you own a grandfathered asset, the tenant, if they want to keep that higher reimbursement, has to stay there. They can move it back to the hospital campus, but if they put it on the outpatient off-campus setting for a reason, they just totally benefited from the HOPD rates and now CMS, you can maintain that as long as you stay in their location. So, we feel very good about that from that perspective.
Tayo Okusanya: What about the future acquisitions, are you thinking about making future acquisitions?
John Thomas: Yes. I think future acquisitions, if they are grandfathered assets, right, if they are not a grandfathered asset, we’ll underwrite it from that perspective and again, we like on-campus, but we think the future healthcare delivery is very consumer driven and consumer oriented driven and you don't plot the new hospital down in the middle of a high network demographic kind of market, you do it in an outpatient setting, and again there will be future outpatient buildings built there that just have a different reimbursement model. So we will underwrite it from that perspective, but there is a lot of grandfathered assets out there, very large number of our buildings, 50 buildings have some kind of 603 anchored to them and we think they are stronger than ever with this law and these regulations.
Tayo Okusanya: Got you. All right, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Hi, just a follow-up on the recent hire, so you commented in an answer to one of the questions that they have developed most of Duke’s portfolio and so it just raises a question surrounding development, now that you’ve kind of - you’re building some of that capability internally, how are you thinking about development?
John Thomas: Yes. So we really haven’t changed our views on development. Again, one of the opportunities we have with our CHI relationship is to work with them, and as they identify developers that they want to work with and again hopefully we would expect some opportunities to help them in that planning and eventually owning those best buildings, but we certainly have the capability to develop and oversee the development, but we are not building an engine business -- do direct development. So, we’ll continue to work with developers and friends around the country and if they need some capital as part of the opportunity and create some opportunity for us, then we'll do that on a case-by-case basis. But you're not going to see a development team starts self-developing here in any meaningful way. We can expand the building where we have like a TI expansion, but no change in philosophy.
Jordan Sadler: Is that a never?
John Thomas: No, it’s not. I would never say never on anything, but we don't have any intention to do that, Jordan.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thanks, John.
Operator: And now, I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Brad Page: Yes, we appreciate you joining us today. We’re sorry about the technical glitch, but again, just to reiterate, strong, great quarter and we appreciate your support and we look forward to seeing you at the next earnings call and investor conferences this fall. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Physicians Realty Trust began 2016 where we left off last year, strong growth, strong balance sheet management and strong operational performance. During Q1 2016, we added $202 million of investments in their excellent medical office facilities, with the first year un-levered cash yield on these investments expected to be approximately 7.2%. Every one of these investments came through existing relationships mostly off-market consistent with our strategy and where we can continue to focus our time and attention for accretive private pay outpatient medical office facilities. These investments included our third acquisition affiliated with HonorHealth in Phoenix, our sixth, seventh and eighth acquisition anchored by a USPI affiliated and managed ambulatory surgery center, and our firth acquisition affiliated with Ascension Health. This Ascension Health affiliated transaction consisted of a particularly large complex of three buildings on the campus of Ascension’s St. Vincent’s Health in Birmingham, Alabama. The 224,000 square foot complex is anchored by St. Vincent’s and is 95% occupied. The first year un-levered yield from this investment is expected to be 7.3%. We are also excited to expand into the New Mexico market. These high-quality facilities are optimally located and occupied by best-in-class ophthalmology surgeons. We continue to source diligence and acquire excellent medical office and outpatient facilities affiliated with the best healthcare providers in the United States. As Jeff will discuss in a minute during the first quarter, we also enhanced our already excellent balance sheet with long-term, low cost unsecured investment grade debt as well as an equity raise in January and most recently in April. We have built an excellent team that can source, underwrite, diligence and close and then manage these outpatient medical office facilities, where the vast majority of healthcare services are delivered and will continue to be provided in greater proportions and that is outpatient relative to inpatient facilities. All of this hard work led to ending the first quarter of 2016 with approximately $1.9 billion in total real estate assets with year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 80%. The focus and leadership of our team is one of the reasons we were able to complete another quarter with high investment growth and high attention to operations, while at the same time underwriting, diligencing and papering what we believe to be one of the largest medical office investments directly with the healthcare system in the United States. Our recently announced investment in 51 medical office facilities, the value over $700 million owned by affiliates of Catholic Health Initiatives, or CHI. We believe the CHI medical office investment is one of the largest and most important medical office facility relationships ever established by a REIT directly with a major healthcare system. CHI has over 103 hospitals, 3,950 employed affiliated physicians, 95,000 employees. In 2015, these providers served over 60 million outpatient visitors and admitted 55,000 of inpatients, realizing more than $15 billion in annual revenue. We are honored and humbled to be selected to monetize these facilities and enhance CHI’s healthcare real estate service delivery platform through this partnership. Our investment provides substantial capital to CHI, but more importantly, we are hoping to free CHI executives, management physicians, provide us the staff to focus on the primary mission. We in turn will provide real estate capital management and strategic intellectual support to enhance their existing facilities, physician recruiting and outpatient strategies. Altogether, this relationship empowers CHI to enhance and provide greater access to care the community they serve. The total purchase price for these facilities will be approximately $687 million. We have also agreed over the course of times to invest $31 million into these facilities, which leads to a total investment of approximately $718 million. All totaled, we are acquiring just 15 medical office facilities containing more than 3 million square feet located in 10 states, with an average size just over 60,000 square feet. 20 of these facilities are off campus, 19 of these are 100% leased by CHI health system affiliate and one is anchored by a CHI affiliate. We estimate 14 of these are Section 603 assets representing about $16 million of first year NOI. 32 of the facilities are on campus, with those hospitals leasing approximately 64% of the on campus space. The overall portfolio was 94% leased and the weighted average lease term remaining is 8.6 years. In total, CHI hospitals lease and occupy approximately 2.6 million square feet of these facilities and they will sign new 10-year triple net leases at local market rates for their space, which will contain annual rent increases of 2.5%. The first year NOI from these CHI leases alone is $40 million or 93% of the first year in-place NOI of $43 million from this investment. Since the end of the quarter, we have also completed two acquisitions of three healthcare properties in two states containing in aggregate of 51,600 net leasable square feet. These investments total approximately 17.6 million at an average first year un-levered cash yield of 6.7%. We ended the quarter with 74% of our space either on the campus of a hospital or anchored by a health system and we are targeting that number to increase to at least 90% in the next two years. Upon completion of the CHI investment, we will be at approximately 83%. Physicians Realty Trust continues to focus on the long-term and to build this organization on a very solid foundation enabling us to deliver high growth, excellent returns and a value to our providers that will continue to fuel our growth and prosperity with the future of U.S. healthcare in well-located outpatient medical office facilities. With that, I will ask Jeff to review our financial results and balance sheet management. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. I will start with a brief review of our operating performance and then touch on our investment in capital activity year-to-date. We generated first quarter 2016 funds from operations, or FFO of $20.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Our normalized FFO which added back $3.4 million of acquisition expenses and some other small normalizing adjustments were $23.7 million. Normalized funds from operations per share, was $0.22, which represents the year-over-year increase of about 16% from the first quarter of 2015. Normalized funds available for distribution, or FAD, for the first quarter were approximately $21.1 million or $0.20 per diluted share an increase of 11% over the first quarter of 2015. NOI growth in our same-store pool of assets, which represents about half of our total portfolio was 2.1% year-over-year and was impacted positively by a 2.5% increase in rental revenues and negatively by a 130 basis point loss of occupancy and 3.7% increase in operating expenses. Also on the operational side, I would like to highlight our leasing retention rate which was far lower than typical this quarter at 16%. The largest driver of this reduced retention rate was our refusal to renew a 27,000 square foot lease on our newly acquired HonorHealth asset in Arizona. We instead entered into a 15-year triple net lease with the seller of the building have contemplated in our underwriting of the transaction. Leasing activity across our portfolio was positive overall with the net absorption of almost 3,000 square feet. Our investments for the first quarter 2016 totaled $202 million at an average stabilizing cap rate of 7.2% and we are sourced from existing relationships. This external growth was the primary driver of our 16% year-over-year FFO growth for the quarter. Approximately, $87 million worth of our investments closed in the last two weeks of March which limited their contribution to the first quarter operating results. Had all of our first quarter acquisitions closed on the first day of the quarter, we would have recognized approximately $2.3 million of additional cash NOI. Although the single asset acquisitions sourced from existing relationships continue to be our primary focus. We have entered into a moderating competitive environment, which gave us the opportunity in April of this year to enter into the largest ever monetization of medical office buildings from a healthcare system. Through this transaction with CHI, we are adding approximately $719 million to our asset base and have already funded it with about 65% equity leading to a deal that will be accretive to both NAV and FFO per share. CHI’s desire for a lasting partnership and the relatively limited competition from the usual market participants led to a much smaller portfolio premium than we typically deceived a great deal of this size. With CHI, we instantly achieve a critical mass in four new markets, enhance our existing portfolio and are able to foster relationship with the top tier healthcare system that we expect will continue to be one of the most important systems in the country going forward. The transaction is still expected to close in two tranches as certain assets require Vatican approval at the last condition to close. But we have been able to move additional assets into the first closing tranche. We now expect to close on up to 28 assets worth $335 million in the new two weeks, while the remaining 23 assets are expected to close prior to the end of the second quarter. One asset worth approximately $6 million was removed from the portfolio as we worked through our due diligence process. But we are intensely focused on closing the CHI transaction. We continue to see a steady stream of acquisition opportunities and remain comfortable with our existing acquisition guidance of $1 billion to $1.25 billion for the full year of 2016. Turning to equity capital markets activity, we have raised over $750 million so far this year, placing us in a strong capital position. Pro forma for close of the CHI transaction and the $17 million of additional closings announced so far in the second quarter, our debt to gross assets will be about 25%. On the debt side in January of this year we were able to issue $150 million of 4.5% private placement debt with the weighted average term of 12 years. As we look to the balance of the year, we will continue to match our long-term fixed rate leases to long-term fixed rate debt and expect to take advantage of one or more of the bank loan market, the private placement market and the public bond market to do so. Finally, our general and administrative costs for the first quarter were $4.1 million which was within our expectations. We continue to believe our full year G&A will range between $19 million to $21 million which includes some new hires brought on to help manage the CHI portfolio. Pro forma for the CHI transaction, our G&A to asset ratio will be below our 1% target. We remain focused on streamlining our overheads to provide immediate value to our shareholders, while continuing to build our infrastructure to accommodate our increased asset management responsibilities. As long as the capital markets remain open, we believe we can maintain our growth trajectory which will help provide superior total returns for our shareholders as we move through the rest of the year. With that I will turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. And I look forward to your questions. Mitchell?
Operator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kucera with Wunderlich Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Kucera: Hi guys. I appreciate the color. I wanted to talk about the competitive environment, you mentioned that that things sort of moderated which opened up the window for you guys to close on the Catholic Health transaction, but the cost of capital with some of your competitors, certainly on the public side has come back quite a bit, since back then, are you seeing them more now and if so does that leads you back, if you are doing more one-off transactions or are you continuing to see larger portfolio opportunities that where the pricing can still make sense for you?
John Thomas: Yes. Craig, it’s John and good afternoon. We are – the biggest buyer kind of out there in the space is still private equity and we are seeing probably more private equity than public buyers. And even some new existing recognized firms with the new – some new capital coming to the private equity side. And there still continues to be plenty of bank debt and other leverage for them to use. There are – we are still not seeing say the big three – I think all three have basically said they are net sellers or at least two of them have this year and there are some – there are several portfolios out in the market today that are floating around. And again I expect the private and some of those are REITs selling so my assumption is those will be private equity or the non-listed are coming back a little bit and we don’t see that much. So, we are going to continue our onesies, twoisies straight down in the middle of the fairway is business like we always have and to take advantage of good portfolios like to CHI which is outstanding from time to time. But we will continue to see our onesies, twosies that’s what this business is about.
Craig Kucera: Got it. And I appreciate the going over the guidance certainly in regard to acquisitions but you are closing this large transaction this quarter you usually close call it maybe 150 to 250 a quarter sort of onesies and twosies as you put it, is that seeing reasonable or are you guys more likely to focus on just getting the Catholic Health deal done this quarter and then kind of get back to ramping things up on the back half of the year?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, we have some other activity this quarter, but it won’t be size as we close on and operationalize and integrate the CHI facilities. Obviously, we want to do that extremely well and extremely impressive to our new physician partners and tenants and the hospital consults. We are very focused on that. But being in John’s lead, myself and others are still busy outsourcing new opportunities. So we feel good about the guidance and the second half of the year and if there will be some other opportunities out there, but you will see folks – we will be talking very close on integrating CHI for the next few months.
Craig Kucera: Got it. And one last one, I appreciate you guys noting the – given the color on the retention rates, can you talk about the occupancy on the same-store portfolio, it’s not as meaningful given the growth of the company, but it still was down quarter-over-quarter and certainly year-over-year are these tenants – can you give us some color on who these tenants were they leaving, are there kind of situations where the leaseback will be relatively brief or maybe more expensive?
John Thomas: The major contributor to that was a couple of leases in one building, the hospital system in that building was consolidating some sleep center and related pulmonary physician groups into another sleep center. And it’s one of our premier buildings done in Atlanta on Pill Hill and we feel very good about the repositioning that building and back filling that space. It just takes a little transition time. So that building should demand high end of the market rental rates and we are going to be very picky about how we reposition that space. Well, we do think we will good demand for it and we will get that back filled.
Craig Kucera: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Good afternoon guys.
John Thomas: Hi Juan.
Juan Sanabria: First question maybe just for Jeff, in terms of the balance sheet you kind of briefly touched on different opportunities on the debt side, what quantum and pricing are you seeing across the different avenues that are open to you?
Jeff Theiler: Sure. So I would say that the bank loan market on a term loan basis is pretty attractive right now, I would say if you are looking at a 7-year term loan you are probably – spreads of LIBOR just under 200 somewhere around there. So it swapped out, you are probably in the low 3% range if you were to fix the payment. On the private placement side we think we could probably execute a deal in line with what we did before, it not a little bit better and so that was a about 4.5% rate on the 10-year term if you average it all out. And then on the public bond market side that’s a little bit more difficult. We – certainly we would be looking to get an S&P rating before we did that investment grade rating which we feel hopeful that we can get this year. And so that market is a little bit more difficult to read particularly as an inaugural issuer. But I imagine it would be pretty close to the private placement market maybe a little bit more expensive.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then just on cap rates maybe a question for John, as you think about kind of the deals you were seeing in the pipeline today, what should we expect for the onesies and twosies as we go forward for the balance of the year, what you are seeing in the pipeline today?
John Thomas: Yes. I think cap rates generally they have got I will say stabilized with 6% being the highest quality opportunities. I think what we are saying right now is come more in that 6.5% range and that’s probably the right average for the rest of the year, the rest of the acquisitions. We had a good strong first quarter, some very high quality buildings mostly off market that large St. Vincent’s investment that bring resourced from his colleagues at ascension and positions in those buildings with an attractive 7.3%. So we still see good opportunities like that. But I think you will see 6.5% probably good average for the rest of the year.
Juan Sanabria: Just one last quick one for me and I think I know the answer, but any interest in any of the portfolios that maybe out there from some of the larger REITs?
John Thomas: We know some of the buildings. We know some of the providers, but I think we are very focused on the provider portfolios like CHI is our primary source of portfolio reduce.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks.
John Thomas: Can’t really talk too much about those portfolios, yet we are all under – indeed everybody out there looking out on their NDAs [ph], but we have kind of given you a good range of our guidance for the year.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Good afternoon, I just wanted to follow-up on the cap rate discussion a little bit, so the 6.5 cap for the rest of the year, is that a function of what’s happened in terms of market cap rates or is it partially a function of the asset you are targeting or is that for sale?
John Thomas: I would say primarily what they asked is they were targeting of the quality scale when we can so in bigger markets.
Jordan Sadler: Bigger assets, bigger markets kind of thing?
John Thomas: Yes. Bigger assets, bigger markets newer buildings.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
John Thomas: And that’s an average to be clear, so it’s kind of what we see the average working up for the rest of the year.
Jordan Sadler: And that’s I mean excluding CHI just looking in this up the stuff that basically closed in the first quarter, first year cash yield was 7.2, right, so it’s down 70 basis points and just making sure we are focused on the same things here.
John Thomas: We are so obviously like I said I just highlighted the big acquisition which had a influence on that 7% average with the St. Vincent given off-market transaction building the buildings [ph] in a associated way for many years of physicians and the developer of those buildings, so just we are able to get a very attractive price there. So…
Jordan Sadler: Right. Okay. And then, just in terms of the pipeline and the pacing you are seeing is there - are you seeing more products coming for sale, I mean obviously the REITs we talked about but what about the more traditional stuff you guys have been acquirers of?
John Thomas: Yes. Our pipeline is pretty robust.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then releasing spreads in the quarter any color you can offer around that I may have missed this?
Mark Theine: Yes. Jeff mentioned our attention this is Martin. Jeff mentioned our retention – this is Mark Theine, Jeff mentioned our retention rate earlier we had 9,000 square feet or so renewals it was 2 leases and those leases were both flat for this quarter. When you start with sorry same rate 2% increases on this.
Jordan Sadler: About 2%.
Mark Theine: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: That’s cash releasing spreads on the $9,.000.
Mark Theine: That’s right Jordan.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Is there a number you can offer or that may not be meaningful on the new leases, new leasing spreads or was that space vacant the whole time you owned it?
John Thomas: That was the vacant space. Okay.
Jordan Sadler: Just kind of multi-vacant and then just lastly trends and escalators that you are seeing were they still in the 2% to 3% range?
John Thomas: Yes. And again you are looking at CHI, $40 million of that NOI is going to escalate by lease but for 2.5% or so continue to move that average up.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then the last piece should be just any further thoughts or updated thoughts on 603 or are we sort of status quo for rate now in terms of assets you are targeting or just asset management?
John Thomas: Yes. So as I have mentioned in the comments the nice portion of the CHI assets were 603. CHI and McKesson on the opposite sides of changing or fighting that legislation or trying to amend that legislation in Washington but we don’t see that getting any traction. But they are making a big effort, haven’t seen any regulatory moves that CMS on it yet. And so again we are, we still see a lot of good 603 opportunities and things that are unattractive, so it should be attracted parts of our investments going forward.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks Jordan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Chad Vanacore: Good morning all. So just thinking about the timing of the closing the CHI acquisitions you moved some things around a little bit and some assumptions, how do you think that should change our FFO assumptions through the year and does that move anything a penny here or there?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. Chad, this is Jeff. I mean it will move a little bit right because we had initially anticipated kind of about a month – a month ago that we are going to be closing – pretty close to it. So I think it’s a bigger tranche upfront. So that’s the way I model is $335 million in mid-May the rest in mid-June and that will probably get you pretty close, these closing days fluctuate a little bit but that will get you pretty close.
Chad Vanacore: Alright. And then just looking at the same-store portfolio its cash NOI growth was pretty decent 2.1%, but occupancy was down and same store occupancy or same-store operating expense grew faster than same store revenues, can you add color on what’s going on in that same store pool?
John Thomas: It’s almost entirely attributable to those two leases we just talked about Chad. So operating expenses in with the lease gone, there is no – we have less tenants to allocate those operating expenses through. So there are some other smaller buckets but that’s the material part of that issue.
Jeff Theiler: Yes. I mean Chad this is Jeff. Just to add on some of the other little tiny pieces which we were a little bit bigger than normal with some garage work on the P3 Dunwoody building. And then there is a tax increase in pooling asset which is grossly so we end up taking that. But other than that it was pretty standard on the operating expense front.
Chad Vanacore: Alright and just a follow-up to that, what should we expect as far as like same-store NOI growth through the rest of 2016?
John Thomas: Yes. I think we have been kind of in the low 2% range. So I think if you average out its going to fluctuate like I always I reached you. But I think the average of that over the next year you will probably be around 2%.
Chad Vanacore: Alright. And then just one last question on the – on your ATM still around $70 million or so remaining in authorization?
John Thomas: Yes. We actually we terminated that ATM agreement so if you remember that ATM agreement was with NLB. We terminated that agreement. They were purchased by FBR. So, we will be looking at implementing a new ATM agreement at some point, clearly we just raised a bunch of equity, so we are not in a huge rush to do that but we will contemplate putting together a new ATM agreement as we go forward through 2016?
Chad Vanacore: Alright. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thanks. Good afternoon. On the CHI acquisition, can you just elaborate a little bit on their ration at this time, I realized there is $31 million of CapEx that probably helped out, but if you could just add some color to that?
John Thomas: Yes. I am John and good afternoon. CHI has gone – made a number of major acquisitions over the last 5 years. They expanded dramatically with the merger in logo with the dual self system there they acquired or merged with the St. Luke system down Houston. Expanded their operations in Omaha, it’s just that they have been growing very rapidly through kind of M&A and frankly needed to kind of replenish their balance sheet with cash. They have been working with the rating agencies on that as well. So, one of the factors and the rating agencies in noting as a factor for an upgrade was for them to kind of replenish the cash and the balance sheet. So it’s a good capital allocation and a good way to source capital at a good cost for them and prudentially hopefully improved their credit rating, they are an A. So there is strong credit and the hospital systems with a bit of actually tenants in our buildings we did – we had a third-party doing indicative rating analysis for us. And some of the systems are high Ds and some are better than the system rating away. So, we feel very good about the credit quality there.
John Kim: With M&A potentially picking up in the healthcare world, do you see other big health systems likely following with you?
John Thomas: We wouldn’t be surprised. We don’t see anything actionable right now. But we do expect it to be a trend level continue and we think we are well positioned with our relationships between again Deeni and myself and John Sweet and Governor Thompson to get phone calls routine from health system CEOs looking for sourcing of capital for M&A opportunities.
John Kim: Okay. And then can I ask you on some granularity on the private equity buyers that you are seeing as competition is sort of a largely encompassing term, but are these mostly high IRR opportunistic buyers or do you see them as sort of longer term owners?
John Thomas: I think IRR opportunistic using a lot of leverage using both secured senior debt and a lot of mezzanine debt that’s out there. So, that’s where we see the capital coming from. There has been one of the big name brand private equity shops that you would know has just funded a new core fund. So, with the kind of lower return, lower leverage expectations, but they are targeting kind of major market large kind of core type buildings that suggest may or may not be medical. But these two or three private funds that have been value-add slow growers over the years, but both have exploded and put a lot of capital in the last 18 months and we see them playing into at least one of them was actively involved in the CHI discussions and we would expect probably bid a lot higher than we do.
John Kim: Do you see the possibility of another MOB focused REITs in the public space?
John Thomas: I think we have plenty, Joe. I don’t know what they – I think everybody in the space is curious about what the excess strategy is at least one or two of these private funds, but the way their capital structure that looked like they are kind of structured themselves for a public exit, but we will see.
John Kim: Okay. And then my final question is on potential conversation opportunities, one of the office REITs this quarter signed a deal that’s the price of the market, I think to convert a modern Class A office building into basically medical center/hospital. Do you see further conversion opportunities either through your network or through some of your partners?
John Thomas: Yes, it’s not an unusual experience. Our Peachtree Dunwoody building was exactly that. It was a general office building that was sitting right next to the hospitals and the original owner didn’t want to lease to physicians and then it was empty and then second owner came in and leased it up to physicians in the hospitals on the market. So, it’s not an unusual phenomenon and usually a pretty low cost way to convert those buildings. I wouldn’t say we fear that business. I think we see opportunity in that was well.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, thanks guys and good afternoon. What’s your underwriting differential on your single versus multi-tenant MOBs? And then is that maybe less important than finding assets either on campus or affiliated with healthcare systems?
John Thomas: I wouldn’t say we have a canned underwriting differential there. I mean, I think you will probably see it be 25 to 50 basis points in practice, but we don’t go into an underwriting this was going to be 25 or 50 basis points left. We look at the whole tender roster, single tender obviously being kind of easier to think about, but so the 603 assets not exactly true, but are essentially tend to be the single tenant buildings and now with 603 and a lot of those have CON as well like the Louisville, Kentucky buildings with CHI. They tend to be more attractive and thus attract a higher price, lower cap rates though.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then some of these sellers out there, it’s their increasing willingness to accept OP unit deals or actually wanting unit deals, not only because of the tax advantages, but also just to participate in the growth trajectory of DOC?
John Thomas: Yes. So, our OPs are very – so, I mean we have a lot of physicians seeking us out for – to do OPU transactions. Lot of our physicians that have participated over the last three years have done very well with theirs and are great referral sources. So, frankly, we have probably more demand for OPUs than we want to put out, but it’s a very attractive tool. And it seems to be a couple of other REITs in the space offering OPUs that didn’t used to offer OPUs, I am not sure who started that trend.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, thanks for that. And then just – I guess just one more, everything sounds to be pretty good in the MOB sector rate now, I mean what’s the biggest headwind or potential risk to your story, is it new supply regulatory growing too fast just trying to get like any sense of the downside that we may not be thinking of here?
John Thomas: I think your raising hard economy slows down our growth as you got people to transition into more economically sensitive REITs, but even that will be good for our business and this would probably temporarily slowdown our growth. So, Jonathan, we focus on good underwriting selecting the best providers to work with, the best facilities to invest in and so we don’t see any headwinds right now. We are just very focused on operations and managing the buildings we own well and improving them and keeping them leased and leased up and continued growth, so…
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. Yes, now I was more so focused on your operating fundamentals than how the market changing, but thank you for the color. I appreciate it.
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Yes, thanks. John, could you describe the type of assets that you are going after now and how they are different versus the ones that you are underwriting 12 months ago? I mean specifically how are those properties different, are they I guess closer to campus now, are they new or they are bigger multi-tenant literally kind of the things you are looking for?
John Thomas: Yes, I think it’s a great question, Michael. I think we continue to focus – we have always had a goal of getting to 90% of the portfolio being either on the campus or affiliated with the health system. Nothing has really changed about our kind of underwriting views of off campus versus on campus other than what’s the – who is the anchor tenant, great health system or large physician group. And so we are still doing lots of physicians’ direct transactions with physicians and talked about the OPUs and then which I am going to be which continue to be a very attractive request from our physicians that we are buying from. But our cap rates are tiding down because of cost of capital is allowing us to access higher quality newer bigger buildings and again those at the highest prices are ones that are leased by credit rated health systems and in bigger markets. So, the CHI investment in Seattle is a great entrée into that market and we are already getting inbound calls and other opportunities for growth in that market. That’s an expensive market. So, yes, that’s where some of that kind of guidance to the lower ends, yes. We are still seeing lots of great opportunities in the El Paso, Texas world as well. So, I don’t think we will avoid those markets by any means, but when we can get newer, bigger health systems credits we are going to take advantage of it.
Michael Carroll: And then what are the size of the transactions that you consider your bread and butter right now, I am assuming the smaller ones are getting a little bit less interesting as you are getting bigger?
John Thomas: Yes, that’s right. And I mentioned the growth with USPI, the USPI kind of relationship those buildings tend to be smaller, so really have to be something special about it first to do something less than $10 million. When I say special, I mean a relationship that where our total portfolio of USPI affiliated buildings is getting pretty sizable, but those tend to be smaller on a unit by unit basis. So, $10 million is getting to be small. But again if it’s related to an existing possible or physician group relationship, we will work on those sized transactions, but people were tending – if they have seen a bigger…
Michael Carroll: And what about the ambulatory surgery centers, I know that you bought one I guess in the April, I mean is that a property type you still want to pursue and do those – are those big enough to really move the needle for you?
John Thomas: Again, that’s another one that’s related to USPI and the tenant there is Brookwood Hospital which is a tenant hospital in Birmingham, very profitable hospital in a great kind of suburban location. So, the physician who developed that MOB – or excuse me that ASC and operates that of this is one of the kind of world’s leading sports orthopedic surgeons. So, its part of the relationship there and it’s a great tenant, great credit and kind of adds on to an existing relationship.
Michael Carroll: Okay great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you. So just sticking to the topic of acquisitions, now that you have done a couple of larger deals and between the sale lease back any thoughts or color you can give us as to just how – is there some thought process and how larger you would actually like to be and given the current G&A load what sort of volume could you do without meaningfully increasing the G&A?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. I think we have scaled pretty well in anticipation of closing CHI which has obviously a lot of total assets. We continue to maintain 1% or loss of assets with our goal for G&A. And I will let Jeff speak to that a little bit further, but the – we can really see a runway of $200 million to $250 million of acquisitions a quarter and feel good about that guidance going forward into next year. So Vikram as long as our cost of capital makes sense with the asset quality that’s available and we will continue to grow and really don’t have any breaks on it. But setting goals for next year will kind of come out of next the next couple of months – next couple of quarters and see where we end of the year and where the cost of capital is and what the market environment has been. We are going to continue to grow and be the leader in this space.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And then I apologize if you touched on this I joined a bit late. Just on the CHI portfolio are there parts of it that you could to sell, do you have any targets in mind, still how much?
Jeff Theiler: Yes. That’s a great question. So, we have no intentions to sell any of the buildings we bought. On the other hand we don’t have any restrictions there are – some of the – many of the buildings are on rally. So we will work closely with CHI if and when we ever decide to sell anything, but we are not prohibited from doing that. We have complete flexibility there. But there are some brand new buildings and there are some older buildings that some of that CapEx that we need to make is going to go into some of the older buildings. So overtime you would expect out of any large portfolio to transition some of those. So those are – some of the buildings are smaller and could be turned down, replace with better newer facility. So no plans or tension you do anything but you should expect over the next couple of years did you see some mortgage positions as we grow and no plan to do that now.
Vikram Malhotra: So it sounds like some of your peers were interested in parts of the portfolio and just based on my conversations willing to pay probably 50 basis points for the lower cap rate for some of that. So it could be some interesting recycling opportunities for you. Just last one, on the Section 602 assets, maybe if you could clarify, I am a bit confused as to whether the grandfathering actually lies with the landlord or with the tenant and what happens when that tenant sites to move somewhere else?
John Thomas: That’s yet to be decided to see a mouthful amount issue regulations. But as the law is written and based upon historical practice with CMS as they interrupt grandfathering typically that stays that is addressed specific with that provider as applied for and got the reimbursement status. So the role should be different but approximately we don’t anticipate it. Within the CHR portfolio I mentioned we have a couple of 603 assets there that are also see assets there is really two regulatory kind of restrictions they make those buildings very sticky. And those are very volume very profitable facilities for them. So we expect long-term that grandfathering and CON makes those buildings very long-term attractive holds for us.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. Thanks guys. Congrats on a strong quarter.
John Thomas: Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr John Thomas for any closing remarks.
John Thomas: We appreciate all of the support. Just looking at our stock we purchased, I think we are bouncing around somewhere all-time high as we appreciate the opportunity to do that for you and continued to work with you and our shareholders and your clients. So thank you for joining the call today. And we look forward to any follow-up questions you may have. This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad, and good morning. 2015 was a landmark year for Physicians Realty Trust and we finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter. Just in case you didn’t noticed, we delivered an almost 8% total shareholder return in 2015 including dividends, comparing favorably to the S&P 500 which had a total return of 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial with a loss of 2.3% and the Healthcare sector within the SNL US REIT index which lost 7.3%. It’s a volatile in the capital markets but we are pleased with the relative performance of our stock and dividends as we continue to execute on our business plan and build an excellent long-term company for you. And the other investors have recognized that excellence. Thank you. During 2015, we added $841 million of investments in excellent medical office facilities, more than doubling our total portfolio during the year with the first year unlevered cash yield on these investments expected to be approximately 6.92%. These investments included 66 acquisitions, and $22 million of mezzanine loans, all of which we believe to be strategically valuable medical office out-patient medical office facilities.  Since we went public, we have averaged just over one acquisition per week and believe, we’ll have the opportunity to continue that pace for the foreseeable future. Our ability to underwrite, diligence, and close an acquisition per week is due to our highly refined process routine where every facility, tenant and market get the same consistent evaluations while effectively building our relationship with our tenants and clients during the process.  This is the DOC way and leads a great tenant satisfaction and referrals to other hospitals and physicians who would rather work with us due to our professionalism, healthcare knowledge and attention to customer service.  All this hard work led us to enabling – led us to ending 2015 with approximately $1.7 billion in total real estate assets and our annual revenues grew year-over-year by 143%. During the fourth quarter, we completed $152.8 million of investment activity including 11 property acquisitions in 11 states, totaling $142 million and 494,000 square feet and loan investments of $10.2 million.  The average first year unlevered cash yield on these investments is expected to be approximately 6.7%. Since our January 19, 2016 offering and disclosures, we have completed seven acquisitions of seven healthcare properties containing an aggregate of 323,000 net leasable square feet. These investments total approximately $104.4 million and an average first year unlevered cash yield of 7.35%. During our offering in January, we announced purchase agreements totaling $99.6 million and $167.4 million of acquisitions under letter of intent. We have completed $90.5 million of those acquisitions and we continue to believe most, if not all of those pending investments will close, once we complete due diligence and the seller satisfy their continuities.  Medical office and out-patient care facilities are the defensive recession resilient real estate and investors continue to understand that more and more. DOC’s team is the most qualified team for sourcing, underwriting, acquiring and managing this most desirable real estate in any economic cycle, but especially now.  Investors particularly appreciate our industry-leading occupancy of almost 96%, with an average lease of almost nine years and our clients refer other opportunities to us routinely. We continue to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio and are very excited about the opportunities we see in front of us in 2016.  We ended the year with 74% of our space either on the campus of a hospital or anchored by a health system and we are targeting that number to increase to at least 90% in the next two years. Like the IMS facilities we acquired in Phoenix during 2015, we continue to seek out larger, newer medical office facilities anchored by high-quality health systems and physician groups both on and off-campus. Our average property size has grown to 38,400 square feet and we expect that average to still grow, but not forsaking our high quality providers who practice in smaller more efficient clinical settings where appropriate.  In 2015, Congress in the White House in bipartisan legislation passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Section 603 of that law lowers Medicare reimbursement for future hospital outpatient departments located more than 205 yards from the hospital.  While this legislation certainly benefits our on-campus facilities with vacancy for location of future HOPDs, Congress didn’t pass this law to incentivize hospital to place services on the campus, but rather intended to further Congressional policy to pay for care in the lowest cost setting clinically appropriate to that care.  Congress intends to save $9 billion by this legislation over the next ten years, which means they expect the care to be provided in convenient locations for the physicians and patients away from hospital campuses. The American Hospital Association and their members recognize this as well as they are fighting hard to repeal this legislation, so that they can place services in locations convenient to their patients and physicians and recognize that it’s not always on the campus of a hospital.  We recently discussed this legislation with a Chief Medical Officer of one of our most important clients, specifically, section 603’s impact on strategic outpatient physician strategy this sophisticated hospital organization has developed. The answer was very revealing. This hospital system like meaning it’s actively acquiring physician practices and very focused on its off-campus outpatient strategy is the current and future of healthcare service delivery.  This physician executive said, and I quote “we have found that trying move physicians from Medicare Part B physician office REITs to Part A hospital outpatient departments, results from the loss of more than 50% of their patients. In HOPD clinics, the patients have substantially higher co-pays and deductibles and they seek other options as the service is the same, but they have substantially higher out of pocket cost.  The implication of these comments in light – hospital recognize what they may gain in rates then may lose substantially more in volume. Hospitals are focused on placing physicians and hospital outpatient services in the best possible locations for access and volume.  Similarly, HR2895, a bipartisan bill sponsored call the Medicare Patient Access to cancer treatment act of 2015, seeks to enhance Medicare reimbursement for physician practices providing cancer care in lower cost settings and will pay for the incentive by further lowering the reimbursement to HOPDs. The AHA is also fighting this legislation.  We support all our clinical providers in advancing their efforts for fair and adequate reimbursement for their services. Our belief is that patients and physicians, that is consumers and consumers will ultimately drive the optimal location for their healthcare services and today that means services that can be provided in the most convenient location will be the ultimate real estate location for investment.  The answer is clear, government commercial payers, patients and even physicians want all care that can’t be provided in all patient settings to be provided in the lowest cost environment that is possible.  Physicians Realty Trust’s strategy and focus is to invest where everyone wants the care to be provided including those who pay for that care. That is outpatient medical office. As US healthcare economy grows from $3 trillion to $5 trillion over the next eight years, the wave in transition of care out of the hospital and into lower cost outpatient medical office facilities is not only inevitable it is imperative.  In the mean time, we have a significant number of 603 assets benefiting from a grandfather reimbursement status and we have more in the pipeline. These assets have the dual benefit of being in a location that maximizes patient flow and convenience that is customer satisfaction, as well as physician efficiency while also benefiting from higher Medicare reimbursement. We have a strong belief that the hospital locate at these services and these locations primarily for patient volumes and convenience and we’ll continue to make that a priority and we’ll be reluctant to move out of these locations and jeopardize both patient physician convenience, and the higher Medicare HOPD where reimbursement Congress protected for them.  Before I ask Jeff to review our financial results, I would like to commend our Senior Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer, John Lucey, Laurie Baker and their entire team and our entire team that worked so hard in 2015 to build our internal controls and SOX compliance structures. The 10-K we filed for 2015 is the first year-over-year subject to SOX 404 D requirements and that is a monumental task.  Excellent and transparent reporting is our commitment to you, and we couldn’t do it without DOC eligible team that John has build and leads. Thank you, John.  We believe we are well on our way to continue delivering our strong 2015 performance into 2016 and beyond. We are building a great company in piece-by-piece. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. We finished the year with a strong quarter of operations. Our fourth quarter 2015 funds from operations or FFO were $19.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Our normalized FFO, which added back $3.1 million of acquisition expenses and some other small normalizing adjustments were $22.7 million. Normalized funds from operations per share was $0.26, which represents a year-over-year increase of 18% from the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year 2015, normalized FFO per share was $0.92 representing growth of 31% over the full year 2014. Normalized funds available for distribution or FAD for the fourth quarter were approximately $21.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share an increase of 20% over the fourth quarter 2014. Our funds available for distribution are helped by the fact that our average lease term is nine years, which limits the amount of tenant improvements and leasing commissions required to generate that figure. We achieved record investment results in 2015 adding $841 million of healthcare investments which was at the higher end of our guidance of $700 million to $900 million of overall investments for the year. 90% of our 2015 investments were in medical office buildings, 7% in specialty hospitals, and 3% were Mezzanine loan investments which are designed to provide future acquisition opportunities.  We are focused and will continue to focus on the medical office building segment of the healthcare asset spectrum which we believe will generate superior risk-adjusted returns. 86% of the cash NOI generated by our portfolio is from medical office buildings and we would expect that percentage to continue to grow in 2016. The investments this quarter totaled $153 million at an average first year cash yield of 6.7%. If we had acquired all of our fourth quarter acquisitions at the beginning of the quarter, they would have contributed an additional $1.2 million of cash NOI to our portfolio.  As a reminder, the National Medical Office Building which we acquired in the fourth quarter for $45 million is 100% leased but tenants don’t take occupancy until June of 2016. Once occupied, our Nashville MOB will generate cash NOI of $700,000 per quarter.  As John mentioned, we have completed $106 million of investments year-to-date in 2016 and are making good progress toward closing the rest of the new transactions we announced in January. It is an unusual time for medical office building investment. Non-traded healthcare REITs continue to be negatively impacted by the RP fallout and increased regulatory scrutiny by the SEC.  Medical Office Building focus private equity funds have a relatively limited pool of capital and have exhausted much of that in the past year with portfolio purchases.  Finally, many of the larger diversified REITs are reluctant to pursue large-scale investment activity with the recent declines in their share price related to negative perception around the senior housing and skilled nursing sectors.  Our stock price on the other hand has performed relatively well in 2015, and was one of the few healthcare REITs that generated positive total returns for its shareholders. Based on these factors, and the pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities we see in front of us, we believe the overall investment environment for 2016 is even better than last year and we remain comfortable with our investment guidance of $750 million to $1 billion for the year.  We elected to strengthen our balance sheet with a follow-on equity offering of $321 million in January at favorable pricing in order to reduce our debt outstanding and put us in the best possible position to execute on our investment pipeline.  We had another important financial milestone in January of 2016 as we were able to issue $150 million of long-term debt at investment-grade rates in the private market split into four different tranches, the seven year tranche, a 10-year tranche, a 12 year tranche and a 15 year tranche.  The blended maturity of the debt was just under 12 years with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. Both the debt and equity markets were extremely challenging at the beginning of 2016, and we were pleased with the favorable results of those offerings and appreciate the support from our investors.  To summarize the impact of all the capital changes following the quarter end, pro forma for the $321 million equity offering in January, the terming out of a $150 million of debt in the private placement market and the acquisitions announced year-to-date, our current debt-to-gross assets is approximately 15%.  We believe we are starting 2016 in a strong capital position with low debt and $73.5 million remaining on our existing ATM program. Our portfolio continues to perform to our expectations.  At the end of the year, it was 96% leased and the 62 property same-store pool which encompasses 100% of the properties we have owned for over one year generated year-over-year NOI growth of 2.2% driven primarily by contractual rent increases.  Finally, our general and administrative costs for the fourth quarter were $3.5 million, which brought full year G&A expense to $14.9 million within the range we had estimated at the beginning of the year. This met our target of reducing overall G&A to less than 1% of asset value.  As we look into 2016, we estimate our overall G&A expense will stay in that less than 1% of asset value target range for the year, at least scale up the platform for another year of growth.  With that, I’ll turn it back over to John. 
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. We look forward to responding to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Good morning guys. 
John Thomas: Hey, Juan. 
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Juan.
Juan Sanabria: I was just hoping if you could give us a little bit more color on the pricing you are expecting on acquisitions for the year in terms of the deal pipeline, you are saying – mentioning less competition from the non-traded REITs and some of the bigger guys, but it seems that you are wanting to bigger assets and move up the quality spectrum. So just how you are thinking about pricing for the year?
John Thomas: Yes, it’s a great question. I think the deals we announced in the first part of the year is 7.35%, Juan, as you recall, we always report kind of first year cash yield that we expect. I think overall though, for the year, it’s for us, it’s going to continue to tie in a little bit for the factors that you mentioned kind of moving up the quality scale and bigger markets, bigger buildings. So, probably 6.5% to 7%, we historically said 6.5% to 7.5%. We still see some higher yielding opportunities, but I think that overall average is going to move down to that blended number of 6.5% to 7%. 
Juan Sanabria: And are you seeing cap rates stabilize? Any signs if they may head up with some of the big REITs out of the market or what are you seeing overall?
John Thomas: You know, I mean, call it the big guys, the big three and others is kind of out of the market, but there is still plenty of private equity and plenty of data out there. So, while the players have changed a little bit over the last 18 months, there is still plenty of competition for the building. So, I would say they have stabilized. There is less competition or less buyers, but there is also plenty of buyers and plenty of liquidity and just the defensive nature people recognizing that had really attracted a lot more capital from many sources. 
Juan Sanabria: Great, and then, maybe for Jeff, on the same-store NOI outlook as we think about 2016. What kind of range can you give us at all if you can or any pressure on expenses? And if you could remind us what percentage of your portfolio is internally managed? 
Jeff Theiler: Sure, I’ll actually turn it over to Mark to answer this question. Mark?
Mark Theine: Sure, Juan, heavy into the question. On the same-store for 2016, we projected being in that 2.5% range. As you know, our contractual rent increases are regularly 2% to 3% on average. So I think we’ll be kind of right in the middle of that range there for 2016. And, as it relates to property management, we are about 96% internally managed on everything we oversee. 
Juan Sanabria: Great, thanks guys. 
John Thomas: Thanks, Juan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Chad Vanacore: Hey, good morning all. 
John Thomas: Hey, Chad. 
Chad Vanacore: So, John, you mentioned that, that you expect to get to into the 90% of on-campus MOBs in your portfolio. So what should we expect in terms of off-campus versus on-campus in the pipeline right now?
John Thomas: I think, again, to be clear, it’s 90% on-campus or anchored by a health system, but we are just very focused on kind of the larger physician groups and the larger health systems and big part of my comments and quote and clear my presentation was, hospitals are looking for the most strategic opportunity and physician groups are looking most strategic locations of their facilities and that’s not always on-campus and reimbursement and payers are recognizing that as well, and frankly trying to incent the care to be provided in lower cost settings whether that be on or off-campus. So, I think it just continues to be a nice blend of both and the IMS portfolio which I highlighted and we closed on last – third quarter last year, three of those were big on-campus buildings but one was off-campus in a very strategic location but anchored by that health system in a – or excuse me, anchored by the IMS group in a large surgery center that’s tied to be Brazo health system out there, so. 
Chad Vanacore: Okay, and then, just thinking about the other side of your portfolio, other than MOBs, what’s your appetite for specialty hospitals and surgical centers. 
John Thomas: Pretty limited. We could close on the Great Fall Surgical Center in the first quarter earlier this year. That – as I look at over the year, that maybe the only one we did this year. So you could – you may see one or two, but we are very focused on these pure play medical office buildings. 
Chad Vanacore: All right, and then, just what, can you remind me what the overall pipeline size is and then, I think you had mentioned at some point you had some more small portfolios of - what size are those in the pipeline? 
John Thomas: Yes, so we – with our offering and we announced about less than $215 million of acquisitions on our contract or letters of intent and we tend to kind of maintain that kind of bucket. So, I think we are looking the second and third quarter opportunities right now and we expect to close on just about everything we announced earlier this year. So, pipeline continues to be robust and last opportunities to pick and choose from. 
Chad Vanacore: Okay, still looking to some $20 million, $30 million small portfolios in there?
John Thomas: And I’d say $20 million to $30 buildings, but, not a lot of – we tend to grow one building, two buildings at a time and that’s what sellers tend to own. So, that’s where we focus. 
Chad Vanacore: All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Thomas: Yes, thanks, John. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Hey, John can you give us some color on the competitive landscape in the investment market today and how has it changed over the past few quarters? I know you indicated that the larger guys and the non-traded guys have kind of dropped off a little bit, but those guys won’t remain competition truthfully, right?
John Thomas: Yes, we always – I know that’s not what you want to hear, but 100% of everything we’ve done this year with off-market. So, we tend to not have a lot of competition, most of the buildings that we are acquiring. But the landscape has changed. Two years ago, we saw, when we did see somebody with the non-listed REITs more often the non, last year, and I’d say this year, it’s been more private equity-driven investors than anything else. So, we tend to bump in our other – our pure play peers and try to distinguish ourselves on service and hopefully get a better price than they do, but they win their fair share as well. So, we are not seeing the big three really at all, and frankly, rarely have bumped into them in our life of this company. 
Michael Carroll : Okay. And I know this is kind of also – one asked earlier, but, I mean, with the volatility in the capital markets, I mean with your off-market transactions, have you been pushing cap rates a little bit higher just due to the increased volatility or has that not really changed at all?
John Thomas: No, I think so, I mean, I think, first quarter the deals we’ve announced so far reflects that and again, with – the off-market nature of that, but, I think the things in our near-term pipeline, I think the cap rate is better than it was a year ago. But, our blended average is coming down kind of our historic norms just because of the ability to access more newer bigger anchored health system buildings, so.
Michael Carroll : Okay. And then thanks for your comments on – I guess, the changes potentially occurred – could occur with the section 603 assets. I guess with the passage or the enactment of that, I guess, legislation, has that changed your underwriting and all? Are you looking at anything different right now?
John Thomas: I think, it’s a factor to consider. So, the on-campus buildings that have vacancy, again, if it’s got vacancy there is some incentive to – for the hospitals to look at that space versus going off-campus. And as I said, I mean, we are having this conversation with our client, he is the Chief Medical Officer of the hospital system and he said, it’s really not driving their ultimate decision-making, it’s ultimately patient access and convenience and they found that they have lost patients by trying to push them into an HOPD reimbursement model in the past. So, we tend to listen to our clients and then, kind of follow where they think was the best location for the services.
Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. 
John Thomas: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: The next question is from Craig Kucera from Wunderlich. Please go ahead.
Craig Kucera : Hey, good morning guys. Appreciate you taking the call. I know you breakout rent coverage for hospitals and L tax in the 3.5 to 4 times range. But can you give us a sense of where the overall portfolio would be for rent coverage?
John Thomas: It would be - in the physician groups, we get financials for the larger groups, but a lot of the smaller onesie twosie physicians, they are not audited or anything like that. The bigger groups tend to be, but, I mean, it would be 5 to 10 kind of on a blended across the platform, Craig. So it’s very strong – really across, I know, one group we always talk about a lot has almost 50 times coverage. So that’s kind of – these numbers get a little irrational or a little pricy at times, but and that’s the benefit of these private pay kind of MOB investment model which is – seems to 5% to 6% of their kind of the overhead, the rent and that should get these large drivers of coverage. 
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Craig, so unlike, as skilled nursing or other types of – some other types of healthcare asset classes, the rent is a pretty small part of the overall expense structure for a medical office building tenant. 
Craig Kucera : Got it. Can you give us some color on the pipeline as it relates to potential Operator unit issuance and there is a drop in maybe the non-traded and larger REIT competition? Does that necessarily help you there or are they not really as focused on that, on a net seller base?
John Thomas: Yes, it’s – we had that conversation with most of our seller – particularly with some private physician group or a private developer. The – so, you will continue to see it a handful. It’s been kind of a strategic advantage for us. Most of the big three don’t use it as a tool very often and the non-listed REITs, to my knowledge, I have always seen it happen once or twice. So it’s been fairly limited. So, you will continue to see some, but right now, we are really trying to add people to our cash purchase. 
Craig Kucera : Got it. And one more, just wanted to talk about the mezzanine size of the business. Are you seeing any pick up in opportunity to invest in that segment or is it still just sort of – as things have been going in the past? 
John Thomas: Yes, we see opportunity, but we are pretty stingy about where we do those loans as we are not out shopping for paper. It’s really a structuring tool and particularly with developers who are either in the process of structuring or kind of post-construction and they are wanting to continue to hold the asset, but we had some kind of hope into it long-term when they do a recap. So, see some opportunities out there, the hospital anchored development is – I’d say picking up and when they are using private developers for that, most of the national ones we have great relationships with. We have opportunities to get involved in that on a limited basis, but usually through the mezzanine loan structure and some kind of optionality when there is been a stability if we are interested in buying at that time, so. 
Craig Kucera : Okay, great. I’ll hop back in the queue. 
John Thomas: Yes. 
Jeff Theiler: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler : Thanks, and good morning. A question regarding 603, so you’ve had some time to process it another 90 days or so and I am just curious, vis-à-vis your comments and discussions with tenants. Is this – has there been any change in terms of target assets for you all as it relates to 603 either as it relates to prospective underwriting or the existing portfolio?
John Thomas: It’s hard to say it’s been a change, but it’s just certainly a factor that we consider. I mentioned in my comments, we have a number of 603 assets in our pipeline and in a couple of the cases I am referencing there is also CON type of the building. So, an off-campus where the hospital essentially can’t move, because that are CON and they can’t move or reluctant to move out of that building because they are getting that higher HOPD reimbursement that’s grandfather tends to be pretty attractive us. It’s a very sticky building, very sticky tenant providing outpatient services which is going to continue to drive the healthcare dollars. So, I would – I’d say it’s a factor we consider, but it’s – I don’t think it’s changed kind of ultimately what we are looking for which is great health system in large physician group anchored building. That said, if it’s on-campus building and it’s got some vacancy there is certainly an enhancement to kind of more opportunity to lease that vacant space with the hospital now being forced to consider HOPD reimbursement only being available feature on-campus facility, so, helpful, but I wouldn’t say change, it’s just a factor and we are talking to every hospital that we talk to, or a physician group that’s working with hospitals around and trying to get a good handle on who is taking advantage of HOPD and who is not the higher reimbursement. 
Jordan Sadler : Has there been any clarification on the determination of whether or not it’s the classification or grandfathering ties to the tenant versus the size?
John Thomas: Yes, there has not been. The AHA is working hard to at a minimum, expand the grandfathering to projects that are under development. But, I think if the AHA had it’s brothers that would just repeal the section altogether and – but there hasn’t been any real clarification around them. The law is pretty clear written, but as you mentioned it’s - it will be up to CMS to define further define what’s eligible to be grandfather and whether or not you can actually move that status. Historically, sometimes you can and sometimes you can’t, again we are taking that into consideration, but and keeping our eye on – out for clarifications. 
Jordan Sadler : Okay, and then, lastly, on 603, I mean, I missed that, have you guys been able to assess what percentage of the portfolio is now 603 or falls within sort of the writing of the law? 
John Thomas: Yes, we’ve got pretty good transparency on that in our investor presentation. If you look at that, it’s probably the best way to answer your question, the one-on-one line.
Jordan Sadler : Okay, and is that in terms of on-campus, will that ultimately refine your definition of an on-campus or proximate to campus asset?
John Thomas: Well, we joke that Deeni and John Sweet now carry a tape measure around what this see if it’s within 250 yards of the hospital, but, it’s – I applied full ball out here, but pretty good feel for how long 100 yards is and can be able to buy. [Multiple Speakers] I mean, smart, but I guess, the on-campus buildings that they have vacancy, it’s just creates one more opportunity for leasing the space, so. 
Jordan Sadler : All right, thanks guys. 
John Thomas: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: The next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Can you provide us an update on the percentage of your portfolio that on-campus versus off-campus affiliated? And then, maybe also the cap rate differential that’s between the two?
John Thomas: If you look at just the on-campus it’s a little over 50%. Again, I think the more relevant is – I appreciate the question, but we think the more relevant is what’s health system anchored and that number is in the high 70s moving to 90 and that’s kind of how we focus on that definition. So, on the cap rate difference, I mean, it’s hard to say, so many things influence cap rate, but just purely being on-campus or off-campus, again, we tend to buy – when we are buying off-campus its health system or physician group anchored and there lot of capital chasing of that, that there maybe fewer buyers, but there is still plenty of capital chasing of benefits. So, 25 basis points on average, but maybe, but I wouldn’t say there is a big spread from a quality perspective and against the buildings we are buying.
John Kim: And to get your 90% target within two years, is that’s solely through acquisitions or you also looking to – some of your off-campus assets?
John Thomas: No, we don’t have any plans to – we don’t have any near-term plans to selling, but I think it’s driving through acquisitions and again we’ve got some great relationships with some developers that are – have some good product coming down the line, we think we have the opportunity to acquire those assets as well and those – the development we have our eyes on are health system anchored tend to be a 100% pre-leased before they are ever built. So, to be very clear, we are not funding those developments, but we have some expectations that we’ll have good opportunities to acquire those developments. 
John Kim: Okay, I may have missed this, but, can you provide the releasing spreads during the quarter and maybe the year on a cash and GAAP basis?
Jeff Theiler: It’s about 2% 
Mark Theine: 2.1%
Jeff Theiler: So, during the quarter, we had 43,000 square feet renew – or excuse me held for renewal and 33,000 of those renewed 78% retention and the ones that renewed were up 2.1%. 
John Kim: And that’s cash?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, that’s cash. 
John Kim: And then finally on 603, John, you mentioned that the American Hospital Association is looking to repeal the legislation on this. Can you maybe provide an handicap of how long you think that may take?
John Thomas: Not expected to – Congress is actually working 111 days this year. So, there is no expectation of any meaningful legislation. There is nothing they have to do this year after the Bipartisan Budget Act. So, fairly minimal chances this year. Tell me who wins the Presidency and I’ll tell you what the chances are next year, so. 
John Kim: So, what side would be more adaptable changes?
John Thomas: I am not going to answer that question. No to be - in all sincerity, I think, no matter who wins the Presidency, I mean, is the healthcare policy gets tweaked, that will be by anybody, that would be the AHA’s chance to kind of claw some of that back if not all of it.
John Kim: Okay, got it. Thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you for taking the questions. So, just going back to your acquisitions, I am just trying to – if you can give us some more color on how you are thinking about these larger market as a process that you would probably started a year-and-a-half, two years ago, on the one hand, competition maybe a little lighter, but pricing, cap rates are still stickier, maybe moving a little bit, but given all the volatility in the markets, I am just trying to figure out is this the right time to kind of make that move and what would maybe make you say, hey, we want to pause from going to these larger markets and maybe stick to what we’ve done historically? 
John Thomas: Vikram, that’s a great question. I think it’s an evolution. So the larger markets, we’ve been fortunate to kind of make a couple of big acquisitions to move into the Minneapolis market than the large transaction on the Phoenix which is already having some – I’ll say some organic growth opportunities coming out of that IMS and the hospital systems relationships we developed out there through that transaction. So, it’s an evolution, but we are not forsaking some of the smaller markets and high coverage and working with great physician groups as well. So, I think it’s – we looked at opportunities across the spectrum and once we are in a market, we tend to have the opportunity to grow more like in Minneapolis, like in Phoenix, Atlanta and Columbus. Columbus, Ohio is a market we continue to find lots of great opportunity and that’s a booming market. But, some of those – some of the opportunities, say in Columbus tend to be in the kind of the surrounding communities as well where there is less competition kind of back to your point about kind of staying in the secondary market. 
Vikram Malhotra: And then just given that some these could be lumpy, are you targeting every quarter for there to be a mix or could it be one quarter your more secondary market heavy and then, the other quarter to the opposite?
John Thomas: I wouldn’t say we are targeting at all. I mean, we are targeting great physician groups and hospital systems and evaluating the market where the building is located. So, as you said it’s lumpy, but we continue to have plenty of opportunity to pick and choose from and some sellers are looking at second and third quarter for some reason and other, we kind of just tend to just manage the deal flow that way. 
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, and then just maybe shifting to sort of your watch list of the performance of certain hospitals, given what we have seen in the public markets, any insight maybe given your exposure to community or any of the other hospitals? Any insight from what the hospitals are thinking in terms of expansion or even maybe a closure or I shouldn’t say closures, but maybe just a pause?
John Thomas: Yes, I mean, the whole post – the world obviously feeling a lot of cost pressures right now, I guess, probably the most specific issue in that world. We have three L tags that’d be great. The L tag industry is going through a transition – they’ve been going through it for this year in particular it kind of follow-up impact of the patient criteria legislation and in rules which – and the evolution of that business. So – but, Life Care which is our only tenant in that space is doing fine, but it’s can be a transition year as they move into a new reimbursement scheme. So, I don’t think any of our hospitals, specific hospitals we are working with. We don’t have any concerns with them specifically and obviously, on the big systems, tenant had announced kind of a big loss for the year, but they also announced, it’s part of the subset of that, their outpatient business was very strong. That outpatient business was in large part they are USPI which is great client of ours and we are very pleased with the coverage of our USPI which is now tenant facility. So, Mark, anything else jump out for you? In Atlanta, Northside Hospital that’s one of our bigger client and that market is - continues to grow and expand as that market continues to – or at least they, with a lot of competition, they tend to be aggressively moving into new markets and Northside has several sponsored new developments ongoing right now.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, this is the last one. Jeff, this is maybe for you. In terms of funding the additional acquisitions, or the future acquisitions, Jeff, you got preference for equity versus debt? I know, you’ve in the past talked about maybe coming out some more debt, but if you could just maybe update us on your plans?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, absolutely, Vikram. Yes, I mean, I think we are currently 15% at the assets now. We’d expect the majority of acquisitions to be funded primarily with debt going forward at least in the near-term. I guess, that always depends on the lumpiness of the acquisitions et cetera and we have the ATM program as well that we could utilize if we thought it was necessary. But, I think – over the year, we would expect to increase that leverage – in fact to a more normalized level and certainly a long-term debt issuance this year is another target of ours. So, we probably would be looking at that, call it mid-year-ish. 
Vikram Malhotra: Okay and just – moving the data, would that be more close to 30%?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I mean, I think that’s kind of more inline with what we’ve – where we’ve historically been.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator: The next question is from Dan Altscher with FBR. Please go ahead.
Daniel Altscher: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. The thing about where the stock has traveled up to and some of maybe the competition in the space having a step back. Do you think maybe the hurdle rate has changed at all for what you are seeing now on asset bases or maybe on a levered base, I know you talked about 6.5% to 7% being kind of the average. But has your hurdle rate maybe changed at all the close competition?
Jeff Theiler: Well, I mean, I think our hurdle rate changes, Dan, to the extent your cost of equity is decreasing with our increasing share price, which it is and along the debt lines, I think we had a pretty good execution there in January of 4.5%. So, as we look at those factors, I mean, certainly, I think our cost to capital is coming down. I mean, the competition, I guess, I’ll let John speak to it, but my view is, some of the higher quality assets really extremely bid before, as you had a bunch of different players going after them, I think there is a little bit lightening up on that side of it. So we see value – a little bit more value there perhaps than we did a year ago as well as seeing value in the assets in the secondary markets that we’ve also historically participated in. 
John Thomas: Yes, Dan, the only thing I had to add to that is, two years ago when we started the company, we had $100 million of assets and people tended to be nervous about signing a letter of intent with – in questioning our ability to close, now that we’ve closed an acquisition a week for nearly two years now and we are approaching $2 billion in assets and Jeff’s management of the balance sheet, we don’t have that issue anymore. So, it’s just gave opening – the reputation and the growth is just opening up more and more doors for us and for sellers to be willing to work with us and then, we tend to find those sellers like the large physician groups where we can to build longer relationships and that’s how our quality, so. 
Daniel Altscher: Okay, and you may have addressed this earlier and I you did, I apologize, but as you start to look at maybe some more primary markets or somewhat that’s maybe a little bit higher quality, I mean, just give us an example of whether it’s maybe a geography or a group that might fit into that category that before may have fallen off the radar screen but it’s maybe on?
John Thomas: Again it’s hard to answer that question, because, well again, we find opportunities in bigger markets, it’s not like, we draw a line around New York City and say, let’s go spend the next six months there. I mean, we know kind of all markets reasonably well between – again John Sweet and Deeni Taylor and myself and so when we find to get opportunities in the bigger markets with great hospital systems or physician groups, then we focus our efforts and work through process that opportunity. So, we got a little bit in the upper northwest, that’s probably we like to have more scale, once we get into a region. So, we still not own anything in California but we haven’t found anything in value, I mean, in my past life, bought and sold and managed a lot of property in California. We just – if we see things, we just don’t haven’t seen the right kind of value opportunities for us in that market. So – again, in the future or for the near term you are going to continue to see Minneapolis and Columbus Ohio and Phoenix and Atlanta and some of the bigger markets where we already are and just continuing to expand our scale in those markets. 
Daniel Altscher: Okay, that works. Thanks so much. 
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of mine have been answered, but just had a few more. Can you give us any more details on the St. Luke’s MOB acquisition completed last week like lease expirations and apex rents versus the market? And then is that 7% unlevered yield there inclusive of additional lease-up, given it’s only 4% occupied?
John Thomas: That – I’ll start with the back, that’s on in place. We do have some color on where we see some growth opportunity there and that’s making even more attractive, but it’s nice on-campus building. The seller, the developer and close friend of the company who is somebody else we’ve done some business with. Deeni, you want to – Deeni Taylor we are asking to address the other question, so.
Deeni Taylor: Well, I think, as it relates to potential lease-up for the vacancy, one of the good things that hospital has affiliated, actually joined the monitory system, so there is real effort to increase the physician side occupancy in that building along with the AFC that’s already in there. So, we see a real opportunity to fill the remaining space over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, great. Thanks, and then, just one more, the $100 million that has been acquired – 100 plus million that’s been acquired so far this year, any debt on those deals or were they all unencumbered? 
John Thomas: They were all unencumbered. The one we just talked about – there were some debt on the deal and the lender restructured the debt as part of our transaction. Jeff will give you the numbers, so. 
Jeff Theiler: Yes, it’s $9.5 million of debt on that one deal. 
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks guys. 
John Thomas: Yes. Thanks, John.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. 
John Thomas: Well, again we are very excited about the performance of the company in 2015 and very excited about the very nice accretive acquisition pipeline that we have already started capturing this year and have a good feel for another great year in 2016. So we look forward. Thanks for taking your time today and we look forward to the follow-up. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

John Thomas : Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Physicians Realty Trust's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. During the quarter we celebrated the two year anniversary of the Company and I am pleased to discuss today our best quarter yet for growth and operating results. From the beginning of the Company's life just over 27 months ago, we have always stressed the importance of building a great long-term organization striving to achieve our liable rising dividends and a total shareholder returns. Our portfolio now totals more than $1.5 billion in high quality medical office buildings and we believe we are well on our way to continue delivering on our goals into the future. Our growth and focus on the quality of our income has delivered normalized FFO of $0.26 per share during the third quarter more than 14% above our quarterly dividend and an increase of 53% year-over-year. During the quarter we invested over $297 million in 11 medical office facilities totaling 876,000 square feet, a 19% increase in gross leasehold square footage. This is not only the largest volume of quarterly acquisitions in the history of our Company but we added some of the highest quality facilities and providers in the country to our organization including major health system on campus and affiliated facilities in three top MSAs, Columbus Ohio, Phoenix Arizona and Houston Texas. Our third quarter and year-to-date results reflect the hard work and dedication of our fantastic team. Starting with our founder and Chief Investment Officer John Sweet, who's led our efforts to double the size of our asset base this year and now working with Deeni Taylor we’ll continue to self-drive our high but disciplined rate of growth. Jeff Taylor, John Lucey and their team also deserves special recognition as they have kept pace with our growth rates scaling our reporting and accounting infrastructure, cost effectively allowing us to communicate with investors and clients confidently and frequently especially when we see the opportunity to raise capital at the right time at the best price. In a minute I will ask Jeff to speak to our operating results, noting he will be reporting the third quarter of 2015 produced the best operating results in the history of the Company. We believe this platform will continue to do even better consistently better for quarters and years to come. But first I'd like to speak of the quality of our portfolio. We want to own the highest quality medical office outpatient care facilities in the United States. The vast majority of investments in 2015 reflect our strategic plan and focus. These investments are highlighted by our facilities in Houston, Phoenix, Minneapolis and Columbus Ohio the 5th, 12th, 16th and 32nd largest MSAs in the United States respectively. In these four markets alone we’ve invested $406 million and 1.3 million square feet, 51% is on campus, 80% is on campus or affiliated with our major health system and more importantly 96% occupied. The average age of these buildings is nine years with many of them less than five years old. The first year unlevered yield of these investments is 6.8% and the average lease term is 8.3 years. Our four largest markets are now Phoenix, Atlanta, Columbus Ohio and Minneapolis but we’re also well diversified yet geographically with facilities now located in 25 states. While it’s easy to define quality simply by location on campus or a famous street in our top five MSA, we believe the definition of quality in healthcare real estate is much broader, especially from a clinical standpoint. In MedPAC the organization established by Congress to provide analysis and recommendation to Congress for improving the Medicare system reported in its latest reports to Congress that Medicare inpatient volume in 2013 was 10.1 million admissions, a decline by 1% over 2012. In contrast, outpatient volumes in 2013 were 196 million admissions, an increase of 6 million admissions or 5.5% over 2012. Because there’s exit top to the capacity, and these trends, occupancy rates in hospitals averaged just 60% in 2013 despite a national reduction in over 1000 beds. Since 1975 over 2000 hospitals in United States have closed. Medicare inpatient discharge volume from 2006 to 2013 declined by a total of 17% over the past 17 years. In contrast Medicare outpatient service volume from 2006 to 2013 increased by 33%. MedPAC in the healthcare industry not only expects this continued shift for inpatient, outpatient services and settings, the affordable care act and payers are encouraging and incentivizing the shift in care to more efficient integrated service providers in the lowest cost settings capable of meeting the clinical needs of the patients. We believe the data is undeniable that the future of healthcare services in the vast majority of the care will be provided in outpatient settings. Our healthcare expertise combined with our experience in real estate and finance enables us to soar substantially more potential investments in far more markets that’s providing to you our investors far more opportunities for more outsized growth and higher risk adjusted returns. We don’t stop at the address when we underwrite. We believe quality in healthcare real estate begins with the quality of care provided in that facility, the critical math of patients seeking convenient access to that care, the qualities of patient's ability to pay or otherwise compensate the provider for that care, and the care providers are willing to deliver that care efficiently, effectively and faithfully. A beautiful but empty building regardless of location is not high quality healthcare real estate. The strength of our team is the ability to match quality criteria with Physical real estate and locations that optimize the success of our clinical provider tenants and that products reliable long-term and growing net operating income for our organization. As an example earlier this year we invested $41 million in Rochester New York to acquire strategically located outpatient medical office for consisting of five Class A facilities. While Rochester is the 51st largest MSA in the country, the Alpha Spark is least primarily to the university of Rochester medical center one of the largest healthcare providers in New York and a strong investment great credit with an S&P double A minus rating. The convenient outpatient location provided a central healthcare destination for high margin and needed access to oncology, orthopedics and family medicine primary care services. Our investment produces a 7.2% first year unlevered return with long-term triple net leases and the opportunity to expand the relationship with the university of Rochester and new investments in the future. That goes toward the physicians and the patients want to go and that's where the rents located. We believe that is high quality healthcare real estate. While our primary focus is the quality they incur tenant, we do believe the vast majority, the best anchor tenants are healthcare systems and large physician groups and the percentage of our facilities that are on campus or affiliated with our health system is now 77% with a goal to increase that percentage to 90% or more over time. Finally, we would like to thank our investors for the strong support in the upsized $226 million follow-on offering completed in October. This capital further strengthened the already very strong balance sheet and positioned us for continued and sustainable growth. We have excellent liquidity moving forward to take advantage of accretive investment opportunities and a growing pipeline of off market transactions. I will now turn the call over to Jeff, to discuss our financial results for the quarter. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. We're happy to report another strong quarter of operations and acquisition activity. Our third quarter 2015 funds from operations or FFO were $16 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Our normalized FFO, which added back $3.3 million of acquisition expenses and some other small normalizing adjustments were $19.3 million. Normalized funds from operations per share was $0.26 per share, which represents a year-over-year increase of 53% from the third quarter 2014 normalized FFO per share of $0.17. Normalized funds available for distribution or FAD for the third quarter were approximately $16.9 million or $0.23 per diluted share. Importantly, this quarter marks a milestone for our Company in which we for the first time achieved our stated goal of covering our quarterly dividend, a testament to the success of our disciplined investment program and the strength of our operating portfolio. We achieved record investment results this quarter adding 11 medical office building properties and one mezzanine loan investment. The investments this quarter totaled $297 million, expanding our asset base by about 25%, and were achieved in an average first year unlevered cash yield to 6.7%. Had we acquired all these assets at the beginning of the quarter, they would have contributed an additional $2.7 million of cash NOI to our portfolio. In this past quarter as we have throughout the life of our Company, we source many of these deals through relationships which we believe enables us to achieve higher risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we close on $53.5 million of additional investments. For the year, we have closed on $741.6 million of investments, putting us at the bottom end of the upsized $700 million to $900 million of full year 2015 investment guidance that we announced on our second quarter earnings call. We are evaluating an increasing pipeline of potential opportunities and expect to continue to execute our growth strategy in the highly fragmented medical office building sector. We utilize our line of credit to fund our acquisition activity in the third quarter ending on September 30 with a balance of $473 million. Our debt to gross asset at the end of the third quarter was 38.4%, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.9X. In keeping with our strategy of maintaining a conservative capital structure to position our Company for a long-term sustainable growth, we executed a follow on offering in October at $15 per share. The upsized offering generated net proceeds of $226.3 million, $225 million of that offering was used to pay down our line of credit, with $1.3 million contributed towards acquisitions made subsequent to the end of the third quarter. Pro forma for the pay down of the line of credit and the $53.5 million of acquisition subsequent to the end of the quarter our debt to gross assets would be 26%. We continue to work on finalizing our first long-term debt issuances and expect to announce an agreement before the end of the year. On a 10 year basis, pricing is now anticipated to be slightly better than the range we announced last quarter of treasuries plus 225 to 250 basis points. Our portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well, and was 95.5% leased at the end of the third quarter. Our same-store portfolio which encompasses about 37% of our total NOI, grew cash NOI at 2.3% year-over-year which was primarily driven by contractual rent increases and a 30 basis point improvement in occupancy. This was partially offset by a 4.6% increase in operating expenses driven by additional insurance expense incurred in the third quarter of about $70,000. Finally, our general and administrative cost for the third quarter were $4.0 million, which was primarily driven by salary expense and about $275,000 of one-time rating agency fees. We expect to incur a similar G&A expense in the fourth quarter which will put us at the high end of the $14 million to $15 million range we estimated at the beginning of the year. We continue to work diligently toward reducing our G&A below 1% of assets. All-in-all, our portfolio is continuing to perform well, our pipeline of potential opportunities remains as big as ever and we are exceptionally well positioned to continue to execute on our disciplined growth strategy in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2016. With that, I'll turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we'll be happy to start taking questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
Juan Sanabria: Good morning, guys. Just given the very successful acquisition quarter record numbers, what you guys feel is a sustainable sort of quarterly or annual run-rate - however you want to frame it or what you guys think you can do with the current team. And any views on cap rates as well would be helpful, thanks.
John Thomas: Yes one, we've been consistently growing every quarter and adding - Deeni is going to bring an additional level of resources and relationships to the organization. So we kind of consistently been in $200 million third quarter I think next year we look at it similar to this year, we'll put our formal guidance in the next earning call around acquisition expectations next year. But as long as capital market stay up and we think the volume of opportunities will continue to be there in the kind of consistent pace we've been growing. Cap rates I think we're very excited to this quarter to cap rates we achieved littler price year than previous quarters but again we've consistently said where we can match quality with our cost of capital. And I think quality, the bigger markets to more on campus or more health system affiliated assets, we can find those - we will pay up for those. But we're still for the year right at 7% on the deployment of capital and that's a first year unlevered cap rate. So, we haven't seen a big change in pricing this quarter but I think that's what we'd expect going into the first quarter.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then as you think about the quality of assets that you highlighted in the quarter and the whole shift towards outpatient and lower cost settings. How do you underwrite and what are the key metrics you look at to underwrite hospitals as the key sort of tenant and sort of the relationship with the medical office buildings. Any sort of key benchmarked market share et cetera that you look at demographic growth. Where are you focused on? 
John Thomas: Yes, we look at all the above. The one of easy thing with hospitals is most of them have credit ratings and more public data about their historic and current financials. But also more importantly we look at their growth rates and their access to new market where they are growing and aligning with physicians most importantly because hospital doesn’t do anything with the physician order. So they get to have good relationships with physicians and then growing and aligning with those physicians in outpatient care setting. So those settings can be on campus or off campus should reflection of underwriting what services are in the building and how that hospital is going to grow.
Juan Sanabria: And then Jeff on - I think you mentioned quickly at the end of your prepared remarks on terming up the line, so what size tenure year are you thinking - it would be on secured market or private placement market or what are the latest thoughts?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, sure Juan. So latest thoughts on private placement market, the size is likely to be around $150 million and we'd expect to become a private placement market, you typically are trenching that out in several different countries but kind of average maturity of 10 years or so.
Juan Sanabria : Okay. And you said 225 to 250 over or maybe a little bit below that?
Jeff Theiler: I think it will actually be a little bit below that under the range.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. Thanks guys. Great quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Hughes: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the third quarter and growth in IPO. Are you guys putting any of these large MOB portfolios in your pipelines or they mostly smaller one-off deals? And then I guess one more, have you seen any assets circle back around that were previously on the auction block?
John Thomas: The simple answer is all the above. Jonathan, there has been several larger portfolios out there floating around and we see most of those. I think for us it's a matter - most of those will carry some kind of portfolio or portfolio of premium and so one of the things we do is reflect - is the quality of the overall portfolio worth paying a premium for or how do they match up with our – say [indiscernible] down in the middle of fairway kind of pipeline and the way we've grown. And so its nice opportunities out there, nice portfolios out there but we are yet to see a lot - its entire assisted to pay a premium to those assets while we are still growing very effectively in putting capital together or putting capital work at a better cap rate once [indiscernible].
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then I guess to get segway into my next question. So looking at the Memorial Hermann assets you brought in 3Q, could you maybe talk about the difference in yields there on those assets versus the portfolio of Memorial Hermann assets that were bought earlier this year by competitor of yours. I think the cap rate differentiate there was a kind of 80 basis points. So I won't expect the portfolio premium, but it seems like it was even more of a differential than it was expected.
John Thomas: Yes, I think that reflects the approach that John Sweet had with the seller. It's a Physician Group that really self developed those assets working with Memorial Hermann, very newer bigger buildings in a great market. The other assets were on campus but frankly not assets that were as attracted to us that. But in the end it's Memorial Hermann credit. So, again no criticism of that portfolio that we are very excited in and we think we got a very attractive price and yield on those assets and they will be there for a very long time and they are completely occupied or 95% occupied. So can't really explain the differential other than jobs we're getting done, we're working hard developing a relationship with the seller and the seller caring who the next owner was.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. Now it's great, it's great color. Then I guess one last one, I know you're definitely focused on external growth right now, but given some of the other healthcare REITs out there looking to aggressively moving into hospital sector, would you be open for selling some of your hospitals or LTAC that recycle that capital into MOBs or is that something you haven't looked at?
John Thomas: We always evaluate our portfolio, I mean everything -- just about everything we bought in the last two years, so we're excited about the investments we've made, but always looking to maximize the best source of capital and then deploy that in the best new opportunities and so we're a pure play medical office building REIT, we like to serve with the hospital in a business, we like the specialized post care facilities with the best operators and we think we have all of that in the portfolio. But we'll look at it from time-to-time and if there is a good opportunity to recycle capital, we'll evaluate it. We have no current plans to do so but we're evaluating it constantly though.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. That's it from me, thanks guys.
John Thomas: Thanks, John.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, good morning. My first one is just sort of following back up on the hospital underwriting. I'm curious John, given sort of your history and experience from the real estate perspective, would you be interested in owning an acute care hospital today?
John Thomas: We focus on our patient care, Jordan, and as I said -- I'm sure there's some good opportunities out there to own acute care hospitals. But the average age of hospitals and there's not going to be most hospitals in the United States were built in the 50s, 60s, so there's a lot of big infrastructure out there. Just with the outpatient – the trends to more and more clinical services being performed frankly in a physician's office. We have no plans to invest in acute care hospitals. Our surgical hospitals are licensed hospitals in their respective states, but the outpatient care facilities that are primarily to expand the scope of services for the physicians that work there, but they're not in taking patients and they're not big general acute care hospitals. So, long way to answer to say no, I wouldn't expect just to invest in any hospitals and again back to -- probably didn't tie the square tightly in my opening comments but a lot of hospitals are closing, a lot of hospitals are re-building in new kind of better markets within their submarkets and so we'd rather focus on the outpatient care and aligning with those hospitals in those newer markets where we can.
Jordan Sadler: The other sort of question I have for you which is a little bit along the same lines, but given sort of the recent budget approval, the Section C03 revision there, can you maybe speak to that and how is that -- how you're addressing that near acquisitions in underwriting strategy and how you may expect that to impact tenant decisions going forward?
John Thomas: That's a great question. So, we’re calling those 603 assets after the section number and we have a number of grandfather 603 assets [indiscernible]. Section 603 you're going to have the same scope of services in our building if it's build as an outpatient department of the hospital, you should expect much higher reimbursement particularly in oncology and cardiology, those are the two service lines or two of the service lines where you get significantly higher rates building as a hospital outpatient department even though it's in effective position office with ancillary services. Section 603 requires or provides those facilities to build on that basement on that basis, need to be on campus which is historically defined by regulation as kind of tied to the hospital within 250 yards of the hospital. The grandfather's all existing HOPD providers of hospitals billing facility, hospital outpatient department reimbursement rate, those are grandfathered – in place. So we have a number of those, like DMO calling them 603 assets, we have a number of those grandfathered facilities. Historically we’ll have to see how the rigs are written, but historically if you're grandfathered you can’t change the address of that location and continue to achieve that higher reimbursement. So, we would think that our 603 assets providers are going to want to stay in those locations for a very long time. So that excites us a lot. On the other hand going forward you're certainly making new investment decisions, we will underwrite what their expected reimbursement is going to look like in the location and obviously they want HOPD reimbursement as a new provider, at least under the new life it’s going to have to be on campus as defined by the rigs and certainly that'll make us look at that investment in that perspective. But there's other reasons to be off campus providing -- getting into new markets looking into align with new physician groups and accessing new higher patient demographics. And so you still may get better or good reimbursement just not the HOPD reimbursement, so that'll call us to dig a little bit deeper into the expected reimbursement structure of that provider. So again long one answer to the question but it's good for our existing assets, we've already built that into our underwriting process and structure. And one thing it does is it really levels the playing field between big multi-specialty groups and hospitals with lot of physician groups already performing these services and doing it very successfully at a high margin. And that really levels the playing field. So, for this year if you want to continue to stay independent of the hospital really levels the playing field from a competitive standpoint. And again we think we have great relationships with those big multi-specialty groups across the country. So something to factor in that really drive a decision one way to the other just something to factor into the analysis.
Jordan Sadler: Would you -- I mean so on a sort of look back basis, does this sort of enhance the value of the Grandfather 603 asset as we look at and as your underwriting new investment I guess basically everything on the ground today are being built before 2017, would it be considered a grandfather asset, right? I mean so -- changed anything now?
John Thomas: Yes slight better to what you just said. You have to be the way I understand the law you have be billing in their location as of the effective day which is November 2nd. If you create a new location after September 2nd you can bill HOPD until January 1, 2017, if you otherwise qualify and then you'll go to the lower physician office rate. So, I think the more important answer to your question is we certainly view hospital outpatient department in an existing building as one that's probably -- you don't want to stay in there for a very long time. So when we underwrite 10 to 15 year investments at least the way the new laws written, those hospital tenants are going to understand there for the longer term than that we would expect. So yes, we think it enhances the value of those assets.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Altscher with FBR. Please go ahead.
Daniel Altscher: Thanks and good morning everyone. Really nice results, glad to see the dividend coverage. Just reading from the language in the press release, it sounded like the idea of a lowering the further [indiscernible] further was kind of the game plan. So I just want to confirm I think we're trying to say is maybe not dividend increases but just naturally get it down as cash flow search to continue to ramp is that right?
John Thomas: I think it's a fair interpretation Dan, and thank you for the nice comments.
Daniel Altscher: Great, okay, good. And I just want to spend a minute just on the - I guess the T1 or the leasing commission number in the quarter it was a little large. Can you give us some color or context as to what that was specifically related to?
Jeff Theiler: Sure Dan, it's Jeff. Yes it was little bit larger than normal and primarily what that related to as we had about $1.5 million of additional CapEx associated with our office build out of the new Dock Headquarters.
Daniel Altscher: Okay. So that was probably more of one-time in nature?
Jeff Theiler: It's definitely is a one-time expense.
John Thomas: Nothing unusual or unexpected in the rest of the core portfolio.
Daniel Altscher: Okay. Great and that's perfect. And then I guess just one clarification question. I think Jeff, you said that pro forma for the pay down of the revolver, you're looking at 26% kind of debt to assets. Just want to make sure that was not including any potential future bond issuances that you're referring to?
Jeff Theiler: No, that was just pro forma for the pay down of the revolver and the additional acquisitions that we announced subsequent to the end of the third quarter.
Daniel Altscher: Okay. So maybe just to make it really simple for me, can you kind of just give me a sense as to where I guess the line currently its, how much capacity or how much is currently drawn kind of in that number?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, I mean we have about give or take $500 million of capacity on the line, $750 million a line.
Daniel Altscher: Okay. Great, that's simple. All right, thanks, appreciate it.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Please go ahead sir.
Paul Morgan: Hi, good morning. Just quickly going back to the section 603 asset, if I missed it I'm sorry. Did you say what share of your assets or NOI did you kind -- did you quantify these things part of your section 603 portfolio?
John Thomas: We're working through that Paul, we'll follow up with you but it's not a huge percentage but there's a nice batch of – 603 assets, Grandfather 603 assets in the portfolio. So actually talking to some of the hospital tenants that we work with to clarify whether it's HOPD or not. Most probably which ones are but some of them are really classic position offices. So you have to dig a little deeper to figure that it's HOPD build or not. So we're working with the hospitals on that assessment.
Paul Morgan: Okay. All right, thanks. And then you've talked about with some of your prior acquisitions that there are opportunities for growth with those tenants be either expansions of their network and the acquisition of other facilities or potentially development opportunities. And as you look at your current pipeline for investment, are there -- is that a meaningful piece of it, do you see opportunities you could accelerate over the next few quarters either till acquisitions or development opportunities with your operator?
John Thomas: We have one specific asset that we're working with the private party to expand that asset on behalf of the provider. I don't see it being a material part of our growth next year. We have a number of assets where the potential for expansion is there. But I don't see that being a near term event. And then I think the bigger opportunity is like the [indiscernible] as we know what some of there kind a three to five year plans are, we hope to have opportunities there. The IMS Group out in Phoenix added 30 providers this year and has a similar aggressive growth by next year. Those buildings that we bought in partnership with them are substantially full. So we look for some opportunities over the next 18 months there. So it's short answer, more potential long-term, we see some exciting organic growth opportunities with them.
Paul Morgan: Thanks and then getting probably a pretty good clarity on the rest of the year. As we think about your investments before year end, are there main indicative chips in around of the fourth quarter, first order until we see inactive last two months of the year.
John Thomas: I think -- I mean our guidance was $700 million to $900 million. We wouldn't expect to change that probably. And I hope you more that towards the higher end of that guidance. But we slowdown the pipeline a little bit intentionally in July and August and we pushed out some discussions intentionally during that period of time when the market was so rocky. So I'd say that's still good guidance but the pipeline for first quarter 2016 as we're really pleased where we sit today.
Paul Morgan: Okay, great. And then just lastly, I mean it's only about a third of your portfolio is in the same store pool. So as I think about it's all of additional asset get rolled into it over the next few quarters. Is there any reason to expect any variance and kind of your sort of low 2% same store NOI number. Is there any upside or downside for all the assets that you've acquired over the past 12 months that they get added to the pool?
Jeff Theiler: We will continue to expect 2.5% to 3% quarter-to-quarter. We have some variability each quarter in that number, but pretty confident in that range.
Paul Morgan: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from John Kim with Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.
John Kim: Thank you. Your acquisition related guidance - your acquisition related expenses were pretty significant. And three quarters into the year, they're higher than your G&A costs. So can you just provide some breakdown as to the external versus internal breakdown of these costs, as well as what percentage directly related to transaction.
John Thomas: So this is John, so I understand do you mean - internal versus external meaning external like progresses and stuff like that and internal being allocated acquisition personnel.
John Kim: Correct.
John Thomas: We can do that. We'd actually don't have that at our fingertips right now. But I think we are just around 1% of assets which is fairly typical and what we've been kind of doing over the past couple of years. So, I wouldn't expect the number to change drastically from that going forward.
John Kim: I'm just wondering if you're actually paying brokerage fees, a higher dollar figure than your internal management.
John Thomas: No, and I don't think so. We can look at it John but most of two-thirds of our acquisitions are kind a off-market – probably half of those are no broker involved at all, sometimes the broker working with us helps to establish the relationship and I don't think it's an unusual percentage.
John Kim: Okay. And it looks like your margins were higher this quarter with the increase in occupancy. Where do you see the occupancy next year given you have pretty minimal exploration?
John Thomas: 95% to 96% should stay there, you think about MOB and that's substantially full. We heard already above a good pace on our next year renewals have very limited amount and as a percentage basis expiring through the end of this year. So 95% and 96%, we continue to buy buildings that are 90% to 100% occupied. So to the extent that affected - should still be in that range.
John Kim: Even estimate on your mark-to-market on your explorations for next couple of years?
John Thomas: Yes, Mark why do you speak to recent renewals and just the kind of - 
Mark Theine: Sure. On the third quarter we had 19,000 square feet that we renewed our head up renewal in the quarter with a 78% retention rate, there was only one lease that we did not renew in the quarter and unfortunately that was a physician who had a stroke and we work on their termination that's his leads with prepayment only. But we added 78% retention rate and then for the releasing spreads, we were actually up substantially 22% for the quarter again on the small 19,000 square feet renewals that increased up nicely.
John Thomas: Yes, based on model 22% increase in spread but we continue to see renewals add or above the exploration. So 2% to 3% growth should be normal.
John Kim: On that growth figure, can you discuss maybe what your signing is far as annual lease accelerators?
John Thomas: Typically 2% to 3%, we will always push for three where we can.
John Kim: Okay. And then finally I know you are still in active growth mode. But are you going to be providing 2016 FFO guidance next year?
Jeff Theiler: No, John, this is Jeff, I don't think so. We've talked about it a lot because we wanted to be as transparent as we possibly can be to the market. So, because we are still an external growth, because the FFO is so dependent on the timing of the acquisitions and either the leverage that you have throughout the year, it's really, really difficult to come up with an estimate that's meaningful and it would change quarter-to-quarter as our acquisition activity change. So I think what we will end up doing is providing the same type of guidance that we did this year and overall acquisition bucket and then that gives a little bit more flexibility as to the timing of those acquisitions because it's just highly variable depending on the deal.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Carroll: John, can you give us some color on your recent investment activity. I’m specifically looking at the catalyst portfolio, looks like it's 12 facilities with an aggregate of 94,000 square feet – those facility seem to be fairly small.
John Thomas: Yes, Mike, smaller than we like but a great tenant base and it's a really young dynamic development team that's really built a nice client base and particularly the [pendent] [ph] looks lot, not going to stretching over the Jacksonville. So again kind of smaller assets but newer, would get tenant base. But the pipeline there which we essentially controlled to the acquisition as well is really moving towards kind of the preferred assets and size of assets and location that we want. So I wouldn't call it a loss lead, we got a nice cap rate on those assets with a nice tenant base but going forward we would start some bigger more interesting opportunities with those same hospital systems in that groups.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the mezzanine loan that you made, I guess for the children facility to be - just buy that property and you expect to take amount in the near term?
John Thomas: I'm glad you asked about that, we are very excited about those two investments. Those were built by developer called Landmark, they’re actually basing a lot, but we had a very long relationship with the Landmark organization. The Jacksonville Florida assets over 200,000 square feet, we’d be humble to say probably the best, nicest looking best occupied medical office building, outpatient care facility built this year and developed. I mean every REIT on though - every developer on those try to win that opportunity. So Landmark was just looking to recap it for a five year period upon CEO, working with them we put in some mezzanine debt as part of their recap and working with GE Healthcare as well. And then we have an opportunity to buy it, the determination of that five year recap. So, same thing in Kansas City, the Truman Medical Center is the tenant of that buildings, 82,000 square foot facility it was just completed last month, it's on – hospitals here in Kansas City, so kind of a great location close to a number of hospitals but the tenant is Truman Medical Center which is the teaching hospital from the University of Missouri Kansas City. So again similar structure we get a nice premium yield on the mezzanine loan during the term and then the opportunity upon the maturity of the senior loan and our mezzanine loan to buy that time. So, great new assets and great opportunity for the future.
Michael Carroll: And what was the rate on those funds?
Jeff Theiler: 8.5% - just over 8%. We’ve indexed those to the tenure closure at the time of closing so.
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Gentlemen, there are no further questions registered at this time.
John Thomas: This is John, thank you everyone for listening in. We look forward to seeing most of you at NAREIT. Please call up if you have any further questions.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our company CEO, John Thomas. 
John Thomas: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Just two short years ago on July 19, 2013, we started Physicians Realty Trust with 19 medical office facilities worth $124 million, generating $9.5 million of annual revenue. Since that time we've increased both the quality and size of that portfolio and today it exceeds $1.3 billion and generates annualized cash revenue of more than $98 million. And just as importantly, we continue to see high quality opportunities to continue this growth. We shared in our IPO road show a long-term plan to grow the organization quickly but in a discipline way with low leverage all for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. This morning we've announced a number of exciting events all consistent with our original message and plan which further enhance and establish our shareholders company as a growth stock investment. We've strong liquid balance sheet, high quality of healthcare facilities, industry leading occupancy and lease stability with over 95% occupancy and an average lease term with 9.25 years including the medical office investment closed announced today they closed after June 30. These announcements include total year-to-date investment of $480 million at an average first year cash yield of 7%, growth of 57.8% in gross real estate year-to-date. Upon closing of the IMS Phoenix investment, we then completed $621 million investment this year. We now own $1.3 billion of medical office facilities, growth of 942.5% in our 24 month life. Additionally, we feel confident enough with our visible pipeline to increase our acquisition guidance by $200 million this year. We are now projecting total acquisitions of $700 million to $900 million of high quality healthcare facilities in 2015.  Revenue has grown 45.7% this year-to-date and our annualized cash revenue now stands at $98 million compared to our $9.5 million revenue when we completed our IPO. The average size were 19 facilities at our IPO was 27,000 feet, today we own 124 facilities with an average size of almost 38,000 feet. Our original 19 facilities were 85% occupied as compared to 95% as of this morning. With the anticipated August closing of the $141 million IMS Phoenix investment, our total investment balance will grow to $1.43 billion and our average building size will grow to approximately 40,000 feet. With IMS we will add yet another healthcare community to the 14 marker where we have geographic concentration, enhancing our -- scale for efficient property and asset management and multiple provider relationships. IMS is a very high quality physician owned and led multi specialty group, affiliated with Dignity Health, one of the largest healthcare system in the West. IMS has already has 140 providers and has added 31 physicians already this year. The physicians are owned outpatient care office building, three of which or on hospital campuses contain over 400,000 feet of Class A real estate. We believe this investment will be just the beginning of the opportunity to grow with this leading physician organization.  We also announced Moody's Investor Services has recognized Physicians Realty Trust organization, asset, balance sheet and operating philosophy of highly coveted Baa3 investment grade rating. Since the IPO we have approached our growth with the mindset of an investment grade company and we intend to continue to manage the organization this way.  Our Board and management believe low leverage and disciplined balance sheet management will optimize total shareholders returns over the long term.  Finally, in March we announced our founder John Sweet had agree to extend his contract to service our Chief Investment Officer through the end of 2016, and that we had plan to identify and retain successor Chief Investment Officer before the end of 2015.  This morning we announced the appointment of Deeni Taylor as our Executive Vice President starting October 1st, 2015. And we plan for Deeni to assume the additional title and responsibly Chief Investment Officer upon John Sweet's retire. Deeni has over 25 years of hospital executive management, 25 years of experience with hospital executive management with a largest healthcare system in the United States. Since 2006, he self lead the medical office building division at Duke Realty and through his tenure that ended in June, 2015, his team built one of the best portfolio as a medical office building in the United States. Deeni will hit the ground running and only work John Sweet and our team to evaluate and manage our investment opportunities. Deeni has a depth of relationships coast to coast that I believe in further enhance our ability to identify, underwrite and grow our investments in high quality medical office facilities with the highest quality providers.  We look forward to introducing Deeni to you in the future as part of the DOC team. On our last earnings call we announced our goal to pursue an investment grade rating in 2015 and if successful begin the transformation to a long-term capital structure. As noted, Moody's has recognized our team asset and balance sheet with this investment grade rating. The Board, management and team have worked hard to achieve this recognition, but we want to recognize our CFO Jeff Theiler and his leadership and hard work in achieving this recognition.  Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to conclude with the note of appreciation to you on the call. We are a growth healthcare real estate company. We pursue this growth from the beginning with the commitment to be disciplined and transparent to our stakeholders and clients. We are proud of -- to transparency and the content of our communication was recognized by NAREIT with the gold care as the communications and reporting excellence award for small cap REIT. Winners of this award are selected by panel of securities analysts and portfolio managers. Thank you to those who on the call, who are on the panel and selected us for this award. The privilege to communicate with you. Your feedback makes us better, we encourage you to provide all the constructed feedback you can and we look forward to your questions later today.  With our ability to grow and your support, we look forward to earning this award from you in the future, perhaps in the future piece of the large cap REIT category. I will now turn the call over to Jeff to discuss our financial results for the quarter. And the short and long term benefits of our investment grade rating and after that we will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. We are pleased to share our results for another successful quarter of operations. Our second quarter 2015 funds from operations or FFO were $13.2 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Our normalized FFO, which added back $2.6 million of acquisition expenses and some other small normalizing adjustments were $15.7 million or $0.21 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 23.5% from the second quarter of 2014. Normalized funds available for distribution or FAD were approximately $15 million or $0.20 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 25% from the second quarter of 2014. We are excited that we have able to continue this high level growth for our shareholders and we see the opportunity in front of expanding. With the pending appointment of Deeni Taylor as Executive Vice President of Investments, the signing of $141 million IMS portfolio and the state of our current pipeline, we now feel comfortable increasing our acquisition guidance by $200 million for the remainder of the year. This equates to total acquisition of $700 million to $900 million for 2015. In the second quarter of this year we invested $157 million in 13 high quality healthcare facilities with an average first year cash yield of 7.4% and one mezzanine loan investment that paid interest at the rate of 8.4%. And we acquired all these assets at the beginning of the quarter; they would have generated an additional $1.8 million in cash net operating income. In addition, subsequent to the end of the second quarter inclusive of the Phoenix IMS portfolio, we've acquired or entered into agreements to acquire additional $229 million assets with an average unlevered first year cash yield of 6.6%. We funded our acquisition primarily with our revolving line of credit which we upsize to $750 million in July and now have the ability to expand to total size of $1.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, our revolving line of credit had a balance of $191 million leaving us with plenty of capacity to fund our growth plans. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our total secured debt is $95.7 million or 8% of our asset value. Our overall debt to asset is just under 24% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 3.4x. Both of these metrics are solidly in the investment grade range. Moody's Investor Service specifically recognizes that fact yesterday as they initiate re-coverage of senior unsecured debt for the Baa3 investment grad rating. This rating was earned by a disciplined growth and commitment to building a long-term company. This excellent outcome will enable us to access the debt market to favorable rates and will lower our cost of capital significantly, on both the revolving credit facility as well as on any long -term debt we issue in the future. On the operations front, our portfolio is just under 95% leased at the end of the second quarter. Additionally, this is the second quarter in which we have reported our same-store portfolio statistics. As a reminder, our same-store portfolio is relatively small part of our overall portfolio at 37% and relatively small adjustments can significantly impact the results. Our same-store cash NOI for the second quarter of 2015 grew 2.3% year-over-year, which was driven primarily by contractual rent increases of roughly 2.8% and offset by operating expense growth of 4.9%. Finally, our general and administrative costs for the quarter were $3.9 million, or $3.1 million on a cash basis. The increase was primarily driven by salary expense accrual which was in line with our expectations. We continue to maintain effective control on our cost and make progress towards our target of reducing overall G&A to less than 1% of assets.  With that I'll turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. We will now turn it over for questions-and-answers. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, good morning. So congrats on the investment grade nod from Moody's, I guess I am curious about the follow up we might see or expected timing on a second rating if you think that's imminent. And sort of maybe if you can sort of provide a little bit of color, little bit of an update on when your inaugural on deal you may look to get off. 
Jeff Theiler: Hi, Jordan. It's Jeff. So we spent the last two years with Moody's, walking them through our assets, talking to them about the company strategy, laying out a game plan, executing on that game plan and so benefit of that was by the end of the process they felt very comfortable with the company strategy, the management team, the portfolio and gave us that investment grade rating. So it was a pretty long engagement. We are continuing to do that with the other rating agencies and if and when we receive an investment grade rating from them, we will certainly report that to you. But I think that the key here is that the first one is here is Moody's one is really the important one. Because it does the couple of things immediately. It reduces the cost on our revolving line of credit. We go from a leverage base grid where we currently at the lowest leverage level we pay 150 basis points over LIBOR, to an investment grade pricing metrics which will charge us LIBOR plus 120 at our current Baa3 rating. So you get an immediate benefit there. It also gives access to the private debt market and investment grade rates. And if you look at the private debt market versus the public debt markets, right now for fairly new investment grade issuers you get much better execution in the private debt market on the pricing basis. So we feel that we got really a great ability to go out there and access capital right now in the private debt market as well as our bank markets actually. But all that being said, we are continuing to engage with S&P and fair action will report those ratings if and when we get them.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. I think are you suggesting that you could do the private deal or bank deal in advance of second ratings, second investment grade rating? 
Jeff Theiler: Yes. We are. I mean we are looking at all the options and we continue to weigh all the options but we certainly have the ability to go do private deal right now with our current rating.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. I guess as you relates to this cost to capital shift somewhat which I know you are guys were anticipating. How does this impact John underwriting or so on assets and or the target assets that you might be looking at?
John Thomas: And I think we've said from the beginning, as our cost to capital improves we can be kind of move up the quality scale but we are still seeing lots of great opportunities in secondary markets where we get favorable pricing. I think our relationship model continues to get us favorable pricing even in the bigger markets and with bigger higher quality assets i.e. the IMF portfolio we talked about. So I think you'll still see just the range across the board where we pay up the quality now we have the cost to capital, continue to have cost to capital allows us to do that. And but we are still seeing lots of great opportunities are -- not as if expensive higher yielding helping us fuel growth so--
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then last one, Jeff, just a follow up on sort of the quarter. I feel like you are relative to model and we can follow up on this off line little bit but relative to model, I know there are lot of moving pieces, lot of acquisitions in the quarter and last quarter, feel like the FFO came in little bit later than expected relative to our model but probably relatively to the rest of this street as well. Was there anything driving that in particular that you can flag for us in the quarter that more of one time item or do you think it was all purely acquisition timing. 
Jeff Theiler: Yes. It is hard to answer without directly looking at your model. I am happy to that with you off line and if I can flag what might be a difference in this quarter. I think a lot of it is the acquisition timing. If you look at our acquisitions for the quarter, the bulk of them were kind of June and lot of them are actually the last day in June. So while the number -- the overall number seems to be in line with probably have most people are modeling it. I would imagine most people are modeling those acquisitions to occur early in the quarter at least midway through the quarter. So I think from my perspective the vast majority of that probably going to be acquisition timing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning, guys. And congrats on the investment grade rating. John, I was just hoping maybe if you could speak to the pipeline and kind of what we should be expecting for the balance of the year. Most skewed toward the cap rate we were seeing earlier in the year is sort of closer to 7% plus or more sort of mid 6, maybe as a quality improves with some of the more recent deals, with the ballpark of that range should be. 
John Thomas: Yes. The IMS portfolio which has not closed, we described today in our release and we talked about today. It is a very nice, bulky and that help drive and fuel the increase in guidance from the $700 million and $900 million for the rest of the year. And again easy to say that we feel pretty good about that range particularly at mid point of the range. And a high degree of confidence there. We are seeing some high quality assets out there. There are some high qualities I'll say small portfolio that are floating around and we will track and we will demand a higher price forward. We are still in that 6.5% to 7% plus range. I think right at 7% for this quarter. Blended basis across the pipeline and so I think you can high 6%, 7% is still a good number for the remainder of the year. 
Juan Sanabria: Are you seeing any movement in cap rates or sense the things may begin to turn, what's happen in the capital market or still too early to tell or and if there is any change in the level of competition for deals?
John Thomas: Yes. I think the easy answer is too early to tell but I do think there is more talk, investors like us that the pricing need to start adjusting and I think that's translating into the market discipline, again this -- there is two or three portfolios out there that we are really not involved in, but they are going to command a pretty high price from a size volume discount or volume premium if you will. And so I think overall class A on campus building is going to attract the most potential bidders or going to command in the low 6s or 6 and portfolios that are having a quality and may demand six or less. But I do think it is too early to tell but I do think that the market generally that the buzz if you will is asset price needs to start reflecting where the 10 year debt is moving. 
Juan Sanabria: And for just as a couple quick ones. Expectations for G&A. How should we think about that with Deeni's addition and just any thoughts on timing of dividend coverage?
John Thomas: Yes. So for G&A, at the end of last year or I guess fourth quarter earnings call we talk about G&A of $14 million to $15 million for 2015. I think we are still on track for that. I mean I think with Deeni it would probably pushes to high end of that range frankly. But we still feel good about that number. And then in terms of dividend coverage, we continue to make very good progress towards covering our dividends, we feel -- we talked about by the end of the year we still stick to that. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't be recovering by the end of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Gorman with Cowen Group. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Thanks, good morning. Just could if I just could follow up on Juan's question maybe ask it a different way. As you are looking at the investment pipeline and as you are out in the marketplace, have you started to see any deals maybe that you had missed on that you had one come back to you or are you starting to see any assets being re-traded in the marketplace?
John Thomas: That's an interesting question, Mike. We are actually having been seeing some of that. I think some for different reasons but some for private buyers who won reason another didn't get to the finish line with their capital stake, but we have seen that two three instances of that. And frankly if it is something that we had looked at and either put an offer or passed on it our price is typically been higher-- excuse me lower than kind of where the deal have been struck and they are not closed. So seen a couple -- we have seen couple try to just flip their contracts to us in the most part we -- not just been there. 
Michael Gorman: Sure, okay. And then as we think about the back half of the year and kind of giving maybe the midpoint of that acquisition guidance. I mean should we think about it more in terms of the smaller deals that we saw through the first six months or is it going to be little bit chunkier like the Washington acquisition and now that the Phoenix acquisition is that going to be more prevalent in the back half of the year?
John Thomas: I think we've got some sizable opportunities. We got lots of our bread and butter $50 million opportunities as well. So I would say things kind of set down in December, so I think most of work would be -- most of the closing would be by then but otherwise I think it would be kind of the blend what you have seen throughout the year. But we work through December 31st
Michael Gorman: Okay. And then maybe just one last one on the investment front. Can you just talk about as your out there working with the physicians group what you are hearing on kind of seller motivation right now, what's driving, is it investment in their practices, is it just trying to expand or is it kind of what's the motivation to cash up the real estate or to find the partner for the real estate.
John Thomas: Yes. IMS in the most recent example. And their motivation is couple of old one, they are hearing from people it's kind top of the market of the seller so they are capturing that. They've added 31 provider this year, I mean they are growing like crazy and they need additional facilities and so they kind of self funded, self developed these beautiful Class A, three of which are on campus, 100,000 square feet facilities, and they need to develop more those and they want to develop more those, they kind of like this development model, it is very large, very sophisticated physicians group that got this alignment now with Dignity Health and who is really providing capital for them to grow but they need both real estate capital and this capital for their baseline growth so, same things we hear from -- we've been hearing and have been talking about for a couple of years. IT investments and investments in new physicians and --
Michael Gorman: Okay, great. And then one last I think for Jeff, can you just talk about, I know it is still minority the portfolio but in the quarter what kind was driving the operating expense line? I know it is not that bigger number but I am just curious that the 5% growth in same store expenses and kind of what that should -- that's going to look like over long term?
John Thomas: Mark, you want to address that. Mark Theine is sitting here so 
Mark Theine: Yes. Certainly, and as you mentioned as the same store percentage isn't that all large 37% of the portfolio, so and Jeff mentioned in his comments that some small adjustments can make large numbers and percentages. The one or actually there are two that are one time event, one is in insurance invoice there is we have one time payment for triple net 2000 increase and expense there. And the second was in increase in expenses that are building with some at health plus where we reduce some of the lease payment, we do that because of -- evolve with that because they try new 20 year lease that will be commencing this fall at that particular property. So couple of one time item that happen in the quarter. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Hughes: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give us an update on maybe any development deals you maybe looking at or projects under development that you have agreed to acquire upon completion and then maybe what yields as potentially would be bought at.
John Thomas: This is John. Some of the biggest maybe we made in this space, we close in July, we did expect that close in June and the project was completed in June but for a couple of reasons we just -- it didn't close until July. So that was the Kennewick, Washington medical office building, very large investment $64 million and our price was about, our deal Jon net is, first year yield is 6.6%, 20 years lease with the 100% lease for the hospital and two in quarter two on 3% increase so really attractive investment, developers were Wisconsin based company and long relationship with governor Thomson and it is really the source and how we secured that deal. We got some optionality on couple of projects that one that may close by the end of the year. Again assuming the CF is delivering them and lieutenant commences and we have every expectation they will, we've got a very attractive price on that in the high eight on that investment. If we proceed with it and frankly we expect we will but we have the ability to walk away as well so got a couple others but smaller maybe -- again we are not taking any development risk and we have some optionality to acquire in the back end and exchange for small either mezzanine debt or small no capital commitment upfront.
Jonathan Hughes: Right. And then thanks for that and then lastly just kind of touching on Jordan's question earlier about the FFO discrepancy versus almost versus model down, you should have breakdown of lease side by grossing that on 2016 which is helpful, if you have to kind of like NOI margin split between specifically for the gross leases. I think that maybe it would be helpful to try and clear some of that going forward.
John Thomas: We lost you hear just for second, what was your -- what was the point the question.
Jonathan Hughes: I was just trying to see if you could maybe give kind of an NOI margin breakdown for the gross leases and kind of help because we were little high on NOI margin that we had model for the quarter.
John Thomas: We will follow up with you on that. 
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
John Kim: Good morning. I was wondering with Deeni's appointment to the executive team, how if any or acquisitions going to change at all? For instance are there going to be more acquisitions with hospital bands or potentially any acquisition from Duke?
John Thomas: Great question. We expect Deeni to bring a lot of his relationships, it is kind of funny John, Deeni, John Sweet, and Deeni must have competing with each other for so many years, chasing the same relationship, same quality and kind of high profile healthcare providers. So again we are excited while the three of us together for the next 18 months or as John Sweet wants to work, we just see additional opportunity to --an additional wheel to the team and the breadth of the relationships and the quality of -- and frankly less competition from Deeni and Duke. So all of those are good things. I don't think it changes so much the nature of it other than Deeni's focus has been very health system driven and but he also had some physician group versus well, exactly the same kind of things we've been pursuing for investments. So broader reach, broader opportunity, and broader ability to get to more opportunities. 
John Kim: And just to clarify your answer to a previous question, are you going to be looking to do more development type of acquisition or something that's some kind of development angle potentially?
John Thomas: Yes. We've always said we like to be kind of the partners to developers and exit path for developers but not building the development engine or team. Did a lot of development with Duke's, much more of development REIT than we are, far more than we are in more healthcares REIT. So as a percentage as we grow the percentage of creative development take out relationships will have will grow with -- because their denominators growing but we will still keep a very modest path to chamber kind of our pipeline committed to those kinds of structures. And with a lot of optionality so I wouldn't really see anything change there the way and how we are approaching development.
John Kim: Okay. And as you are growing your portfolio, how do you feel about your staffing level particularly on the asset management side?
John Thomas: Yes. Asset management is really rounded up well recently we've said couple of really great new additions in that space. Mark Davis, our partner Minneapolis, we bought his portfolio back in the spring. Frankly, he has been a great addition to the organization just to the partnership because he is the kind of front end property manager and asset manager of that portfolio and others in his market that we've been sourcing. And so we feel really very good about that. The scalability the team is for what we got on our plate for foreseeable future and we think is very strong, very high scalability. Same thing on the accounting and kind of other back office we had three recent additions there that, again these are added up physicians but we continue to focus on finding DOC eligible people so we have three great addition in that group as well so feel very good about that. With Deeni's addition we will always be helpful to find some underwriting and local support, always got -- doing it now
John Kim: Jeff, it is maybe little bit early to ask about this but what are you plans for the mortgage debt when they come due in the next couple of years?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, as we can pay off mortgage debt we will be paying off mortgage debt. We like running an encumbered portfolio, I think it is gives us lot of flexibility as we consider our options on the financing side, so I can't imaging that we'd really be adding mortgages to new properties or even keeping mortgage on existing properties. 
John Kim: Okay, great. And then final question, you needed $9 million mezzanine this quarter, it is not very big but can you just maybe elaborate on the strategy of this like how big do you want your mezzanine investments to get and maybe the rationale of this particular investment?
John Thomas: Yes. This is John Thomas again. That doesn't mean to an end, we've had we got a few those mezzanine loan structures out there. They happened to be all with GE that is senior debt, it all have been in connection or most of them have been in connection with developer recap -- recapitalization looking to afford a five year hold post construction. The developer of that facility owns hundreds of millions of dollars buildings and we have had a great relationship through several years and he was looking to recap sell that building, it is very large medical office building built in Jacksonville, every healthcare development firm in REIT that our there that does development chase that opportunities several years ago and landmark wanted and delivered facility lease primary to the University of Florida health systems, so very strong credit, GE put our press release about this as well. It is about $100 million building. So we get a nice premium yield on our mezzanine loan, we got a lot of equity behind this. And we have some rise in the back end, not a pure call option but some preference for rights in the back end deposit building. At the end of the-- at the long term so we see that as mezzanine a nice tool box for investment and building the pipeline over time, lot of optionality, there is no put in that deal. So we will get paid a premier yield on a very premier building that University of Florida is going to build the hospital next to it in the next couple of years, so before we had the -- expect to own it, but we have to see what they have done on that campus as well. And again as a percentage of our pipeline, mezzanine loans as a tool development take out for the tool, I would say 5% to 10% -- 5% less kind of a borrow, kind of asset mix and pipeline commitment expectations.
John Kim: So the mezzanine is going forward, are you going to be investing in them with the idea to purchase the options or purchase the assets?
John Thomas: That's exactly right. It is a good summary and it is like -- we are not all shopping for mezzanine that we are out shopping for great healthcare facility investment, buildings to invest in and some of the owners are start ready to sell and we got good access points in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Kucera with Wunderlich Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Kucera: Hi, good morning, guys. Couple of questions here. Would be -- and I apologize as I had miss this but with the increase in acquisition guidance how do you think about the size of the professional bond offering and kind of where do you think pricing is going to settle in today?
Jeff Theiler: Craig, it is Jeff. So we are flexible on the bond offering. I think right now we are probably looking $250 million $300 million range but again we've always treating that depending on the pipeline that we see going forward and all that. But that's a pretty good base estimate. And what we are seeing now in the private markets is probably all in pricing on 10 year average duration, we have to tranche it out, you could do a 10 or 12 something but probably 2 in a quarter to 2.5 over trajectory, so that's about the pricing that we are seeing right now in the private market and it is about -- if you were to go to public market you probably an additional 25 basis points to 50 basis points is our preference. 
Craig Kucera: Got it. That's helpful. I understand from the modeling perspective. And doc question for you, can you give us some additional color on the concept of the treaty?
John Thomas: What did you say, Craig?
Craig Kucera: Can you tell us a bit about the dream team?
John Thomas: Are you talking about Deeni? Yes, they are adding Deeni to the team. If that's what you are referencing. 
Craig Kucera: Yes. 
John Thomas: I think we started this -- when John and Mark and I started this company with Governor Thomson three years ago, I think we laid out kind of who over time would be the best additions to the organization. Frankly, Jeff Theiler was high on that last as well. So we can be more excited about Deeni coming on Board. And those of who you investors on the phone who know Deeni, I hope you feel the same but there are others hadn't met and he will and I mean Deeni's relationship are so deep and frankly -- most of the deal that I lost they were relationship driven deals were to Deeni so we just think we just building out a great team for the long term and Deeni could be more excited to join the team as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Carroll: Thanks. John, how did you source the IMS Phoenix portfolio? Was that an existing relationship that you had?
John Thomas: They had an advisor so there was some competition but it was not widely marketed. This is not one that you talked about in the internet for everybody to sign up for the advisor or somebody who is -- we have a great relationship within understands kind of what we are looking for and understands in this particular case trying to match her client or team him and her but so slightly marketed but I am sure it went to five or ten organizations that advisor is trying to match make and we got upfront from the physicians quickly and business development quickly and building a great relationship with that group. Like I said we haven't close yet, got a couple of conditions left to satisfy but we do expect those to satisfy and close quickly.
Michael Carroll: And then how do you plan on to grow with that to get physician group, how many years set or how quickly are they actually growing in this entirely through development? Do they have existing properties that you could also purchase? 
John Thomas: Yes. So they own these four, they have some smaller ones but these were the four ones -- the four that we are focused on. And they weren't really marketing the others or seeking buyers for the others. I think it will be a combination of both ground up development that they will fund through their sources and look to exit to those to us upon completion or thereafter. I think we work through the couple of groups over the last two years who -- we now bought the building, rehab for their purposes and they sold to us upon completion of that profit. So I think it will be a combination of both. No specific color on sizing or how large that can be but this is just said a minute ago, a group is added 30 positions this year already and has a -- the part of big accountable care organization in the Phoenix market and growing relationship with Dignity Health and tenant which operates or the brace in the market is also part of that ACO and looking to kind of explain that ACO provider network which is primarily to the IMF physician network. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And when did you usually start talking to I guess tenants with expiration in 2016, those discussion already started?
John Thomas: Yes. Those have already started. You typically look at 12 month to two years to initiate those discussion. Mark mentioned minute ago kind of one time adjustment or operating expense this year would be deferred some lease timing in connection with the extension of a lease, that actually extending out beyond 2028. So most of 2016 discussion has already occurred and we have good insight to where those renewals will be and where the renewals will occur.
Michael Carroll: So you feel very comfortable -- so do you feel comfortable about this expiration over the next I guess 18 months?
John Thomas: Yes. We feel comfortable about it. Yes. We are still working through in terms and how long and the rent bound adjustments but we feel good about and higher renewal rate should be add or increasing rent. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question 
Paul Morgan: Hi, good morning. In terms of the -- as we think about kind of modeling the acquisitions for the rest of the year and I think maybe little earlier in the second quarter, I mean how should we think of timing for the third quarter. Obviously you had healthy amount in July that if we -- for what's in your pipeline, I mean is there anyway for us to get a feel for kind of when those deals might close especially since you let the full year guidance. 
John Thomas: Yes. Hi, Paul. It is John. We mentioned, I mentioned a minute ago if you think about the mid point of our increased guidance we feel very good about that. And I would say now spreading that out through third quarter, fourth quarter. December tends to kind of shutdown but so we will be working, we will be closing deals in December but they most have occurred between now and first of December, if we get for portion of it to move to the top of our guidance again it would be still can fall in the same general timeframe. 
Paul Morgan: Okay. So I mean if we take from where you are now to the mid point of guidance for the full year and kind of smooth it out over the rest of the year, that's a decent guess. 
John Thomas: Yes. It is a decent guess, yes. 
Paul Morgan: Okay. 
John Thomas: With the IMS being sooner. Yes, because IMS we expect to close fairly soon. We have come to that additional amount.
Paul Morgan: And then for the smaller deals that you have announced over the past couple of other you close over the past couple of months .Could you just characterize how did you source those deals and the mix of our preferred from your -- acquisition network that you talk about before versus likely market there or pulling market a deal. 
John Thomas: Yes. Smaller ones are -- tend to be when we think about smaller we think about saying below $10 million, it tend to be relationship driven, part of a bigger relationship or physician referral to the physician next door that the we just had a transaction with so they are not ones, we are up spending a lot of time and effort tracking down their physicians to call us and strike conversation and come for mid primitive physicians we are doing business with. And then we properly price those to -- we are getting much bigger yield so we continue to kind of move up kind of the minimum size deal that we do, but we will do -- if it is a relationship driven, I mean if it is -- if we had investments that's bigger with the relationship and they want us to do the smaller things, we are going to bend over back we are still to meet their needs but at the right price. 
Paul Morgan: And in terms of your pipeline, is that kind of similarly spread between our portfolio and one off referral based deals?
John Thomas: Yes. But between I think $50 million average transaction still about the right average size but no they are once a while get lucky by the vague groups at $116 million or IMS and $141 million. You don't see many hundred million deals a year, not at all space so we are really excited we source through this year. I would -- it just not outer that kind of walking, trying to action of that quality and counting we want to invest in.
Paul Morgan: Okay. And then just last one for me. Now that we have little time to absorb DOC six resolution and are you hearing anything from the other physicians that are changing kind of anything in the industry that might have implications from an investment and perspective for you?
John Thomas: We hear anything new or different I mean that certainly provide some stability then, certainly provide stability for us for the next five years with relationships -- with the physicians' relationship. We haven't count-- we made one best with this year, little bit smaller but with a very large physician owned kind of care organization in the Midwest and this going to back to your last question, it is about $10 million deal but they are growing rapidly and I think DOC experience with the ACO and so strong for them that there are looking for fairly rapid growth and with that come access to real estate opportunities if everybody have with them so some connectivity between the DOC, their incentive to grow and -- with all the insurance company consolidations, headline news in the Wall Street Journal recently, I think both hospitals and physicians feel and an even greater compulsion for consolidation and scale to build, negotiate against even larger and fewer insurance companies got in market. 
Operator: Our next question is from Wilkes Graham with Compass Point. Please proceed with your
Wilkes Graham : Hi, good morning. John or Jeff, just one question for me. With the sort of weakening public bid to reach out there I am curious as you think about looking pass your current pipeline and maybe until 2016, the idea of continuing to grow your portfolio via acquisitions and improved sourcing ability with addition of Deeni and lower cost to capital with investor grade rating, how do you think about your various ways you can use your capital to continue to create value if your stock is not at a level where you wanted its equity.
John Thomas: Yes. I mean I think part of that; I am going to let Jeff answer as well or ask Jeff answer as well. But I think part of that is being disciplined about match funding and slowing down the pace of growth if necessary the stock pricing is not attractive for raising the equity capital. We are not -- we are very committed to low leverage and not being trapped in a high leverage box and I think we will do -- you will see us be very disciplined with our gross. We are high growth rate organization but we can also slowdown that growth with the investment grade ratings, almost $1.5 billion in real estate with very low leverage and 95% lease we can collect their cash and kind of weighted out while we have the prices adjust for our stock price, just a point but it is attractive. 
Jeff Theiler: Yes. It is Jeff. I don't know if I have few much to add to that other than we are not growing for growth sake. We are continuing and monitoring the market and we only grow when we can do so in a way that's going to be accretive to our stakeholders' value. So we are perfectly comfortable seeing, waiting if that's what a market is telling us to do. So we evaluate that, week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter. 
John Thomas: I'll just conclude Wills with we still lot of interest in our OPU, upper restructures and so just another tool in the capital tool box. 
Wilkes Graham : Sure. I am curious if another tool was -- is perhaps selling a non core assets? 
John Thomas: Good question. Eventually we will, we haven't barred any portfolio where we have to buy DMC assets so we actually did dispose one of the kind of the lands in Michigan property this year which was part of the original portfolio, but so really not lot of non core assets, everything we-- $125 million of bonds, we are not a year ago or last month and intentionally purchase those for 10 year plus investment also. So then you don't see anything like that there in the near term but eventually we will move through an annual disposition kind of guidance and process. 
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to John Thomas for closing comments.
John Thomas: Yes. So again we think we had a fantastic quarter and lots of great things coming. But as we said we are all cognizant of the equity market, the debt markets and kind of the adjustments. Again just I thank Jeff and his leadership in achieving investment grade rating and appreciate Moody's recognition of that. And we look forward to seeing you soon in next quarter. So thanks for taking the call today. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at this time.

John Thomas: Thank you, Brad and good afternoon. This morning we hosted our second annual shareholders meeting here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And I am pleased to report the reelection of all our trustees the approval of our employee stock purchase plan and the appointment of Ernst & Young is our auditors. Thank you for your support. We are particular excited about the employee stock purchase plan as many of our teammates have already purchase stock, shares and DOC and want to buy more systematically. This plan will enhance the alignment of interest between our team and shareholders and we appreciate our shareholders recognizing this and providing our team that opportunity. As we mentioned last quarter we are very focused on hiring, retaining and enhancing the capability of DOC eligible teammates. As we reported to our shareholders this morning to straight Physicians Realty Trust is very strong and healthy. We are pleased to report we have now exceeded $1.1 billion and high quality medical office facilities with over 4 million rentable square feet, which is almost 95% occupied and the average lease term of just under nine years. A strong healthy portfolio that we believe will produce reliable and growing cash flow for years to come. Since our IPO it emphasis our strategy to build a high quality portfolio with low leverage and seek investment grade as soon as possible. The strategy that we believe will optimize total shareholder return and long-term value. As of March 31, 2014, we had about $1.05 billion in gross real estate assets and only $157 million in debt. With our recent acquisitions announced this morning, we have almost $1 billion in high quality unencumbered medical office facilities. Our board and management team continued to believe that keeping our properties unencumbered and low leverage is the best capital strategy for the company and more importantly the company’s shareholders. If you study the capital and balance sheet strategies of our peers and the data is clear that the best performing REIT in terms of total shareholder return over the course of time have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and that is our plan. During the first quarter we invested $234 million highlighted by the Minnesota portfolio developed by Mark Davis. Mark and his high quality clients including strong credit health systems like Allina, Fairview, North Memorial Health Care and Essentia are the four thinking providers we seek to work with. These providers want facilities designed to meet their current and future needs of patients. During April, we added four facilities and a total investment of $56.5 million and a number of healthcare systems to our client base. Through investments and facilities in Louisville, Kentucky with Catholic Health Initiatives, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with tenant healthcare and another Essentia Health Ministry outpatient on-campus facility in Michigan as well as another HCA anchored outpatient facility in Jacksonville, Florida. Each of these facilities was owned in part by physicians and we believe the DOC focus on docs continues to be a powerful strategy. CHI tenant especially with their recent announcement to acquire United Surgical Partners and Essentia Health continue to grow and evolve multi-state health systems focused on the future of healthcare delivery services, which we believe will be an outpatient care facilities combining physicians offices, diagnostic services, imaging, ambulatory, surgery and physical therapy or rehab services all of the various physician alignment strategies. Last night our board and team have done it with the CEO a physician of one of the leading healthcare systems in United States. He has led a dominant healthcare system through an evolution focused less on inpatient care and more on outpatient care, consumerism and cost containment. All the while investing heavily in evidence based medicine and information and technology. This Physician CEO has 5,000 patients who actively provide feedback on the services provided by this multi-billion dollar organization. And one of the most important messages he delivered to us is “little things matter”. We believe taking care of our healthcare provider tenants and partners in the visitors to our facilities and taking care of the little things differentiates us in the market and while we’ve been so successful since the IPO, acquiring facilities from owners who care who the next owner will be. There have been some very interesting transactions recently in our market and while we have great respect for our peers big and small we continue to believe our best strategy is to remained focused on medical office and outpatient care with opportunistic investments in small specialized hospitals from time-to-time, but as an unusual opportunities which by definition we did not see occurring anytime soon. You should expect to see is growing our medical office and outpatient care portfolio on and off campus anchored by leading healthcare delivery systems and large multi-specialty and specialty position groups. As we discussed in our last earnings call while the timing is not certain now that we have surpassed the $1 billion mark in real estate assets and market capitalization, we expect to pursue an investment grade rating in 2015 and this success will begin the transformation to a long-term capital structure. Thank you for taking the time to listen and speak with us today. I’ll now ask Jeff Theiler to review our financial results and then we will take some Q&A. Jeff.
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. We start off 2015 was another successful quarter. Our first quarter 2015 funds from operations or FFO were $7.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Our normalized FFO, which added back $5.9 million of acquisition expenses and some other small normalizing adjustments were $13.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 67% from the first quarter of 2014. Normalized funds available for distribution or FAD were approximately $12.5 million or $0.18 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 50% from the first quarter of 2014. We continue to execute on our strong acquisition pipeline in the first quarter closing on over $234 million of high quality investments featuring premium healthcare tenants with an average unlevered first year cash yield of 6.9%. These assets generated $1.9 million in cash NOI in the first quarter. And we acquired all these assets at the beginning of the year they would have generated an additional $2.2 million in cash net operating income. In addition, subsequent to the end of the first quarter we have acquired an additional $56.4 million of properties with an average first year unlevered cash yield of 7.1%. In order to fund these acquisitions while maintaining our commitment to a conservative balance sheet we closed almost 19 million share follow-on offering on January 21 of this year the largest in the company’s history. This offering raised $297.7 million in net proceeds enabling us to fully pay down our existing line of credit and help fund a portion of our first quarter acquisition activity. We also utilize our aftermarket equity program in January raising $4.2 million of total proceeds in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter we had $73 million drawn on our $400 million line of credit combined with our modest existing secure debt of approximately $84 million, our debt to total asset ratio was just under 15% at the end of the quarter. Leaving us well-positioned to continue to execute on the acquisition pipeline we see for the remainder of the year. On the operations front our portfolio is just under 95% leased at the end of the first quarter. This is the second quarter in which we have reported our same-store portfolio statistics. As a remainder our same-store portfolio is relatively small part of our overall portfolio and small adjustments can significantly impact the results. Our same-store cash NOI for the first quarter of 2015 grew 2.4% year-over-year, which was primarily due to expense savings. Finally, our general and administrative costs for the quarter were $3.4 million, or $2.7 million on a cash basis inline with our expectations. To touch on guidance for the remainder of 2015 because we continue to focus on external growth our FFO and FFO per share are highly variable depending on investment volume, investment timing and assumptions for raising capital. This makes it extremely difficult to provide meaningful guidance on these items. However based on our acquisition success in the first quarter of the year and the pipeline we see going forward we remain comfortable with the previously provided acquisition guidance of $500 million to $700 million of total investments for 2015. This guidance includes acquisitions already announced this year and at the midpoint represents a modest increase over the investment volume we achieved last year. With that, I will turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. With that, Brendan please open up the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions.
Juan Sanabria: Hey, good afternoon guys.
John Thomas: Good morning, Juan.
Juan Sanabria: I was just hoping you could remind us how many deals have you guys announced that haven’t closed but are still pending just to give us a sense of easy wins in that pipeline built-up to guidance?
Jeff Theiler: One second, Juan. I think its just two, yes I mean I’m thinking about $64 million.
John Thomas: Yes, Kennewick which is the large development project where we have a takeout which appears to be on schedule for this summer some time.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, and what should we be thinking about in terms of cap rates for that $500 million to $700 million and is the focus mainly on single assets or just assets in secondary markets are you looking to maybe do small portfolios and maybe a little bit tighter in terms of cap rates?
John Thomas: Yes, we’ve got really both, but we are still seeing lots of good volume and high quality around the 7% first year unlevered cash yield, but we are in both in bigger markets and smaller markets.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, and then just on the dividend when do you guys expect to be in a position to be able to have that covered?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Juan, it’s Jeff. We’re looking forward to covering the dividend by the end of the year, that’s our projection, where it’s a priority for us, obviously we feel like we are making good progress towards it, so we expect to be covering it by the end of the year.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, great. And just lastly any update on senior management search you’ve got on ongoing and to any other personnel that you maybe looking to add to the team?
John Thomas: No, I think we are still rounding out some additional accounting staff primarily, but right now as we announced previously John Sweet has extended his contract through at least 2016 and probably by the end of this year we’ll add some additional senior leadership in our business development.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you, guys.
John Thomas: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.
John Kim: Thanks, good afternoon. You’ve done a very good job so far balancing your acquisition growth with maintaining a strong balance sheet, but this year the REITs as you know have been very volatile and are down a little bit this year. If the capital markets are not there what’s the Plan B as far as trying to maintain that balance?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, John, it’s Jeff. I think when we look at our growth and our growth through acquisitions and how we fund that certainly a big part of our objective is to make sure that we are keeping the company safe and keeping in position for a long-term growth. To the extend capital markets aren’t there and I mean I think that would mean a pretty big drop from where we are today. I think we would be comfortable sitting and waiting for pricing to readjust on assets before we start acquiring assets again. I mean we are not going to do deals that are destructive to our equity value. And we are also like we’ve talked about many times committed to maintaining a sensible balance sheet. So if the pricing isn’t there and it doesn’t make sense then we are comfortable passing, we don’t see that as we sit here today.
John Kim: Is it too early to discuss dispositions as a source of capital and also would you potentially look at giving joint ventures?
John Thomas: It’s too early to talk about dispositions, we have a couple of legacy assets, we’ve been trying to sell, we sold one of those but they were small assets they came in the legacy portfolio and generating enough capital really be consider for capital recycling, everything we bought since the IPO we bought with the intention of kind of a 15-year old and they have had no affected all more gotten better than no real issues with the credit loss or anything like that. So the next year the next will probably start thinking about that more routinely. And then on the JV we have lots of kind of private investors that recap to us looking to partner from time-to-time and we want small kind of very small JVs where they had the asset or had an ownership interest in the asset, but again we think we have access to big capital partners and small capital partners in the capital markets general.
John Kim: Okay, and then on your occupancy is there any difference between the leased rates and the physical occupancy in your portfolio?
John Thomas: What’s the difference? I am looking at about 4% of leased versus occupied so 91%.
Jeff Theiler: Just in one portfolio overall…
John Kim: Okay.
John Thomas: Yes, it’s a very small part that’s the difference between leased versus occupied I mean we kind of go under this lease terminology because there might be a small tenant, 2000 square foot tenant in some building that vacate and they are still paying the lease so we feel like leases are little bit more of appropriate term to use.
John Kim: And then if you all ready talked about this and just ignore this question I’ll look it up, but the same-store leased rate decline this period versus the fourth quarter, what was the reason for that?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, we had in the same-store portfolio there are two tenants that left one was just over 3,500 square feet and that was [indiscernible] comments so we had another one in new is just over 3,000 square feet that vacated as well. So two small tenants have left in again this is the downside of having a small same-store portfolios you get relatively small changes in your operating statistic and it just carries a big way.
John Kim: When they left, they left early and had to pay like a termination fee or they just left…
John Thomas: That was all leased role that we had anticipated when we bought the buildings, so again relatively small tenants compared to the overall portfolio.
John Kim: Got it. Okay thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carroll with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.
Michael Carroll: Thanks. Can you guys give us some additional color on your investment pipeline how many deals are you currently tracking and then what’s the composition of that, my guess to meet in your comments that mostly medical office buildings?
John Lucey: Yes, Mike its John. The pipeline continues to be robust I think the same kind of averages has we’ve been producing each quarter recently what we consistently would think about and then back to the kind of the $700 million top end guidance for the year potentially but when you got plenty of pipelines to at least [indiscernible] to that number or you know kind of the midpoint of that $500 million to $700 million. I think most everything in the pipeline right now is medical office and healthcare system anchored maybe on or off campus but healthcare system anchored, so really we’re seeing some very high quality opportunities right now.
Michael Carroll: And then what’s the signs of those potential acquisitions or there mostly smaller deals or do you have some of the large ones like the Minneapolis transaction that you completed.
John Lucey: Yes, we got some nice sizeable opportunities as well but this business is $20 million to $25 million at a time. So we’ve got some $10 million ones we got some $40 million so the averages will look like in next quarter or two look like what we have been doing, so.
Michael Carroll: Okay it seems like over the past I guess several quarters that your investment strategy shifted a little bit you’re acquiring a large type portfolios are larger type assets that you did in the beginning is that kind of by design or do you expect kind of go back to those smaller one-off pipe deals.
John Lucey: No I think its by as we’ve had a opportunity for lower cost of capital having the opportunity to be competitive with the larger buildings the larger on-campus buildings, but it’s well, but as I said minute ago, we still see a lot of nice $10 million opportunities I mean we’ve gotten to a point ourselves we’re looking at things smaller than that is hard to justify the time and energy in some of those transactions but we completed nice $8 million of acquisition Louisville, Kentucky which is brand new ASE leased to the CHI affiliated hospital there. So we see – still see and we’ll still do some transactions like that, but it usually because there is some bigger relationship opportunity out of it.
Michael Carroll: Okay great thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your questions.
Jonathan Hughes: Hi, guys good afternoon. Just curious in the same-store pool operating expenses were down by 9% year-over-year just curious what is the driver behind the significant decline?
Jeff Theiler: Hey, Jonathan. So again for the small pool impact, we have some higher than normal operating expenses in the first quarter of 2014 and it’s a stuff like [pipe first] that we had as maintenance expenses, we have some paneling on a roof that we have to replace that we had an expense through. So there is just a couple out of the ordinary expenses in the first quarter of 2014 that weren’t there in the first quarter of 2015 and that’s really what drove that down.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. And then I’d guess more broader picture, could you guys maybe talk about the impact of potential DOC fix and just any impact that’s having on maybe your underwriting forecast and potentially any valuations out there.
John Thomas: I wouldn’t say it has had a huge impact, obviously it’s a great change – great legislation for physicians just creating their stability that they had to kind of fight for every other year, every 18 months. I don’t think it really changes our underwriting at all I mean you kind of after – ultimately fixing it every 18 months for the last 20 years it came to be predictable. So kind of stabilizes the physician community generally. So I won’t say any real great impact. Hospital reimbursement overall, partly used to pay for that, I think just a continued emphasis on outpatient care are reflecting a continued emphasis on outpatient care and lowering the cost of care that Medicare is going to pay for. So we do think that is kind of support of our strategies of looking outside the big box hospital for real estate investment assets.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay, and then I don’t know if I got it, the size of the current pipeline you set it near the high end of the $700 million guidance range back to this year?
John Thomas: Yes, I didn’t probably said to [indiscernible], that the pipeline is very robust what I meant by that I think we are comfortable with that guidance and at least a midpoint or the higher end of that guidance with the pipeline in front of us.
Jonathan Hughes: Okay. All right, that’s it for me. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your questions.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, gentlemen. Just question regarding sort of a little bit bigger picture in that, you guys have obviously grown your scale a bit and as if effective in the first quarter you deleverage yourselves and availed yourselves of some capital and John having sort of been here before I’m kind of curious if getting to this better scale and having closed all the acquisitions that you have closed to date kind of just changes the opportunity set at all and if you notice that and if there is anything you can speak to there where you may see bigger deals or just be able to toss your hat on the ring on bigger opportunities, what that flow might look like?
Jeff Theiler: Yes, Jordan I think that’s a good observation I mean we’ve clearly got into a critical math and we got $1 billion – almost a $1 billion of unencumbered real estates, we have a lot of capital or a lot of different tools in the tool box now for capital. So we can’t look at bigger deals there are some fairly large deals out there that with our assets and clients that we know well we’ll take a look at a year ago we probably wouldn’t spend anytime at all. But again our regular way investing is we are going to continue from the foreseeable feature which I think is years which is - this is a very fragmented business and we pick up a lot of business again $20 million to $25 million at a time and that’s what’s sitting in some of us. So when we talk about pipeline we are really focused on those kind of opportunities. And then in addition to that looking at some bigger opportunities floating around the market.
Jordan Sadler: Is it safe to say that the larger portfolio deals even a couple $100 million tend to have come along with sort of a premium price tag?
Jeff Theiler: They generally do so and kind of think about that a couple of different ways, but 50 basis points probably the minimum when you get into those backup, you get the big three involved in and you get anybody is looking for a big opportunity is going to pay a premium for the bulkiness of it. The Davis portfolio was frankly he was particularly focused on a specific type of partner, our investors know the assets and so. And I think Dave will get those at a very attractive price and probably didn’t have as much portfolio premium there because he was willing to take a discount because we wanted to be very selective with the owner – the next owner.
Jordan Sadler: And then just last one here on the operating side I am curious what you are seeing in terms I know there were some optimism previously about that being able to continue to pick up some occupancy and I am curious if that I assume that’s still there and then what you are seeing in terms of the ability to goner rent bumps 3% plus in your… 
Jeff Theiler: Yes, that’s market by market, but I mean the few renewals that are left for this year in it $19 bucks kind of expiring so we should be able to continue to move those up. And some markets are 2% markets, some markets are 3% market. So we continue to focus kind of on that 2.5% average across the portfolio, but the near-term we don’t have a lot of expiring so we don’t have any roll downs that risk and overall we only have about 5% in the entire portfolio available, so 30,000 feet of that is one building that we would again in Lansing, Michigan that may move into more a disposition effort than a leasing effort. So Mark has done a – Mark and his team had done a great job not only with renewals but advancing the absorption of the other space. Feel very good about it.
Jordan Sadler: Okay thank you.
John Thomas: Thanks Jordan. End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you, we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to John Thomas for closing remarks.

Operator: Greeting, and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust's fourth quarter and yearend 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer, for Physicians Realty Trust. Thank you. You may begin.
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust's fourth quarter 2014 conference call and audio webcast. With me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; and John Lucey, Principle Accounting and Reporting Officer. During this call, John Thomas will provide a company update and overview of recent transactions and our strategic focus. Then I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter and our thoughts for 2015. Following that, we will open the call for questions.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company's CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Good morning. Physicians Realty Trust established a foundation for success in healthcare real estate in 2014, and we capped it off with another strong fourth quarter of investments and growth in our cash flow. During the fourth quarter we completed $104.8 million of investments, highlighted by a number of investments with Pinnacle Health in Pennsylvania, the Carle Clinic Foundation in Illinois and a hospital MOB monetization with Columbus Regional Health in Columbus, Georgia. 2014, we completed $565 million worth of investments with leading healthcare providers in the communities they serve, bringing our total real estate assets to $819 million, as of December 31, 2014. We have since closed on another $172 million of investments in very high-quality medical office facilities as of February 27, 2015, and now own just over $990 million of medical real estate. With over a $100 million of additional asset under a binding purchase agreement, we expect to exceed more than $1.1 billion in gross real estate investments in the very near future. I would also like to highlight the growth in our portfolio-wide occupancy rate, which increased to 94.6% by December 31, 2014, both with the acquisition of high-quality well occupied facilities, but also through the active internalization of property management and leasing, led by Mark Theine, our Senior Vice President of Asset Management. With the recent 2015 investments, we now have more than 3.5 million square feet of medical office and outpatient care facilities, and are approaching a critical mass for cost-effective property and asset management. This has enabled us to strengthen our normalized funds from operations as well as pay a fourth quarter dividend to our shareholders of $0.2250 per share paid on February 6, 2015. As we move into '15, we are excited about the opportunities we see in front of us. We have a strong balance sheet with significant capital available in light of our $400 million unsecured line of credit, and a very successful equity offering in January, which raised almost $300 million in net proceeds. This will provide us with the firepower we need to capitalize on our growing pipeline and high-quality assets. With our substantial growth, we have been prudent stewards of our resources, but have made investments in people, people we view as DOC eligible, to support our accounting and property management underwriting and investment teams. We are pleased that Brad Page has joined us recently as Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Brad and his legal assistant, [ph] Jill Marinello have been so critical to the success of DOC from the beginning, and we are honored that they have moved in-house, which will not only save us cost, but make us even more efficient and effective in identifying, underwriting, closing and managing our medical facilities in our organization overall. John Sweet, our Founder, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, has recently agreed to extend his employment through the end of 2016, and we will be working to identify his successor later this year. We are so grateful to John and his tremendous success in sourcing and closing so many fantastic new physician relationship investments in 2014 and already in this year. I want to be as clear as possible about our current status and the direction and future of this company. We just completed our annual three-day strategic planning discussion with our Board, led by DOC's Chairman of Board, Governor Tommy Thompson. Physicians Realty Trust trustees reaffirmed our long-term strategic plan to build a visionary organization to stand the test of time. We have a unique culture and talents, as we know healthcare and focus on the real estate needs of high-quality physicians and providers, if they serve their patients. We believe investments consistent with that core ideology will allow us to make attractive returns on invested capital, relative to our cost of capital, and thus delivering outstanding total shareholder returns. While we've had tremendous success in 2014, we believe we can do better, and we'll focus on getting better with everything we do, finding more and higher quality healthcare facilities, more physician and provider relationships, who meet our investment criteria and be excellent stewards of our shareholders' and stakeholders' capital. We didn't achieve everything we wanted in 2014, but we continue to have a disciplined focus on three fundamentally important strategic philosophies. One, the dividend should be covered by AFFO, that is real investments in our target asset classes. And it is very important to keep that policy in mind, as we evaluate short and long-term investment opportunities as well as balance sheet management. We're getting closer, and as you can see, to achieving this goal, but we're not there yet, but we will be soon. Number two, we are healthcare people, and as such, we continue to differentiate ourselves, especially in our ability to evaluate, select and then work with our clients and partners, and those that are expected to pay us rent, to help them be more successful and thus provide greater value to our shareholders. And number three, we should be mindful of our founding investors and our current shareholders and the opportunity to attract future long-term investors, as we build and grow this visionary company. As a REIT, we are mindful of the short and long-term tools to fuel and grow this organization, and we will select the tools available, mindful of our core ideology and strategic philosophy. While the timing is not certain, now that we are about to surpass the $1 billion mark in real estate assets and market capitalization, we expect to pursue an investment-grade rating in 2015, and if successful, begin the transformation to a long-term capital structure. We also believe for now that the focus on medical office and outpatient facilities is the most appropriate healthcare real estate asset class to achieve our plan and short and long-term goals. But as always, we will evaluate opportunities when appropriate for other potential healthcare real estate, but we don't expect that to occur in the foreseeable future. Thank you for taking the time to listen and speak with us today. I will now ask Jeff Theiler to review our financial results. Thank you.
Jeffrey Theiler: Thank you, John. We had an extremely successful fourth quarter of 2014, which capped off a very exciting year. Our funds from operations or FFO for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $9.7 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Our normalized FFO, which added back $1.6 million of acquisition expenses and some other small normalizing adjustments were $11.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share, an increase of 29% from the third quarter of 2014. Normalized funds available for distribution or FAD, which consist of normalized FFO, adjusted for various non-cash items and recurring capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, were approximately $10.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share. We closed on approximately $105 million of real estate investments in the fourth quarter of 2014, at an average first year cash yield of 7.6%. These assets generated about $800,000 of cash net operating income in the fourth quarter. And if we had owned these assets for the entire quarter, they would have generated an additional $1.2 million. We were able to find over $550 million of attractive investment opportunities in 2014, more than tripling our asset base, also at an average first year unlevered cash yield of 7.6%. Following-up on that strong momentum, we have announced another $172 million of investment so far in 2015, highlighted by the $116 million Minnesota portfolio, one of our most exciting and certainly the largest acquisition in our company's history. The first year cash yield on acquisitions completed so far in 2015 is 6.8%, which is lower than our usual yield, but reflective of the very high-quality of assets we acquired, particularly the Minnesota portfolio, which we acquired for 6.4% unlevered cash yield. As usual, we have been very conservative with our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of last year and through the first part of 2015. We utilized our at-the-market or ATM facility for the first time in the fourth quarter, raising roughly $55 million. The majority of these proceeds were raised in conjunction with our inclusion into the Morgan Stanley RIET Index, which provided several days of very strong investor demand that we matched with issuance from our ATM. We ended the year with $78 million of secured debt and $138 million drawn on the revolver, for a debt to enterprise value of 19% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.6x. In January of 2015, we raised an additional $4.2 million on the ATM, but more notably completed our fourth follow-on equity offering, raising $311 million in gross proceeds. This offering funded our new acquisitions and enabled us to pay down the existing the revolving credit facility. All of our acquisition and funding decisions are made with the intention of creating a company that is positioned for long-term success. One of the key pillars of that success is having a strong balance sheet, and we will continue to keep that focus in 2015. General and administrative cost for the quarter were $2.6 million overall and $2.0 million on a cash basis. We had seasonally low professional fees this quarter and expect these to tick up slightly going into 2015. We also recorded an impairment of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter, which was a reduction in the book value of our vacant property in Lansing, Michigan. This property was part of the original Ziegler portfolio, and was also vacant during the formation transactions associated with our IPO. Finally, to touch on our expectations for 2015, our FFO and FFO per share are dependent on investment volume, investment timing and assumptions for raising capital. Those factors are highly variable, making it extremely difficult to provide meaningful guidance. However, based on the composition of our current investment pipeline, we are comfortable providing guidance of $500 million to $700 million of total investments for 2015. This guidance includes acquisitions already announced this year and at the midpoint, represents a modest increase over the investment volume we achieved last year. With that, I'll turn it back over to John.
John Thomas: Thank you. Melissa, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kucera with Wunderlich Securities.
Craig Kucera: Looking at your pipeline, I just wanted to get some clarity. Did you say you had another $100 million under contract currently, or did I give that incorrectly?
John Thomas: Yes, we've got another $100 million under contract. We have announced I think all of that. The biggest part of that is the Kennewick, Washington medical office building that's under construction. We expect that to close this summer, but we've got more than $25 million of other assets under contract.
Craig Kucera: Appreciate the color on the G&A. You mentioned some cost savings by bringing things inside. What's the current expectation this year for G&A? Is it still sort of, I believe, at last it was maybe in the $14 million plus or is that still on track?
John Thomas: I think that's pretty consistent with what we are thinking this year. I'd say, on a cash basis, we are probably going to run around $2.5 million a quarter, maybe a touch higher, so on a cash basis maybe $10 million to $11 million for 2015, and then probably another roughly $1 million a quarter for stock-based comps, so overall, $14 million to $15 million.
Craig Kucera: And then finally, and I'll jump back in the queue. In the past you guys have looked also at some of the specialty hospitals. I think the cap rates on those has sort of been arched down to where MOB is. Is that still the situation today? And is that why you sort of are saying you're continuing to go the path of going more for MOBs and outpatient facilities?
John Thomas: It's generally the case, but we do have a couple of, I'd say, exciting opportunities early of that evaluation, but we're seeing a couple of specialty hospitals at appropriate pricing, we may or may not pursue, but you'll see us pick one of those off here and there. But the very focus is on the outpatient care and medical ops going.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Quick question on the acquisition guidance. Expectations on pricing, should it be more consistent with the transactions completed year-to-date. I'd imagine obviously that would be skewing it or should we expect the balance to sort of move back up toward the levels we saw last year? Just what are we seeing?
John Thomas: I think, if we found quality, we've paid up for quality. And then Minnesota is a very high-quality portfolio, and we felt both is necessary, but valuable to make that investment in the 6.4% cap rate range, but we see most of our pipelines between 6.5% and 7.5%, so 7% is a good blended number, but we've got plenty of opportunities above 7% and where we can find quality, it seems to be necessary to pay somewhere in the high-6s.
Jordan Sadler: In terms of financing the activity, obviously, you've got quite a bit of powder for now, but I guess, given sort of the anticipation of trying to move toward the investment grade rating this year, what are we thinking in terms of the financing strategy for the year?
John Thomas: When we raised our offering in January, we did that with the intention of not having to go back to the market, in advance of going for investment grade rating. And that's assuming our acquisitions as we see them today. So if we get a great opportunity obviously, that thinking could change. But as we look at it based on the pipeline that we see today, we think that we've got plenty of dry powder for that and can achieve all those acquisitions and still maintain a sensible leverage.
Jordan Sadler: So you didn't think you'd have to go back to the market for the bulk of the year, to get through this acquisition guidance, you thought the January deal would hold you over through?
John Thomas: I think it's fair to say that we don't think we would go back to the market for the bulk of the year, that's fair.
Jordan Sadler: So was the ATM kind of turned off post that deal as well or -- I know there was a small amount of issuance, I think, just prior?
John Thomas: Yes, exactly. So there was a little bit of issuance prior to that deal, and since that deal has been turned off.
Jordan Sadler: Lastly, just on the dividend. I know that first philosophy, sort of the opportunity to be covering the dividend with AFFO. What's the time frame looking like based on sort of what's under contract going forward? Is this yearend opportunity?
John Thomas: I think by the end of the year, we should be in good shape with that. Obviously, we had the big equity raise in January, which pushed us out a little bit more than it look last year, but certainly by yearend we think we'll be in good shape with our dividend coverage.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with MLV & Co.
Paul Morgan: Just talking about acquisitions more broadly, when you were formed in a lot of your kind of strategic outline, you gave yourself the flexibility to pursue deals outside kind of the narrow core sub-sectors that you've actually focused on. As you look into '15 and over the next several quarters at least, do you see yourself still sticking to essentially the portfolio as it is now, or do you ever take a look at healthcare real estate outside those areas? And is that a longer term thing, or are you happy with where you're looking at right now?
John Thomas: I was trying to articulate that at the end of my comments. Generally, we spend a lot of time at this Board meeting and strategic planning discussion with exactly that question. And I think long-term, we will broaden and diversify, but right now I mean outpatient care medical office is really our core. And we see tremendous opportunities to continue to grow in that space and thinks that where our focus should remain. But we see what most people see on the other asset classes as well. We'll keep our eye on it, and be opportunistic. But I wouldn't expect to see anything in the foreseeable future, but long-term broadly.
Paul Morgan: So you don't really spend much time looking at deals outside of that area right now at least?
John Thomas: No, just because we have more than we can process in that office space, but all joking aside, I mean that's where our core focus is and we're going to stay focused on that.
Paul Morgan: And then you had some OP units in Indiana deal this quarter. I mean, how is the conversation with sellers going in terms of using their units as currency? Should we expect to see more of that in terms of what your near-term pipeline is over the course of the year?
John Thomas: I think it will just continue probably at the same pace. We estimate tremendous tool for us. So many of the sellers we're talking to are physicians that have self developed their own facilities and enter into sale-leasebacks with us, and so they like the attractiveness of that tax deferral and they like the investment in DOC. So a lot of our early transactions were OPU transactions and those physicians have held on to their OPUs and the value that they've written and have been great referrals of other opportunities for us. So you continue to see that, but just it's really on the case-by-case basis. We're probably getting a little more selective about where we offer it, but the Minnesota transaction had a component with the OPUs. It was a brand new building. So it was important part of there negotiation and convincing the seller there to go ahead and make the trade now.
Paul Morgan: Then just lastly, what about development? I mean, are there opportunities you're exploring with your existing tenants or with new projects? Is this something that we should look for this year?
John Thomas: So it's kind of all of the above. So I want to be very clear about that. We have several tenants who are in need to expand their existing facilities and we are very engaged with them about doing that. So you'll see that kind of development, which is six to nine month kind of funding. They'll typically fund the construction, and then will refund that and amend the lease when they're completed, is the typical way we approach that. In the future, you may see us again partnering with a developer and looking to fund completely pre-leased or highly pre-leased outpatient care facilities. But that's not a core part of our near-term strategy. The Kennewick, Washington investment that's under contract is a development take out, where we didn't put any capital into that. We're not at any development risk. The developer there has got to complete the construction, and the lease it's a 100% leased and the leases got to commence before we're obligated to close or would close. So we'll see some of that as well, but kind of 10% of our target investments are focused on those kind of opportunities, but we're not going to take development risk. We're not going to take speculative development at all.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: I was hoping you could speak to the pipeline of opportunities on the acquisitions in? And what you're seeing in terms of small deals versus more medium or large size portfolio opportunities? And kind of where your focus is and where you want to butter your bread on the deal front and this spread on the cap rates between those two opportunity sets.
John Thomas: I think the Minnesota investment, which we'll probably talk about for years to come through, we're so excited about it. That was a rare portfolio of that quality and essentially brand new real estate. The average age of those eight buildings is less than three years old, and one of them just went into service. So those types of portfolios, if you will, are kind of few and far between, but we continue to move up the minimum kind of dollar amount of our transaction. I mean this is a $20 million to $25 million space. We've got plenty of $10 million investments, so we're evaluating several in the $25 million to $40 million. So that's the sweet spot for this space, but anything that gets larger, we'll look at. And hopefully, like Minnesota be somewhat off market and have the opportunity to earn the opportunity.
Juan Sanabria: So the focus remains from small portfolios and single asset transactions?
John Thomas: Yes, I mean, I guess in contrast to M&A or anything like that. I mean, we'll evaluate all of the opportunities that are presented to us or that we find, but you'll just continue to see us execute our core plan.
Juan Sanabria: And then, I guess just a question for Jeff. So what would be the plan or what's your current thinking when you eventually do get the investment grade about what you'd like to do to the balance sheet?
Jeffrey Theiler: As we think about building a long-term company and having a stabilized balance sheet, in my mind that's terming out long-term fixed rate debt, so call it 10-year debt, and running leverage at probably the lower investment grade levels. So we want to continue to be very conservative. But for us it's been a little bit unsatisfactory, because we've had a revolver and you have this growing the revolver and then paying it off and it's a little bit of the yo-yo leverage plan. So I think it will be a much better outcome to have long-term debt out there, so you can have a little bit more stabilized capital structure and be able to plan your earnings, et cetera a little bit better.
Juan Sanabria: And then I wanted to follow up on the ATM. So is the plan not to have to tap the ATM for the balance of the year to sort of match fund acquisitions as you complete them over the course of the year or just -- 
John Thomas: I think we'll be flexible with that. And I think it's going to depend on the acquisition volume, when it comes. It's easier to predict the total for the entire year, but it's very difficult to predict when those opportunities are going to present themselves, in which quarter. So I think we'll be flexible with the ATM. It's certainly not our plan to just have it running all year, but we'll certainly look at that, if match funding, certain types of acquisitions makes sense, then we might do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.
Jonathan Hughes: I was wondering, if you could comment on rent spread growth and the types of tenants you saw leasing space during the quarter? And then if you could talk about how you're thinking about rent spreads on the 2015 expirations, and granted you only have 3% and 4% of rents expiring this year and next, but any color there would be helpful.
John Thomas: Yes, I'm going to have Mark Theine to answer that question. I will say, while he is getting to the phone, last year's renewals averaged 2% or better and we continue to see the opportunity to move around. So we don't have much 2015 expirations, but Mark has been engaged in that. Mark, have you got any comment?
Mark Theine: Yes, absolutely. In 2015, we have just 3% of the portfolio we're doing. So it's a very small size of the portfolio, 31 leases in total. And as John just said, for 2014, we had about 2% spread on lease renewal. And during the year, we had 82% retention rate. And again, a very small percentage of the portfolio we're renewing, so we are seeing leases rolling up.
John Thomas: Yes, I think that what we didn't retained was practices that expanded and needed more space than we had available in the building. So we're really excited about the work Mark's doing in keeping tenants happy, but are able to move around at appropriate levels.
Jonathan Hughes: And then are you seeing any current tenants like in the multi-tenant MOBs looking to proactively the new leases or expand space, given the performance within the sector?
Mark Theine: Absolutely, yes, we've had quite a few tenants that we're looking proactively to expand their lease now at this time.
Jonathan Hughes: And then, I guess, just one last one. I know we've already talked a lot about acquisitions. But the $500 million to $700 million execution guidance, is that a net of any dispositions? Do you anticipate recycling maybe some legacy properties in the new investments?
John Thomas: Yes, we've announced the contract to sell one of the small facilities in Columbus, Ohio from the legacy portfolio. We don't have any active disposition plans, but it would not be a material amount of cash for that. So that's really a gross and net number, if you will.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wilkes Graham with Compass Point.
Wilkes Graham: John, just one question. As you continue to increase the acquisition guidance, you guys obviously have done a great job with the portfolio thus far. Can you just give us some color on maybe how many deals you end up turning down and maybe what the mix of those assets that you pass on between price and credit?
John Thomas: We don't keep a formal tally of that, Wilkes, but I would tell you that most of the things we pass on are the widely-marketed auctions. I think every day there is a new medical office building or hospital that pops up on the internet for sale and we rarely evaluate those. And that's probably 80% or 70% of what we see. So the remaining 20% to 30%, I think it turns into the quality of the physician or provider of the quality of the markets that they're in, the quality of the real estate they're in that narrows the focus. Kind of assets in existing markets where we're at or expansion opportunities with existing clients usually jumps to the top of our priority chain, and usually most successful, kind of repeat business or direct referrals from existing. So I'd say its 10% to 20% of everything we see. We pursue and we close on 75% of that, if it meets underwriting.
Wilkes Graham: I think this was asked before, but are portfolios anymore widely available than they were six months ago in terms of the products you see out there at returns you like?
John Thomas: Yes, it's about the same, and I think the key question is if the returns you like. There are some lower quality portfolios flooding around, which we don't even sign the NDA and get the -- we know enough about the market, so we don't spend time on those. The Davis portfolio Minneapolis was a very exciting find and surprised, frankly. I would say it's one of the best portfolios I've been involved in the last five years and pretty proud of what we were able to accomplish in the past, but those are few and far between. But one thing about the Davis portfolio is Mark Davis, the developer of those, is taking the proceeds from the transaction and reloading with a number of projects he is already working on and starting to lease up for development later this year. We are going to have the opportunity in 2016 probably in order to continue to grow that relationship in that market, so long-winded answer to your question. But those are few and far between, but if they're out there, we see them. Some of the portfolios have traded in the last six months, just traded at prices that didn't make sense to us.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of our allowed time for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remark. End of Q&A
John Thomas: Again, thanks everybody. Thanks for taking the time to join the call this morning. As you can probably tell from our voice, we are very excited about what we accomplished in 2014. We are very focused on building a great visionary company here and continuing that growth in 2015. We just look forward to seeing you soon and talking with you in May. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-11-12 12:00:00) =====
Executives: David Burke – Investor Relations John Thomas – Chief Executive Officer, Trustee Jeff Theiler – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Karin Ann Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Joe Ng – MLV & Company Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities Collin Philip Mings – Raymond James & Associates Wilkes Graham – Compass Point 
Operator: Greeting, and welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Burke of The Ruth Group. Thank you Mr. Burke, you may begin.
David Burke: Good morning and welcome to Physicians Realty Trust third quarter 2014 conference call and audio webcast. With me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; John Sweet, Chief Investment Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer, John Lucey, Principle Accounting and Reporting Officer; and Mark Theine, Senior Vice President-Asset and Investment Management. I’d like to remind you that today’s call will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that can be identified by words such as belief, expect, anticipate, plans, project, seek and similar expressions and involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors as set forth in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, David, and thank you for joining us today. As David mentioned, my name is John Thomas, President and CEO of Physicians Realty Trust. I apologize I’m having a cold this morning, so I’ll do as best as I can. I will share with you some of our achievements for the third quarter of 2014 as well as some of our strategic things for 2015. Jeff Theiler, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will walk through our financial results for the quarter and then we’ll be pleased to take any questions that you may have. During the quarter, we invested more than $226 million in 13 high quality medical office buildings and one surgical hospital at an average first year cash yield of 7.3%. Since the July 19, 2013 IPO through October 31, 2014, we have grown our portfolio from approximately $110 million to over $700 million towards that medical office facilities and specialty hospitals. When we announced our overnight equity raise, September 08, 2014, we announced $180 million of pending new investments. We have completed $161 million of those announced investments plus an additional $23 million investments for a total of $184 million of investments, closed since the equity raise in September. A $90 million investment announced in September that has not yet closed continues to be in our pipeline has been a waiting satisfaction of a closing addition and we expect that to occur in the near future. In other words, we continue to put our investors’ capital to work quickly, efficiently, and prudently. Working primarily with our physician and healthcare provider relationships around the country to find attractive facilities, leased a high quality physicians and providers. John Sweet, our Chief Investment Officer, in particular was very successful this past quarter sourcing and closing off-market transactions. Looking at the past 15 months of our life as a public company, we have sourced about two-thirds of our transactions off-market and the remaining one-third had mostly been narrowly marketed. We appreciate the support of those physicians and other providers who have interested us with their facilities and many of these clients have referred other opportunities to us for investment. Our reputation of a trusted partner to our physicians and providers is very important to us and we believe it is very important to the long-term value we are working to create for our shareholders and other stakeholders. In addition to our successful growth in the third quarter, we continue to develop our internal controls infrastructure with a successful IT implementation and other structural investments that are allowing us to internalize more of our property and asset management. We expect these efforts will allow us to continue to build best-in-class customer service to our tenants and visitors, while improving the margins on our buildings and achieving high retention rates over time. Mark Theine and John Lucey have worked hard to achieve our goals and have exceeded expectations managing our portfolio and implementing our long-term asset and accounting management tools this year, as we build a lasting healthcare real estate platform and portfolio. As we look at 2015, we remain focused on rapid, albeit prudent growth. Our pipeline remains robust and focused on medical office billings and we believe we can exceed $1 billion in assets in the near future with stable, high quality tenants and high occupancy across our portfolio. We will manage our platform in 2015 to be well-positioned for continued growth as we evolve to a long-term balance sheet and capital structure. We made substantial strides this year lowering our cost of capital with tremendous support from our investors and bank partners, allowing us to acquire high quality real estate. We want to continue that evolution in 2015 with a continued pure play focused on medical office facilities with an emphasis on private pay revenue and the occasional surgical and other specialized hospital and we see appropriate valuations. We make these investments in the short-term focused on the long-term success of each investment and that’s the long-term success of our organization to deliver value and the best possible total shareholder returns. Jeff, please share our third quarter financial results and the terms of our own secured line of credit and we will then be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. We’re pleased to report another successful quarter of operations. Our funds from operations or FFO for the third quarter of 2014 were $2.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Normalized FFO, which adds back $2.9 million of acquisition expenses and the $1.8 million one-time shared services amendment payment to Ziegler were $2.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Normalized funds available for distribution or FAD, which consists of normalized FFO adjusted for various non-cash items and recurring capital expenditures, including tenant improvement from leasing commissions, were approximately $7 million or $0.17 per diluted share. As previous announced we completed $226 million of acquisitions in the third quarter, including the closing of $114 million of acquisitions on September 30 the last day of the quarter. The fall of the acquisitions that took place in the third quarter, have been completed on the first day of the quarter, our rental revenues would have increased by an additional $3.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by $1.4 million and operating expenses would have increased by $0.1 million. Our normalized FAD per share would have been higher by roughly $0.04 had the acquisition draws on the line of credit to fund the acquisitions and follow on equity offering occurred at the beginning of the quarter or another way to say it is that our current run rate FAD is roughly $0.21 per share. General and administrative costs were $4.4 million in the third quarter. These costs were higher than usual as they are impacted by a onetime $1.8 million payment as part of our amendment agreement with Ziegler. The amendment of the shared services agreement enabled us to bring all of our accounting functions in-house, which will help us comply with the enhanced internal controls that will be required to meet in 2015 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. From an overall cost standpoint, we don’t project material difference between the shared services agreement and paying for the services individually in the near-term. And over the long run, it will allow us to scale up the company more efficiently. We had an exceptionally busy quarter on the financing side, as we continue to strengthen the balance sheet and improve our access to capital. In September, we completed our third follow on equity offering, raising nearly $146 million in net proceeds, which were used primarily to pay down debt and to fund acquisitions. In addition to this traditional follow on offering, we also implemented our first at-the-market equity program. This program will allow us to periodically and strategically issue equity at current market prices. The aggregate amount of equity we can issue under our at-the-market equity program is $150 million. In this quarter we also made significant improvements to our credit facility, we transitioned from a $200 million secured credit facility to $400 million unsecured credit facility, greatly increasing our financial flexibility. In addition, the facility has a $350 million accordian feature, which would increase our overall capacity to $750 million. Not only did we increase the size of the facility, but we’re able to achieve better pricing. And our current overall leverage level less than 35% debt to assets, our rate of interest in the lines outstanding balance is LIBOR plus 150 basis points, an improvement of 115 basis points from our previous facility. At the end of the third quarter, we had $70 million drawn on a new line of credit in addition to $83 million of secured debt. This brings our leverage to 22% on a debt to total assets metric, providing excellent flexibility to continue executing on the external growth opportunities we see in the pipeline. As we mentioned on the last call, our FFO was highly dependent on external growth and is also impacted by the timing of any capital events such as follow-on equity offerings. The time of these events is very difficult to predict, making it also difficult to provide meaningful guidance on an FFO per share basis. However, we do have visibility on the overall size of the acquisition pipeline and feel comfortable providing estimates on overall closings in the fourth quarter. Since September 30th, we have closed one additional transaction, the Pinnacle Health portfolio, for $23 million. In addition to this transaction, we currently expect to acquire to between $40 million to $80 million of additional properties during the rest of the fourth quarter. If we achieve this target, it will bring our acquisition volume for the year to between $510 million and $550 million of high-quality medical facility with a projected average cash cap rate over a 7.5%. With that, I’ll turn it back over to John for some closing remarks.
John Thomas: Thank you, Jeff. Before I turn it over to questions, I would also like to mention that Physicians Realty Trust was recently selected for inclusion into Morgan Stanley REIT Index. This recognition for a company just over a year old is a testament to the success we have had, executing our company’s business plan, as well as the tremendous support we have seen from our lenders and investors over the past year. So thank you. With that, we’ll open it up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ann Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. John, I just wanted to ask you about the deal pipeline. You had obviously a great year this year with $510 million to $550 million, probably before year end done. Based on what you’re seeing out there today, do you think 2015 could be as big as 2014 or even bigger, what’s your sense?
John Thomas: Good morning, Karin. I think what we continue to see in the pipeline in the near future is really a repeat or better for next year as it looks right now. So we’ve been averaging around $150 million per quarter in investments and we see that right now for the foreseeable future, but we’ll give better acquisition guidance after the fourth quarter call, early next year.
Karin Ann Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. And do you expect to see less competition given a disruption in the non-traded at the enlisted [ph] REIT sector these days? Do you run into them? Do you compete with them often?
John Thomas: We don’t compete with them often. I think is back to be seeing what’s going to happen with the disruption there whether that capital just moves to different players. There are multiple players in that market and frankly we’ve been running into others more than ARCP and growth as have been reloading and then they’ve had the recent issues. But I would expect to continue to see them active in the market for their foreseeable future. But bottom line is we don’t go head-to-head with them too much, but they certainly have an impact on pricing expectations, which is fairly transparent in the market. 
Karin A. Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.:  Okay. Next question is have you taped the ATM yet or do you plan to tap it with some other deals you have coming up?
Jeff Theiler: Hey Karin, it’s Jeff. We have not taped the ATM yet. We’ve actually been in the blackout period through the closing of the credit facility and then also into the earnings season here. So we haven’t tapped it. We’re certainly looking at that opportunistically, as we go forward. I mean it’s a great way to match fund smaller acquisitions. So we think as an additional tool in our tool kit and we’ll continue to evaluate these for that quarter-to-quarter.
Karin A. Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Great. And then just last question, do you have a bias today towards shorter or longer lease terms when you guys are looking at deals.
Jeff Theiler: That’s a great question, Kary. I think as we’ve continue to evolve and internalize our property management, asset management and if you look at our lease terms right now, our average lease is over ten years. We have, I mean, 1% to 2% per year in our current portfolio of lease maturities. So I think we’re starting to at least evaluate sprinkling in some shorter-term lease maturities when the acquisition, pricing and then in the market ramps in that particular facility or market attractive to as they take advantage of the ability to increase rents in the near term and actively manage that portfolio. I’ve talked about this before and we’re [indiscernible] and actively managing, operating healthcare real estate company. And I think that’s part of our, now that we’ve internalized, have the controls and the tools to do that, and frankly the team to do that. We’re going to start doing more and more of that on a strategic basis.
Karin A. Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with MLV & Company. Please proceed with our question.
Joe Ng – MLV & Company: Hi, this is Joe Ng for Paul.
John Thomas: Hey, Joe.
Jeff Theiler: Hi Joe.
Joe Ng – MLV & Company: Hi, excluding the $1.8 million amendment payment, G&A was $2.6 million during the quarter approximately 1.5% of your gross new [ph] asset? And you’ve mentioned that the goal is to bring the G&A level to below 1% of your gross new [ph] assets. So how should I think about the run rate of G&A in 2014 and 2015?
Jeff Theiler: Hey Joe thanks for the question. In the past we’ve given guidance of about $7.5 million to $8.5 million of cash G&A for year. So we were on $8 million pace this quarter. As a growth company, the G&A can jump sporadically when we have to plan for additional growth and scaling up as we take advantage of the opportunities. Recently, we hired a new VP of Asset Management out of Atlanta to help start building our presence in that region as well as some office support and getting all the systems in place for Sarbanes-Oxley. So over the next couple of quarters, I predict cash G&A to rise from about $2 million this quarter, probably closer to about $2.5 million over the next few quarters. However, as you said and we’ve talked about, we’re committed to achieving this 1% of assets level. I’d be very surprised if we don’t achieve that in 2015.
Joe Ng – MLV & Company: Okay, also could you provide more color on your mix of acquisition pipeline next year or knock it at versus relationship deals or medical office versus audit assessed and also the one off deals versus the portfolio deals?
John Thomas: Yes, I think what’s in our pipeline right now and what we continue to see is fairly consistently two-thirds are coming from existing relationships or them introducing us to other relationships. And the other third again fairly lightly marketed. We rarely get involved in those kinds of the mass marketed options. It all in fact I don’t think we’ve really pursued anything in the past year on that basis. Medical office buildings, you’ll continue to see more and more medical office facilities private labs, surgical hospitals, but we still like those and – when they’re appropriate kind of risk adjusted returns where we can find them and we still see a few of those in the future. But portfolios tend to get more widely marketed, so our portfolio – the portfolio deals that we are actively involved in and have looked at have been – those were the portfolios owned by a developer or half to our physician group. And it’s – but it’s a three to five building kind of opportunities not the 10 to 15 building or some of the mega deals we’re seeing this year. So lot of $20 million to $25 million acquisitions which again we think it’s kind of the sweet spot in the right place to be in the medical office facility investment world.
Joe Ng – MLV & Company: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kucera with Wanderlust Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: Hi, good morning guys.
John Thomas: Good morning Craig.
Jeff Theiler: Good morning Craig.
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: Can you give us a little bit of color on any updates with your discussions with the ratings agencies as far as maybe getting an investment grade rating at some point 2015?
Jeff Theiler: Hi, Craig, it’s Jeff. What we’ve been doing is we’ve been meeting with S&P, Moody’s as often as we can just to make sure that we’re in front them and they understand the story. And so, as we look out into 2015, getting an investment grade rating is really a primary goal for us.
 :
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: When you think about trying to hit that, has that then changed the amount of leverage that you might ultimately take the existing capital base that you have today instead of maybe pushing into the mid to upper 40s as we’ve talking about in the past? Does that sort of maybe bring it down closer to the 40% range?
John Thomas: That’s a good question. I mean, I think as we go for the investment grade rating and then presumably once we achieve the investment grade rating, I think what you’ll find is that leverage levels are going to be consistent with other companies that have that investment grade rating. So as you look out into the healthcare world, that’s a large diversified REIT among others. So I think if you start looking at those types of levels, that’s probably the range that we’ll be in.
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: Got it. And with especially the leases that were closed at the end of the quarter and really throughout the quarter, can you advocate some additional details sort of on the escalators that were baked into $226 million of acquisitions that were closed this quarter?
John Thomas: Mark, why don’t you address that?
Mark Theine: Sure. At the end of the quarter, we closed three buildings in El Paso and four in Columbus on the last day of the quarter, but in the total for the quarter closed 16 buildings and the average escalator is just about 2% for those transactions.
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: Got it. And finally with the OP Units, there was a bit of pickup in the quarter. Can you give us a little bit of the terms of those OP Units, where they were issued and for which assets?
John Thomas: Yes. The biggest one was the El Paso. That was a three building portfolio we acquired from the Orthopedic Surgery Group down there. All OP Units are consistent, have the same terms, which is they’re restricted for one year and then after that quarter-by-quarter they can raise or hanging out on off to convert to cash or shares at the same price. They all average or the OPs are issued an average price, it’s kind of three-day average price before the closing of the transaction. So I think we’ve disclosed what that average price was made apparently we should have disclosed.
John Lucey:  We’ve disclosed in there are three transactions in the quarter for total of $25 million of operating partnership
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: $25 million?
John Lucey:  Yes million dollars worth and the average price across all of those for the quarter was $14.17
John Thomas: Got it you’ll deal for them.
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities:  Great, thanks I appreciate the color.
John Lucey:  They tend to refer the doctors to us and when it works out like that for them.
Craig Kucera – Wanderlust Securities: Great, thanks.
Operator:  Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. 
Collin Philip Mings – Raymond James & Associates:  Hey good morning guys. One of my questions has been addressed, but just a follow-up really on that duel pipeline, is there a way to maybe think about or quantify how you think about the mix between MOB’s and specialty hospitals going forward? I know John you’ve talked in the past again about seeing more relative value and opportunity right now really on MOB side. But may be just talk a little bit more about where your portfolio is and where do you see that mix going into 2015?
John Sweet: I think we look at it right now is moving to 80 to 85% we still see, we still like the others where we can find attractive value but its 80% to 85% in our current pipeline
Collin Philip Mings – Raymond James & Associates: Okay and then as you guys continue to grow and kind of build that asset base and really improve the quality of the portfolio with some of these recent acquisitions. Going into 2015 now there is may be some legacy properties that may be what were required before the IPO that you might want to recycle some capital out of, is there any plans for more disposition activity going forward?
John Thomas: Yes think again in the – not to put off the question in our next earnings call we’ll be talking about the plans for next year, we may provide some disposition guidance. I think in the legacy portfolio there’s a handful of buildings that eventually over time will be disposed of or will recycle, but nothing material in the near-term, so.
Collin Philip Mings – Raymond James & Associates: Okay, and then just on terms of lease pricing and renewal and rent [ph] guidance that you guys had extremely small amount of renewals and leasing activity during the quarter. But may be just talk a little bit more about the pricing environment, I know it sounds like the new properties that you guys just acquired is kind of 2% type escalated, may be just talk a little bit about may be what you’re seeing in terms of mark-to-market as far as leases in a lot of your markets and how you think about that, the pricing about it more broadly?
John Thomas: Yes, Mark, can you address that?
Mark Theine: Yes sure, absolutely. As you mentioned, we do a very little roll over right now. Rates have definitely stayed the same or increased in lease renewals that we’ve had during the quarter. And as John Thomas had mentioned earlier that we continue to sprinkle in a few more multi-tenant buildings where there is the opportunity to bring some leases up to market. So in the multi-tenant buildings that we are acquiring we’re looking for leases that are at or below market upon acquisition and then we’ve got the opportunity to manage them well and to increase those rental rates and bring them up to market.
John Thomas:  Yes, I’d just add anecdotally Mark has done a nice job of some acquisitions where the tenants are looking to extent their leases right now. We got some nice bumps for future rent renewals where we’ve already got the renewal in place and Mark has done a good job doing that.
Collin Philip Mings – Raymond James & Associates: Okay. I appreciate guys. Congrats on the progress during the quarter.
John Thomas: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wilkes Graham with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point:  Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. One, with all the acquisitions made in the quarter and obviously on the last quarter, Jeff, I’m curious. You reported about $11.5 million of NOI during the quarter, but can you disclose what the run rate NOI is either as of today or as of September 30?
Jeff Theiler:  I have to have that on my finger tips, but I can certainly follow-up with you with an exact number.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: Okay. And John, with the Supreme Court looking at whether these 5 million individuals may not be entitled to receive subsidies if they purchased insurance on the federal exchanges. I’m curious if that decision were to be – if it was determined by the Supreme Court that they’re not entitled, can you comment at all on how that would affect your business either positively or negatively?
John Thomas: I don’t think it has a direct impact on our specific business, I mean, obviously healthcare in general has been riding a little bit of a wave with the increased coverage expansion. The physicians in the hospitals we’ve been working with primarily are more focused on the commercial pay and kind of higher demographic population. And we can see the consolidation of physicians with each other and the consolidation of hospitals, acquiring physicians is continuing regardless. So it will be something important to watch, but we just kind of done our review of our kind of strategic asset mix goals and as a big part of driver continue to focus on medical office billing, which is more private pay, reimbursement commercial pay, reimbursement facilities, particularly including on our specialty hospital in the surgical hospital side. So [indiscernible] could have some short-term impact generally on the healthcare market, but the healthcare economy is going to be $3 trillion next year regardless and coverage expansion will occur one way or the other.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: Great. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
John Thomas: Yes, again we just appreciate you for taking the time this morning and enjoyed seeing many of you at May REIT [ph] last week and I look forward to the follow-up in a continued success in the fourth quarter and beyond. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-08-13 12:00:00) =====
Executives:  David Burke – IR John Thomas – CEO Jeff Theiler – CFO John Lucey – SVP, Principal Accounting and Reporting Officer  John Sweet – Chief Investment Officer 
Analysts:  Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Craig Kucera – Wunderlich Wilkes Graham – Compass Point 
Operator: Greeting. And welcome to the Physicians Realty Trust Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Burke of The Ruth Group. Thank you. You may begin.
David Burke: Good morning and welcome to Physicians Realty Trust’s second quarter 2014 conference call and audio webcast. With me today are John Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; John Sweet, Chief Investment Officer; Jeff Theiler, Chief Financial Officer and John Lucey, Principle Accounting and Reporting Officer. I’d like to remind you that today’s call will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that can be identified by words such as belief, expect, anticipate, plans, project, seek and similar expressions and involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors as set forth in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s CEO, John Thomas. John?
John Thomas: Thank you, David. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. I apologize I’m fighting back a little cold this morning. So, hopefully you’ll be able to understand me. As David mentioned, we have the entire DOC management team here and I’m very excited that we’ve completed our team this quarter. I’ll begin the call with a brief review of our first full year of operations and second quarter highlights. Jeff Theiler, will present his observations and vision for DOC, then John Lucey will present our second quarter financial results. We will then be pleased to take your questions. I would like to begin with a summary of the first year of our operations. Since our IPO on July 19, 2013 we have delivered the following results to our shareholders. Total shareholder return from July 19 through July 18 2014 was 36.8%, including dividends paid during the year. We paid as of August 1, 2014, $0.855 per share. Our predecessor had NOI of $3.8 million through the six months ended June 30, 2013 and our company had NOI of $15.7 million for the comparable period of 2014, an increase of $11.9 million or 310%. On the date of our IPO, we had 528,000 rentable square feet with 83% occupied and an average lease term of seven years remaining. On June 30, 2014, we had approximately 1.7 million rentable square feet of which 94.2% was occupied and with an average lease term of 9.65 years. When we made public, the predecessor company led by John Sweet and Mark Theine, contributed real-estate investments valued at $124 million. During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, John, Mark and our team had added $73.6 million new investments. And in July 2014, we added an additional $45 million in acquisitions and topped $500 million in total healthcare real-estate assets, an increase of 303% from the date of our IPO. We feel this performance with $123.8 million raised at our IPO $103.1 million in our follow-on offering in December, and $149.9 million in our May 2014 follow-on offering. We also rely primarily on our secure credit line facility provided by Regions, Key and other banks which is now been expanded to $200 million of funded capacity. Lastly, we have worked hard to manage our organization efficiently and in the best interest of our shareholders. After our first full quarter of operating as a public company which was the quarter ended December 31, 2013, our total G&A was $1.7 million or 2.7% of our gross real-estate assets on an annualized basis. For the quarter ended June 30, 2014, our total G&A was $2.4 million or 2% of our gross real-estate assets on an annualized basis. We are dedicated to managing this organization to a total G&A level below 1% of our gross real-estate assets and all advances as efficiently as possible. To that extent, we have outgrown the need for the back-office support from B.C. Ziegler. We appreciate very much their support in the IPO process getting DOC up and running on day-one and extending extraordinary effort from the CEO, Tom Paprocki, and throughout the organization. But as we have exceeded our growth expectations and as we build out our (inaudible), internal controls and accounting infrastructure, we determined that we could now manage their process more efficiently over the next four years by substantially reducing our reliance upon Ziegler’s back office support. Ziegler was very supportive of this transition and even allowed us to directly employ one of their accounting managers through a supported DOC from the beginning. We filed an 8-K last week announcing this contract amendment. We appreciate all that Ziegler has done for us and look forward to a long premier relationship as we both seek to serve the healthcare industry. Our team has achieved remarkable success over the first year and we are very proud of our accomplishments but this is only the beginning. We have a long-term view of outsized growth opportunities as we expand to become one of the big-four, not by aggregation of secondary assets but by acquiring one high-quality asset leased to high quality healthcare providers, one facility at a time. We will also acquire high-grade portfolios opportunistically when we believe such assets will provide long-term value for our shareholders. We are dedicated to a long-term strategic plan to maximize total shareholder return with prudent long-term investments in healthcare facilities that we have underwritten which we anticipate will produce reliable rising rental revenues and thus reliable rising dividends as we move from a start-up REIT to an investment grade balance sheet as quickly as we can. Our board of trustees and our management team remain committed to managing our investments and property as well as our balance sheet to maintain a conservative capital structure. Among our many outstanding investments during the second quarter, we are excited to round-out our exceptional senior management team with the addition of Jeff Theiler who joined us officially on July 7, 2014. Jeff was most recently with Green Street Advisors, a leading real-estate and REIT focused independent research, trading and consulting firm where we served as the lead Equity Research Analyst covering the healthcare and laboratory space. Prior to that, he was a vice president in the real-estate investment banking divisions of Bank of America Securities and Lehman Brothers. He’s hit the ground running for you and has already made significant contributions that will produce long-term benefits for our shareholders as he brings a wealth of expertise and experience to Physicians Realty Trust and to you. We’ve asked Jeff to present his short-term findings and observations of why he joined DOC as well as his long-term vision for our organization. Jeff?
Jeff Theiler: Thank you, John. I’m very pleased to be speaking to you today as part of the leadership team for Physicians Realty Trust. I’ve been here just a short time but have already been impressed by the caliber of the people serving the company starting with our distinguished board of trustees on to our Chief Executive Officer John Thomas, our Chief Investment Officer, John Sweet and extending throughout the rest of the company. I know some of you on this call from my time at Green Street Advisors, where I led the Healthcare REIT research effort for the past four years. During that time, I observed a transformation in the Healthcare REIT sector. During the first part of my tenure as a REIT Analyst, I watched the already large diversified healthcare REIT more than triple in size as they work to consolidate the industry creating outside shareholder value along the way. And then later on, the smaller and more focused healthcare REITs began to generate the best performance in the sector. These REITs demonstrated the ability to generate consistent external growth and their relatively small asset bases meant that each acquisition dollar contributed more to the bottom line growth than their larger peers. So, it was with great interest that I watched Physicians Realty Trust complete its initial public offering just over a year ago. In DOC, I saw a small REIT with a large opportunity ahead of it in the medical office building sector. The sector by the way that I consider to have the best risk adjusted return profile in healthcare. The biggest question I had as an outside observer was whether the REIT had a fuelling place that could source a significant number of high-quality acquisition opportunities. When I saw the first quarter 2014 investment results of nearly $150 million deployed, it was clear to me that it did. So, when I spoke with John Thomas and the rest of the group about joining and we discussed the opportunities ahead, it wasn’t a difficult decision for me to make. So, fast forward to today, in terms of company’s strategy I see no reason at this time to deviate from the winning formula that was laid out by John Thomas and team at the IPO. And that has provided a total return to our shareholders of more than 30% since our initial public offering in July of last year compared to under-10% for the overall REIT index. We’ll continue to capitalize on our senior executive’s network of healthcare context to source acquisitions primarily in the medical office building sector while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2014, we acquired $73.6 million of assets along with another $45 million of assets after the quarter end. This brings our total acquisition volume in just over six months to $266 million, more than doubling our real-estate portfolio. While this progress is exceptional by any measures, we’re just getting started. Based on the existing pipeline of acquisition opportunities that we’re working towards completion, we feel comfortable providing acquisition guidance for the rest of 2014 of $150 million to $300 million. Importantly this guidance is, in addition to any acquisitions announced to date. The low end of this range will put us comfortably over the prior acquisition guidance we provided of $400 million in total acquisitions for 2014 and we hope that we can do better than that. As we look out towards 2015, we will continue to be disciplined in our balance sheet management as we strive to achieve an investment grade rating which will reduce our cost of capital and allow us to achieve even better investment returns to pass on to our shareholders. Finally, a word on FFO guidance for 2014 and why we haven’t provided it this quarter. Our normalized FFO per share has grown from $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2014 to $0.17 per share in this current quarter so, an average of roughly 50% growth per quarter in 2014. Almost all of this FFO growth stems from acquisition activity, while our current pipeline provides comfort in the overall volume of acquisitions we can achieve through the remainder of the year. The timing of these acquisitions in any additional capital raising activities are inherently difficult to predict. This minimizes the value of providing FFO guidance for a fast growing company like ours. What I can assure you is that our acquisition pipeline is stronger than ever and we intend to execute on those opportunities while maintaining a conservative balance sheet as we continue to provide a solid foundation for this company to generate excellent long-term results for its shareholders. With that, I’ll turn it over to John Lucey, to discuss the financial results for this quarter.
John Lucey: Thank you Jeff, and good morning. As I have stated in previous calls, prior to the completion of our IPO on July 24, 2013, the Trust had no operations. Therefore, results of operations for the second quarter of this year represent results of the Trust while results for the comparable period of 2013 reflect the results of operations of our predecessor. For the second quarter of 2014, our normalized FFO was approximately $5.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share and normalized FAD was approximately $4.9 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Second quarter 2014 total revenues increased by 233.1% to $11.4 million from $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2013. The year-over-year in total revenues was attributable to $7.7 million increase in rental revenues which totaled $10.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Expense recoveries and other revenue also increased by $304,000, a 33.7% increase over the comparable period of last year. The strong growth in rental revenues of over 304% from the second quarter of 2013 is attributable to our portfolio expansion as we add a total of 49 properties contributing to our results during the 2014 quarter which had a combined square footage of approximately 1.7 million square feet and an occupancy rate of 94.2%. Our predecessor had 19 properties and 500,000 square feet in the comparable period and occupancy of approximately 83%. As previously announced, we completed $73.6 million in property acquisitions during the second quarter of 2014. On a pro forma basis, had all the acquisitions occurred on the first day of the quarter, we would have reported an additional $1 million of revenue. General and administrative costs were $2.4 million compared to $102,000 in the comparable period of 2013. The increase in expenses resulted from the build-out of our public company infrastructure which included $1.1 million for salaries and benefits, $700,000 in professional feels, primarily legal and accounting, $400,000 of administrative expenses and $200,000 in public reporting and board of trustee cost. Second quarter 2014 depreciation and amortization was $3.7 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $1 million in the second quarter of 2013. Again on a pro forma basis, depreciation and amortization would have increased an additional $0.4 million had all the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the quarter. Acquisition related expenses were $2 million for the second quarter of 2014. Our predecessor did not incur any acquisition related expenses in the comparable period of 2013. Interest expense net for the second quarter of 2014 was $1.7 million compared to interest expense of our predecessor of $1.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Net loss for the second quarter of 2014 was $0.6 million compared to a net loss by our predecessor of $300,000 in the second quarter of 2013. Basic and diluted loss per share was $0.02 for the second quarter of 2014. Looking at the balance sheet, we finished the second quarter of 2014 with total assets of $469 million, including $6.7 million in cash compared to $293 million in total assets at December 31, 2013. On the liability side, we have total liabilities of $93 million including $79 million of debt as of June 30, 2014 compared to total liabilities of $52 million including $43 million of debt from our predecessor at the end of last year. As previously announced, our board of trustees authorized a quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of $0.22 per share which was paid on August 1, 2014 to shareholders of record as of July 18, 2014. That concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. My first question is just on the pipeline, I wanted to ask about what the composition of the pipeline looks like, is it similar to the recent fill that you’ve done on the past? And also talk about what the trends you’ve been seeing in pricing it seems like cap rates have come in quite a bit in recent months? Just want to get your thoughts on that.
John Thomas: Yes, good morning, Karin. This is John, John Thomas. I’ll speak a little bit about it and let John Sweet to make a couple of comments. But the pipeline as Jeff mentioned is robust, primarily medical office building and with large multi-specialty groups and half the affiliation so typical of what we’ve been buying and good strong healthcare market. On pricing, generally, in where we’ve seen a big move in the last, since the IPO frankly is in the post Q and surgical hospital space where a pricing on those assets has moved more aggressively toward MOB rates. We believe there should be a pricing differential there, our risk reward, our risk adjusted return that’s better – a better place to put investments. So, you’ll see less of that from us but still seeing some really good opportunities in the – primarily in the surgical hospital space unless the post Q care world right now. John?
John Sweet: Yes, good morning Karin. We are seeing a little bit of compression in cap rates. The popularity of the asset class continues to be very, very strong. We’ve been fortunate in recent months by virtue of referrals that are coming from folks who are in properties that we have acquired over the past year. That’s kind of kept the market, kept them out of the larger market and we’ve been able to be pretty successful in negotiating some transactions. But there is some compression out there right now.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks for the color. My second question is just on G&A, came in at $3.4 million including I think roughly $0.5 million of non-cash comp. Just, I think in the last call you sort of said its $1.7 million you thought was a good run rate, even though higher. I wanted to get your thoughts on what we should be looking at from here? And also what the impact is as the change in the shared services agreement on G&A?
Jeff Theiler: Hi, Karin, it’s Jeff. So, in terms of G&A, one of the great things about being a small company is that you have outsized growth opportunity. One of the disadvantage frankly is you have a higher G&A as a percentage of assets. So, as we look to build a long-term company versus just putting a portfolio together, we’re investing in the people and the systems that are going to make that possible. So, as we look out into the future for G&A, I think a sustainable run-rate for the foreseeable future in G&A is probably about $7.5 million to $8.5 million of cash G&A going forward on an annualized basis.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And what impact is the change in the shared services agreement going to have versus the savings?
Jeff Theiler: The change in the shared services over the longer term it’s going to be positive for sure. I think in the near term, before we really start scaling up, I think it’s probably about a neutral cost impact.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then just last question, was there any material leasing done in the quarter say in the Lansing property or the Columbus property that you guys want to share with us?
John Thomas: Yes, I’m sorry Karin, allow us to for a second, color on the Columbus property or the Lansing property, is that what you asked?
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes.
John Thomas: Okay. The Columbus property, we’ve entered into a sale agreement to sell that to a frankly it’s a retail use. And we’re pretty pleased to move – go and move that asset off of our books. And we expect that or hope that will close this quarter. And we’re working through the time there. But it’s assigned purchased agreement just the seller working through with the buyers, working through their diligence. On Lansing, we’ve had tremendous amount of traffic flow. I think each quarter we’ve reported lots of tenant activity but we’d continue to have a great deal of expectation that that would be leased to a healthcare provider and we’ll contribute to the core NOI in the future, so.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks very much.
John Thomas: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Craig Kucera with Wunderlich Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Kucera – Wunderlich: Hi, good morning guys.
John Thomas: Hi Craig.
Craig Kucera – Wunderlich: Nice quarter by the way. You’ve expanded the line of credit to $200 million, it’s a secured facility. If you were to move to an unsecured facility, you have a feeling for kind of the pricing differential or would it be material?
Jeff Theiler: Hi Craig, this is Jeff. Yes, I think it would – obviously we’re at the stage in our company’s lifecycle, where we’re starting to investigate all types of additional capital avenues, unsecured facilities certainly one of those. We would expect pricing on an unsecured facility to be somewhere slightly over 100 basis points inside of our current pricing on the secured facility.
Craig Kucera – Wunderlich: Got it. And then, when you think about the company moving forward to being investment grade because I know that’s the goal that you guys have clearly made, present to the Street for a while, could it happen next year that’s certainly the goal. What do you think that would mean overall to your change in your cost of financing?
John Thomas: Look, I think that, if we hit investment grade metrics, certainly you get another little bump on any kind of unsecured facility that we would have out. And then I think importantly for us, it provides the opportunity to put long-term financing in place for our assets. And that’s really the goal of ours. So it’s difficult to say what the cost of capital for an investment grade unsecured debt is going to be in the future. But certainly it’s worth it for us to – because of their answer quickly to kind of wait for that window of opportunity and execute when we can.
Craig Kucera – Wunderlich: Got it. And then finally, there was actually a significant announcement in the space between HC and the Main Street were there setting up a development partnership. Is something like that attractive to you at any point in the near term or are you guys finding plenty of products now, that’s existing, at cap rate so they’re still quite attractive?
John Thomas: Yes, Craig, this is John Thomas again. That’s a great opportunity there. That’s a nice portfolio. But again, it’s mostly in your housing and post skilled care but great assets. Congratulate and help for REIT on that acquisition. We’re continuing to focus on the medical office and again these specialized hospitals from time to time so we can find attractive yield opportunities. The development world in the MOB space is picking up, but larger health systems sponsoring large, highly leased MOB development opportunities. So we’re keeping an eye on those. But those are things that will come online a year from now. And so, hopefully we’ll have the opportunity to and have a cost of capital to be competitive for takeout other type of arrangements there. Development for us is something in the future and something we’ll pursue where we can find attractive long-term higher yields in the acquisition market. And right now that’s more of a future opportunity in the near term, plenty of acquisition opportunities for us in the near term for growth.
Craig Kucera – Wunderlich: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question is coming from the line of Wilkes Graham with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: Hi, good morning everyone.
John Thomas: Good morning, Wilkes.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: And Jeff, welcome to the company.
Jeff Theiler: Thank you.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: I think most of my questions have been answered. I think the only I might have is your guidance for the second half of the year, $150 million to $300 million. Obviously that’s a pretty good number the mid-point of that is obviously above the $400 million you talked about before. But can you talk about maybe what goes into such a wide range for the second half of the year, is it just certainty of timing before December 31, or is it a function of the due diligence that maybe after (inaudible) assets?
John Thomas: Wilkes, this is John Thomas. I think it is timing it is the biggest variability there. We’ve got a near-term pipeline that, have fairly good certain color on when it’s going to close. It’s probably the fourth quarter and timing of getting transactions closed, is the only real variability there.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: Okay. And I know, Karin asked before about Cap rate compression. But have cap rates moved or are you seeing a continued compression off late that concerns you at all about your ability to continue to grow into next year?
John Thomas: All the high profile large portfolio trades are somewhere in the 5.8% to below 6% range depending upon how you do the math and what year of NOI you’re looking at in the transaction. So and we’re still finding, historically we’ve said, we’ve been finding things in 7% to 10% range. If we over the past year, some of the higher yielding as I mentioned before assets have been, and the opportunities have been in the post Q care space or the surgical hospital space. And there has been contraction there that we’ve just avoided, which means most of our acquisition for medical office buildings and we’re finding lots of high grade opportunities there in the 7% to 8% range. And where you see us, but they’re below 7% it’s for quality and size and bulk and you’ll start to see some of that as our cost of capitals come down. So the short answer and sorry to ramble a little bit is 7% to 8% is still a good number for us primarily because it’s mostly medical office buildings, they’re below 6%, they’re below 7% be very clear about that. They’re below 7% if we see really high quality, larger acquisition that makes sense in a great market with a great healthcare or tenants in the building. We have some opportunities above 8% where there is some risk adjustment premium available so.
Wilkes Graham – Compass Point: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Thomas for any additional concluding comments.
John Thomas: I think you can tell we’re very excited and very proud of our first year and accomplishment. We had our Annual Shareholder Meeting last week and actually had several shareholders drive from a long way away from around the country to come. So we’re very excited, very pleased. Thank you for our time this morning. We’ll be happy to have follow-up calls and discussion with you. And we welcome Jeff Theiler and his expertise and track record and a long bright future with DOC. So, thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. We thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-06 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Danielle, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Danielle. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements, including those about our guidance and financial position and operations of our tenants. These statements are made as of today's date and reflect the company's good faith beliefs and best judgment based on current information. These statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are described in our press releases and SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2013.
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. Future events could render the forward-looking statements untrue, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update earlier statements as a result of new information. 
 Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, both of which have been furnished to the SEC today and are available on our website at www.hcpi.com. 
 Also during the call, we will discuss certain operating metrics, including occupancy, cash flow coverage and same-property performance. These metrics and other-related terms are defined in our supplemental information package. 
 I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Lauralee Martin. 
Lauralee Martin: Good morning. Welcome to HCP's 2014 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Paul Gallagher, Chief Investment Officer; Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; and John Lu, Investor Relations. 
 We had a solid start to the year on all fronts, including operations, financing and accretive investments. We are pleased to share the details with you this morning. Let me turn the call over to Tim to start with our first quarter results. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Lauralee. Well, let me start with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported FFO of $0.75 per share and FAD of $0.63 per share. Our FFO and FAD per share growth year-over-year of 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively, were negatively impacted by a one-time gain of $0.02 per share from the sale of marketable securities in the prior year period. Excluding this gain, FAD per share increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2013.
 Our same-property portfolio generated a strong 4.2% cash NOI growth year-over-year, driven by contractual rent increases and performance from our senior housing RIDEA portfolio. The results also included a 30-basis-point benefit due to the timing of ad rents from our tenant hospitals recognized this quarter, which is one quarter earlier than prior years, as we transitioned to the newly extended leases. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes.
 Turning to our financing activities and balance sheet. We completed 2 attractive financing transactions during the quarter: first, we raised $350 million of 10-year bonds at a coupon of 4.2% in February. Net proceeds, together with available cash from year end, were used to repay scheduled debt maturities in the quarter, totaling $560 million. In addition, with the support from all existing relationship lenders, we upsized our revolver capacity from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, improved the pricing by 17.5 basis points and extended the term by 2 years to March 2018.
 Our strong balance sheet further improved during the first quarter. Financial leverage was reduced to 38.5%, down from 39.2% at year end, and our secured debt ratio declined to 6.2%, representing a 60-basis-point improvement sequentially. Scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of the year total $105 million, and we have $2 billion of immediate liquidity from our undrawn revolver. 
 Now turning to our investment activities. During the first quarter, we executed on $136 million of investments, including the acquisition of a $32 million medical office building in Dallas and a $51 million commitment to construct a new 180-unit senior housing community in suburban Chicago. Last week, we closed on the acquisition of 2 on-campus MOBs in Miami for $26 million. 
 As previously announced, we entered into an agreement with Brookdale to form a new $1.2 billion continuing care retirement community joint venture. Upon closing, we will own a 49% interest in a venture via our contribution of 3 wholly-owned properties and $334 million of cash to be used by the JV to acquire 4 additional CCRCs. As part of this transaction, Brookdale agreed to cancel all existing Emeritus purchase options on 49 of our senior housing properties in exchange for amending the leases related to 202 properties currently operated by Emeritus.
 Finally, our 2014 guidance. Our portfolio continued to perform in line with our business plan, with projected full year cash same-property performance growth unchanged at 3% to 4%. We are also reaffirming our 2014 FFO and FAD per share forecast and continue to expect FFO to range from $2.96 to $3.02 per share, and FAD to range from $2.47 to $2.53 per share. 
 The full year guidance is based on our existing portfolio under the current Emeritus leases before taking into account any impact from the pending Brookdale CCRC JV and Emeritus lease amendment transaction. 
 As previously announced, our pending transaction with Brookdale is subject to the closing of Brookdale's merger with Emeritus, which requires the approval of each company's shareholders. We will provide updated guidance that reflects the entire transaction with Brookdale when we conclude our third-party valuation work and have more clarity regarding the timing expected to clear all closing contingencies. Upon closing, we expect the transaction to be $0.02 per share accretive to our FAD on an annualized basis. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thanks, Tim. Now let me review the portfolio's first quarter performance. Highlights include continued robust leasing momentum in our medical office, life science and RIDEA portfolios. 
 Senior housing. Occupancy for our senior housing platform was 86.8%, a 10-basis-point increase over the prior quarter and the prior year. Same-property cash flow coverage for the portfolio was 1.11x, unchanged from the prior quarter. The same-property population now includes the Emeritus flagstone portfolio, which is performing in line with underwriting.
 Same-property performance increased 4.7%, driven by contractual rent steps, including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators and growth in our RIDEA portfolio, where year-over-year occupancy is up 190 basis points. Rates are up 4.4%, driving same-property performance of 7.8%. 
 As Tim noted, we announced an agreement with Brookdale to expand our relationship to create a $1.2 billion joint venture that will own and operate entry fee continuing care retirement communities and to amend the triple-net leases on our 202 communities currently operated by Emeritus. The transaction includes the termination of purchase options on 49 Emeritus and 3 Brookdale communities, resulting in the elimination of approximately $1.3 billion of reinvestment risk over time. 
 The triple-net leases on the 202 communities leased to Emeritus will be split into 2 portfolios. The first portfolio is comprised of 49 non-stabilized communities, which will be operated under our RIDEA structure in an 80-20 partnership with Brookdale. These 49 properties have an average occupancy of 80% and were selected for the RIDEA portfolio as they have the highest potential for growth. 
 Cash payments from Brookdale totaling $34 million and a favorable interest rate on ATP financing to the JV will bridge the near-term cash flow shortfall when compared to the in-place triple-net rents. Thereafter, EBITDAR, net of recurring CapEx generated from these communities, is expected to exceed the status quo rent levels. 
 This portfolio represents our second RIDEA venture with Brookdale. EBITDAR growth on our existing RIDEA JV was 7.6% in 2013, evidencing that Brookdale is a best-in-class operator, delivering both high-quality care and strong financial results.
 The remaining 153 properties will be in a triple-net master lease, with an average initial term of 15 years and current cash flow coverage of 1.15x. The 2014 annual base rent will remain unchanged at $158 million, with rent escalators of 3% to 3.5% in years 2 through 4, and a greater of 2.5 or CPI with a ceiling of 5% for the remaining term. Rents will be reduced by $6.5 million in 2016 and $7.5 million, thereafter.
 The overall transaction is expected to be immediately accretive, driven by the investment in the CCRC JV and the funding of up to $100 million in capital improvements on the triple-net lease portfolio at an initial lease rate of 7%. More importantly, the CCRC JV and the new RIDEA JV are expected to be platforms for further accretive acquisitions and growth. Additional details about the transaction can be found on our website.
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2014, was 1.14x, a decline of 2 basis points from the December 31, 2013's coverage of 1.16x discussed on the last call. 
 HCR's coverage now reflects a full year of sequestration, which went into effect April 1 last year. Skilled nursing centers improved significantly during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, but still remained below prior year levels due to weaker hospital volumes, shorter average lengths of stay, driven by industry shift towards managed care and weather impacting hospital admissions.
 As we mentioned in the fourth quarter conference call, we expect HCR's coverage to improve in the latter half of 2014 once it realizes the full impact of cost savings initiatives that were implemented in late 2013. HCR continues to invest over $100 million per year to maintain, upgrade and expand its facilities, including 10 expansion projects totaling over $20 million of an investment in HCP's portfolio. 
 HCR ended the quarter with $170 million of cash on hand, up from $142 million at the end of December. Same-property performance for our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio was 3.6% for the quarter, driven by rent steps on the HCR portfolio. 
 Turning to our non-HCR post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio. Cash flow coverage was 1.70x, a decrease of 4 basis points over the prior quarter. Same-property performance for the non-HCR portfolio increased 4.2%, driven by rent steps and additional rent on capital improvements at our covenant care facilities.
 Hospitals. Same-property performance increased 10.2%, driven by the modification and extension of our 3 acute care hospital leases with Tenet Healthcare that changed the timing of rent recognition over the year. The lease modification is expected to result in a decline in same -- hospital same-store performance of 5% to 6% in the second quarter, but will have no impact on the full year guidance. Cash flow coverage declined 12 basis points to 5.28x, driven by lower inpatient volumes at our Tenet hospitals.
 Medical Office Buildings. Same-property performance increased 4.3%, driven by rent steps and a one-time revenue adjustment that occurred in the first quarter of 2013. Occupancy for our total medical office portfolio declined 70 basis points from the prior quarter to 90.0%, driven by a redevelopment asset placed in service at 19% occupancy. That asset is now 72% leased.
 During the quarter, tenants, representing 429,000 square feet, took occupancy. The average term from new and renewal leases was 60 months and the retention rate was 69%. We have 2.1 million square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, including 441,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We have executed a total of 360,000 square feet of leases that have yet to commence and have an active leasing pipeline of 1.1 million square feet.
 Executed leases, including new 11-year lease for a 51,000 square feet with the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada that anchors 85% of our Las Vegas redevelopment project. The lease was signed in February 2014. 
 In March 2014, the company acquired an 88,000-square-foot medical office building located in Dallas, Texas for $32 million, yielding 7.1%. The property constructed in 2009 is 96% occupied with an average remaining lease term of 90 months. The building represents one of the most comprehensive ophthalmology centers in the United States. 
 On May 1, 2014, we acquired 2 MOBs totaling 148,000 square feet for $26 million with a yield of 7.7%. The property is located in the historic Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami on the campus of HCA's Mercy Hospital, and are 82% occupied. 
 Life science. Same-property performance grew 2.5% in the quarter, driven by rent steps. Occupancy for our total life science portfolio declined 70 basis points from the prior quarter to 91.7%, driven by a 160,000-square-foot office tenant in Redwood City, whose lease expired in January, offset by new leases in the Bay Area, including a 63,000-square-foot lease with Genentech and a 69,000-square-foot lease with CardioDx that took occupancy this quarter. For the quarter, tenants representing 411,000 square feet took occupancy with average lease terms of 66 months. 
 Leasing remains strong. In February 2014, we executed a new 11-year lease for an entire 51,000-square-foot building at our Hayward, California life science campus. In March and April, we executed 3 new 7-year leases totaling 85,000 square feet, which fully leases our South San Francisco Oyster Point life science campus.
 The life science portfolio has 167,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2014, 30% of which has already been leased to new tenants. Additionally, we have executed 265,000 square feet of new leases expected to commence within the next 12 months. 
 Life science development pipeline consists of 2 projects totaling 230,000 square feet that are 100% preleased and 1 78,000-square-foot project that is 63% leased. Total remaining funding requirements for the development pipeline are $27 million.
 Sustainability. During the quarter, we received another 4 ENERGY STAR certifications for a total of 134 ENERGY STAR certifications as of March 2014. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Lauralee. 
Lauralee Martin: Thank you, Paul. Paul has highlighted our investment portfolio's continued strong organic performance, demonstrated by cash same-store growth of 4.2%. Year-to-date leasing activity further strengthened both our life science and our medical office portfolios, as well as continued our success in reducing non-stabilized assets. And the announced lease amendments with Brookdale will improve lease coverage and the credit quality of our operator. All of these actions position us for a very solid organic growth this year and into 2015.
 On the investment front, in addition to the $334 million accretive new investment with Brookdale expected to close later this year, the $51 million commitment to construct a new senior housing community in suburban Chicago, we also completed the 2 medical office investments Paul described totaling $60 million. Both of these investments were sourced through existing relationships and have initial cash yields of about 7%. 
 The focus of my comments this morning will be on our increased commitment to our operator relationships to help further drive external growth. We know that supporting our operator's financial success increases the growth opportunities of HCP. 
  In conjunction with their merger, Brookdale announced that their acquisition of Emeritus could provide an opportunity to monetize Emeritus' purchase options. Market commentary speculated that operator consolidation across the health care state could result in a more owned versus leased business model, making REITs as a capital source less valuable to the resulting stronger operators. Our announced transaction validates that HCP remains a very valuable source of capital to Brookdale and a key component in their business strategy.
 We extended our triple-net lease relationship and also structured 2 new partnerships, an 80-20 senior housing RIDEA partnership and a $1.2 billion continuing care retirement community joint venture. With these partnerships, HCP benefits from an aligned operator manager and is solidly positioned to grow with Brookdale. Brookdale benefits from increased real estate ownership, while retaining HCP as a reliable capital source. 
 The elimination of purchase options, while at a cost of modest future rent reduction, allows us to focus our acquisition resources on investments to accretively expand our asset base after having retained the cash flow from our existing assets. 
 Our new CCRC JV platform enables us to expand our senior housing investment mix to a consumer seeking long-term security and continuity regarding housing and health care, while at the same time representing an attractive entry point for HCP, as CCRCs continue to benefit from the housing market recovery. 
 We like the CCRC asset class, a property type with a premium yield and high barriers to competitive entry. And we like investing alongside Brookdale, the best-in-class senior living franchise with 35 years of success, marketing and operating CCRC facilities. We're very proud and pleased to have been selected as the largest capital partner to the largest senior living operator. 
 We remain disciplined to our investment hurdles in a marketplace where asset and portfolio pricing is aggressive. Our strategy continues to focus on long-term cash flow growth and value creation, particularly when interest rates are kept artificially low. Even after putting deals through this opportunity filter, we are pleased with the increasing size of our transaction pipeline.
 Let me close by saying we are proud of a solid quarter performance and remain positive on the balance of the year. Operator, we are now happy to take questions.
 ' 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Josh Raskin from Barclays. 
Joshua Raskin: Here with Jack Meehan as well. So my first question, just -- and I think Lauralee, you mentioned a little bit in your prepared comments, but as we think about the diversity from an operator perspective following the Brookdale Emeritus transaction, your 2 largest tenants are going to represent 1/2 of basically total revenue. So I'm just curious if there's a feel -- do you feel like there's a necessity to sort of diversify away from that? Or is it we pick the 2 best operators, and I heard your comments on Brookdale, we pick the 2 best operators and sort of that's the strategy going forward? 
Lauralee Martin: Well, they are 2 tremendous operators and we're very pleased to have them in our portfolio. I would also say that relative to the Brookdale portfolio, with what we've done in terms of positioning the portfolio with the leases, we have tremendous diversification in terms of the assets underlying what is now an even stronger operator. So we feel like we have diversity within that portfolio, but we're very comfortable with Brookdale as an expanded concentration within our portfolio. 
Jack Meehan: And this is Jack. Just maybe for Paul, just want to follow up on the HCR ManorCare coverage, I think 114, you mentioned. What's the progress on the operational improvements you previously talked about? I think it was 1/3 done at year end. And when should that be complete? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, let me kind of go through it. When you think about it, their coverage continues to reflect the previous headwinds on reimbursement, sequestration and reduced hospital volumes. This first quarter's numbers include a whole year of sequestration. The second quarter's going to have our 3.5% rent increase, that represents about 1 basis point a quarter of impact to coverage. That said, in March, despite the low hospital admissions due to weather, HCR's census was above prior year for the first time in quite a while. Additionally, in October, we anticipate positive rate increases on the reimbursement front. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see full year impact to the cost savings that were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013. And their hospice and home health continues to do very, very good, with year-over-year growth of 12%. So we're still looking at fourth quarter starting to see some traction with respect to the coverage. 
Jack Meehan: Got it. And then just last one off that, as you put all those things together, what do you think the coverage is that when you get to year end? And then could you just remind us what's the component that's coming from home health and hospice and EBITDAR? 
Paul Gallagher: Do you have that, John? 
John Lu: Yes, the home health care business is about 10% of the business. 
Jack Meehan: And then as you roll that forward, just what do you think the coverage got still? 
John Lu: We expect to see traction in the second half of the year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: A quick question. On the acquisition front. Your name has kind of come up in a couple of really big transactions internationally in the media. Just again, curious about your interest in doing more internationally versus domestically, and also whether we should be thinking about acquisition activity more like what we saw in one quarter. And then first quarter, onesies and twosies versus doing a deal of a substantial size. 
Lauralee Martin: Well, there's a number of questions in there, so let me see if I can break that down. First of all, we like both domestic and international. If we go back to the last quarter call, I mentioned we are very comfortable in the U.K. and on the continent in the developed markets like France and in Germany. We spent a lot of time over there with our debt investments both underwriting, as well as asset management, and feel it's a marketplace where we understand reimbursements and we actually like the stability of the reimbursements in those markets. So we don't comment on market rumors of transactions. But I can tell you, we are very active in the marketplace. I think you had a question on onesie, twosies as well. We don't see ourselves as a retail aggregator, if that's what you mean by onesie, twosies. We will do smaller transactions like we did this quarter with relationships where they're actually the retail aggregator and we're supporting their growth. We do think that we have a combination of sophistication both around the real estate assets, but also the structured finance that makes us have significant opportunities into midsized and large portfolios, and we will continue to seek those opportunities. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, great. And then I may have missed this in your opening comments, but did you talk about what the ManorCare coverage is at the facility and the corporate guarantee level as of March 31? 
Paul Gallagher: We've talked about the fixed charge coverage March 31 at 1.14x. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, so it's very similar to what we had in the fourth quarter? 
John Lu: Yes, that's right [indiscernible]. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Theiler from Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: Can you talk a little bit more about the CCRC joint venture you're doing with Brookdale? Entrance fees CCRCs haven't really been the preferred investment choice for REITs. And in recent years actually, many of them converted to rentals. Can you talk a little bit more about why this is the right time to get into that business and what your near-term and long-term NOI growth projections are? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, Jeff, let me take a crack at that. We've actually looked at the asset class for several years. I would say prior to 2008 valuations, in our opinion, were rather lofty cap rates for these assets. They typically traded at lower cap rates than traditional senior housing. And what we saw was the lion's share of the entry fee was mostly refundable, if not 100% refundable. When the market took a downturn, we looked opportunistically to try and buy some of these assets. It was difficult to kind of figure out where the bottom was in the housing market. And it was difficult to turn on kind of where entry fee prices would end up stabilizing at. And then when you looked at it, the operators ended up having large amounts of liabilities to pay out without a lot of new entry fee coming in. Really what's changed is the housing market has recovered. Entry fees are less refundable today than where they were. They're now probably about 50% nonrefundable. They get you a much more durable cash flow stream. The occupancies today in the CCRCs are lower, so from an opportunistic standpoint, it allows a good entry point and upside. So that when the vacant units are sold, you don't have to pay out a refund. And we were able to buy these things at what is now a premium to where senior housing assets trade at. So we thought of this as a good opportunity. I think if you were to look at it on a static basis, that we're going to see outsized growth for a couple of years as these things go from 80% to the low 90s, and some of the independent living components of these things can get up over 95% occupancy. They will then stabilize out, but we look at this venture as the ability for us and Brookdale to work together to help consolidate the space. And hopefully, we'll have more accretive transactions that take advantage of that upside over time. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay, so just in the near term, what kind of NOI growth rate would you be underwriting for this venture? 
Timothy Schoen: On a 6% to 8% range as occupancy increases over time, Jeff, in the next couple of years. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. And how big would you anticipate this venture getting over the next few years? 
Paul Gallagher: We don't have a size limitation on it. Whatever the opportunity brings. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay, great. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Tom [ph]. I just had a quick question on the SNF cap rates. There's been some chatter from some participants that cap rates could be starting to tick down. I just want to know, is there a point in which the cap rates could fall substantially to warrant more active recycling of that SNF portfolio? And then what are you seeing in terms of pricing in the marketplace today? 
Paul Gallagher: We're seeing lower cap rates across the board on all asset classes. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And any color on the SNF portfolio in particular or how you think about that? 
Paul Gallagher: If the price of SNF gets to the point where we can't justify the risk-adjusted return, then maybe we'll sell those assets. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. 
Emmanuel Korchman: Just looking at the Brookdale Emeritus deal both for the CCRCs and the changes to the senior housing assets, what sort of made you comfortable -- taking on the RIDEA assets in that structure, especially since it's been one that HCP traditionally has not been as active in? 
Timothy Schoen: Well, the assets that are in the RIDEA structure, Manny, are ones that -- first of all, we were able to choose and put those assets on the RIDEA structure. Second, those -- the rent payments associated with those -- the triple-net lease payments associated with those assets had a coverage of sub-1. So that's one of the reasons we chose to put those assets into the JV -- into the RIDEA JV plus we like the growth opportunity of those assets. 1/3 of that portfolio was the Blackstone JV. Legacy Blackstone JV assets that were in lease-up. And those we've just started to put capital into, so we think those are in attractive growth profile. As you'll recall, we could actually do a rent reset on those lease-up assets, so we still retain the benefit from those. And then the other 2/3 of them are Sunrise assets, and we like the quality and location of those assets as well. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think from a standpoint of not wanting to do RIDEA in the past, I think where we were was we didn't see the right risk-adjusted return to go out and buy assets and put them into a RIDEA structure. In these particular assets, we have assets that were part of our Sunrise transition, where we had some modest CapEx that were spent, and we saw some significant lift in the rents and the NOI of the properties. And we've seen in the Blackstone portfolio what's happened with spending capital and the upside associated. And if you look at it, Emeritus has been pretty much underspending on the capital side for the past couple of years. So we really had the benefit of kind of going to school on the portfolio to see which assets -- which are good assets that needed capital that had both the rate and the occupancy play, where if you spend capital, you would get outsized returns. And we were able to basically craft a portfolio to our liking that we thought hit the risk-adjusted returns in order to be able to put them into a RIDEA structure. 
Timothy Schoen: And the final note, Manny, on those RIDEA assets, we're looking to replicate the success we've had with RIDEA 1, where we were transitioning an operator as well. 
Emmanuel Korchman: My other question is, have you seen any other tenants or relationships come to you following the sort of very public rent reset and say, "Hey look, we're looking out over the next 3 or 5 or 10 years, and our rent bumps look really high, too. How can we renegotiate with you? 
Paul Gallagher: No, we haven't. 
Emmanuel Korchman: And I think Michael Bilerman has a question for you as well. 
Michael Bilerman: Yes. As you think about the transaction overall with Brookdale, there obviously was value both ways. They talked about the purchase options having a value of $130 million to $160 million, which I don't want to say fictional, but it requires a transaction to be done and has to be purchased and capital to be raised and is over time. And so there's a lot of uncertainty to them even achieving that value but we'll put that aside. They've sort of said $130 million to $160 million on a discounted basis. The rent reductions, the elimination of the escalators, the elimination of the fair market value resets, any reasonable cap rate would be far in excess of that $130 million to $160 million. So I'm just curious how you thought about the value that you're giving up on that side, and how much value you attributed to the reinvestment risk than getting those assets stripped away, number one; and number two, to getting into this new joint venture. So how much of value did you put on that? 
Timothy Schoen: Well, looking at -- I'll just -- I'll take the numbers answer. I guess Paul can take a more qualitative approach to it. But if you look at the amount of rent reduction we have over time, again, some of those were rent payments that were above -- or had -- didn't have coverage or had coverage below 1, first of all. But secondly, call it 9% -- $9 million annually, put a cap rate on that of 6.5% or 7%. Put a 7% on it, that's roughly $130 million. You put a 6.5%, it's roughly $138 million. That's how I would answer it numerically, Michael. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think kind of more simplistically, I look at the rents that we structure for Emeritus, we did a really good job of -- for HCP shareholders of getting very good, very high, very strong rent payments from a good-quality operator. And those rent steps over the next couple of years will have stepped up to a point that may or may not have been sustainable to property. I don't know, it depends on how much capital Emeritus would have put into those particular assets. And I compare that to the need to put up $1.3 billion of new investment over time just to make up for assets that get called away from me, and in return balance that with kind of what I think is almost perfect knowledge as to how the assets are going to be -- respond in the RIDEA scenario after spending capital. We know how they've performed in the past 2 or 3 years both on our Sunrise and on the Blackstone assets. So when we put all that mix together, we actually think that we come out ahead on the trade without taking into account the CCRCs. But we want to give ourselves a little bit of cushion because they are RIDEA, and they may not hit the exact numbers that we underwrote, but we think that it was a very good trade. 
Michael Bilerman: But doesn't that call to question a little bit when you think back to when a lot of these deals were originally announced, the company made a big deal about the fair market value resets on the rents, the high escalators in terms of the effect of straight-line impact, the -- and eventual cash flow growth. There was a lot of things that were talked positively about, and it just seems that -- I guess, this is coming from the question what else may be underneath from all the other transactions that you've done that you may have to figure out a different way of restructure. 
Paul Gallagher: I look at it very differently from that standpoint. I look at it as we advertise that we were able to take a less risky position than RIDEA and get outside market rent steps and had a fair market value rent reset. There would be some negotiation around what the fair market rent reset is. Having experienced what happened with our Sunrise assets after spending capital and after experiencing what happened with our Blackstone assets, as we spend capital, we now know how these assets performed. We think that the upside over and above what we have with those outsized rent steps and fair market value rent reset far exceeds what we would have gotten in the structure that we had a year ago. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, and the only thing I would add to that is the 34 assets, Michael, that had a fair market value rent reset to them. 17 of those are in the RIDEA structure, so we'll get the upside in those assets as they stabilize. And again, we chose those assets to go into that RIDEA structure because we think those are the better 1/2 of the 34. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. 
Juan Sanabria: With regards to the Brookdale transaction, can you give us a little bit of background about how the discussions originated, who approached who? Did Brookdale originate the transaction? 
Paul Gallagher: In all of our relationships, we always go through and determine what things we would like out of the relationship. We do that with all of our senior housing operators, our skilled nursing and our tenants and our MOB and life science. And there was a situation where there was consent, we negotiated a consent, and they asked us if we would entertain certain things, and we pulled out our list, they pulled out their List and we cut a deal that worked for everybody. 
Juan Sanabria: Okay, great. That's helpful. And for the seniors housing RIDEA assets, the new ones, why have those assets lagged? I know you mentioned sort of it's underinvestment of capital. Anything else you can point to other than maybe underinvesting and any geographic focus that you could share with us on those -- on that portfolio? 
Timothy Schoen: Well, again 1/3 of that -- 1/3 of those assets are coming out of the Blackstone JV where there hadn't been a lot of capital invested. So those are still in the process of being turned around. The other ones are -- the other opportunity we like is what Brookdale brings to the table in terms of their operating capabilities. Again, I'll draw the analogy to RIDEA 1, whereas Paul just mentioned, we had 7.5% growth last year. So we like the operating skill set that Brookdale brings to the table, including their ancillary revenue platform and ability to attract tenants with a better marketing campaign. 
Juan Sanabria: And any geographic focus? 
Timothy Schoen: No. 
Paul Gallagher: No. 
Timothy Schoen: Okay. Just one thing. That's -- it's 49 properties in 22 states, just to give you a factoid there. So... 
Juan Sanabria: Okay, great. And then on the CCRCs, can you just give us a sense of the market opportunity and whether you think the 50-50 JV will stay in terms of the split or whether Brookdale may want to be diluted down over time? 
Paul Gallagher: I would expect it to stay 50-50 over time. 
Lauralee Martin: Yes, they've expressed that they like this vehicle for their growth as well. They see it as an industry that's going to have tremendous consolidation. And same reasons we like it, premium yields, barriers to entry and an expertise that Brookdale has. 
Timothy Schoen: A blend of it, HCP's attractive cost of capital and Brookdale's operating expertise. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Carroll: With regard to your investment activity, can you talk about how you're approaching new investments, especially given the amount of competition coming in the space? Have you seen more competition and has that caused you to change your strategy at all? 
Lauralee Martin: Well, there's no question there's a lot of money out there. I think that there's been a great deal of activity, particularly in the sort of retail aggregator space, which we don't play in, however, it is setting pricing expectations that are moving over into a more institutional market. What we're doing is making sure that we're going to the places that need capital, so that's one of the reasons we should talk about international. Staying close to our operators as they look at what their growth opportunities are going to be. And in particular, we know that we can bring things to relationships if we just think about medical office. And the way hospitals are thinking about that space. The 2 that we talked about was because we had relationships with hospitals where they know that how we manage those properties, helping them with doctor relationships, et cetera, is going to bring more value to their strategy. 
Paul Gallagher: And from a pure underwriting discipline, there's been no change. We're still looking at risk-adjusted returns versus the various different asset classes and where we're at in the capital stack. 
Michael Carroll: Is there any other property types that you're interested in expanding into, I guess, similar to the CCRC joint venture you set up? 
Paul Gallagher: How we look at the CCRC is as just an extension of senior housing. 
Michael Carroll: Is there any other property types that you're looking at? 
Paul Gallagher: I'm sorry? 
Michael Carroll: Is there any other property types, I guess, that you're looking to be active in? I know in the past few years, you've been very active in senior housing and medical office buildings. Is there anything else that intrigues you? 
Paul Gallagher: We try to be active in all of our 5 asset classes. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Rob Mains from Stifel. 
Robert Mains: I may -- Paul, you may have implied this in your comment, but I didn't get it. From the first -- fourth quarter to the first quarter, there is about a $3.5 million sequential drop in senior housing rental income. Was there something one-time that either I'm forgetting about in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking of in the first quarter going on there? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Rob, I'll take it. There's ad rent -- there's more ad rent in the fourth quarter, so there's some seasonality on that portfolio. 
Robert Mains: Got it. And then on the same -- sort of same -- on the same topic kind of straight-line was up $3 million sequentially. Anything going on there because I know that you had said $42 million for the year. I was kind of looking through the way there. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, it's still a good number for the year. It goes down throughout the year, Rob, as we get rent steps underneath their leases. So it's a little higher in the first quarter, but $42 million is still a good number for the year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: My questions were answered. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. 
Vikram Malhotra: Just one quick follow-up on the acquisition pipeline. Lauralee, you mentioned that -- I know it's tough -- pricing is -- it's tough to kind of get very aggressive, but you did mention kind of an expanding pipeline. Can you just kind of give us a little more color, the types of opportunities you're seeing that would grow the pipeline? 
Lauralee Martin: We're seeing activity pretty much across all the product types. So I would say that with the focus we have in the organization to be out in the marketplace on an aggressive basis, it's across all the product types, and it's both domestic and international. 
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Lauralee Martin, President and CEO, for any further remarks. 
Lauralee Martin: Well, thank you, all, for joining the call. Again, we think we had a terrific first quarter, and we remain very positive on the balance of the year. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-02-11 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darla, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir.
 [Technical Difficulty] 
John Lu: Thank you, Darla. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements, including those about our guidance and the financial position and operations of our tenants. These statements are made as of today's date and reflect the company's good-faith beliefs and best judgment based on current information. These statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are described in our press releases and SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2013.
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. Future events could render the forward-looking statements untrue, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update earlier statements as a result of new information.
 Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, both of which have been furnished to the SEC today and are available on our website at www.hcpi.com.
 Also during the call, we will discuss certain operating metrics, including occupancy, cash flow coverage and same-property performance. These metrics and other related terms are defined in our supplemental information package.
 I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Lauralee Martin. 
Lauralee Martin: Thank you, John, and welcome to HCP's 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning, in addition to John Lu, Investor Relations, are Chief Investment Officer Paul Gallagher; and Chief Financial Officer Tim Schoen. We will begin with a review of the results announced earlier today, and for that, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Lauralee. 2013 was another productive year for HCP. One, we generated cash same-store growth of 3.1% over 2012; two, increased FFO as adjusted by 8% year-over-year to $3.01 per share and FAD by 14% to $2.52 per share, both above the midpoint of our last guidance; three, completed $598 million of accretive investments, sold $111 million of real estate and reduced our nonstabilized asset pool by $137 million; four, improved our sector-leading, investment-grade balance sheet in key credit metrics; and five, achieved continued success and sustainability.
 With this summary, there are several topics I will cover: Our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, investment and disposition transactions, financing activities and balance sheet and finally, our 2014 guidance and dividend. 
 Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Our same-property portfolio generated strong year-over-year cash NOI growth of 3.5%. This marks the third consecutive quarter we achieved same-store growth at or above 3.5%, a level we expect to continue into 2014. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes.
 For the quarter, FFO as adjusted -- for the quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.76 per share and FAD of $0.61 per share, representing growth rates of 5.6% and 7% compared to the fourth quarter last year. As discussed on our last call, results for the quarter included a $0.01 per share gain for monetizing a portion of our equity interest in Hyde Park, a newly developed Class A senior housing property located in Tampa, Florida. 
 Also during the quarter, we extended leases with Tenet Healthcare related to 3 acute care hospitals, allowing us to retain $23 million of annual rent from these previously held-for-sale assets.
 Turning to our full year 2013 results. Cash same-property performance increased 3.1%, representing the fifth consecutive year we achieved cash same-store growth above 3%. We reported full year 2013 FFO of $2.95 per share, which included severance-related charges of $0.06 per share recognized in the third quarter. Excluding these severance-related charges, FFO as adjusted was $3.01 per share and FAD, $2.52 per share, representing year-over-year growth rates of 8% and 14% and are $0.01 higher than the midpoint of our last guidance for both metrics.
 Our 2013 cash dividends of $2.10 per share resulted in an FFO as adjusted payout ratio of 70% and an FAD payout ratio of 83%, continuing our decade-long trend of improving the payout ratio while simultaneously increasing the dividend.
 Our strong earnings performance in 2013 was driven primarily by recurring same-store growth and accretive acquisitions. In addition, the results benefited from several favorable onetime items, which equated to a positive $0.07 per share per FFO as adjusted and a positive $0.10 per share for FAD. Before taking into account these favorable onetime items, our year-over-year FAD per share growth remained robust at 9%, and our FAD dividend payout ratio was 87%.
 Let me quickly recap the $0.10 onetime items in our 2013 FAD results, which included $0.05 per share income from our U.K. Barchester debt investment, $0.03 in gains from monetizing our Brookdale stock and a portion of our equity interest in Hyde Park and $0.02 from several other small items.
 We achieved a 17% reduction in our nonstabilized assets in 2013, reducing the pool from $840 million in January to $700 million at year end. 2013 stabilizations included additional paydown of our  Delphis debt investment, sale of Brookdale stock and reaching stable occupancy on 10 life science and medical office buildings. This pool of assets now represents only 3.5% of our portfolio, down from 6% 2 years ago.
 Moving on to investment and disposition transactions. During 2013, we invested $598 million consisting of: first, a $198 million debt investment in U.K.-based Barchester Healthcare purchased at a discount, which was subsequently paid off at par; second, $145 million of real estate and other acquisitions, primarily in senior housing; third, $102 million second tranche funding of a mezzanine loan facility provided to Tandem Health Care; and fourth, $173 million for development and other capital improvements. During the year, we sold 13 properties for total proceeds of $111 million, generating a gain of $68 million.
 Switching to financing activities and balance sheet. During the quarter, we raised $800 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at an attractive 4.25% coupon. Proceeds were used to repay $400 million of 5.65% bonds that matured in December, with the remainder to prefund a portion of our first quarter 2014 debt maturities. 
 At year end, we had $1.8 billion of immediate liquidity from $300 million of unrestricted cash, including proceeds from the fourth quarter bond offering and asset sales mentioned earlier, and full availability under our undrawn $1.5 billion revolver.
 We achieved substantial improvement in all of our key credit metrics during 2013, demonstrating our continued long-term commitment to a strong balance sheet. Our financial leverage improved 100 basis points, ending the year at 39.2%. Secured debt ratio was low at 6.8%, representing 150-basis-point reduction as a result of our strategy to refinance existing mortgages with unsecured notes at a lower cost. Fixed charge coverage improved to 4x in 2013, up from 3.6x a year ago, and net debt to EBITDA at 4.7x compares favorably to 5.3x in 2012. 
 Next, our full year 2014 guidance and dividend. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions and reflects the following: cash same-property performance is projected to range from 3% to 4% this year, with the same-store portfolio capturing 98% of our operating real estate. Our cash same-property performance is a direct growth driver of FAD per share, which strips out noncash items embedded in FFO, mainly straight-line rent and DFL accretion and includes the impact of recurring capital expenditures required to maintain the quality of our operating portfolio.
 That said, 2014 FAD is projected to range from $2.47 to $2.53 per share, which at the midpoint represents a slight decline year-over-year due to the 2013 favorable onetime items mentioned earlier. Excluding the $0.10 onetime benefit in prior year's results, 2014 FAD per share growth increases to 3.3% at the midpoint, driven by cash same-store growth, partially offset by higher second-generation leasing CapEx as we are forecasted to increase occupancy in our life science and medical office portfolio, along with the fourth quarter sale of the Kindred SNF portfolio mentioned earlier. 
 2014 FFO is projected to range from $2.96 to $3.02 per share, which at the midpoint is slightly lower than 2013 FFO as adjusted due to the $0.07 positive onetime items recognized in our 2013 results. Absent these, 2014 FFO per share at the midpoint is projected to increase 1.7% year-over-year. Our 2014 business plan reflects an additional $130 million on assets reaching stabilization as we continue to reduce our nonstabilized asset pool.
 Let me quickly run through a few other detailed assumptions related to our 2014 guidance. Interest income is projected to be $68 million, primarily from debt investments in Four Seasons, Tandem Health Care and senior housing development loans. The extended hospital leases with Tenet mentioned earlier are now accounted for as direct financing leases, starting in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 G&A is forecasted to be $86 million, including amortization of stock-based compensation of $22 million; development, redevelopment and first-generation capital funding of $160 million, including capitalized interest of $8 million; funding of $15 million related to our senior housing development loan program, which had $117 million outstanding across 7 projects at the end of 2013. 
 Turning now to noncash items and recurring CapEx to compute FAD. We have assumed amortization of below-market lease intangibles and deferred revenue income of $3 million; amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance cost of $18 million; straight-line rents of $42 million; DFL accretion totaling $140 million, of which $77 million is reported in income from direct financing leases, with the remaining $63 million reported as income from joint ventures because of our minority ownership interest in HCR ManorCare OpCo; DFL depreciation of $16 million; and leasing costs and second-generation tenant and capital expenditures, $68 million. 
 Regarding our 2014 dividend. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.525 to $0.545 per share, marking the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases and ensuring HCP's continued representation as the only REIT included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. The annualized dividend of $2.18 per share represents an increase of 3.8%, or $0.08 per share over 2013.
 After taking into account this growth in the dividend and based on the midpoint of our guidance, the projected 2014 FFO and FAD payout ratios remain low at 73% and 87%, respectively, and we expect to retain $160 million in cash flow after dividends and recurring capital expenditures to continue growing the portfolio. 
 Let me end with a quick word on our quarterly supplemental package. As you may have noticed, this quarter, we improved our supplemental disclosure document. In addition to many design and layout changes, we streamlined certain information and now present a document with a simplified quarterly focus to better align with our earnings calls. I'd like to thank our operational accounting team for an extraordinary effort the last couple of months to produce this retooled package, making it easier to read and navigate, while keeping it equally informative.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Now let me review the portfolio's fourth quarter performance and provide 2014 same-property performance guidance by segment.
 Senior housing. Occupancy improved from the prior quarter by 70 basis points to 86.2% due to typical seasonal occupancy gains. Occupancies are unchanged from the prior year due to the high number of moveouts that occurred in prior quarters as a result of the severe flu season. 
 Same-property cash flow coverage for the portfolio was 1.11x, a 1-basis decline from the prior quarter, driven by rent steps on transition portfolios. Total portfolio cash flow coverage is 1.10x, and includes the Blackstone portfolio acquired in October 31, 2012, which is performing above underwriting. 
 Same-property performance increased 4.9%, driven by contractual rent steps, including higher rents for assets, transition to new operators and growth in our RIDEA portfolio, where year-over-year occupancy is up 180 basis points and rates are up 4.1%. Same-property growth for the full year 2013 was 5.1%, and 2014 is expected to increase by 3.5% to 4.5%. There are no senior housing leases expirations in 2014.
 There are 3 CCRCs leased to Brookdale Senior Living that are subject to a fixed-price purchase option exercisable in July 2014. The facilities generate annual rents of $14 million.
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2013, was 1.16x, a decline of 3 basis points from the September 30, 2013, coverage of 1.19x discussed on the last call. The decline resulted from additional reimbursement reductions in 2013, shorter average lengths of stay over the prior year, driven by the industry shift from Medicare to Medicare Advantage and lower admissions experienced by acute care hospitals in 2013, which impacted the entire skilled nursing industry. 
 As we mentioned in the third quarter conference call, HCR commenced new cost savings initiatives in response to the lower census environment, and 1/3 of those savings were realized in 2013. The full year impact of these initiatives, the positive momentum on rates across the board and the continued growth in HCR's hospice and home health businesses should have a positive impact on coverage in the latter half of 2014.
 Same-property performance for our post-acute SNF portfolio was 3.5% for the quarter and for the full year 2013, driven by rent steps on the HCR portfolio. Same-property growth for 2014 is expected to range from 3% to 4%.
 During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Kindred to sell 9 skilled nursing facilities, which they operated under a master lease expiring in early 2017. The portfolio had an average age of 37 years and a cash flow coverage of 0.66x. The sale of 7 of the facilities closed in December, and the remaining 2 closed this morning. The portfolio's sale price of $82.5 million represents a 7.6% cap rate on trailing 12-month EBITDAR. The transaction, together with a hospital facility swap executed in the third quarter of 2013, provided an excellent opportunity for HCP to reshape our portfolio around Kindred's strategic markets and provided a platform for growing the relationship going forward. There are no post-acute SNF lease expirations or assets subject to purchase options in 2014. 
 Hospitals. Cash flow coverage was 5.49x, a decline of 4 basis points from the prior quarter and a 29-basis-point increase over the prior year, driven by our HCA Medical City Dallas facility. Same-property performance increased 2.1%, driven by increased cash rents on our recently repositioned Plano, Texas, facility, which also drove 2013 full year growth of 3.7%. 
 Full year same-property growth for 2014 is expected to range from 1.5% to 2.5%. In November, we reached an agreement with Tenet Healthcare to modify and extend 3 acute care hospital leases. The leases were extended at current rent levels and now contain annual CPI-based escalators under staggered terms from 3 to 8 years, with 4- or 5-year renewal options and purchase options exercisable for a fixed price at the end of each term. There are no hospital lease expirations or hospitals subject to purchase options in 2014. 
 Medical office buildings. Same-property growth for the quarter and the full year 2013 increased 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively, driven by rent steps and occupancy, which increased 40 basis points from the prior year to 92.3%, the highest same-property occupancy since 2007. Same-property growth for 2014 is projected to range from 2.75% to 3.75%.
 During the quarter, tenants representing 641,000 square feet took occupancy, bringing the 2013 leasing total to 2.1 million square feet and increasing overall occupancy by 190 basis points from the prior quarter to 91.7%. The average term for new and renewal leases was 68 months, and the 2013 retention rate was 74%. 
 We have 2.5 million square feet of scheduled expirations in 2014, including 489,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We have executed 330,000 square feet of leases that have yet to commence and have an active leasing pipeline of 1.2 million square feet. 
 Life science. Same-property performance grew 1.8% in the quarter, driven by rent steps and increased leasing activity, partially offset by mark-to-market rent reductions and vacancy associated with the downsizing and consolidation of Takeda's South San Francisco operations into one of our San Diego properties earlier this year. 
 The full year 2013 same-property performance declined 1.6% as a result of the items mentioned above and a $4 million payment received from Google in the first quarter 2012. Same-property performance for 2014 is expected to range from 2% to 3%. 
 Occupancy for our life science portfolio increased 10 basis points from the prior quarter and 110 basis points from the prior year to 92.4%, establishing an all-time high occupancy for the portfolio. For the quarter, we completed 176,000 square feet of leasing, bringing the 2013 total to 545,000 square feet and a retention rate of 77%. 
 During the quarter, we executed an 8-year 69,000 square foot new lease with genomic diagnostic tenant CardioDx at our Redwood City, California, life science campus. The lease with CardioDx will anchor 75% of the redevelopment HCP repositioned in 2011. 
 Turning towards 2014, the life science portfolio has 420,000 square feet of scheduled expirations, where we already re-leased 21% of the space. The expirations include 160,000 square feet in Redwood City that was vacated by an office tenant in January. We have re-leased 40,000 square feet in this building to Pearl Therapeutics, an AstraZeneca company, for 11 years. 
 In addition, we have executed 190,000 square feet of new leases, all commencing in 2014.
 During the quarter, we completed the first phase of redevelopment totaling 61,000 square feet at our 2 North Carolina facilities and commenced redevelopment on an additional 77,000 square feet at those same facilities that are 100% leased to Duke University for a 15-year term.
 Life science development activity also includes a 115,000 square foot building in Poway, California, that is 100% preleased and a 78,000 square foot redevelopment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that's 58% leased. Total remaining funding requirements for the development pipeline are $35 million. 
 Overall, we have seen a pickup in demand from life science users over the last few quarters across all of our markets, most notably the San Francisco Bay area, where we are in active discussions with a number of tenants for new leases. Additionally, our portfolio tenants continued to demonstrate throughout last year an ability to successfully tap both the private and public capital markets to support future operations and growth.
 Sustainability. HCP was named Healthcare Leader in the Light by NAREIT for the second consecutive year. HCP has received NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for 6 of the past 7 years. During the quarter, we received another 19 ENERGY STAR certifications for an annual total of 37. HCP has received 130 ENERGY STAR certifications as of December 2013. 
 With that, I'd like to turn it over to Lauralee. 
Lauralee Martin: Thank you, Paul. And let me apologize in advance for a very raspy voice this morning, the remaining symptom of a weekend cold. I'm hopeful my dialogue with you this morning will not overtax my recovering voice strength.
 As highlighted by Tim and Paul, we closed out 2013 with solid financial results, demonstrated by significant year-over-year growth in both FFO and FAD per share. These results came from a strong performance from our operating portfolio, a number of onetime profit items, which Tim covered in detail, and the benefits of our 2012 and 2013 investments.
 As we enter 2014, we find ourselves providing relatively flat year-over-year financial guidance, the result of the strong 2013 onetime profit items impacting the year-over-year comparisons, but also due to the limited investment activity in the second half of last year.
 Several reasons account for our second half investment pause, including the Federal Reserve's May interest rate comments that put a pause on overall market transactions; the intense effort and commitment of resources we put into the pursuit of the acquisition of the Barchester real estate portfolio; and our management transition in the fourth quarter. 
 I can assure you we are very focused on delivering consistent long-term growth performance and are already taking actions. What are we doing to increase investment activity? We have recently visited the majority of our key operators to discuss with them changes to their strategies arising from health care reform and how we can provide capital to support their success. Operators across the entire health care spectrum from acute care hospitals to senior housing companies are being challenged to deliver quality care at more affordable prices, which is prompting them to assess strategic and capital investment priorities.
 We are already seeing business combinations and strategic alliances among operators as they create more efficient integrated delivery models. While the rapid changes in today's health care marketplace have introduced an element of uncertainty, we believe the opportunities for HCP as a leading real estate owner and capital provider are even greater. 
 For example, our significant national medical office building portfolio being primarily on campus or affiliated with the major hospital systems gives us a constant communication touch point into most major hospital systems at the C-suite level. As hospital CEOs wrestle strategically with the transition actions required to move from a fee-for-service model to an integrated delivery model tied to bundle payments, we are a part of the discussions. 
 These conversations offer the best opportunity for both bid and off-market transactions. As validation of this potential, in 2012, 87% of our $2.4 billion of acquisitions arose from strategic discussions with our existing relationships. 
 We are adding to our asset management capabilities to allow our seasoned P&L leaders to focus more on acquisitions, and also adding investment professionals to several key areas, most notably medical office. Our relationships with intermediaries and our reputation for capital strength and responsive underwriting ensures we see and are active in the bid process for the larger marketed transactions.
 We have revisited the European marketplace, leveraging off of our Barchester and Four Seasons experience. In visiting the markets, I found our reputation is one of a knowledgeable and respected health care capital source, with solid relationships with both operators and investors. The market has a need for investment capital, and our underwriting continues to validate that the U.K. offers attractive investment potential, particularly in the care home space. 
 With all of these actions, we are actively looking at transactions across all our product categories, using both equity and debt investment structures. Consistent with the past, we do not comment on pipeline or deal specifics until transactions are completed. 
 So in conclusion, in addition to pursuing new investment opportunities both in the U.S. and abroad, we will be working our existing portfolio to continue its strong performance, maximizing our development pipeline for new opportunities, as well as seeking monetization of existing investments. 
 We are focused on being the leading organization in the health care real estate space, leading being measured by doing smart, accretive investments on a risk-adjusted basis, delivering top performance for our shareholders and in remaining an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to performing for you in 2014. 
 Operator, we are now ready for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. 
Nicholas Yulico: Lauralee, turning back to your commentary on the investment market. I was hoping to get a bit of an update as to how you're viewing the landscape now. You talked about the fourth quarter being a bit of a pause because of -- probably because of what was going on with the Fed. Has that changed for the better now? Or is it getting a little easier for deals to make sense today versus the fourth quarter? Or is the environment still pretty similar? 
Lauralee Martin: I would say the biggest thing that has changed is that the marketplace has adjusted that whatever the Fed's actions are, it will be readily absorbed. And therefore, there is not a concern that they need to stop their activity to determine what to do in that period of uncertainty. So I think the marketplace is getting on with what they do quite well, and that is trade assets and grow assets and we're in the middle of that. So we feel comfortable with our cost of capital relative to what's going on in the marketplace. It still is a competitive marketplace, but we feel comfortable in the middle of it. 
Nicholas Yulico: And then turning back to your discussion about meeting with hospital operators and also spending some time in Europe. What -- I know it's a little early, but what should we envision are some of the possible types of investments that could be made in a world where we are moving to more of a bundled payment system? I mean, what is that -- I think some of us are -- have wrestled with this idea of what exactly does that free up on the real estate side since hospitals really haven't had any need to sell hospitals or much of their real estate in the last couple of years based on a pretty decent cost of capital. 
Lauralee Martin: Well, I think the interesting thing is if you have a conversation with 5 CEOs, you would get 5 different answers. That being said, you are seeing that actions are being taken, whether there's hospitals that are merging, whether they're figuring out how to get a very focused footprint where they want to be, knowing that it is going to be about the patient, delivering the highest-quality care at the lowest quality -- the lowest cost price. And so again, that medical office portfolio, which is how they've early on started to deliver into that, becomes a very critical factor. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And just one last question is I was hoping to get a little update on what went on in the South San Francisco market broadly for life science in the fourth quarter. You talked about, back in May when you did the tour, that vacancy needed to come down a bit, rents needed to improve before you started thinking more about doing the developments there. Where -- what's sort of the latest thinking on that market and your possible future developments there? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, Nick, it's Paul Gallagher. We actually saw a tremendous amount of volume in the fourth quarter, tremendous amount of leasing, and we saw rents improve. Vacancy has -- available space has been taken up. And we're in the process of finalizing our entitlements on The Cove land that we own. So we think that our timing is good on the entitlements there and with what's going on with respect to available space in South San Francisco. 
Nicholas Yulico: So I mean, just quickly, I mean, what's at this point the earliest you think a development could start there? 
Paul Gallagher: I wouldn't hazard a guess. I think we've always looked at having some level of pre-leasing before we want to kick off any development, but vacancies are extremely tight and have been probably it's -- probably not starting for at least another 18 to 24 months, I would suspect. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Just quick question on ManorCare, improvement in coverage this quarter, I may have missed it, but could you give some commentary on what the key driver of that was and what we should expect to see going forward? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think that, Tayo, what you saw there was on the -- as reported, the majority of that came from GL/PL reserves coming off. If you look at the normalized, it was down 3 basis points as we mentioned.  2 of that, 2 basis points was a result of lower EBITDAR based on the items that we discussed, and 1 basis point was based on rent steps. So like we mentioned in the last quarter, HCR, they benefited for the first time -- benefited from a first rate increase in 2013 that was not offset by sequestration or other provider therapy cuts since the implementation of RUGs-IV. We talked about the hospital volumes and the shift from Medicare to Medicare Advantage. That's had an impact and a heavy impact on EBITDAR in this particular quarter. But on the positive side, all the business segments are projected to be positive this year. The rate increases should be maintained throughout the year. And the cost savings initiatives that were started in the fourth quarter should be realized over the remainder of the fourth quarter. And as we said, we think that the majority of the positive impact will present itself in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. So we see them continuing on kind of status quo until about the second half of this year. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Great, that's helpful. And then for Brookdale, the 3 assets that you mentioned that there's a right to purchase back sometime in 2014. Do you actually expect them to buy those assets from you? Is that what's built on the guidance? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, yes. We do, Tayo. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, great. And then on -- just one more from me. From the Kindred perspective and the asset sales in the fourth quarter, did you mention that the coverage ratio was at 0.66? And if so, just wondering how coverage got so low in the first place on those assets. 
Paul Gallagher: The answer is yes, the coverage was 0.66, and they've been impacted by the RUGS-IV, this being very old SNFs that are not strategic for Kindred, and we worked together to find a way to, for the both of us, to exit those particular assets and focus on their strategic markets. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. 
Michael Bilerman: Yes, it's actually Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I thought maybe we can just start on guidance. And I can appreciate some of the onetime securities gains and the interest -- the higher spread on the interest income from Barchester debt clearly has an impact on your '13 results. That makes a comparison to '14 muted with basically no growth. But even if you back that out, you're still at 2%, 2.5% FAD growth. And I guess I'm struggling a little bit to understand what's sort of holding that back. If you're telling us same-store is going to be 3% to 4%, CapEx, all those noncash items look to be the same spread as it was in '13, why is there no growth? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Michael, I'll take that. As I walked through on my comments, it's actually 3.3% growth from an FAD perspective, and that's being offset by a couple of things. That's being offset by the fact that we're going to spend a little bit more in terms of CapEx as we ramp up occupancy in our life science and medical office portfolio. And then also it's being offset by the sale of the Kindred portfolio that Paul just discussed that had a higher yield on it. 
Michael Bilerman: So what's the dollar amount of the Kindred portfolio and the yield on it? 
Timothy Schoen: The lease yield was 11%. The sale yield on EBITDAR was around 7.6% and then the -- sorry, what was the other question, Michael? 
Michael Bilerman: The dollar... 
Paul Gallagher: The proceeds were $82.5 million. 
Timothy Schoen: $82.5 million. 
Michael Bilerman: You're also getting back the capital from all the things you did last year, right? So that's got to have some return to it. Even with the sale, it still seems light, but I guess it is what it is. Maybe, Lauralee, you talked at the end of your comments about some of the actions that you're taking in terms of visiting with your key operators, adding some key people and then revisiting Europe as a way to get your engine -- investment engine going after a very light second half. I was wondering if you can just expand a little bit in terms of -- I got to assume that the company prior to you taking over to being CEO was meeting with those operators all the time. And so I don't -- what's changed in those conversations or in the approach to the conversations, number one? Number two, are you adding G&A or are you just reallocating some internal people? And maybe, Paul, you can say what -- or, Tim, you can say what sort of G&A forecast is for '14 if you are adding people. And then lastly on Europe, you're a $24 billion enterprise, what are you thinking about in terms of a more longer-term investment in Europe in terms of how much risk you want to take in a currency and other things in a foreign country relative to the base of assets you have in the U.S.? 
Lauralee Martin: There's a number of questions in there, so let me see if I can kind of check those off. Let's first of all talk about the people that we have, the talent that we have and what their focus will be. I mean, one of the things that I think comes through very clearly is how the portfolio is performing in a very solid operating way, which means that we do have the capacity to reprioritize our P&L leaders much more into acquisition mode and not put anything at risk. So that has already commenced. So that's a reprioritization. In terms of additions, they're modest, and I wouldn't build anything greatly into the cost structure -- Tim already gave you guidance. 
Timothy Schoen: The guidance reflects the [indiscernible]... 
Lauralee Martin: It reflects that. And what I would say about the people in general, we've had the relationships. It's a question of who had the green light to pursue them for acquisition. And so I think the enthusiasm to do what our talent is capable of doing and be in acquisition mode is being extremely well received. So that would be the sort of core business. Relative to Europe, I think you've seen we've focused very much on risk-adjusted approach to a new marketplace, to learn it in places we're not as comfortable that we don't know it well enough to be in the equity position, to be in a debt position so that there's equity behind us, selecting very carefully who our operators are, who's going to be winners in the space. What we do know is that, that marketplace has continued to perform quite well. Its difficulties were really created by financial engineering, not market issues. And so as those financial situations need to be corrected, new capital is what does that. So we believe we can be in that market with accretive risk-adjusted positions. They may be equity, they may be debt, but it's a marketplace that we well approach it with care. We will talk with you as we go, but we do think there's opportunity. 
Michael Bilerman: And then, I apologize, I may have missed it. What was the G&A forecast for '14? 
Timothy Schoen: $86 million. 
Michael Bilerman: $86 million, so just an increase over 5% over '13? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. A lot of noise in '13, but we had guided last year at $85 million, so not quite that much of a [indiscernible]... 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisor. 
Jeff Theiler: Can you drill down into the same-store senior housing growth a little bit? I'm just trying to understand what the drop-off was from the last couple of quarters to this quarter. Is that -- I know a large part of this triple net was higher than usual rent steps. Can you just walk me through how it went from 7% to 5% this quarter? 
Timothy Schoen: That was a result -- there's some seasonality in there, Jeff, but it's -- primarily, it's changes in our RIDEA portfolio and our Sunrise assets. 
Jeff Theiler: So the RIDEA portfolio -- what was the growth on the RIDEA portfolio on a same-store [indiscernible]... 
Timothy Schoen: For the year, it was about 7%. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. Maybe I'll follow up with you offline about... 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, I can get you more detail depending on which quarters you want to compare it to. That's a pretty detailed question depending if you're comparing the second quarter to third quarter or third quarter to the fourth quarter. 
Jeff Theiler: I was just talking about year-over-year, but okay. On the -- so going back to the heat map, which I think is great, by the way. 
Timothy Schoen: Well, hey, Jeff, if you're talking about year-over-year from '13 to '12, it's really driven by our rent steps, 2.3%, and our transitioned assets that were transitioned away from Sunrise and then our RIDEA portfolio. Those are the 3 components in terms of order of magnitude that drive same-store growth for senior housing. 
Jeff Theiler: Right. Okay. Maybe this will help, too. So looking at the heat map, which is great, a couple -- I'm just trying to identify some of these leases that are no longer in the heat map. There's one for senior housing, it was 0.5% of your AVR. That was about 2.5 years out or so, maybe 3 years out. It's down from this version versus last quarter. Can you tell me what happened to that lease? I'm just trying to identify it. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, we did have a renewal of one of our leases. Let me see if I can find the pool that we actual renewed there. Did you have another question, Jeff? 
Jeff Theiler: I do. Sure, I'll go on to the next one. Talking about the purchase options, I know you talked about the 3 CCRCs already. Looks like you have about $120 million of AVR over the next couple of years. What's your best guess on how much of that gets -- how many of those purchase options are exercised? Do you have any idea? 
Timothy Schoen: No, it depends on the time. But right now, the only one set we believe will be executed are the Brookdale purchase options. 
Jeff Theiler: Just the Brookdale? Okay. 
Timothy Schoen: And I think the portfolio that you're talking about, Jeff, from the heat map, was our -- was one of our senior housing operators that had a renewal of all or none on a pool of assets. So those have been combined into one data point, if you will, on the heat map since it's an all-or-none renewal on a group of assets. That's why you have that change. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. 
Jack Meehan: I have a few questions on HCR ManorCare. So first maybe for Paul. Can you just talk a little bit about the specific measures they're taking to improve the earnings coverage? And as to the set-up [ph], it looks like about 1,350 SNF beds were taken offline in the quarter. Obviously, that boost to occupancy, is that one of the levers since it's a fixed-cost business? 
Paul Gallagher: The levers are things that they have done in the past with respect to both taking some of the beds offline, yes, and also with respect to overhead, kind of rightsizing the business based on kind of what the reimbursement scenario is going to look like on a going-forward basis. 
Jack Meehan: Okay. And when you mentioned about 1/3 went into effect in 2013.  Is that -- I mean, getting the other 2/3, is that really that just overlapping into 2014? Or are these new things that they're planning on doing in 2014 as well? 
Paul Gallagher: It's implementation over the course of the year and getting the full year impact. You're going to see the majority of that pop happen most likely in the third and fourth quarter of '14. 
Jack Meehan: Got you. And then for Lauralee, I understand that you're not contractually bound to offer rent concessions. But now you're in the CEO seat, have you had any conversations with HCR or their sponsor around some sort of win-win solution to the rents? Just as an example, is there a scenario where they could pay you some set amount to buy down their rent obligation and actually help your equity stake as well and improve the coverage? 
Lauralee Martin: Well, we have not had those conversations, and at the moment are not planning to. We do have ongoing conversations with HCR on how we increase the coverage on the portfolio, particularly where they have assets where they actually are a cost to them to keep them and whether or not they should exit those assets in order to improve both their profits and our coverage. But no conversations relative to what you're referencing. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, particularly with the fact that they'll have -- as Paul mentioned, they're projected to have growth across their entire portfolio. They've come through a very difficult reimbursement environment over the last 2 years, and they finally got some relief from that in October. 
Paul Gallagher: They're spending capital on the assets. They have free cash -- positive cash flow. They're actually, for what they have been through in the past 2 years, in very good position, and we don't see pressure on them from a payment of rent standpoint. 
Timothy Schoen: And expect to see growth across not only their post-acute aspect of their portfolio but also their assisted living and continued growth in their home health and hospice business. So as Paul mentioned, positive growth across all 3 major components of their business in 2014. 
Jack Meehan: Yes, got you. Definitely makes sense with the quality of the assets, and it sounds like the admission numbers are good. But you see this general length-of-stay pressure across all skilled nursing. And then I guess just my last thought is, do your operators have any thoughts around the upcoming doc fix? There's been some progress toward a long-term fix, and something needs to happen by the end of March. And then again maybe on the investment side, with better Medicare clarity, would you actually think about starting to make new investments in skilled nursing? 
Paul Gallagher: Well, I think from the doc fix, like you said, they've kicked the can down the road for a short period of time. It's our sense that the focus was indicated that it might be impacted on the pay for more with LTACHs. And also we think that there's going to be some deference made to, say, neutral-type payments, which would benefit low-cost providers like HCR ManorCare. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital. 
Michael Carroll: Lauralee, how is HCP positioning its portfolio to take advantage of the health care reform? And are you focusing on any potential property type? 
Lauralee Martin: I think I referenced that we think we have opportunities across all of the property types because one of the things about health care reform is it focuses on the continuum of care, which really makes you think about the flow of your assets as the patient is involved in them. So our discussions with those that are delivering that care is how they need to either build out that continuum of care, so they stay the premier provider, or what other investment activities they need to take in order to reposition their portfolios. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then, Paul, with regard to HCR ManorCare, did I hear you correctly that coverage ratios will remain relatively low in the first half of '14, but you'll start to see more improvement in the second half of '14? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I would characterize them as fairly flat for the first couple of quarters of '14, and then you'll see it pick up towards the latter half of '14. 
Timothy Schoen: But remember, the impact of sequestration didn't kick in until April of 2013. 
Paul Gallagher: You had sequestration in April. You had occupancy issues in the third quarter. You're going to see the effect of a rate bump and these cost savings initiatives. That'll happen third and fourth quarter of '14. 
Michael Carroll: And then your rental rate bump occurs on April 1? 
Paul Gallagher: April 7. 
Michael Carroll: April 7, okay. And then, Tim, I you know you mentioned this in your remarks related to the Tenet Healthcare lease extensions. Was that roughly at the same rate as it was being paid previously? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, it was, $23 million that was renewed. 
Paul Gallagher: But we were able to get CPI rate increases where before we had relatively flat increases. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then, Paul, on the life science demand that you mentioned that you're starting to see in the Bay Area pick up, is that just solely from life science tenants or you're still seeing a lot of demand from tech tenants? 
Paul Gallagher: The majority of that was from life science tenants. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: Quick one, Tim, what is the GAAP same-store NOI growth relative to the 3% to 4% cash? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, GAAP is 2.2%. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. So then you're still -- you take the CapEx... 
Timothy Schoen: At the midpoint. Right. 
Richard Anderson: Right. If you take the CapEx issue out of the equation, then you're still going from 2.2% same-store GAAP to 1.7% FFO, right? And so all of that is the Kindred sale, I guess? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes [indiscernible] that's... 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And did you give a cap rate or a proceeds amount from the Brookdale purchase options? 
Timothy Schoen: They haven't been exercised yet. We just put that into guidance. 
Richard Anderson: All right. So I know you gave the NOI amount, but what should we -- how should we model it? 
Timothy Schoen: It's about 8%. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And, Lauralee, or anybody I guess, maybe Paul, with senior housing supply picking up, that's kind of the news of the year so far for senior housing, does that make -- what are your views on that, number 1? And number 2, does that make you even less likely to pursue an incremental RIDEA path at this point? 
Timothy Schoen: A couple of things. First, let me talk a little bit about the impact on our RIDEA assets and then on our triple net. The majority of our RIDEA assets are independent living, and the NIC data still shows a large gap between starts and absorption, 1.2% versus 1.8%. Our biggest concentration of RIDEA is in Houston where we expect absorption to exceed inventory by 200 basis points. And we spent a lot of money on that whole portfolio. So we've seen fourth quarter sequential occupancy growth about 170 basis points. On the triple-net side, our 3 biggest concentrations are in Washington, New York and Chicago, and we're seeing supply remaining low, between 0.6% and 1.6%. Construction is also low relative to that supply. Revenues are growing. I think from our standpoint, we remain looking at RIDEA assets as opportunistic where there is an occupancy rate or a repositioning-type play, preferably where there is a significant upside and we get a risk-adjusted return. We think that if you buy good assets in good-info locations, and good quality, and allocate capital to reposition them, that there's still a play for RIDEA assets. And at the same time, as long as we can get outsized growth on triple-net-type opportunities, we'll take advantage of those types of structures as well. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. So just to clarify, for assisted living, which is where most of the supply is happening, you would be just as inclined to pursue a RIDEA structure if it met all those hurdles even though you see this uptick in supply happening in front of you? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, especially since you're dealing with new construction, whereas it's going to take 24 to 36 months for a lot of this stuff to kind of come online and then lease up. If I could take advantage of a good-quality asset in good markets where I've got barriers of entry and I can invest some capital and get an outsize risk-adjusted return, I'd be more than happy to do that kind of transaction. 
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. 
Juan Sanabria: Just on the balance sheet, I was wondering if you guys could talk about how much headroom you have to debt finance deals relative to sort of where your target leverage metrics? 
Timothy Schoen: We've got -- we're slightly below our target level of 40%. We're at 30%, and we ended the year at 39%. We run the balance sheet on a 60-40 basis, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of -- with your headwinds and rates, we could -- in terms of rates, the unsecured debt market today is still very attractive relative to the weighted average interest rates that we have in place, Juan. 
Juan Sanabria: Do you have any opportunities to refinance debt maturing this year that's -- and if so, is it included in guidance? 
Timothy Schoen: It's included in guidance and -- number 1. Number 2, there's $667 million coming due this year. Most of that's in the first quarter. It's not -- so relatively muted in terms of our total debt stack of $8.7 billion or something. 
Lauralee Martin: Well, thanks for everybody who's joined the call. As I said before, we thank you for your support, and we very much look forward to performing for you in 2014. 
Operator: This concludes today's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-29 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melinda, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]  I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Melinda. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements, including those about our guidance and the financial position and operations of our tenants. These statements are made as of today's date and reflect the company's good faith, beliefs and best judgment based on current information. These statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are described in our press releases and SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2012.
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. Future events could render the forward-looking statements untrue, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update earlier statements as a result of new information.
 Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, both of which have been furnished to the SEC today and are available on our website at www.hcpi.com.
 Also during the call, we will discuss certain operating metrics, including occupancy, cash flow coverage and same-property performance. These metrics and other related terms are defined in our supplemental information package.
 I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Lauralee Martin. 
Lauralee Martin: Thank you, John. Welcome to HCP's 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Paul Gallagher, Chief Investment Officer; Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; and John Lu, Investor Relations. Let us begin with our results and for those, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Lauralee. Let me start with our third quarter results. Our same-property portfolio generated a robust 3.7% cash NOI growth compared to the third quarter last year. Led by contractual rent increases and RIDEA senior housing performance, this represents the second consecutive quarter we achieved same-store growth at or above 3.5%, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. 
 For the third quarter, we reported FFO of $0.73 per share, which was impacted by management transition-related costs of $26 million or $0.06 per share, including the acceleration of equity-based compensation and severance payments. Excluding these severance-related charges, we achieved strong results, generating FFO, as adjusted, of $0.79 per share and FAD of $0.67 per share, representing year-over-year growth rates of 14.5% and 21.8%, respectively. 
 The results included a $0.05 per share gain and interest income from the par payoff of our 2 Barchester debt investments, which was $0.01 better than the prior forecast due to a follow-on investment completed in August. 
 From a quarterly run rate standpoint and before taking into account the Barchester investment gain, FAD for the quarter would have been $0.62 per share, representing a 12.7% year-over-year growth. The double-digit per share growth is jointly driven by our 3.7% cash same-property performance and accretive acquisitions completed during the second half of 2012, including a $1.7 billion senior housing portfolio operated by Emeritus and a $200 million mezzanine debt facility with Tandem Health Care. 
 Turning to investment transactions and balance sheet. During the quarter, we made investments totaling $78 million, that consisted of: one, $55 million in funding for development and other capital projects; two, a $15 million acquisition of an in-patient rehab facility as part of an asset swap transaction with Kindred Healthcare. In exchange, we sold a L pack at a matching price generating a gain of $8 million; and three, a GBP 5 million or $8 million follow-on Barchester debt investment purchased at a 40% discount to par. 
 In September, we received proceeds from the par payoff of our 2 Barchester investments totaling GBP 129 million or $202 million, which was used to pay down our revolver. The Barchester payoff and related revolver paydown improved our financial leverage sequentially by 80 basis points to 39.1% at quarter end. Our adjusted fixed charge coverage reached a new high at 4x during the quarter. In addition, we repaid $240 million of mortgage debt at a blended interest rate of 6%, reducing our secured ratio, secured debt ratio, by 100 basis points from 8% to 7%. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver and cash balances. 
 The improvement to all of our key credit metrics demonstrates our continued long-term commitment to a strong balance sheet. Debt maturities for the balance of 2013 totaled $414 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%, including $400 million of senior unsecured notes due in December. 
 Finally, updates to our 2013 guidance. We expect full year cash same-property performance to remain unchanged at a range between 2.5% and 3.5%. We are revising our 2013 NAREIT FFO guidance to a range of $2.91 and $2.97 per share due to the $0.06 per share severance-related charges in Q3 mentioned earlier, partially offset by a net positive benefit of $0.01 per share that I will discuss next. 
 Excluding severance-related charges, we are raising our 2013 FFO as adjusted guidance by $0.01 per share to a range between $2.97 and $3.03 per share. The increase is driven by the following items not contemplated in our last guidance: an additional $0.01 per share benefit from our follow-on Barchester debt investment in Q3; and a $0.01 per share gain for monetizing our investment in the Hyde Park senior housing development project in Tampa, Florida in anticipation of a refinancing during the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 These are offset in part by a $0.01 per share reduction due to lower noncash DFL income as we place the portfolio of 14 senior housing communities operated by Sunrise on a cash basis effective this quarter. We are raising our FAD guidance by $0.02 per share to a range between $2.48 and $2.54 per share, driven by a combined $0.02 per share benefit from our follow-on Barchester investment and Hyde Park refinancing I just mentioned. 
 As many of you know, we place the most emphasis on FAD per share amongst our various reported earnings metrics. We believe FAD is an effective measure of cash flow and our capacity to sustain and grow our dividends. At the midpoint of our updated guidance, 2013 FAD per share is projected to increase by 13.1% compared to 2012, improving our FAD payout ratio from 90% in 2012 to 84% this year. 
 While the current year FAD reflects the combined benefit of $0.09 per share from several favorable items, including gains from monetizing our Brookdale stock in Q1, Barchester debt in Q3 and refinancing our equity interest in Hyde Park in Q4. Excluding these favorable items, our year-over-year 2013 FAD per share growth remains strong at 9%, driven by the recurring benefit from cash same-store growth and accretive acquisitions. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Now let me review the portfolio's third quarter performance. 
 Senior housing. Occupancy for our senior housing platform was 85.5%, a 20 basis-point increase over the prior year and a 50 basis-point decline versus the prior quarter. The sequential decline is attributable to the lingering effects of a severe flu season. After reaching a low of 85.3% in April, occupancy has increased each month thereafter, reaching 86.3% for the month of August, a 100 basis point increase over the April lows. 
 Cash flow coverage for the portfolio was 1.12x, unchanged from the prior quarter. Same-property performance increased 7.2%, driven by contractual rent steps, including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators and strong performance in our RIDEA portfolio where year-over-year occupancy is up 230 basis points, rates are up 3.2% and margin is up 340 basis points. 
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2013, was 1.19x, a decline of 5 basis points from the June 30, 2013, coverage of 1.24x, reflecting the continued challenging rate and census environment for HCR's post-acute facilities, with increased admissions offset by shorter average lengths of stay. Despite the shorter average lengths of stay, HCR's rehospitalization rate of 18% remains significantly lower than the industry average, demonstrating HCR's continued high quality of care. 
 Although the outlook for reimbursement remains uncertain effective October 1, the skilled nursing industry was the beneficiary of the first Medicare rate increase of 1.3% in 24 months not offset by sequestration or other therapy provider cuts.
 Turning to our non-HCR post-acute/SNF portfolio. Cash flow coverage was 1.51x, an increase of 2 basis points over the prior quarter. Same-property performance for the non-HCR portfolio increased 4.6%, driven by rent steps and additional rent on capital improvements at our covenant care facilities. 
 In August, HCP acquired an additional GBP 9 million participation in the Barchester mezzanine loan facility at 60% to par. In September, we received to the par payoff of our aggregate GBP 129 million participation and realized a gain of GBP 16 million or $24 million related to the purchase discount, achieving an IRR of 53%. 
 The Barchester debt investment provided HCP with 3 potential options: one, a pathway to the real estate; two, an amendment or extension of our debt purchase; or three, a payoff at par. While we were not able to convert the debt investment into a long-term investment, we were well compensated and gained further U.K. market knowledge. 
 Hospitals. Cash flow coverage was 5.87x, an increase of 13 basis points over the prior quarter, driven by strong performance at our HCA Hospital at Medical City Dallas. Same-property performance increased 4.2%, driven by increased cash rents on our recently repositioned Plano, Texas facility. 
 During the quarter, we placed 3 of our hospitals in discontinued operations pending their acquisition by Tenet Healthcare under a fair market value purchase option effective February 19, 2014. The Tenet facilities generate annual rents of $23 million or 1% of HCP's annualized revenues. 
 In September, we acquired a 60-bed inpatient rehab facility located in Houston, Texas in exchange for a 62-bed long-term acute care hospital located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, both operated by Kindred. The swap resulted in improved cash flow coverage for our 12-property Kindred master lease without any impact on rents. All 3 of HCP's Kindred hospitals are now located in Kindred-designated key markets. 
 Medical Office Buildings. Same-property performance was up 1.4%, driven by rent steps, partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 170 basis points from the prior year to 90% related to the relocation of 2 major tenants to their own buildings. Excluding these relocations, the same-property performance increased 3.5%. 
 During the quarter, tenants representing 492,000 square feet took occupancy, bringing the year-to-date leasing total to 1.4 million square feet. The year-to-date retention rate is 70.2% and the average term for new and renewal leases is 52 months. 
 We have 528,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, net of 251,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We have executed 360,000 square feet of leases that have yet to commence and have an active leasing pipeline of 1.6 million square feet. 
 Life Science. Same-property performance declined 1.4%, driven by mark-to-market rent reductions and vacancy associated with the downsizing and consolidation of Takeda's South San Francisco operations into one of our San Diego properties earlier this year. Excluding these items, same-property performance increased 2.9%. 
 Occupancy for our Life Science portfolio increased 70 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points from the prior year to 92.3%. For the quarter, we completed 108,000 square feet of leasing, bringing the year-to-date total to 369,000 square feet, with a retention rate of 60.1%. 
 Subsequent to quarter end, we executed an 8-year 69,000 square foot lease with a genomic diagnostic tenant, CardioDx, at our Redwood City, California Life Science campus. The lease with CardioDx will anchor approximately 75% of the redevelopment HCP repositioned in 2011. 
 The Life Science portfolio has 277,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, representing just 0.3% of HCP's annualized revenues. These expirations include 160,000 square feet in Redwood City that will be vacated by an office tenant and is currently being marketed for both office and lab uses. Additionally, 77,000 square feet expiring at our Durham, North Carolina redevelopment project has been 100% leased to Duke University for 15 years.
 The Life Science development pipeline consists of 3 redevelopment projects currently 75% pre-leased totaling 166,000 square feet and a development project that is 100% pre-leased totaling 115,000 square feet. Total remaining funding requirements for the development pipeline are $23 million. 
 Turning towards 2014, the Life Science portfolio has 373,000 square feet of scheduled expirations, representing just 0.6% of HCP's annualized revenues. We are presently on track to address approximately 45% of those expirations by year end through early renewals and leasing. Overall, we are seeing an increased demand across entire portfolio, indicating our existing vacancies and landholdings are well positioned to capitalize on positive volumes and trends. 
 Sustainability. We have incorporated sustainability reporting into Page 2 of our supplemental. Sustainability highlights for the quarter include being named the CDP's Global 500 and S&P 500 climate disclosure leadership indices by obtaining a score of 97 out of 100 and ranking in the top 10% of reporting companies. 
 We were named Global and North American leader for health care sector by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark and were ranked #1 in the health care sector for the second consecutive year. And we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index ranking in the top 20% of the 600 largest North American companies in the Dow Jones Global Stock Market Index. 
 With that, I'd now like to turn it over to Lauralee. 
Lauralee Martin: Thanks, Paul. I've had the opportunity to speak with many of you, investors, analysts and bankers, and I would like to address what I've heard and provide my view on our conversations. 
 First, accretive growth, when and how much, has been the priority question, and I can assure you it is a priority focus for us as well. Specifically, I've been asked how will we continue to source deals. HCP has grown over the last 10 years through several large transformative acquisitions, which today are the property categories of the 5x5 investment model. 
 From our hospital origin, MedCap added medical office, CNL Retirement expanded our senior housing and medical office portfolios, SSF provided the premier life science platform, and HCR ManorCare for our post-acute. With these acquisitions also came tremendous talent, rich in relationships and expertise. This talent is ready and able to play a much greater role in acquisition without us missing a beat. 
 HCP today is a capital leader in healthcare real estate and is regularly called on by operators, bankers, private equity firms and brokers as sellers look to monetize their properties and portfolios or existing owners seek efficient liquidity events. HCP differentiates itself from the competition with our ability to quickly respond to time-sensitive and complicated structures. Our deep bench of industry expertise means we understand the needs of our operators and tenants, making us a reliable capital source. And finally, my 35 years in real estate is blessed with long-term relationships, and quickly, these connections, both in the U.S. and abroad, are focusing on healthcare assets as a relationship priority. 
 Second, there's a desire to better understand our view on international markets and the use of debt, particularly in the U.K. We have now made 2 debt investments into the U.K. We have one still outstanding, contributing nicely to FFO and FAD. And most recently, as Tim and Paul have covered in their comments, we realized an attractive return from our Barchester mezzanine debt investment. 
 The European markets have lagged the U.S. in dealing with its troubled debt portfolios, largely due to capital and bank markets lacking liquidity. This, together with demographics that track the U.S. market for aging seniors, makes this a market worth seriously evaluating for investment potential. 
 Because reimbursement policies are different from those in the U.S., our approach in this market has been consistent with the HCP risk-reward philosophy. We are using debt, which is part of our 5x5 strategy, as it gives us a chance to take a safe look, with equity having the first loss in the capital stack while we get smart on these new markets. 
 As we underwrite and then asset-manage our debt positions, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of the market, its operators and property performance dynamics. As you are aware, property acquisition pursuits are binary, win, lose, with both opportunity and pursuit cost. Although we did not convert Barchester to property ownership with this mezzanine debt investment, we received a significant investment return while we learned a great deal about the market and its key players. 
 Additionally, we have established solid relationships for future deal sourcing. With these investment returns, as well as the knowledge we gained, we still have potential property optionality in the future. 
 Debt is part of the HCP 5x5 investment strategy. As we evaluate each of the 5x5 property categories, we also look at where they are in the risk-reward cycle to determine the best approach for investment. For example, 30 months ago, we identified superior returns in senior housing development over those of acquisition. The Hyde Park monetization anticipated this quarter validates this approach as we achieve both an investment gain while we still have an ownership position in the property for continuing FFO. So in response to the question, will the disciplines of HCP's investment strategy change? Let me confirm that the 5x5 strategy is both proven and flexible to provide us growth and performance in all types of markets. 
 Finally, many of you have asked for my perspective on our important HCR ManorCare investment. Although this investment was underwritten in anticipation that coverage would decline with the RUGs-IV cuts, the coverage has been further impacted by additional reimbursement reductions, lower hospital volumes, which have impacted the entire skilled nursing industry and declines in average lengths of stay. However, we remain confident that our investment will continue to perform. 
 Let me reinforce why we are so confident: First, our relationship with HCR management is solid, characterized by open communication and alignment for our mutual business success. I've had the opportunity to meet with management and discuss first-hand the actions they are taking to address their business challenges. These include their focus on managing cost that include aggressive actions to take out permanent costs in response to a softer rate in census environment. HCR is also focused on enhancing revenues, such as initiating pilot programs with managed-care companies and creating partnerships with hospital systems.
 Second, as a leader in post-acute, offering the lower-cost alternative to other post-acute settings, the HCR management team continues to strengthen their market leadership by investing in the business, and in particular, our real estate. These investments represent expansions that exceed what is required by our lease. These investments have resulted in an increase in admissions over the prior year and census higher than the broader market, demonstrating they are gaining market share. The investments are a demonstration of the confidence that HCR has in their own business, a confidence we share.
 Third, for asset management purposes, the structure of 4 separate renewal pools in the master lease, each diversified by geography, quality mix and property-level performance, strongly incents HCR to address individual property performance that may be a drag on overall lease coverage. We continue our close dialogue with them as we mutually work to optimize how to enhance overall lease coverage. 
 So in summary, after 3 weeks on the job, I'm even more excited and confident about the opportunity and the potential of HCP. 
 And finally, yesterday, we received Jay's resignation from the board of HCP. We thank Jay for his many contributions to the company and wish him the very best in his future endeavors. This is the conclusion of our formal comments. Let me now ask Melinda to open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. 
Joshua Raskin: It's Josh here. I'm with Jack as well. I guess we have 2 quick questions for you. One, maybe, Lauralee, could you talk a little bit about the timing of investments that you're making, sort of a lower number in the quarter than we've seen in historical times? I'm just curious if the management change had anything to do with that or if it's just -- typically it's lumpy and it comes in a different time and there's nothing to read into it. 
Lauralee Martin: Well, we are very actively in the market for deals. You'll recall that in the second quarter just across the broader marketplace, sales activity really took a pause due to the uncertainty that was generated by the Federal Reserve's comments. We have seen market activity come back. And as I talked about, we see that activity across the entire 5x5. So we will be active. I think to your point, it will be lumpy. I would also say we put a lot into the Barchester transaction and transactions are binary. The good thing is we got paid very well for that effort, and we think we're strongly positioned for more in the future. 
Joshua Raskin: Okay. So not going to read into anything around the timing or anything like that. 
Lauralee Martin: Correct. 
Joshua Raskin: Okay, and then I know Jack had a follow-up as well. 
Jack Meehan: So just another one on the deal environment. Specifically thinking about the acute care space. Are you seeing more interest for new transactions there? And then are there any characteristics for certain assets that you're seeing in the market, either more urban versus rural, or larger facilities, things like that? 
Paul Gallagher: We saw some activity first half of this year, probably a little more than we've seen in the past 2 or 3 years. But we continue to see opportunities kind of across-the-board. We like the debt side on the acute care hospital side, but we have not seen anything as robust as we did in the first half of this year from a volume standpoint. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Rick Anderson from BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: Can you have a comment on G&A now with the severance behind you? What do you think a run rate will be for G&A on a go forward basis, bigger or smaller in future years? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, a good run rate, Rich. It's in the $21 million to $22 million range a quarter. 
Richard Anderson: That stays intact? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. Lauralee, you mentioned HCR ManorCare and in close dialogue with them. Regarding the 4 master leases, is that -- could that number change in the future? In other words, could you see a lower number of master leases, some type of transaction between the 2 companies that lowers your exposure? 
Paul Gallagher: You mean, as far as just less assets owned by HCP? 
Richard Anderson: Yes. 
Paul Gallagher: We constantly are in dialogue with HCR as far as what's going on with their platform. We have not had those specific discussions. But to the extent if there was addition by subtraction, we would be open to those sorts of discussions. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And if I can have your, Lauralee, your comment on your view on RIDEA, and how, as HCP has been a lesser player in that business, do you have any comment about whether or not you'll do more or less? 
Lauralee Martin: Yes. The RIDEA philosophy was -- has always been embedded with the board. And both management and the board have shared a very consistent view. We have nothing against RIDEA. We just think it needs to be priced appropriately. It works for some assets, it doesn't work for other assets. It works when you can see a way to enhance value and it's got to be priced appropriately. So if the opportunities come forward that match our risk reward philosophy, we'll be in them. And if they don't, we'll do triple net leases. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And then lastly for me, you mentioned relationships with a very high-quality resume that you bring to the table. But what about healthcare relationships? Do you have that in your coffer as well? Or would you be relying on folks that work for you to maintain and enhance relationships? 
Lauralee Martin: Well, I will definitely be relying on the people in HCP. But Jones Lang LaSalle has both a healthcare business and a life science business. We approached it not as an owner. We were a service provider but it meant that we were advisers into many of the clients that actually HCP has or would like to have. And so those relationships come in at levels of conversation that can make us potentially dialogue differently but get to what HCP would like. And that is an opportunity to be part of the capital structures of the best providers. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: Just one on the HCR ManorCare portfolio. Your coverage has continued to drop again this quarter. I understand they're working to fix those coverages through new initiatives. But how long do you realistically expect those fixes to take? And where would you expect the bottom of the coverages to hit for HCR ManorCare portfolio? 
Paul Gallagher: Jeff. I think first off, I mentioned this is the first time in 24 months that HCR has benefited from a Medicare rate increase that was not offset by sequestration or therapy provider cuts. They also saw some solid growth in their home health and hospice with 3.5% year-over-year growth. Headwinds do continue with lower census due to shorter lengths of stay and shift from Medicare to Medicare Advantage. But they are gaining market share. Admissions are up 1% year-to-date. Free cash flow year-to-date $65 million after rent, interest and maintenance. They continue to spend $100 million run rate on CapEx, and that validates their confidence in the platform. Yes, they've been kind of bumping along the bottom from the standpoint of coverage, but we feel that with the rate increase that's happening, coupled with new cost savings initiatives that they're initiating in the fourth quarter and the strategic partnerships that they have, we think they're going to gain some good traction here in 2014. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. So you think we're at the bottom now essentially? 
Paul Gallagher: We've been bumping along for the past couple of quarters, we're finally getting some good news. We think with what they've done with their strategic partnerships, they've positioned themselves well from 2014. They're taking into account new cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter. We've got rate bumps. We think that's going to bode well for 2014. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. Just one more on the overall acquisition environment. As you look at the various real estate subsectors out there, which ones right now based on current market pricing look like the most attractive risk-adjusted returns to you? 
Paul Gallagher: We're actually seeing some good activity in life science, MOBs and senior housing right now, not as much on the hospital side, probably more debt opportunities on the post-acute side. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Juan Sanabria: I was just wondering if you could give us some commentary on the bid-ask spread. The last time around when capital markets were a bit more volatile, you talked about the increasing your cost of capital and there being a wide bid-ask spread. Has that come in at all based on your assessment of your own capital cost? 
Lauralee Martin: I would make one comment then I'll let the others go in. I think one of the things that I see is that the strength of HCP is really understanding the underlying property dynamics, the capital needs of the operators and then being able to use the right structure against those to compete very well in any type of cost to capital environment. So it's really going at the needs of the operators and what those properties need to have happened that gives us our opportunities. 
Timothy Schoen: It's also understanding kind of where your exposure is. Just because we have very, very favorable cost of capital doesn't mean that we need to pay more than what the property is worth. That's going to have an impact on you when there's new construction in the marketplace and things of that nature. So we're constantly assessing what the right risk return is from the real estate standpoint as well. 
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And are you guys more or less likely to do a RIDEA transaction with the pick up in supply we've seen? Does that make you a bit more hesitant or not necessarily? 
Paul Gallagher: From our standpoint in RIDEA, we think that simply changing from a lease structure to a RIDEA structure doesn't give you "the upside" that you would need for taking on the risk in a RIDEA. We like more the turnaround-type scenario, change in operator, occupancy play, reposition play and things of that nature. And to the extent we see those, we would consider doing a RIDEA transaction. That said, when we bought our Bray joint venture from Blackstone and Emeritus last year, they had a component of that portfolio that had a lot of those characteristics. But we were able to effectively structure that deal in the triple-net lease where we got the upside through rent steps in the first 5 years and then a rent reset to market at the end of that 5-year period. And effectively, we were able to protect our downside with corporate guarantee from Emeritus while still getting the upside that we wouldn't have gotten through a RIDEA transaction. 
Juan Sanabria: Great. And just a last question. Were you guys looking at the holiday transaction that one of your peers had transacted on? 
Lauralee Martin: Yes, I would say we look at all significant deals. But our policy is not to comment on what happens to the market. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS Capital Market. 
Nicholas Yulico: I was hoping we could turn back to the Emeritus that you did do a year ago. Thinking about the pricing for that, it was a 6-1 initial yield. It was in a ton of coverage on day 1 because you had -- there was going to be some occupancy upside. Is that the type of deal that you would do today, I mean in this environment? Similar pricing, similar type of coverage or have you sort of rethought that deal as it is now a year later? 
Paul Gallagher: I think we like that risk return profile on that particular transaction. We would definitely be interested in a similar type of transaction. And by the way, that portfolio was actually performing better than our underwriting. So we think of that as a very good outcome. 
Timothy Schoen: And as Paul mentioned, the reason we like that transaction, corporate guarantee, outsize rent steps, the ability to stabilize that portfolio over time, investment of the tenant in that portfolio. So those are all aspects of a deal that we like that we would definitely do again even in today's environment. 
Nicholas Yulico: And you said it's performed a little bit better, so I'm assuming that the coverage has gone up then in the past year? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, occupancy, margins and coverage are all -- rate occupancy and margins are all up. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay, good. And then on HCR ManorCare, I mean, I think there was this thinking that at some point in time, there was going to be some possible potential upside maybe getting to some additional real estate opportunities by having a relationship with ManorCare if they were consolidated or another situation. How much of that is still a possibility today? And does that only happen if HCR ManorCare at the OpCo ends up, let's say, merging with a hospital provider or assisted-living provider? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think those opportunities do exist. They do have owned properties outside of our master lease that we've had discussions with them in the past. ManorCare has been spending a majority of their time dealing with the difficult environment, the post-acute sector for the past 24 months. But we do have constant dialogue about opportunities that are in the marketplace, and we've had active discussions about specific transactions over the past 12 months. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, if we go back to the call 3 weeks ago, there was talk that the reason for the CEO change had to do with leadership style. Jay submitted a letter last night saying the vision for the redirection of the company -- his vision has differed in the past and still differs today from that of the remaining board members. Can you just talk a little bit about that? And maybe, Lauralee, if you could just talk about it? I mean, Lauralee whether there really is any sort of strategy change in place today that you're looking to implement? Because it sounds like there could be a strategy shift potentially, but you guys haven't really said that there has been. So as much as you can on that. 
Lauralee Martin: Sure. Well, first of all, the reasons expressed by Jay and his resignation, we do not view -- board does not view as any different than what Mike McKee, our Chairman, made in his comments on the recent per leadership change. The board and Jay had a very different vision of the tone and standards of leadership that belong and are required at an S&P 500 company at the stature of HCP. So it's very consistent with what you've been told and it is there. I think what you've heard is my comments on our strategy, what we're doing in that strategy. And as a board member, I've been very comfortable with our business strategy. If we change our strategy, it will be because the operating environment tells us we should for more opportunity and the management team wants to do it together. But right now, it's working very well. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citibank. 
Michael Bilerman: Yes, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Lauralee, I find it strange that you're saying that it's consistent in terms of what Jay sort of had written and what you guys discussed on the last call. Mike specifically said it's not about a new direction. It's purely about leadership, and Jay's letter clearly would indicate direction, not about how he takes that direction but specifically about what direction the company is going to. And so can you elaborate a little bit more because you are were board member about what those differences were? 
Lauralee Martin: Again, the word that he used was vision, and the ongoing discussions between the board and Jay were our vision of what leadership should be and his vision of how we operate it. We discussed those very clearly in the transition change, and that was the reason for the change. So I appreciate everybody wanting to pursue what has happened, but we as a company are completely looking forward on how we optimize our performance and deliver the most to shareholders at this point. 
Michael Bilerman: Right. Well, he didn't say his vision for the leadership of the company. He said his vision for the direction that the company is taking. So that's different from a style of leadership that would indicate that potentially, he wanted to do potentially more transactions maybe with outside the 5x5. Maybe wanted to go further internationally, maybe it wasn't just U.K. Maybe it was Asia. That's the type of thing that we're trying to get an understanding about the direction he wanted to sort of take the company versus where the board was willing to allow it. 
Lauralee Martin: Again, I think you're trying to find words in a document of resignation that is reading way too much into it. Again, I realize everybody wants to delve into it, but the most important thing is we're telling you our strategy today. We're telling you where we're going and we're completely looking forward to get it done. 
Michael Bilerman: Okay, Manny has some questions. 
Emmanuel Korchman: Paul, I think you had made a comment earlier that Barchester had allowed you to get additional U.K. knowledge. And just wondering, obviously, you guys have made a debt investment. It's allowed you to get on the ground. Those have been done over and over again at this point. It sounds like you wanted to be more involved in Barchester than beyond the debt investment that didn't happen. How might things play out forward or maybe you can elaborate on kind of why Barchester isn't part of HCP today? 
Paul Gallagher: Why it is or it's not? 
Emmanuel Korchman: It is not. 
Paul Gallagher: Well, again, we were dealing with risk-adjusted returns with that particular transaction. There were certain aspects of the transaction after we got in and did some due diligence at the asset level that indicated that where we thought value was, was different than where they were. But from a standpoint of understanding the market, we do our normal due diligence. We went out and we looked at a lot of assets, understood the landscape, talked with a lot of people about reimbursement in the marketplace, understood their particular strategy. We have a good relationship with the folks at Four Seasons, understood their strategy and how they created value in the marketplace. And we've been able to formulate some very strong opinions about what are good opportunities over there in the U.K. market. And we think there are still some attractive opportunities for us to pursue. 
Timothy Schoen: We underwrote Barchester as a debt investment. We like the returns associated with the debt investment. But like we've done in the past, we do like the optionality of debt. At times, that's led to the ownership of real estate in HCR ManorCare's case, and at times, that's resulted in repayments like in the case of Genesis and Barchester. So we like the optionality. We underwrite it as a debt investment. If it clears the bar, great. If it leads to ownership of real estate, all the better. 
Emmanuel Korchman: Could we expect an entry into a different maybe international market to be done the same way, take a foothold for a debt investment and, if possible, then go into the next reinvestment? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think Lauralee commented on that, that that's kind of the preferred action. If we find something that we feel on a risk-adjusted basis makes absolute sense, then we would pursue the equity transaction. But primarily, we like to get in with best-in-class operators and try and provide capital in the debt stack. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Carroll: If you guys describe your current investment pipeline, I know last quarter HCP took a step back on the investment market. But now it sounds like that's no longer the case and the company is once again much more active in the market. 
Timothy Schoen: I wouldn't say that we characterize it as HCP took a step back. What -- I think what we said was, as a result of what happened with the Fed and what have you, that buyers have taken a step back to reassess where pricing would be. Right now, our portfolio remains strong and robust across the 5x5 and we're actively in the marketplace. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And what types of investment should we expect in the near term? I mean, will you continue to make these similar type of Barchester loans or should we expect more real estate-centric investments? 
Paul Gallagher: Wherever we can find the appropriate risk-adjusted return. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then can you give us some color -- I think you mentioned you had a follow-on investment in the Barchester loan? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes. We had the opportunity to acquire a small piece a couple of weeks prior to the payoff, and we were able to buy that investment to that tranche and subsequently we're repaid. 
Michael Carroll: Was that the same seller that you made the original purchase from? 
Timothy Schoen: No, it was a different institution. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Actually, my question has been answered. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: Quick question for Tim. I was wondering if you can give a little more color on when you talked about 2013 guidance, you said, I guess, a pool of Sunrise assets were being transitioned from DFL to cash and that was $0.01 hit. Just give us more detail on that, if you could. And is it -- should we think of it as a $0.01 hit per quarter going forward? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Mike, on the pool, on that particular pool, it was a pool of 14 assets that are operated by Sunrise, has a unique structure where CapEx is taken out of the operating cash flow. We anticipate making an increased amount of capital investment in that portfolio to improve the occupancy and the operating performance over the next 12 to 18 months. And as a result, the operating cash flow after CapEx is projected to be under our accrual level. We chose to be more conservative and switched to cash basis this quarter. I would think about this investment similar to what we did on our RIDEA portfolio where we invested in the portfolio to improve the operating results. So we're going to take over the next 12 to 18 months, invest in that portfolio and improve the results associated with those 14 assets. 
Michael Mueller: Okay. So it seems like it's going to be recurring. It's not a onetime item until it picks back up down the road? 
Timothy Schoen: Right, yes. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel. 
Robert Mains: Balance sheet question. Your leverage levels have gotten to be fairly low. Is there anything that you're targeting like with the ratings agencies or something? Is this just a function of kind of slow investment pace and you could lever up given the opportunity? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. I think, Rob, we've been very consistent with our capital structure, 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity. I wouldn't expect that to change. We're a little bit below that, given the Barchester debt payoff so there's no target with the rating agencies. We continue to have the highest-rated balance sheet in the healthcare sector. And you would expect -- you should expect to see us continue to underwrite 60 parts equity, 40 parts debt. So we're right in that zone. 
Robert Mains: Okay, fair enough. And then, Paul, you had said that when you talked about asset classes, currently, your liking life science, MOB, senior housing. Are you looking at any life science markets outside of the ones that you're already in? 
Paul Gallagher: No. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then another question for you. The last call, you gave us normalized HCR ManorCare guarantor level coverage to take out the prior period reserve adjustments. Do you have that for the September quarter? 
Paul Gallagher: I have to look that up, Rob. 
Robert Mains: Okay, I'll call you off-line on that. And then 1 FAD question for you, Tim. Can you give us either a run rate, either quarterly or annually that we should be looking at for your CapEx? Because I found that to be kind of challenging to model. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, CapEx, Rob, is a little lumpy. It's got some seasonality in it. But from a run rate standpoint for the year, year in and year out, it's been right around the low $60 million range. That should be consistent. 35% to 40% of that gets spent in the fourth quarter. So expect to see that this fourth quarter, you expect to see it a little bit more lumpy, I think, in the $25 million range. But anyway, $60 million just in that zip code is a good annual run rate. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. 
Todd Stender: Tim, your debt maturities between now and, I think, February 1 are up around $800 million. If you hit in the line, balance you're up in excess of $1 billion. Just kind of talking through some of your options now, kind of how you're thinking about where your leverage profile could go, I guess, over the next couple of months? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, obviously, we'll continue to look opportunistically at the markets to do longer-term debt, but we do have some cash coming back to us with regards to some purchase options that have been exercised. So that addresses a large piece of the maturities next year. So we actually have a lot of optionality in terms of liquidity over the next 3 to 4 months. 
Todd Stender: Is that regarding the Tenet Healthcare repurchases? 
Timothy Schoen: That and one other asset with call sell [ph]. 
Todd Stender: Okay. What is that number? What's the Tenet Healthcare number? How much is that expected to be? 
Timothy Schoen: We're going through the valuation process right now. 
Todd Stender: Okay. And Paul, you indicated you're seeing opportunities in life science. Could we just get your updated thoughts on life science, if it's an area you would add to? I just ask because of some of Jay's comments from a few quarters ago just suggested that there were some macro factors that were contributing to HCP maybe taking a pause and adding to that exposure. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think we still view the asset class as attractive. I think at that point in time when those comments were made, leasing was slow. We've seen it pick up in all 3 of the markets that we're in. So there are opportunities that do exist in a couple of these various different markets and we're actively looking at those opportunities. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Karin Ford: Just wanted to hear your thoughts on where HCP's required return levels have changed to, if they have at all in the last few months, and/or where you think cap rates have moved across different asset classes recently? 
Paul Gallagher: Well, we really haven't seen too much of a move in cap rates. I would answer that question this way. It's not a question of what is our hurdle rate but what's the rate risk-adjusted return for the investment opportunity that presents itself. And those that have less risk, there's going to be a lower hurdle, and those that have more risk, we're going to want to have a little higher return. So we look at them on an individual basis, utilizing the 5x5. And to the extent there are opportunities across the board, we'll go for them as they hit the right return numbers. 
Karin Ford: Have those thresholds changed across their spectrum with either the change in cost of capital and/or the change in leadership at HCP? 
Paul Gallagher: I don't think we're looking at those any differently. Our cost of capital based on stock price and debt costs move on a daily basis. But how we price the risk, that hasn't changed. 
Operator: And your last question comes from John Roberts with Hilliard Lyons. 
John Roberts: Lauralee, I hate to keep beating this but if the reason for the change in management was Jay's management style, why did it take so long for the board to decide that it didn't like his management style? And how does your management style differ from Jay's? 
Lauralee Martin: I think style, you never quite know when it sort of hits you that it's too much. I think I can say I was on the board of HCP for 5 years, most of the board much longer than I am -- was. And in that time, we had 4 CFOs, 3 general councils, 2 audit firms, I could go on. I mean, you never know what is finally, enough is enough. So there was no triggering event, I think, is what everybody's looking for that was there. My style difference? I believe in teams. I believe that it takes a lot of expertise to do complicated business, and that's why you need teams that each bring their specialty, their knowledge, their add to what gets done. The team at HCP is extraordinary. And already, it is a team, it feels like a team. I'm delighted with what we're getting done. So I think it's a large company, HCP is. It works in a space where we want to be a much larger company, and that requires talent being utilized across the board. And that would be probably the major difference that I would say I'm bringing.
 Okay. Well with that, we thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you shortly at NAREIT, and we hope many of you will be joining the bus tour of our Bay Area Life Science portfolio on Tuesday, November 12. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-30 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darla, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Darla. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements, including those about our guidance and the financial position and operations of our tenants. These statements are made as of today's date and reflect the company's good faith, beliefs and best judgment based on currently available information. These statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are described in our press releases and SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2012.
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. Future events could render the forward-looking statements untrue, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update earlier statements as a result of new information.
 Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. We have provided reconciliations to these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, both of which have been furnished to the SEC today and are available on our website at www.hcpi.com.
 Also during the call, we will discuss certain operating metrics, including occupancy, cash flow coverage and same-property performance. These metrics and other related terms are defined in our supplemental information package. 
  I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thank you, John. Welcome to HCP's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen. Let us begin with our results, and for those, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. Let me start with our second quarter results. Our same property portfolio produced strong 3.5% cash NOI growth compared to the second quarter last year, driven by our senior housing triple-net and RIDEA portfolios. Cash same-store growth ramped up during the quarter, consisted with our forecast and represents the level of organic growth expected for the second half of 2013. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes. 
 We reported second quarter FFO of $0.72 per share and FAD of $0.62 per share, representing year-over-year growth rates of 4.3% and 10.7%, respectively, driven by $2.5 billion of accretive acquisitions completed in the second half of 2012 and strong cash same-store growth in our FAD results. 
 Note that 2 nonrecurring items impacted the comparative quarterly results: first, a prior year quarter included a favorable $0.02 recovery of past G&A expenses; second, results this quarter included an unfavorable $0.02 per share noncash adjustment related to straight-line rents in our hospital segment, which reduced revenues and FFO for the second quarter but had no impact on our cash same-store or FAD results. Excluding these nonrecurring items, the year-over-year growth rate for the quarter was 10.4% for FFO and 14.8% for FAD. 
 Turning to investment transactions and balance sheet. During the quarter, we made accretive investments totaling $367 million that consisted of: first, GBP 109 million or $170 million multitranche U.K. debt investment on properties leased to Barchester Healthcare purchased at a 10% discount to par. The debt earns interest on a blended rate of LIBOR plus 3.14% and is scheduled to mature in September, 2 months from today;  second, $102 million second tranche investment under our mezzanine loan facility to Tandem Health Care funded 2 months earlier than anticipated. As previously announced, the second tranche earns cash interest at 14% annually, bringing the blended yield to 13% on the overall $202 million facility;  and third, $95 million related to the acquisition of 2 senior housing communities, along with other capital and debt investments. We funded these investments with free cash flow and $262 million under our $1.5 billion revolver, including GBP 109 million to match fund our Barchester debt investment through maturity. 
 We have $1.3 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver and cash balances before taking into account the anticipated par payoff of our Barchester debt investment on September 30. 
 Debt maturities for the remainder of 2013 total $655 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%, including $400 million of unsecured notes and $255 million for mortgage debt. 
 Our balance sheet and credit metrics continue to improve over year-end  2012 levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, fixed charge coverage increased 20 basis points to 3.8x, and net debt-to-EBITDA improved 20 basis points to 5.1x. Our secured debt ratio declined 30 basis points to 8% at year-end  Q2, which will further improve to 6.9% by year-end,  based on our current refinancing plans. 
 Finally, updates to our 2013 guidance. Our existing portfolio is performing in line with forecast. We continue to project full year cash same-property performance to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%. For the second half of 2013, cash same-store is expected to grow at or above the 3.5% level achieved this quarter. 
 We are raising our 2013 FFO guidance by $0.02 per share to a range of $2.96 and $3.02 per share. The increase is driven by the following items not contemplated in our last guidance: a $0.04 benefit from our second quarter investment activities, including $0.03 related to a one-time gain from the anticipated par payoff of our Barchester debt investment, net of transaction costs, offset in part by the $0.02 non-cash charge recorded in Q2 mentioned earlier. 
 We are raising our 2013 FAD guidance by $0.05 per share to a range between $2.46 and $2.52 per share, driven by the $0.04 accretive benefit from 2013 acquisition activity and $0.01 from several other items. At the midpoint of our updated guidance, 2013 FFO per share is projected to increase 8% compared to 2012 FFO as adjusted, and FAD is projected to grow 12% compared to last year. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Now let me review the portfolio's second quarter performance. Senior housing. Occupancy for our senior housing platform was 86%, a 60-basis-point  increase over the prior year and a 70-basis-point  decline over the prior quarter. The sequential decline is attributable to seasonal occupancy declines and a severe flu season. 
 Cash flow coverage for the portfolio was 1.10x, a 1-basis-point  decline from the prior quarter, driven by outsized fixed rent bumps on our transitioned assets. 
 Same property performance increased 6.4%, driven by contractual rent steps, including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators and continued strong 2013 performance of our RIDEA portfolio. 
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2013 was 1.24x, a decline of 4 basis points from the March 31, 2013 coverage of 1.28x. HCR's year-to-date 2013 revenues are above the prior year despite challenging volume trends in the acute care hospital industry and lower average lengths of stay for post-acute patients at HCR's facilities. 
 Year-to-date admissions are up 2% compared to the prior year, with a lower average length of stay. A reflection of positive patient outcomes resulted in occupancy for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 of 84.1% or 120 basis points below the prior year. 
 All of HCR's operating sectors have demonstrated strong cost control. In addition, home health and hospice continue to report results above prior year. Year-to-date, HCR has generated $60 million in free cash flow after rent, interest and maintenance CapEx. And total CapEx, including investments to maintain, upgrade and expand our facilities, is consistent with a $100 million annual run rate. 
 Turning to our non-HCR post-acute/SNF portfolio. Cash flow coverage was 1.49x, a 1-basis-point  increase over the prior quarter. Same property performance for the non-HCR portfolio increased 3.7%, driven by normal rent steps. 
 On May 2, 2013, HCP acquired a GBP 120 million participation in a mezzanine loan facility at 90% of par, secured by 160 care homes leased to Barchester Healthcare, a leading operator throughout the United Kingdom. The loan is subordinate to a GBP 529 million  CMBS loan, and both mature on September 30, 2013. The anticipated par payoff at maturity will provide HCP with a gain of GBP 12 million or $18 million, an annualized IRR of 32%. 
 On June 24, 2013, HCP funded the $102 million second tranche of a $202 million mezzanine loan facility to an affiliate Formation Capital as part of the recapitalization of its Tandem skilled nursing portfolio. The loan has a blended yield to maturity of 13.3% and matures October 2017. The portfolio has a debt service coverage ratio of 1.81x. 
 Hospitals. Cash flow coverage was unchanged to 5.35x, driven by strong performance at our HCA hospital at Medical City Dallas. Same property performance increased 3.3%, driven by increased cash rents on our recently repositioned Plano, Texas facility. 
 Medical Office Buildings. Same property performance was up 0.2%, driven by rent steps, partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 100 basis points from the prior quarter to 90% related to the relocation of 2 major tenants to their own building. Excluding these relocations, the same property performance increased 1.9%. 
 During the quarter, tenants representing 578,000 square feet took occupancy, bringing the year-to-date leasing total to 901,000 square feet. The year-to-date retention rate is 68%, and the average term for new and renewal leases is 66 months. 
 Mark-to-market rents declined 1.2%, driven by the renewal of 4 long-term leases where HCP's tenant improvement allowance was minimal. We have 887,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, net of 362,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We have executed 320,000 square feet of leases that have yet to commence and have an active leasing pipeline of 1.3 million square feet. 
 Life science. Occupancy for our life science portfolio increased 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 91.6%. For the quarter, we completed 17,000 square feet of leasing, bringing the year-to-date total to 261,000 square feet with a retention rate of 58.7%. 
 Same property performance was up 0.2%, driven by rent steps, partially offset by mark-to-market rent reductions and vacancy associated with the downsizing and consolidation of Takeda's South San Francisco operations into one of our San Diego properties during the first quarter. Excluding these items, same property performance increased 2.2%. 
 Last week, we executed a 5-year 63,000-square-foot  lease with Genentech for the entire building recently vacated by Takeda, expanding Genentech's total footprint in our South San Francisco portfolio to 857,000 square feet. 
 The life science portfolio has 322,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, representing just 0.3% of HCP's annualized revenues. The expirations include 77,000 square feet in Durham, North Carolina at a recently acquired redevelopment project where we are converting office to lab space. Duke University has pre-leased 100% of the space for a 15-year term. 
 The life science development pipeline consists of 3 redevelopment projects currently 70% pre-leased totaling 166,000 square feet and a development project that is 100% pre-leased totaling 115,000 square feet. Total remaining funding requirements for the development pipeline are $36 million. 
 Sustainability. Yesterday, we published our comprehensive second annual sustainability report based on the Global Reporting Initiative framework. The report is available under the Sustainability section of our website. Additionally, we recently completed our sustainability reporting effort for 2012, which includes the submission of our first annual Dow Jones Sustainability Index assessment, our second annual Carbon Disclosure Project survey and our second annual Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark survey, which was combined with NAREIT's Leader in the Light Questionnaire. 
 During the quarter, we received 2 ENERGY STAR labels, bringing the total to 104 across the MOB, life science and senior housing sectors. In addition, we received 2 LEED certifications, a LEED Commercial Interior certification for our 180 Kimball building at our South San Francisco life science campus and a LEED certification at our only Maryland senior housing development project. 
  With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jay. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Paul. We are very pleased with this quarter's 14.8% year-over-year growth in FAD per share, adjusted for the prior year nonrecurring item Tim mentioned. 
 Let me now add additional color on 3 separate topics: one, this quarter's results; two, our senior housing development initiatives; and three, the current transaction environment. As previewed on our first quarter call, same property performance accelerated to 3.5% for the second quarter, with each of our 5 property sectors making positive contributions in the period. 
 Senior housing led the way at a 6.4% same property performance increase, benefited from outsized contractual escalators on transitioned assets and continued improvement at our RIDEA joint venture with Brookdale, where a 5.6% increase in revenues raised margins by 210 basis points to 38.2%. 
 We are pleased with the outperformance of our Blackstone JV acquisition of last October as year-to-date, year-over-year EBITDAR is up 11.8% and trailing 8 months lease coverage has moved up 2 basis points to 1.08x. 
 HCR continues to face headwinds, notably the softness in admission and patient volumes experienced by the acute care hospital sector. As 90% of HCR's admissions represent discharges from the hospital sector, this dynamic negatively impacted HCR's occupancy during the first half of 2013. Notwithstanding this operating environment, HCR continued to invest significant capital in our properties while growing its cash balances to $162 million at quarter end. 
 We began discussions with tenant to determine the fair market value of our 3 hospitals as part of their decision to exercise purchase options on these facilities. As disclosed on our Q1 earnings call, the sale of these 3 hospitals is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. 
 In our life science sector, same property performance and occupancy continue to grind higher. We are pleased with the additional tenant exposure to Roche/Genentech, which now constitutes 18% of our life science portfolio. The relationship expanded to a total of 857,000 square feet as a result of Roche/Genentech leasing the entire building in South San Francisco that was vacated by Takeda earlier this year as Takeda consolidated and expanded their operations to HCP's life science portfolio in San Diego. 
 In our MOB sector, we are experiencing some delay in tenant decisions as physician groups and hospitals remain cautious on making longer-term commitments, given uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. 
 In addition to this quarter's successful Barchester debt investment, our sector leading that platform enjoyed good operating results at Four Seasons U.K. and Tandem Health Care, with trailing 6-month debt service coverage at both companies at solid 1.8x levels. 
 Finally, to close out the quarter, HCP's credit metrics continue to track at A- levels, and our immediate liquidity is substantial. 
 Let me now provide an update on our senior housing development initiatives. In the second quarter, HCP closed on a $22 million loan commitment for the development of a Class A senior housing facility in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. This loan commitment represents the seventh investment by HCP in our participating development loan program, bringing the total program commitments to over $140 million. 
 Under the program, HCP provides approximately 80% of the total development costs, with HCP participating in up to 30% of the anticipated value creation. The total program consists of 690 units spread between 130 units of independent living, 380 units of assisted living and 180 units of Alzheimer's. 
 Total development costs of $173 million approximate $250,000 per unit. The properties are located in Germantown, Tennessee; Olney, Maryland; Horsham, Willistown and Doylestown, Pennsylvania near the mainline area of Philadelphia; Roseland, New Jersey; and Houston, Texas. The 4 properties in lease-up were delivered on time, under budget and are performing at or above underwriting. 
 2 of the remaining 3 communities still in development are expected to be delivered in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, while the Doylestown property is scheduled for the first quarter of 2015. Brookdale Senior Living operates 5 communities, and Atria operates 2. Stabilized return on cost for the portfolio is estimated to be 12%, an attractive spread over current senior housing acquisition cap rates. 
 Now in addition to the development loan program, HCP has a development joint venture, where HCP provides 72% of the equity for the construction of a high-end senior housing community in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. The property is now complete, 100% occupied with a waiting list and operated by Brookdale. The property achieved a 13% return on costs and upon refinancing of the third-party construction loan later this year is expected to return all of HCP's $8 million of equity, plus a profit of $4.5 million, resulting in an unlevered IRR of 17%. This anticipated monetization represents additional upside to our current 2013 guidance.
 As for the current deal environment, it is fair to say that Fed Chairman Bernanke's comments of 2 months ago and subsequent capital market volatility has impacted our near-term deal volumes. While we were not hard on any commitments at the time of the sell-off when the whistle blew, it remains to be seen how quickly the pause button that was pushed on May 22 resets on revised terms. 
 Our raised guidance of this morning puts HCP on track to deliver a 2013 12% increase in FAD per share over our 2012 result. This is especially gratifying in light of the high percentage of contractual investments, either triple-net leases or debt obligations, that comprise HCP's portfolio. If achieved, our dividends pro forma FAD payout ratio for 2013 would improve to 84%, providing significant free cash flow for HCP to fund accretive investments. 
 Please take a few minutes to visit our website and view our new GRI sustainability report, which was published yesterday. The report is comprehensive in nature and reflects the incredible hard work of HCP colleagues across our organization. Well done by all. 
 Lastly, I want to congratulate Milton Johnson on his elevation of last night to CEO of HCA. Milton is a long-time  friend and partner of HCP. We remember Milton fondly as the point person on our 2003 acquisition of HCA's Medical Office Building portfolio. Well-deserved  and well done, Milton. 
 That concludes our formal remarks. We are delighted to take your questions at this time. Darla? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. 
Nicholas Yulico: Just had a question -- a couple of questions. One, Jay, I mean, you talked about senior housing, whether it's the Brookdale, RIDEA or the Blackstone,  Emeritus assets seemingly performing a little better than your expectations. I mean, how is that affecting your thinking on -- are you looking at more senior housing these days, whether it's in development financing or RIDEA or triple-net, I mean, because of the performance you've achieved so far? 
James Flaherty: No, I don't think the -- what we're looking at is a function of our outperformance that we're realizing. I think we're going to -- given our 5x5 platform, we're going to see opportunities across all of our 5 property types, including senior housing, and then up and down our 5 property types, be it development, mezz  debt investing, joint venture opportunities or just fee simple real estate. So I don't think that's the cause. I do think our results make us -- our results and the different ways in which we play the space, be it development, joint venture, mezz debt or fee simple ownership, make us a better informed and hopefully a wiser acquirer of properties in terms of both the economics and the structures we employ. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then turning to the Barchester investment, your expectation is that you're going to be paid off at par in September. Is there -- is the expectation there that it's going to be a cash payoff? Or is there a possibility that you could get, say, an equity investment -- I mean, I know that's structured as an OpCo/PropCo. So is there a chance perhaps you could get an equity investment in some fashion there? 
James Flaherty: Our expectation is  it will be a par payoff for cash on or before September 30, Nick. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then just lastly on the life science lease that you did recently, does that -- can you talk a little bit about how the NOI impact there?  I mean, are you going to be -- your same-store  was hit by losing NOI from the expiration this year, and then you're releasing it, that starts next year. I mean, is that kind of a neutral NOI impact? 
Timothy Schoen: Actually, Nick, that lease will kick in in 2014, so it will be a positive for 2014. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. But is it -- I mean, was it really similar to the previous rents? 
Timothy Schoen: No, it was leased at the high $2, and, again, I'm a West Coast guy, but $2 and -- a high $2 range on a monthly related basis. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: I just want to talk a little bit about senior housing and supply. We've seen some supply increases coming through the NIC data, especially in the freestanding memory care segment, where you obviously have a significant concentration of your properties, I think  around 7,000 units or a little bit more from HCR ManorCare. Has HCR ManorCare adjusted its projections for this sector at all? And is this something you're concerned about impacting your lease coverage going forward? 
James Flaherty: No, not at all, Jeff. That's no blubber, either. We'll leave it to others to slice, dice and analyze the NIC data after the fact. Our job is to anticipate the trends and make strategic decisions to take advantage before they become reality. So as my comments reflect, we've been very active on the development front for the last 3 years in senior housing. And up until this morning, you can see we've been somewhat guarded on the program's success. But, I mean, these are attractive returns we're being able to realize, attractive spreads to the current acquisition cap rates.  I think they make us a better buyer in terms of -- better buyer of senior housing properties in terms of understanding replacement costs. But at the end of the day, Jeff, big picture is that our income streams in senior housing, because of the outsized rent escalators and because of the triple-net structures, they provide a fair amount of insulation from competition of new supply relative to where we took -- owned our current portfolio in more of a RIDEA structure. So, again, we were fortunate to see this trend. We've profited from it, for our shareholders, in terms of the development initiatives we have. We're very comfortable with our existing portfolio's insulation from that. And hopefully, we'll continue to be able to take advantage of the ever-growing demand for senior housing product in the coming period. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. Yes, great. Yes, I appreciate the triple-net leases shield you, to some extent, from fluctuations. Along those lines, with the HCR ManorCare, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about these coverages and the adjustments correctly. First off, they haven't taken any additional charges for reserves in '13. Is that something that generally comes about in the fourth quarter if it is to happen? Or do they look at it quarter-by-quarter? 
James Flaherty: No, the protocol for the industry is that, that's reviewed by external third-party experts twice a year. So... 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. So not in the first half of the year, so potentially in the fourth quarter, if at all. And so assuming there's no adjustment then, I guess the right way to think about it is kind of flattish to slightly up coverages through 4Q '13 and then about 0.2 turns increase in coverage as that charge burns off. Is that the right way? 
James Flaherty: Yes. If you just want to isolate the impact of the charge, absolutely. I think you're going to have some other things happening quite, quite favorably. But if you just want to zero in on the impact of the reserve rolling off, that's true. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. 
Jack Meehan: I appreciate the color on the deal pipeline. When you talk about moving forward on new terms, is that more related to the cap rates resetting with the new financing environment? And have any of those opportunities gone away for the time being? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think when I talk about economics, I would -- it's a whole host of things, some of which is cap rates, some of which is the amount of capital that's needed to invest in the properties, some of which would be the -- if it's a triple-net structure, the magnitude of the escalators. So it's a whole host of issues that get factored in. But -- so I think that's the -- how to respond to your question on the economics. I think with respect to where the deals are, I mean, they're still there. I think -- yes, I think sellers are going to adjust their expectations, not with the frequency that the capital market adjusts. So we've seen -- as an example since May 22, we've seen -- we've kind of cuffed the increase in our cost of capital at about 110 basis points. And we have a first-class junior professional who runs that algorithm, that model for us. And I think -- I don't think he's ever run it as frequently as he have in the last 2 months. But the reality is,  while our cost of capital has adjusted very quickly, sellers' expectations don't adjust that quickly. So I suspect, like I said, I think the pause button has been hit. And I suspect you'll see a good portion, if not all, of those transactions come back, albeit on revised terms. 
Jack Meehan: Okay. Got you. And then just moving to hospital portfolio. I know it's really small, but the LTACHs in your portfolio, the coverage dipped 0.67. What's the remediation plan for those assets? Would you consider them selling back to the operator if they want to acquire them? 
James Flaherty: Well, everything's on the table with all of our assets. Tim is fond of saying we love our assets, but we're not in love with our assets. So yes, we're not big fans of the LTACH space. I think we've gotten just 3 of them. Those 3 are all with kindred master leased with coverages that are substantially above 10.  So the near-term mitigation is -- there is no near-term mitigation required.  At some point, we'll look at opportunities. I think the expiration of that particular master lease is still a couple of years out. But, yes, I think the takeaway there is that we're not a big fan of LTACHs. Particularly, when we see what's going on with our HCR portfolio, where you've got a lower-cost setting, it's kind of clear what's going to happen here, Jack. As a private sector, most notably, managed care, becomes more influential in driving where these outcomes go, they'll be driven away from the higher-cost inpatient rehab and LTACH settings to the lower-cost post-acute setting. So that's just a natural progression in terms of our viewpoint on where all this is going to end up. 
Jack Meehan: Got you. And is some of that related to things around patient criteria and then new rates that we would expect? I'm guessing a final rule sometime soon. Or when do you expect some of that to play out? 
James Flaherty: Well, it's playing out right now. Yes, this isn't a function of this week's CMS reimbursement outcome. This is playing out in the marketplace. The big picture is you've got declining government reimbursement. Guess what, country can't afford 21% of their GDP going in health care. And the platforms that will be advantaged here in the coming couple of years is the time frame this is going to be play out, Jack, in our low-cost, high-quality settings that got concentrated to high-market share platforms. And you've heard me analogize what's going to play out in the health care space to what played out in the aerospace/defense industry in the last part of the decade of the '80s. And if you want to watch that movie, just pull up a chair, sit down and grab some popcorn. It's happening literally this week in the hospital space. You've seen Tenet and Vanguard come together. You see Community Health and HMA. It's just going to continue to play out this way across all these sectors. You're going to have these huge, enormous operating platforms get created. Volumes are going to go up. Revenues are going to go up quite a bit, albeit at lower margins. And that's how this is going to play out over the next couple of years. And at the end of the day, in post-acute, if you've got the lowest-cost setting and the highest-quality outcomes, that's why these relationships that HCR has cut with the UnitedHealths  of the world, where they're partnered on these CMS test cases, are just so important, if you can just see it kind of play out during  the next couple of years. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. 
Emmanuel Korchman: Jay, maybe we can stick to the comment you just made on Vanguard and Community Health. Have you guys looked at ways of participating in those deals? I mean, there were a couple of REITs that were announced by proxy that we're looking at, at the Vanguard transaction. Maybe any kind of thoughts you can share on those for us? 
James Flaherty: Well, Manny,  we look at everything. I mean, that's our business. The deals that we ultimately close on in order to get through the filter of what we're looking at to what we have closed on is very, very small, certainly less than 10% of what we look at. In the hospital space, we've obviously and kind of uniquely -- I want to make sure we're talking about acute care hospitals, not rehab hospitals or LTACHs. But the acute care hospital, that's what created this company back in 1985 when Ken Roath took it public. We were seated from National Medical Enterprises with a couple of acute care hospitals, and then we acquired a few more as we bought out AMI's REIT at the end of 1990. So we understand the space. We've got 2 absolute jewels in our portfolio. I think a lot of you have seen Medical City Dallas, and I think some of you have seen our Hoag Hospital. I would say that for good hospitals located in growing urban areas with good market share, ultimately, the best buyer for those are going to be strategic buyers, particularly with what's going on with the Affordable Care Act, where you're going to benefit highly concentrated market share. So that's -- I think it's going to be difficult for any PropCo buyer structure to be competitive with what a strategic buyer would pay. But notwithstanding that, every now and then, opportunities pop up. I think Medical City Dallas is a good example, where you had a different dynamic, you had a low tax basis driving the seller's motivations there and we were able to add to our portfolio, quite frankly, the premier acute care hospital in the HCA empire. So we stay current, we look at everything, but at the end of the day, what comes through the filter in terms of what we put at the portfolio is a very, very small fraction of that. 
Emmanuel Korchman: Great. And then, Tim, correct me if I'm wrong, the straight-line rent adjustment that you guys announced, the charge you took in 2Q, that looks like it was related to HCA's Medical City Dallas. Can you give us more details as to what the charge is actually related to? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. Yes, man, you're right, that's related to that hospital. It's a long-term lease with multi-tranches, but it related an over-accrual to straight-line rent. And it's a onetime charge that represented the accumulative adjustment. There's multiple tranches underneath that lease. And there was 1 tranche -- the lease runs through 2025. And there's 1 tranche that has a roll-down  many years in the future, and that hadn't been accounted for. 
Emmanuel Korchman: So nothing about an actual change to any leases. That was just something that was [indiscernible]. 
Timothy Schoen: No, no, no. No change to cash. 
Emmanuel Korchman: Perfect. And then if we jump back to Jay for one second. I guess we're beating the sort of the opportunity set down a little bit here. But if we look at the magnitude of deals or the volume of deals that didn't happen or that got delayed, could you provide some color as to how many deals we're talking about or how much product? 
James Flaherty: No, we don't -- we typically don't comment, Manny, on -- we'll tell you everything and then some about the deals we close, but the current state of the pipeline or the deals we're chasing or the deals that we passed on, we traditionally don't give any -- provide any color on this. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: Jay, you mentioned earlier in your comments that you're providing 80%  of the development costs in your loan commitment program and able to capture up to 30% of the value creation. I'm just -- can you explain how that mechanically happens? 
James Flaherty: Yes. Let me have Paul take that, Paul Gallagher. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes. We actually have a participation in the loan. And either through a capital event, whether it's a sale or a refinance, then we would participate in 30% of the excess over the cost. We also had a purchase option where we have the ability to buy the asset and actually keep it for long-term growth. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. Great. Regarding the Barchester loan, that is a quick turnaround, the recent purchase and you're expecting a par payoff in September. Can you talk about how you were able to source that and why you get this nice bump and why other people didn't see it? Was it a relationship of some sort? 
James Flaherty: Yes.  At the end of the day, everything starts and ends with our 5x5 model. So obviously, we had gotten quite current and quite smart on the U.K. caregiving market a year or so ago following the Four Seasons deal. And Paul and I spent a reasonable amount of time over there in the last 6, 9 months, and we had an opportunity to partner with one of our other very close relationships that we've just structured a separate transaction with. And we created a partnership here, and that's going to work out quite well. 
Richard Anderson: So you're not inclined to give guidance, but, I mean, is the U.K. -- you see the same type of kind of pipeline of activity in your loan program in the U.K. in relative terms relative to its size that you are here in the States? 
James Flaherty: I think the magnitude of the opportunities over in the U.K., I don't know if you're comparing that to our senior housing development program, I would tell you that the senior housing development program is more of a kind of a flow business. We've got 7 communities in there, then separately, we've got the Hyde Park community that we're going to ring the cash register on later this year. That's more of a flow of properties coming in. We've got a very good development partner there. The U.K. opportunities are much more lumpy. If you think back in terms of what's happened here from our sector-leading  debt platform, you've got to be thinking more of a Genesis, HCA, HCR sort of dynamic. So  that looks different, but at the end of the day, the skill sets and the ability to execute in a timely fashion are the same. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. My last question is, does the loan program actually get incrementally more attractive in an environment like this where there's chatter about rising interest rates and all the rest? Are you seeing more opportunity or is that just coincidental? 
James Flaherty: Are you talking about the senior housing loan program, Rich? 
Richard Anderson: I'm talking about any kind of loan investments that you're able to make. 
James Flaherty: Well, again, it's tough to generalize. So for example, in a senior housing loan program, I'll tell you that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate the economics in today's market that we were able to achieve when we launched the senior housing development program 2 years ago. And that's a function of there are more banks getting more comfortable, for whatever reason, to being a provider of construction loans. So that's -- I don't really  think that has anything to do with rising interest rates. I think rising interest rates are probably going to manifest itself more from a standpoint of the private equity sector, maybe looking with some increased urgency to either exit or recapitalize existing positions now, given the move in rates and the speculation that continued tapering will march those rates higher. So kind of 2 different dynamics, Rich. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Carroll: Maybe a little bit off of Rich's question. Can you break out maybe the investment opportunities you're seeing on the property side versus the debt side? Are you seeing more debt deals and, hence, the reason of the several recent investment -- debt investments you were able to complete? Or is this just timing? 
James Flaherty: I think it's probably just timing, Mike. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then how are you approaching, I guess, the international markets differently than domestic markets? 
James Flaherty: We approach all the market the same, Mike. We have a 5x5 model, and we look at everything that's out there. And we figure out on a risk-adjusted basis where the cream is. And we like to skim the cream and go forward from there. We've obviously developed -- particularly the U.K. market -- a fair amount of institutional knowledge on that space and institutional relationships and things like that. But everything goes through the same filter within the same 5x5 strategic model. 
Michael Carroll: Are you also looking at, I guess, property investments instead of debt investments in U.K., too? 
James Flaherty: Again, that's one of the cornerstones of our 5x5 model. As you know, it's the preponderance of our 5x5 model from a product standpoint. We've got -- I think well over 95% of the entire investment portfolio is in fee simple real estate. So that's absolutely our default option. Every now and then, some opportunities present themselves that not only are very good risk-adjusted return opportunities for our shareholders but, importantly, provide some optionality to transition a debt investment to real estate. We like those and we're real high on  those sorts of opportunities. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then last one for me. Is there other any international markets outside -- out of the U.K. that you're looking at now? 
James Flaherty: The world is our oyster, Mike. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. 
Juan Sanabria: Just a quick question. You mentioned that you run a model and have been updating it regularly with regards to your cost of capital. If you were able to sort of dictate terms given what you know today with regards to capital pricing, what would you think cap rates should have adjusted from earlier this year? Or where should they eventually settle out? Is it 25, 50 basis points higher? What are your thoughts? 
James Flaherty: Yes. We'd probably be -- I think it's going to be a function of which of the 5 property types you're talking about. But I think in terms of where we would be comfortable, the high end of the range you just cuffed would be the low end of the range that we just start to get interested in. So it'd have to be at least that sort of adjustment. 
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And just with regards to asset acquisitions, how should we think of low-hanging fruit barring you guys getting  together and agreeing on cap rates or asset values? What kind of low-hanging fruit -- are there any other opportunities with Blackstone as an example that you could act on over time or that we should expect you to be able to transact on? 
James Flaherty: Again,  stay tuned. As I mentioned earlier, a very small portion of the opportunities that reside in our company at any given point in time end up being moved into the end zone in terms of points on the board, but we're extremely active across each of our 5 property types and up and down that 5x5 model right now, extremely active. 
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And just lastly on your development, should we expect the developments that you guys do to hold for the long term that you're kind of disclosing your supplemental package. Should we expect that to be growing? It didn't seem like it necessarily picked up significantly from the last quarter, but is that something that we should expect to grow over time? 
James Flaherty: Now are you talking about... 
Juan Sanabria: Given the acquisitions are tougher [indiscernible]? 
James Flaherty: Are you talking about the senior housing? Or are you talking just generally development or redevelopment? 
Juan Sanabria: Just generally. 
James Flaherty: I would say that I think redevelopment, we've done a fair amount of that, almost all of which has been in our life science and Medical Office Buildings sectors. I think you're going to continue to see us redevelop our portfolio. We like our portfolio. There's no obvious candidates aside from the handful of properties that are subject to purchase options that we anticipate exiting our portfolio. So maintaining and upgrading the properties that are in our portfolio, with an eye towards increasing the income stream from those, that's a very high priority. It's -- quite frankly, with the asset management skill sets we have that exist for -- independently for each of our 5 property types, that, quite frankly, is what those professionals spend the preponderance of their time on. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel. 
Robert Mains: Tim, I have a follow-up,  the straight-line rent question. What should be the benefit in this quarter from a FAD perspective? What's the right run rate to be using after -- starting in the third quarter? 
Timothy Schoen: Well, that adjustment didn't affect FAD, Rob, but the $0.62, $0.63 is a pretty good run rate for the quarter. That was unaffected by any onetime items. 
Robert Mains: Right. But the straight-line rent item was the component of FAD. With a positive number, normally, that would be negative and that's because [indiscernible]. 
Timothy Schoen: Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. I got you. For the overall company, a good run rate for the quarter is about $11 million a quarter, Rob. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then kind of in a similar vein, I'm assuming from what you said previously that CapEx and TIs are going to be kind of backloaded this year? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, there's some seasonality in those numbers, but they will be backloaded. 
Robert Mains: Okay. So the full year number that you've talked about in the past is still valid? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, around $60 million. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then G&A has kind of bounced around the last few quarters. What's kind of, again, a reasonable run rate there? 
Timothy Schoen: Just under $22 million a quarter. 
Robert Mains: Okay. Any reason it was up in the second quarter? 
Timothy Schoen: Transaction costs in the quarter. 
Robert Mains: Got it. And Jay, you touched on what's going on in the hospital sector. Is this something where you think there's an opportunity?  Because it seems to be that the publics are buying one another, while the not-for-profits are kind of doing joint ventures or other kind of noncapital-intensive transactions. Is there an opportunity for REITs to participate in the hospital consolidation that you see? 
James Flaherty: Well, sure. I mean, yes, those are -- absolutely, it's right there. At the end of the day, I can only speak for our model. Things still need to clear the bar, whether it's price relative to replacement costs, or FAD accretion, or nominal cap rates, or in the case where we're looking at a RIDEA structure, economic cap rates. But from a spread standpoint, you take an unlevered IRR and you compare that to a weighted average cost of capital in the hospital space, to be very specific with the question you asked, we're going to require a higher return there. Because of our 5 property types, the hospital sector is the least real estate-intensive,  most operating-intensive  of our 5 sectors. So at the end of the day, we'll look at those returns. And, again,  my comments on the earlier question about chances are strategics are going to conclude that they're better off owning the real estate, and they're going to be prepared to pay more than the health care REITs. I think there will be exceptions to that, but I think that's going to be more the norm, Rob. 
Robert Mains: Okay, that's helpful. And then I kind of lost track of what we're talking about 12 months ended June 30, 12 months ended 3/31. HCR ManorCare is that experience under sequestration? 
James Flaherty: They've done a great job managing their costs, so I think that's a push anybody counted on at the beginning of the year, some of the softness in the patient and the admission volumes you've seen in the sector. Notwithstanding that, they are continuing to generate a substantial amount of free cash flow after rent, after interest expense, after CapEx. So they're -- and more importantly than anything else, they're gaining market share. So this is -- they're positioned quite well for what's going to come down the road during  the next 12 to 18 months with an increased penetration of managed care, basically doing a lot of what the government hasn't been able to do, which is to direct patient outcomes to lower-cost, high-quality settings. 
Robert Mains: Right. Okay. Then last question is a balance sheet question. You talked about how leverage has been coming down. Does the change in interest rates change your thinking about leverage either in your proclivity to use it or whether you prefer short or long term or anything like that? 
James Flaherty: No. Again, we underwrite everything with a 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity long-term capital structure. Importantly, for the people on this call, for the 40 parts  that is debt, we put 0 component floating rate debt in there. It's all 10-year unsecured at our current levels, which is a function obviously of where the 10-year treasury is and our indicated spread to that 10-year treasury. So we look at everything that way. And the rating agencies understand that, and they're very comfortable with that. Away from that, we've got balance sheet maturities that have been laddered out quite well by Tim and Matt. And as they come up, we look at that. I think in particular, right now, we're also mindful of the fact that we're likely to have some capital coming back to us with respect to the Barchester payoff that we expect will happen in 2 months and then with the purchase options on Tenet hospitals. So all that goes into the thought process, but we wouldn't be changing our proclivity to either employ higher leverage or the frequency with which we visit the capital markets because of what's happened in the interest rate complex. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. 
Todd Stender: Just to stay on that theme, Tim, what kind of impact has the uptick and interest rates had on your budgeting and planning when you're looking at meeting your 2013 debt maturities? 
Timothy Schoen: Well, we don't really have very much moving around on the balance sheet, Todd, but for what we do, the remaining maturities this year have a coupon of -- in place coupon of 5.9%. And we could do much, much better than that in the unsecured markets on a 10-year deal. 
Todd Stender: Okay. And  just back to the Barchester deal. Is there any chance that September comes and goes? Is there an extension option on the ability to pay that off? 
James Flaherty: Well, that would have to be negotiated with the creditor group. Again, I think based on what we know, I think that's highly unlikely. I think the high probability outcome there is a part payoff for the entire PropCo debt stack. 
Todd Stender: Okay. And that's expected to add $0.03 of accretion, but your guidance went up by $0.02. I may have missed what's the discrepancy there. I know it's $0.01, but is that related to any offset? 
James Flaherty: Well, again, we're looking at -- we're primarily focused on FAD. Our FAD, as Tim made mention in his comments, our FAD guidance for this year, we just increased by $0.05, Todd. 
Todd Stender: Okay. And how about your return expectations when you look at the mezz loan to Tandem Health  that was consummated in 2012? If you were to make that same loan today, what do you think your return requirement would be on something like that? 
James Flaherty: Yes. A blended -- at a blended, we've got 2 tranches there, not 3, 2 tranches. And at a blended average yield there of kind of low 13s, given the cash flow coverage and the quality of that real estate, we think that approximates market today. 
Todd Stender: The risk profile hasn't increased that meaningfully in the last 2.5 months. 
James Flaherty: No. I mean, they've done a good job, and as I mentioned, the debt service coverage there is just over 1.8x. So we feel very, very good about that investment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Jay, just kind of going back to HCR ManorCare, I kind of understand everything you're saying about their competitive position and given all the changes going on, on the health care side. But, again, we still have coverages that still seem to be going down quarter-over-quarter. I mean, with what you're expecting out of the company, when do you think we start to really see  coverages turn around? 
James Flaherty: Oh, I think you'll see that start to happen second half of this year. You've got the admissions situation with acute care hospitals, I think that is what that is. I think you and others on this call have written extensively about the impact on the acute care hospital. With the effective implementation of the Affordable Care Act, hospital volumes are going to spike just because you've got more individuals that are going to be covered by insurance. And so that's a real important fact. Now given HCR's model, that's going to, just as night follows day, drive significantly higher volumes for HCR. The quid pro quo is those volumes will be at lower margins. But, I mean, that's a significant business fundamental that's out there just waiting to come into fruition once the Affordable Care Act is up and running. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second thing that you mentioned in regards to capital kind of coming back to you towards the end of the year with Barchester, for example, that kind of combined with this idea of the pregnant pause and acquisitions that you were talking about earlier, I mean, how should we -- given the combination of those 2 factors, how should we really be thinking about acquisition volumes back half of 2013, first half of 2014 type of a time frame? 
James Flaherty: Stay tuned, Tayo. Again, we have a fundamental tradition of not telegraphing our -- either the amount or the timing of our acquisition activity. So when we're talking about either quarter-over-quarter 15% increase in FAD per share or year-over-year for this year 12% FAD increase, that's all organic, plus last year's activity. So anything we do most effectively is going to be the additive to those results. 
Omotayo Okusanya: That's helpful. And just last question for me. I mean, with what we're seeing on the hospital space, with all of the consolidation going on, would you expect a similar scenario to start to happen in other areas of health care services? 
James Flaherty: Oh, absolutely. It's just going to be a  tidal wave over the next couple of years, an absolute tidal wave. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: Mine were answered. I'm good. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. 
Ross Nussbaum: It's Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. I had a follow-up on this straight-line rent charge you took in the quarter. It sounds like that there was just simply an oversight on how the lease was accounted for historically. Is that how we should  be thinking about this? 
James Flaherty: That's correct. 
Ross Nussbaum: How did it -- I assume this lease has been in place for quite some time. How did it arise to your attention now? 
James Flaherty: Well, there's multi-tranches underneath that lease, Ross. And one of the lease components in future years rolls down, and it's  really the burn-off  of a TI loan. That's the way to think about it. That's the best way  to think about it, burn-off  of a capital improvement loan. 
Ross Nussbaum: Are you going to have to declare a material weakness on the natural reporting front for this? 
James Flaherty: No, no, no. [indiscernible] for any 1 period, under $2 million in any way. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay. Jay, I understand that there's going to be some form of a hatchet job tonight on the assisted living sector on a public television network. I'm just curious what you know of it. And do you have any thoughts around it? 
James Flaherty: Well, we obviously know quite a bit. I think for a second -- third most important issue is that our sympathies are with the families whose loved ones was involved with the incident. But away from that, we've got a concentrated number of relationships with a handful of senior housing operators. And we think very highly of the quality of the care and the clinical protocols that those companies provide. And so away from that, probably most appropriate to direct your questions to those entities involved. So that's how I'd  respond to that, Ross. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. 
Michael Bilerman: Yes, it's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Jay, just on the Barchester loan, was the issuer presented the opportunity to buy back loan at a discount at all? 
James Flaherty: Was the issuer provided... 
Michael Bilerman: Or the borrower in that case? 
James Flaherty: No, no. I mean, it was a CMBS structure that was put in place, Michael, back,  it was '07. So they had the deal they were signed up for. We are looking at September 30, a hard, hard maturity. 
Michael Bilerman: Right. I just didn't know if they had the opportunity to buy back now for the price you did versus the confidence you have that they'll pay par for it in September 30. They could have obviously earned -- I'm very glad that you're earning almost $20 million in profit, but I was just trying to put those 2 together, if they had the opportunity to buy it versus paying par in September 30, why they wouldn't have done that. 
James Flaherty: That's probably something that you ought to address just to them. From our standpoint, ourselves, our  joint venture partner felt -- did feel and continue to feel quite good about the underlying collateral and the likelihood of the September 30 result that we anticipate. 
Michael Bilerman: You don't view this as going into a potential transaction where you get hold of real estate or participate in some larger -- you view this really as just an investment pure payoff and you move on. 
James Flaherty: At this point, yes. I mean, obviously, when we make these investments -- at the time we made the investment, anytime we make an investment like this, we're constantly looking at the potential or the optionality to have that end up with a fee simple ownership in the underlying real estate. And that was  absolutely important element of what we saw here. But we just couldn't make the numbers work to get to that result. And so we're going -- we've got the bird in the hand, and then we'll move on to the next opportunity. 
Michael Bilerman: Great. And then just lastly, just a little bit more on the deal environment. You dial back to late April when we have the call, and you talked a lot about how comprehensive the deals that you were looking at, not only by property type but also by size, the different types of sellers that were out there being very varied, talked about your 5x5 model and said, "Look, it's 80%-plus in terms of being able to fill up that chart in terms of where we're seeing opportunities and where we're evaluating things." And from your other comments, it now sounds like everything has sort of been on pause. I'm just wondering maybe you can sort of drill down a little bit about which sort of opportunities and which sort of deals do you think are the first to come back and which ones -- or which sectors may be still be percolating versus just being a complete halt on what was a very, very  large deal environment for you. 
James Flaherty: Yes. I don't think anything's on a complete halt, but maybe you can help me answer the question. What's  your -- you mentioned something about 80%. I didn't quite understand... 
Michael Bilerman: You said last time, so you -- going back to the first quarter call, you said 5x5, you have 25 boxes, your quote was  80% of the page would be lit up with opportunities. 
James Flaherty: Yes. That hasn't changed at all. But when you have a weighted average, at least I can only  speak to our business model, but when you have 110-basis-point  change in about the 3 or 4 weeks time in your cost of capital and you're looking at an array of investments, which we look at in a number of different metrics, replacement costs, FAD accretion, cap rate, but one of the important ones we look at is spread relative to our weighted average cost of capital, so if the weighted average cost of capital spikes by 110 basis points, that's going to certainly give us pause to look at what the revised and more realistic economics are on some of these things. But the deals themselves, the proclivity for the sellers involved to move forward, that hasn't changed at all. So I suspect, as I mentioned in response to one of my earlier questions, the markets move more quickly than do seller's expectations. And I suspect this will sort itself out. And I think you'll see in the second half of the year, you'll start to see some acceleration, but it's obviously been a shock to the system. 
Michael Bilerman: Is there anything that you are sort of looking at that's sort of gone to others or that you think is completely gone away? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think certainly, the Barchester opportunity, that was something that, all other things being equal, you might very well like to move forward on in terms of the underlying real estate. So I think -- now I think you're going to see that situation result in a par payoff. So that will be one example of where something is likely not to come back, but I think that will be more in the minority of the opportunities that we have in the pipeline right now. 
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel. 
Robert Mains: Jay, in the past, you've done some joint ventures with institutions. Obviously, the HCR ManorCare deal was a private equity. Have you seen increased interest by either joint venture or either institutions or private equity in the space, either just because it's more intriguing or because of what might have happened in the capital markets? 
James Flaherty: No. You mean specifically with the catalyst being kind of Bernanke's comments on May 22 or something else? 
Robert Mains: Either that or just the consolidation opportunity that you've been talking about, just whether you're seeing more activity on the part of institutions or private equity. 
James Flaherty: A little bit. I think even post-May 22, I think a lot of the distressed debt play has kind of gone away. There's more capital out there, the underlying portfolios are improving. So the distressed seller of debt, I think that's either they're going to hold on or they'll wait until maturity and take a  par payoff. So I think that opportunity is not what it was a couple of years ago. Notwithstanding that, I mean, then you see you have a situation like we had 2 in the quarter that present themselves, but those are more needle in the haystack opportunities today. Away from that, I think whether it's in hospital land or post-acute land or senior housing land, you're going to continue to see consolidation activity. You've got a very fragmented industry that's quite large and the ability to realize cost synergies and increase market share in concentrated geographic areas. That's not going.  If anything, that's going to accelerate. So I think you'll continue to see a lot of activity. And then that presents -- as a collateral benefit with the health care REITs, that creates an opportunity for us and our colleagues. And oftentimes, it's even more attractive than that because we've got -- with existing relationships and investments, we have somewhat of a seat at the table on those sort of situations. So I don't think there's been  any change at all in the fundamental driver for the external growth aspects of the space. 
Operator: At this time, I'd  like to turn the call back over to Jay Flaherty, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. 
James Flaherty: Okay, everyone. Enjoy the rest of your summer, get a break and we'll see everybody in the fall. Take care. 
Operator: This concludes the Second Quarter 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-04-30 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darla, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Darla. Good afternoon, and good morning.

We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, as well as certain related disclosures, in our supplemental information package and earnings release, each of which has been furnished to the SEC today and is available on our website at www.hcpi.com.
 I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thank you, John. Welcome to HCP's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen. We will start off with a review of the results we released earlier this morning. And for that, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. Let me start with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported FFO of $0.74 per share and FAD of $0.62 per share, representing year-over-year increases of 10% and 15%, respectively, driven by accretive acquisitions completed in the second half of last year. Results this quarter also included a onetime gain of $0.02 per share from the sale of marketable securities. 
 Our same property performance generated 1.1% cash NOI growth compared to the first quarter last year. The growth was negatively impacted by a few onetime items that included: cash income of $5 million recognized in the first quarter of 2012, consisting of a $4 million rent payment from Google and a $1 million working capital recovery from transition properties in the senior housing segment; in addition, a $1 million negative impact incurred in the current quarter that resulted from a revenue adjustment in the MOB segment and business interruptions due to Superstorm Sandy at a senior housing community.  Combined, these nonrecurring items reduced our first quarter same-store growth from 2.9% to 1.1%. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes. 
 During the quarter, we made investments of $96 million, consisting of $38 million for the 4 remaining senior housing properties that completed our acquisition of the Blackstone JV portfolio and $58 million for development in other capital projects. 
 Turning now to our balance sheet. The significant positive momentum in our credit profile, which led to 2 upgrades by the rating agencies in the fourth quarter of 2012, continues into 2013. Our balance sheet improved during the first quarter as measured by the following credit metrics: financial leverage of 39.6%; fixed charge coverage at 3.9x; net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.8x; and secured debt ratio remains low at 8.3% and will improve to 6.9% based on our current plan to refinance $280 million of mortgage debt maturing later this year. 
 During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of 5 5/8% senior unsecured notes with existing cash, which included a portion of the proceeds from our 2 5/8% unsecured notes issued in November last year. Our remaining 2013 debt maturities, all in the second half of the year, totaled $685 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. And we have $1.5 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver. 
 Updates to our 2013 guidance. Our existing portfolio continues to perform in line with our business plan with projected full year cash same property performance growth between 2.5% and 3.5%, and we continue to expect growth to accelerate as we move through the year. We are raising our 2013 FFO guidance by $0.02 per share to range between $2.94 and $3 per share. This increase is driven by achieving $0.01 higher gains than our previous forecast from the sale of marketable securities and an additional $0.01 from several other items. We are raising our 2013 FAD guidance by $0.02 per share to a range of $2.41 and $2.47 per share. 
 Lastly, a few words on our triple-net leased portfolio. As you know, we have often emphasized the combination of safety and growth in the recurring cash flows generated from our properties. Today, $17.4 billion or 85% of our owned portfolio across 5 property types are anchored by long-term triple-net leases, providing contractual escalating rents. An important safety aspect of triple-net leases comes from HCP's practice of grouping properties into large master lease pools. To provide additional transparency regarding our individual master leases, we have expanded our supplemental package on Page 8 to profile several key credit attributes in a heat map format that shows for each lease the contribution to HCP's annualized revenues, EBITDAR coverage and remaining term. I'd like to point out that $13.2 billion of real estate operated by our senior housing, post-acute and hospital tenants is triple-net leased with a 12-year average remaining term. Of this amount, $12.4 billion is pooled in master leases and $10.4 billion is further supported by corporate guarantees. This heat map conveys the long-term contractual nature of our cash flows with creditworthy counterparties on the majority of our portfolio. In addition, these master leases produce attractive risk-adjusted predictable growth year after year via annual rent increases averaging in the 3% to 3.5% range. Combined, this translates into a core portfolio with low volatility that is expected to produce annual FAD growth per share of 5% to 6% organically. Adding accretive acquisitions will further elevate this trajectory, as is the case this year with our projected year-over-year FAD per share growth to be 10% at the midpoint of our guidance. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Before I review HCP's first quarter portfolio performance, I want to reiterate how our triple-net occupancy, triple-net cash flow coverage and overall portfolio same property performance metrics are calculated. 
 Occupancy represents the average occupancy for the quarter. Cash flow coverage is based on EBITDAR after allowing for management fees for the trailing 12 months. Both metrics are for our same property portfolio and our one quarter in arrears. Same property performance represents cash NOI for the quarter compared to the same quarter prior year for properties that were stabilized and remained in operation for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods. 
 Now to the portfolio performance. Senior housing. Occupancy for our senior housing platform was 86.6%, a 20 basis point sequential increase over the prior quarter and a 120 basis point increase over the prior year. Cash flow coverage for the portfolio was 1.11x, unchanged from the prior quarter. Same property performance increased 1.9%, driven by contractual rent steps, including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators, partially offset by a decline in working capital recoveries from transitioned assets. Net of the effect of working capital, same property cash NOI increased 2.8%. 
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage was 1.29x for the 12 months ending December 31, 2012. For the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2013, normalized fixed charge coverage was 1.28x. Normalized coverages exclude the impact of $95 million in reserves accrued in 2012 for prior period liability claims. Including these reserves, the first quarter trailing 12-month coverage would be 1.09x. 
 HCR's year-to-date 2013 revenues have been driven by higher reimbursement rates, improved patient mix and growth in census. HCR has now had 2 consecutive quarters where quarterly census was higher across all lines of business than the same period in the prior year. 
 Revenue growth was offset by an increase in operating expenses for the quarter, primarily driven by increased staffing levels early in the year due to a higher acuity patient mix. Operating expenses -- operating expense levels came back down to normal in March. 
 Overall, first quarter EBITDAR was stable with a trailing 12-month fixed charge coverage ratio decreasing 1 basis point from the prior quarter due to an additional quarter incorporating HCP's April 2012 rent bump. 
 Turning to our non-HCR portfolio. Cash flow coverage was 1.48x, a 3 basis point increase over the prior quarter, and same property performance increased 3.4% driven by normal rent steps. 
 Hospitals. Cash flow coverage increased 24 basis points to 5.26x, driven by strong fourth quarter performance at our HCA hospital at Medical City Dallas and our tenant hospitals. Same property performance increased 6.7%, driven by increased cash rents on our recently repositioned Plano facility. During the quarter, Tenet Healthcare exercised its option to acquire 3 of our hospitals. The purchase price will be at fair market value and will be effective February 2014. The Tenet facilities generate annual rents of approximately $23 million or 1% of HCP's annualized revenues with an EBITDAR cash flow coverage of 4.7x. 
 Medical Office Buildings. Same property performance was up 0.4%, driven by rent steps partially offset by the relocation of a major tenant in Las Vegas to their own building and a onetime revenue adjustment. Excluding this adjustment, the same property performance increased 2.1%. MOB occupancy as of March 31, 2013, decreased 100 basis points from the prior quarter to 91% due to the delay in commencement of 3 large leases totaling 47,000 square feet in Nashville, Dallas and Denver and the relocation of a Las Vegas tenant. Our retention for the quarter was 67.6%. During the quarter, tenants representing 340,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 291,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Renewals for the quarter occurred at 3.3% higher mark-to-market rents. We have 1.9 million square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, including 478,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We have executed 257,000 square feet of leases that have yet to commence and have an active leasing pipeline of 1.1 million square feet. 
 Life science. Occupancy for our life science portfolio as of March 31, 2013, increased 20 basis points from the prior quarter to 91.5%. Same property performance was down 5.6%, driven by the $4 million nonrecurring rent payment received in the first quarter of 2012 associated with Google's lease amendment and the mark-to-market rent reductions, offset by contractual rent increases and occupancy gains. Absent the onetime Google rent payment, same property performance for the quarter was up 1.2%. We added 70,000 square feet to the portfolio following the completion of a build-to-suit on our Mountain View campus, 100% leased to LinkedIn. Including the 70,000-square-foot LinkedIn lease, tenants representing 183,000 square feet took occupancy during the quarter. Renewals for the quarter occurred at 1.4% higher mark-to-market rents, and the average lease term for new and renewal leases was 6 years. 
 The life science portfolio has 332,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2013, representing just 0.4% of HCP's annualized revenues. The expirations include 77,000 square feet in Durham that will be redeveloped under a previously executed lease agreement with Duke University. The life science development pipeline consists of 3 redevelopment projects currently 69% pre-leased, totaling 166,000 square feet and a development project that is 100% pre-leased totaling 115,000 square feet. Total remaining funding requirements for the development pipeline are $41 million. 
 Sustainability. During the quarter, we received 9 ENERGY STAR labels, bringing the total to 102 across the MOB, life science and senior housing sectors. Our Oyster Point campus in South San Francisco was awarded BEST SITE designation by Best Workplaces for Commuters for offering outstanding commuter benefits. 
 With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jay. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Paul. HCP is off to a nice start in 2013. We achieved double-digit year-over-year percentage increases in both FFO per share and FAD per share. 
 Our portfolio performed in line with expectations and will ramp sequentially in 2013 as we move beyond the anniversary of several positive 2012 onetime events. 
 Our balance sheet continues to register A metrics with quarter-end leverage of 39.6%, fixed charge coverage ratio at 3.9x and net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.8x. 
 Momentum from HCP's ongoing commitment to sustainability, the feature of our new annual report, continues to build. We have made progress on monetizing the small nonstabilized portion of our real estate portfolio. 
 For our Four Seasons mezzanine debt position, trading levels have rallied 250 basis points from that investment's entry point of 9 months ago. And the level of dialogue surrounding potential acquisitions continues to be substantial. 
 Turning to our sectors. HCP's hospital coverage ratios improved to 5.26x, although each of the publicly traded hospital operators reported weak admission trends in their first quarter results. Last week's CMS-proposed reimbursement rates are positive relative to expectations for the hospital sector. 
 HCR's post-acute admissions were up in the quarter and results improved over the course of the quarter, resulting in quarter-end cash building to $158 million. This is noteworthy given the lower acute care hospital admission trends in the first quarter, coupled with the understanding that 90% of HCR's admissions come from hospital discharges. 
 In our office sector, mark-to-market occupancy trends for our life science and MOB portfolios remain solid, and we expect to approach new high-water occupancy levels of 92.5% by year end for each segment. 
 In senior housing, our triple-net coverage ratios remain stable despite outsized rent escalators. Our RIDEA joint venture with Brookdale has improved significantly with quarter-end spot occupancy at 88%, up 310 basis points from its low point a year ago. 
 And for our Blackstone JV acquisition, we closed on 4 remaining communities and one fee interest in the quarter. Granger Cobb and his Emeritus team have that portfolio's performance ahead of our underwriting with the stabilized component at 91.5% occupancy and the lease-up portfolio increasing 250 basis points in occupancy since closing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
 Finally, when you have a few minutes, please take a look at the new triple-net master lease disclosure on Page 8 of our supplemental package. I want to thank our accounting and asset management professionals who worked so well on this initiative. 
 With that, we are delighted to take your questions. Darla? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nic Yulico with Macquarie. 
Nicholas Yulico: Jay, I wanted to ask you about HCR ManorCare. I sense here that the investment community is very focused on the coverage metrics and the risk that the EBITDAR of their company cannot keep up with the rest --  escalators and there's, I think, also a thesis that Medicare dollars are going down to post-acute operators over time. But clearly, when you look at it, there's this other alternative world developing where CMS starts to reward or penalize post-acute operators based on quality of care whether it's via bundled payments or something else. HCR likely benefits in this environment given its very high-quality patient outcome. So my question is how are you and HCR ManorCare thinking on this issue? And is this the year where HCR begins taking some market share from other operators and thus coverage metrics improve based on that? 
James Flaherty: I think the answer is yes. In fact, you already saw that in the first quarter when you've got a business platform that has 90% of its admissions coming from discharges from acute care hospitals and discharges from acute care hospitals were reported to be uniformly down and weak across the sector yet you've got admissions and census and revenues up year-over-year, that's exactly what's starting to happen. So what you've got here is a business model that starts with a significant competitive advantage, that being that it's the low-cost setting in the post-acute space. Through an awful lot of hard work post the RUGs-IV modification back at the end of 2011, HCR has rightsized their cost structure. So now what we've got here -- and the challenge here is going to be revenues. And looking beyond just quarter-to-quarter, you're seeing some significant opportunities develop. We've obviously got those that'll come out of the Affordable Care Act. You've got the bundling, you mentioned the test pilot that HCR was the exclusive partner selected by UnitedHealth on the post-acute bundling project. You've got the potential -- there's been some discussion in Congress about moving to site neutral. So you've got a lot of things that are starting to be talked about and will, in fact, result in lower cost to the payer. And that's where you're going to see HCR disproportionately benefit given their business model. 
Nicholas Yulico: So on that note, you think it's fair to say that there's been a little bit of a benefit so far like you mentioned, but really we haven't really seen obviously the payment model fully change yet, so that a lot of this benefit could still be on the come here? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think you've seen just smatterings. Remember, the project -- the CMS-mandated project with UnitedHealth, I mean that in and of itself is being tested just in the 3 large markets that UnitedHealth and HCR overlap. So what's happening right now is you've got the beginning, as I've said on the prior call, the true elements of health care reform starting to be put in place in the marketplace. And you're going to see alliances, you're going to see risk-based sharing, you'll see these bundled payment programs, you'll see -- eventually you'll see site-neutral opportunities. And that's going to be the real -- the real play here for HCR is a revenue play over the next couple of years as these other programs -- as these new programs get put in place. But in the meantime, HCR, given their visibility in the space and given the test pilots that they're working with with their partners, they've already positioned their business model for that opportunity. So you'll see continued -- you'll see this revenue growth disproportionately drop into earnings over the next couple of years given the cost structure that's been put in place. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then just one last question from me separately on the gain on marketable securities. Did that relate to a sale of your investment in Brookdale Senior Living stock? And if so...
 [Technical Difficulty] 
James Flaherty: Nic, I think we lost you there for a second. 
Nicholas Yulico: Just on the gain on marketable securities, did that relate to a sale of your investment in Brookdale? If so, could you talk a little about your thought process on that? I know it was never a large position for you guys. 
James Flaherty: Yes. Early in the quarter, we sold our position in Brookdale, and that's what gave rise to the gain that Tim communicated. 
Nicholas Yulico: I mean, anything you can just -- I mean, I know it was never a large position; it was essentially Brookdale. You took the proceeds they put into the RIDEA transaction and reinvested that in Brookdale. You saw clearly an opportunity at the time to align with the operator. I mean, is there anything that you kind of learned through this whole process that was kind of interesting, or is it just that the stock ran up in the first quarter and you saw an opportunity to get out at a profit? 
James Flaherty: We think making money for our shareholders is among the most interesting things we do. So if you look at the types of investments that will fall into this bucket, nontraditional triple-net real estate sort of acquisitions, you've seen us in the Genesis debt, the HCA debt, you've seen us initially at our senior housing joint venture where we subsequently took out the institutional partner. And here again, when we go into these sorts of -- this basket of opportunities, we're looking for "heads we win, tails we win" sort of outcomes. So here, we were able to realize an attractive return for our shareholders. We're also able to make some additional progress on the monetization of the nonstabilized portion which is quite small, less than 5%, but every dollar counts. The nonstabilized portion of our investment portfolio that we are moving into stabilization, you'll see -- on that point, you'll see us -- I suspect you'll see us make further progress during the course of the year. In particular, I think it's likely that we'll be out of the entire legacy Delphis loan position by the end of the year. So we're -- again, we're making good progress on all these fronts. So that's what I would say about the exit on that sale, Nic. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Jana Galan: Looking at your new triple-net master lease profile chart, it looks like about 5.4% of annualized revenues are below onetime EBITDAR coverage. I was just wondering if you expect those to improve through the life of the lease or what your thinking is on those? 
James Flaherty: Well, again, we use this as a -- it's a very helpful asset management tool. We certainly look at the opportunities that are below 1.0 just like we look at opportunities that are above 3.0 or 4.0, for example. I know a lot of you will probably be pleased to hear that our hospital coverages are at 5.26x. At the other side of that argument is that the difference between 1.0 and 5.26x is a substantial amount of cash flow that's accruing to the benefit of the operating tenants. But in the situations that are below 1.0, I think what we've attempted to do there is show you that the remaining term is not insignificant. You've got corporate guarantees. But as a matter of doing our routine asset management discharge of our fiduciary responsibilities, we look and we talk with the operators that are involved there and we're constantly looking to see if we can improve the position of HCP shareholders. Don't you want to add something, Tim? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. In all those pools that are below 1, they are -- have a corporate guarantee. They have a long term associated with them. And the underlying properties in those pools are with occupancies in the 75% to 85% range, so there's upside in terms of occupancy in those pools over the longer run. 
Jana Galan: And I guess on the reverse of that, for those that are below -- above 3x, is there opportunity for kind of rent roll-ups and renewals there? 
James Flaherty: Yes, again, we're somewhat -- I think there's a lot on that page and obviously the opportunity to do that would be as you approach the lease renewal date, so -- but again, it's what we've tried to communicate here is that, a, that the triple-net portfolio as a percent of our total investment portfolio is massive as a percentage basis. I think Tim quoted that it's 85%. Number two, as you can see depicted here, now you're not seeing the triple-net portfolio here for either the life science or the Medical Office Building sectors. This is just the senior housing, post-acute and hospitals. And as you can see here, the coverages are good. The corporate guarantees are good. These are creditworthy tenants that are behind these corporate guarantees. And by and large, the remaining lease term is significant. So it's a nice package that really speaks to the safety side of the safety and growth business model that HCP enjoys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: A quick question about the, I guess, you call it a hot zone you have depicted there in red. Is this implicitly saying, for example, that if you've got a lease covering at 0.75x, you don't really talk about it with the operators until 2 years out, or how should I be thinking about what that red area represents? 
James Flaherty: We talk about all of our leases with all of our operators constantly. I think you should take the hot zone, lower left portion of that graph, to be an indicator of maybe a watch list sort of a moniker, if you will, where you've got -- if you've got a portfolio, fortunately we don't have any in or relatively speaking near that hot zone, if you've got a portfolio where you've got below 1.0 coverage with, say, a less than creditworthy counterparty and you're inside, say, 18, 24 months of lease term, you're going to have -- you're going to be having a different asset management protocol than you'd be having for a lot of the others on that page. 
Jeff Theiler: All right, okay. Just switching gears to HCR ManorCare quickly. So it seems like the coverage, excluding those reserves, is pretty stable from the year ending December 31 to the year ending March 31. We've got the sequestered cuts kicking in here. Where do you see that coverage trending for the rest of this year, I guess, before we get into the fiscal year '14 Medicare rates? I mean, with this 2% cut, where do you see that coverage trending? 
James Flaherty: If HCR makes their calendar 2013 budget, you'll see that coverage in the low 1.3s. 
Jeff Theiler: Low 1.3? And so what kind of Medicare rate increases, if any, do you feel like you need to really feel comfortable with that lease on a longer-term basis? 
James Flaherty: We feel very comfortable about this lease on a long-term basis right now. 
Jeff Theiler: So even at 0% Medicare rate increase, you see no risk over the next several years? 
James Flaherty: The play here, Jeff, will be HCR gaining share and bringing in incremental revenues because of what gets changed with CMS and quite frankly what gets changed in the marketplace with the large managed care payers and things like that. That'll drive the upside from this point. That'll drive the increased valuation in our OpCo investment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Carroll: Jay, can you kind of tell us what you're seeing in the investment markets? What kind of deals you're pursuing? Is it size? Is it a lot of large portfolio deals out there? And if there's any particular property type that you find more attractive? 
James Flaherty: Well, Michael, as you know, we don't really comment on prospective events. But I will say that we obviously have a business model that's arrayed across 5 property sectors: hospitals, post-acute, senior housing, medical office and life science and up and down prospective counterparties, capital structures with the fee simple ownership in real estate development, mezz debt, the opportunity to do joint ventures and RIDEA. And I'd tell you that as I'd mentioned on the last quarter, I think the thing that's different right now and that's continued as we've moved into the, I guess, we're 1/3 of the way through 2013, I think the thing that's different is the breadth of the opportunities. I mean, you can light up -- I'd say you could probably light up, if there's 25 boxes in that 5x5 business model, I think you'd probably light up about 80%, 80-plus percent of them in terms of where there's opportunities that are in discussion. And that is different than in years past where it might have been more limited to, say, 1/3 of the business model. So that's the thing that's different and obviously quite interesting. 
Michael Carroll: And the reason why the activity was light this quarter is because the deals were, I guess, pooled into 2012 for tax reasons? 
James Flaherty: No, I don't think so. I think it's just the opposite. I think they were pushed into -- I think -- my guess is you'll see a pretty active 2013 from this point on, by the way, from our standpoint, both on the acquisition side but also on capital market side. I think what happened was with all the election in November and then you had -- immediately after you got the election behind us, which was a somewhat more contentious election than normal elections, then you ran into the whole fiscal cliff stuff. And I just think you had kind of gridlock there for quite a while. And now people are starting to come out of it. It's not like it's off to the races time. But I think you're getting to the point where through price discovery and access to the capital markets, I think there's -- there's some -- you're starting to see some meaningful interaction between prospective counterparties as it relates to incremental transactions. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then my last question is were you able to extend one of your
 2014 senior housing expirations? 
James Flaherty: Were we able to extend? Not that I'm aware of. Is there something you want to ask... 
Michael Carroll: No, I was just comparing the lease expiration schedule and it looks like that 2014 there's a lease that moved out and I just wanted to see if you can give the details around that if that was the case, but maybe I'll follow up after the call. 
James Flaherty: Yes, why don't you -- -we'll do that side bar, that'll be fine. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. 
Ross Nussbaum: Jay, you characterized your acquisition, I guess, pursuit as having a substantial dialogue. And I'm curious just given the volumes that you reported in Q1, and your, I'll call it, the track record over the last couple of years on consummating some very large deals, would you characterize the dialogue as being more focused on those, what I'll call, big elephants versus sort of smaller one-off transactions? 
James Flaherty: No, I'd characterize it as being different from a standpoint that we've got multiple opportunities in both those buckets, if you will. That's the thing that's different. It's very comprehensive in terms of the property type, the product type, the size, the prospective sellers. It's much more varied and deep as opposed to a couple one-off situations. So that's really the thing that's different now than in years past. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay. And the second part of the question is clearly you're dealing with an equity currency that you've really never had before in terms of its cost. How do you avoid -- or maybe this is the question, how do you think about that cost of equity with respect to how you pursue acquisitions? Is it just about the accretion that you can generate to the earnings, or do you really look to the real estate value at the end of the day? How do you balance where your cost of equity is against using that cost of equity? 
James Flaherty: We always -- our business model is such that we always triangulate in on 3 or 4 key metrics. It starts with where you are on a price-per-pound basis versus replacement costs, Ross. So that's an important element. Accretion, and again we always talk about accretion to FAD because FAD is what gives source to an ever-rising dividend stream, which keeps us positioned as the only REIT in the world on the Dividend Aristocrat list. We're going to look at unlevered returns. And then we're going to look at spreads to our weighted average cost of capital. And importantly there, by the way, Ross, we look at, and this is something that we've kind of got written in stone or blood with the rating agencies, we look at all of our prospective investments on the basis of our targeted long-term capital structure, 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity. Now that 40 parts debt, we don't put any floating rate debt in there at all. That 40% debt is all 10-year unsecured debt. And then for the 60 parts that are equity, not only do we put the yield in there, but we put the growth rate that we have in our business model for the next 3 years. So for something to -- for an opportunity to clear the bar, it's got to clear that fully loaded weighted average cost of capital calculation. It's got to be additive not to earnings this year but additive to the growth rate in earnings that we've already got locked in. And so that's [indiscernible] how we look at making our investment decisions. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay, last question. Irrespective of price, if you could put a dollar to work in any property type in your portfolio today, where does that dollar go? 
James Flaherty: Irrespective of price? 
Ross Nussbaum: So basically, where do you see the best cash flow growth over, let's call it, a reasonable time frame as we sit here today? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think if you can opportunistically buy some senior housing assets in here, I think that's interesting. I think you're seeing that play out on our RIDEA joint venture portfolio right now where we're seeing outsized growth in terms of the occupancy in that portfolio since the period of time we bought out the 75% institutional partner. I think you're seeing outsized growth on the lease-up component of our Blackstone JV, which you will recall was about 1/3 of what we bought. So those 2 specific portfolios, which I called out in my script, I mean, you're seeing much more than a kind of a normal sort of course improvement in occupancy and cash flows. So to the extent we could source some more of those, that would be very interesting. To the extent there were some opportunities to kind of have another, what I'd call, "heads we win, tails we win" sort of situation where maybe because of some disruption in our company's capital structure where there's a debt maturity but there's some underlying real estate value, I think those are very interesting opportunities right now, Ross. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill. 
James Milam: First question, Paul. I think you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but can you just go over again what you thought the impact was to HCR ManorCare's coverage of the rent bump in April? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, it's 1 basis point from the prior quarter. 
James Milam: Okay. So almost nothing? 
Paul Gallagher: Right. 
James Milam: Okay, perfect. And then on the MOB leasing, I guess there were some lease-specific issues in the first quarter. But are you guys seeing or hearing anything out of your tenants that is -- are their views evolving on the types of leases, the length of leases, anything with consolidation of physician practices in hospitals, anything like that that's kind of evolving this quarter versus last quarter or 2 quarters ago that you've seen? 
James Flaherty: No, in fact our mark-to-markets there are trending a little bit higher. I do, and this isn't anything that's reflected in our financials, but we increasingly hear about and are seeing a greater involvement from the hospital itself whether they're buying out the physician practices or what. So that's a trend that seems to be continuing. 
James Milam: Okay, great. And then last one on the balance sheet with the debt maturities. Do you guys expect with the refinancing activity the majority of that to come from the unsecured debt market versus equity, I suppose? 
Timothy Schoen: Absolutely. Absent any incremental acquisitions, yes. 
James Milam: Perfect. And then, finally, is there an update on, I believe the second tranche of the Tandem mezz loan that goes out in the third quarter? Is that still the plan or is anything different there? 
James Flaherty: That is still the plan. There's a possibility that, that might get accelerated a little bit but that is still the base plan. We have not changed the guidance from our base plan. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. 
Jack Meehan: Looking at the RIDEA portfolio, you continue to show good occupancy and momentum through the quarter. Is the 88% in April tracking better than your previous forecast? And how is flu relative to expectation? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think you weren't with us at that time we did that so let me just give you a little background. This was a portfolio that historically Horizon Bay had managed for us and we had the opportunity to do 2 things. We had the opportunity to move that portfolio from Horizon Bay and then we had the opportunity to buy out our institutional partner because at that time we only owned, I think, 25% of the actual real estate. So when we looked at these opportunities that presented themselves about 2 years ago, we thought there was upside in the portfolio, which historically had been largely an independent living portfolio, Jack. We thought there was some upside in the portfolio on a number of fronts, most notably if we were to introduce a quality senior housing operator that had kind of an ancillary revenue business model and increase the cash flow of the properties that way. Now in order to do that, we also recognized we had to put some CapEx into it. So it was kind of a multi-dimension thought process of buy out the venture partner, invest some CapEx in the portfolio and then migrate that to an operator that had the ancillary revenue capability in their business platform. So we effected all that back in the fall of 2011. At the time we did that, we said we thought this was going to be 18 to 24 months before Brookdale was -- had their arms around the portfolio. I mean, they had geographic overlaps, which was one of the critical reasons why we decided to go with Brookdale, but we thought it'd be 18 months to get them to totally check out the communities, assess what the opportunities were for the residents that were there, build in the ancillary revenue platform and have the CapEx additions take place. Well, in fact, I would suggest to you, given the progress that we reported this morning, we're at the short end on the 18- to 24-month time frame. So we're feeling pretty good about that and we suspect that these outsized trends will continue. Relative to your comment on flu, there's really no material impact on this particular portfolio, given the most recently completed flu season. 
Jack Meehan: Okay, got you. And then maybe what are your expectations for the remainder of the year then when it comes to occupancy? And then do you have any update on the unstabilized portion of the Emeritus portfolio? 
James Flaherty: Well, let me take the last one first. In my formal remarks, I commented on the unstabilized portion of the Emeritus portfolio. I mentioned that -- remember, of the total acquisition that we closed on in October, 1/3 of the portfolio was unstabilized or what -- the term we use was a lease-up, Jack. And in my prepared remarks this morning, I mentioned that, that 1/3 of the portfolio had, had occupancy gains of 250 basis points in the 4 months or so that have transpired since we closed that. Now, to go back to your first question, I think you were asking about -- I don't think we've communicated to the public a year-end occupancy metric for the RIDEA JV portfolio so I'll have to remain quiet on that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. 
Michael Bilerman: Just looking at your comments regarding the Four Seasons debt, which has come in nicely from a pricing perspective and recognizing that you're perfectly hedged on the foreign exchange and you're generating a substantial amount of free cash flow just given the spread of how you financed it, should we take your comments as perhaps willing to sell down some of that position and harvest more gains for your shareholders? 
James Flaherty: Unlikely. I think harvesting the gains is not the unlikely part. I think the way we may affect -- Pete and his team over there are really good and we are certainly desirous of using our capital to increase the size of his operating platform. And so I think working with Pete and his team in the private equity firm there, I think the opportunity to first create and then subsequently harvest additional gains for HCP we see as quite attractive and quite likely, but it won't be because we're liquidating the existing position. It's likely that we'll add accretively to the position in the form of being a capital partner to that partner. 
Michael Bilerman: Sort of like HCR ManorCare buying into the debt and then going into assets and effectively round tripping a pretty attractive yield? 
James Flaherty: Yes, but also perhaps helping Four Seasons to facilitate some bolt-on acquisitions or expansion of their business platform. 
Michael Bilerman: If we switched to HCR ManorCare for a second, when you talked about 1.3 coverage by the end of the year, you're referring to the guarantor fixed charge coverage, the 1.10, I guess, as of March 31? 
James Flaherty: Yes, I'm talking about the 1 -- low 1.3 is I think is what I said. That would be normalized for reducing the noncash GL/PL charge that they took in the fourth quarter. So it would be -- if apples to apples to apples, it would be equivalent to what I think Paul quoted as being 1.28 today. 
Paul Gallagher: 1.28. 
Michael Bilerman: 1.28 today. And that's the guarantor coverage? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, sir. 
Michael Bilerman: And then that comes in from a lease payment, so the bump is 3.5%. How do those bumps work during the year? You talked about April lease payment that had gone up. I just wasn't sure how that increase should we think about over the course of the year? 
James Flaherty: Tim? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Michael, those come in annually in April. 
Michael Bilerman: All right. So it's basically fully loaded at that point. And at this point, you get the increase in their cash flows to offset some of that? 
Timothy Schoen: You got it. 
Michael Bilerman: Is anything -- just lastly, just on the investment landscape where you talked about this being varied and deep versus some larger just one-off transactions, I guess what are the critical points of transactions at this point to get them to the finish line? It appears it's not like deals are going away from you, right? It's just there's a lack of deals overall in the marketplace. So I'm just curious as you sort of see these deals evolve, what are the key hurdles that the sellers or conversely the buyers need to get over to make a deal occur? 
James Flaherty: Well, Elmer Fudd, everything has got its own little story, some of it is private equity kind of decision-making processes, some of it is more of a public company governance process, some of it might be a particular debt maturity that's got a maturity date. I mean, the trigger points are different in each situation, so I don't think you can really -- you can't say that they're all -- I mean, to be trite, I'd say, well, we haven't been able to come to an agreement on price, but I think there's other things that act -- that go into that and they're each quite unique, situation to situation. 
Michael Bilerman: Right. I should know if there was something that was causing some of them to go longer than others or not occur for others, but that's helpful color. 
James Flaherty: There are, but I guess my point is there are, but it's not one single thing. They're all unique to that particular deal dynamic. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Just kind of going back to Ross' question about the acquisition outlook. You seem to hint that you had a little bit more interest in doing something in the RIDEA space. Just kind of curious how your thoughts are evolving on that? 
James Flaherty: I don't recall hinting to Ross that we had more interest in the RIDEA space. Were you reacting on a specific comment I made? 
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, I think you mentioned to Ross that when he asked where you'd put an additional dollar, one of the things you mentioned was the Brookdale transaction had gone -- has been going very well and you'd be interested in doing something more like that. 
James Flaherty: Oh, right. I think what I also said, though, was I also referenced the lease-up component of the Blackstone acquisition we did in the fourth quarter, which, as you know, was a triple-net lease structure. Now that comment related more towards the ability to create an entry point in a senior housing opportunity properly structured, properly valued, properly CapEx. That was really what that one -- that was not a comment relative to triple-net versus RIDEA. We looked at that -- that's part of our normal arsenal. So we look at that execution real time in senior housing. And there, as you know, the determinant is we look at the risk-adjusted returns for the triple-net lease execution versus the RIDEA. And assuming we have a premium to compensate us for the cash flow uncertainty and the CapEx lability, we're delighted to proceed with the RIDEA structure. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then any baked [ph] at this point in regards to what SNF reimbursement could look like for fiscal year '14? 
James Flaherty: I don't -- you'd probably know more about than I would, Tayo. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: So first of all, if I could just mention or ask on HCR ManorCare if you were to look at a cash flow coverage, I know it's not relevant to you but it might become relevant when those leases expire. Cash flow after CapEx, too, you're probably sub 1. Wondering if my math is right, number one. Number two, what happens when 10, 12 years from now, those leases expire, what is your negotiation -- negotiating position in that type of scenario? 
James Flaherty: Well, for starters, as you know, in the lease, HCR is required to invest a minimum amount of CapEx in the portfolio. Our real estate, plus or minus, that's about $50 million a year, Rich. Last year, they invested $100 million, so 2x that. I think you'll see something similar in terms of a proportion in 2013 to what you saw in 2012. So again, it really kind of goes to the bigger issue of what the opportunity is that I was discussing with Nic. I mean, you've got a company now who's got its business model structured from a cost standpoint for what will be a very substantial market share gain that occurs in the next couple of years, which takes advantage of the fact that it's the lowest cost setting in that post-acute space and that post-acute space is going to have some very substantial changes in reimbursement protocols, risk sharing with acute care hospital operators, risk sharing with managed care companies, things of that state. So this is a revenue play here in the next couple of years, not so much of a cost. They've got the cost situation sorted out. Now, that said, today, we're at the fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.3x. We're -- after CapEx, we're at 1.15x. So that's certainly not below 1. But I think you'll see lift here -- you'll see directional lift in '13 but I think you'll see the major significant improvement start to occur in '14 and '15 as these other elements of marketplace-driven health care reform start to happen. 
Richard Anderson: But if you were to look at the property level, would that be materially different than the fixed charge algebra? 
James Flaherty: Are you asking us if we'd go away from... 
Richard Anderson: No, I'm just wondering how different is it when you say fixed charge coverage versus cash flow coverage? 
James Flaherty: Well, I mean, it'll be lower. But again, we've got -- remember that you're looking just at the property. These properties were used for much more than the revenues. You've got a whole host of other revenue streams here, hospice and home health and a number of other, that these properties that we own are facilitating, which is one of the reasons why we passionately believe the right metric to look at is the overall corporate... 
Richard Anderson: I'm not disagreeing. I'm just wondering what happens say you get the properties back 12 years from now, what then, that kind of thing. That's all. So then turning to... 
James Flaherty: If we go to the heat map on Page 8 of the supplemental... 
Richard Anderson: I wish I can print it out in black and white, but anyway... 
James Flaherty: This isn't going to be a good conversation if you print it in black and white. You've got to get the green and the red, but... 
Richard Anderson: I can guess where the green is. 
James Flaherty: Yes, you'll see this portfolio position kind of looks like somewhere between the 12- and 13-year mark on the x-axis and definitely in the green on the y-axis. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. Can you comment on the 2/3 of the Emeritus portfolio acquired through the Blackstone joint venture acquisition, how that -- those assets are doing, the stabilized assets? 
James Flaherty: Yes. Their occupancy is at 91.5%, I think I quoted that in my... 
Richard Anderson: And what about coverage because it's omitted from the coverage statistics in your supplemental, right? 
James Flaherty: Well, it's not admitted, it's not in the same-store calculation. I think Paul took you through our philosophy on that at the beginning of his remarks. So we won't have that in there. You've seen -- overall, you've seen modest lift on our coverage. But again, we've got through -- you probably got 4.5 months worth of actual data. So we're ahead of our underwriting, that's what I said in my formal comments. That's absolutely the case, and we've had a nice improvement on the lease-up portion, which is about 1/3 of the portfolio. 
Richard Anderson: Just quickly back to HCR ManorCare, does your target of 1 -- over 1.3 coverage assume any market share gain, or is that just real organic stuff? 
James Flaherty: That is -- it's not my target. That's their target. That's their budget. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, their budget. 
James Flaherty: That doesn't -- that has very modest revenue assumptions for calendar 2013. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, last one for me. Is it a reasonable scenario where you shift the Brookdale RIDEA assets back to triple-net once you've kind of gotten to a point where you feel like you've stabilized it and all that sort of stuff? 
James Flaherty: We look at that. I mean, we look at that and then we look at the ones that are at the 1.4, 1.5 and shift those over to RIDEA, right? I mean, we're looking to drive increases in cash flow so we've got to -- and again, this isn't a conversation that's unique to Brookdale by any means. I think people sometimes get a little overly fixated with coverage ratios, particularly as they escalate higher and higher and higher. Those are -- that gap between a 1.0 and a higher coverage is cash flow that's not going to the landlords. It's cash flow that's going to the operator. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel. 
Robert Mains: One question on the 5x5 and I'm not asking you to tip on your hand on what you might do. But institutional joint ventures haven't done any for a while. Is there anything that's percolating there at all at this point? 
James Flaherty: Well, there's always stuff percolating. But you'll recall -- but let's take a giant step back and let's look at that question, which is a very interesting question over a span of, say, 6 or 7 years. So 6 or 7 years ago, ourselves and our peers, we competed with a lot of private equity firms for opportunities. Today, you don't really see us -- and this isn't today, it's the last couple of years. You really haven't seen us competing with private equity firms for deals because our cost of capital has improved significantly relative to their cost of capital. So in other words, the LP investors that are committing to those private equity funds, they're still looking for whatever they're looking for. It's probably 20% kind of plus whereas we've been able to benefit with the improving balance sheets in the sector, which has given rise to improved higher credit ratings and with the present 0 interest policy on the part of the federal government, you could add material increases in your cost of capital. So the -- what a prospective joint venture party today brings, say, to HCP versus, say, 7 years ago when the fellow across the table from me, Tim Schoen, was running that platform and we had $2.5 billion of assets under management for which we owned approximately 20% in institutional pension funds who were pension funds of AA and AAA-rated companies had a lower cost of capital, that paradigm has gone upside down. So we now have the lower cost of capital. So for us to do a joint venture at this point, it would be not having anything to do with really the decisions that we were -- the inputs to the decisions we were making 7 years ago, which was cost of capital. Today, it would be -- maybe there's something in that portfolio that they'd like to, I don't know, monetize some of it but not all of it or there'd have to be a different strategic element at this point in order for us to move forward on a joint venture. I think that's a long answer, but I think that would be my reaction to your question. 
Robert Mains: That's an interesting answer. And then I may have missed in Paul's commentary this. On the senior housing portfolio, rental and related revenues were down sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Is there a reason for that because that same number of same-store properties? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Rob, it's Tim Schoen. There's some seasonality between the fourth quarter and the first quarter as it relates to add rent so that's the reason you see that dynamic. 
James Flaherty: A little lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. 
Robert Mains: Even though it's triple-net through seasonality? 
James Flaherty: You do have some seasonality with the add rent component. There's a matter of... 
Robert Mains: Okay, right, right, right. There's the seasonality, got it. Seasonality in the industry. Right. And then a couple of other questions for you, Tim. First of all, CapEx was pretty light in the first quarter. It was last year, too. Can we kind of surmise that, that's normal seasonality at this point? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, yes. Same word, seasonality, but yes. It's light in the first quarter, but we still expect to be in that $63 million range for the year. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then straight line rent came up a lot but your guidance kind of seems to suggest it's going to come down sequentially. Was there -- in subsequent quarters. Was something going on in the first quarter with straight line? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, well, there's 2 questions there. Yes, straight line's up from $9 million to $18 million because of the Blackstone JV acquisition and it will go down on a run rate basis over the year as we have contractual rent steps throughout the year. 
Robert Mains: Okay. It seems that the quarter-to-quarter decline looks like a little steeper than in the past, but that's probably because you're starting in a higher base? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, it's still in that $61 million range that I provided guidance with on February. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. 
Todd Stender: I wanted to make sure I heard that right, sounded like Tenet was exercising purchase options to buy 3 hospitals. Is that correct? 
James Flaherty: Yes, we announced -- on the last call in February, Todd, we'd mentioned that they had purchase options that were in the zone where they had to notify us as to whether they were going to renew or purchase. They did that shortly after our February call. And as Paul mentioned, those purchase options are subject to a fair market value valuation and that they would close -- they would be effective February 2014. 
Todd Stender: What is the total sale price? Have you guys arrived at that valuation? 
James Flaherty: No, we just got their intention for them to exercise the purchase option. So these are 3 hospitals that collectively have an EBITDAR cash flow coverage of 4.7x and generate annual rents to HCP of about $23 million or 1% of HCP's revenue. You can see, at that sort of coverage ratio, that would imply low market rents. 
Todd Stender: Is this a surprise to you guys? It seems like it would go against maybe what we would think of as hospitals should only be focusing on their operations and not on their real estate? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think the surprise is that we're the only, I guess, us and Universal Health REIT, are the only 2 health care REITs that have -- actually, MTW does as well, acute care. Acute care hospitals, not LTACHs, not rehabs and things like that. We've got these 3 hospitals of Tenet that cash flow quite well. We've got our magnificent Medical City Dallas campus that I think you've been to and then we've got Hoag Hospital down in Irvine. So it's actually the opposite. It's the surprise that they're not on the balance sheet to the hospital. Historically, hospitals have wanted to own their, what they call, the strategic assets, which is their hospitals. And depending on lots of considerations, the nature of the counterparty, what their balance sheets look like, they will look to monetize the nonstrategic portions of their campuses, which typically tend to be medical office buildings or clinics and things like that. So it's really -- if anything, I would say that Tenet's decision to reacquire these 3 hospitals would be more consistent with the traditional view of real estate from a standpoint of acute care hospital operators. 
Todd Stender: Okay, that's helpful, Jay. Any other purchase options on hospitals for the remainder of the year? 
James Flaherty: The only other one is, again, what we talked about on the last call, HealthSouth has exercised a purchase option on a rehab hospital down in San Antonio and Paul described that on our previous call. So that's it for purchase options for 2013. 
Todd Stender: And did the agreements call for any requirement of HCP to provide seller financing on either of the deals? 
James Flaherty: Absolutely not. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: A couple of questions going back to the HCR ManorCare coverages. The $95 million in reserves that you added back to get to the normalized coverage, is that impacting the facility level coverages as well, the 0.83 and the 1.18? 
James Flaherty: Yes, that would be it. 
Michael Mueller: Okay. So it's all 3, it's fixed charge and the facility levels, okay. 
James Flaherty: Yes. 
Michael Mueller: And then secondly, if we look at the Q mix, it looks like it's been stable from Q4 to Q1, but down a couple of hundred basis points year-over-year. Wondering what was driving that and where you see it going? 
James Flaherty: There's been a little bit of a mix shift, but other than that, I don't think there's anything beyond that. I wouldn't expect that quality of mix to move much from this metric right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jorel Guilloty with Morgan Stanley. 
Wilfredo Guilloty: My question is specifically on acquisition. So I was on wondering if the cap rate compression that we've seen in the senior housing space, particularly for Class A product, if it has caused a shift on your acquisition focus in terms of asset classes at least in the near term? 
James Flaherty: No. The answer to that question is no. We look at, as I said on a -- in response to an earlier call, we look at everything on kind of 4 critical metrics valuation relative to replacement cost, FAD accretion, unlevered returns and spread over weighted average cost of capital. 
Wilfredo Guilloty: Okay. And then given this cap rate compression as well, could you see HCP accelerating any contemplated asset monetizations given where pricing is? 
James Flaherty: Well, we certainly -- we evaluate that. As you recall, I was up with Paul last month up in the Bay area where we've got some extremely low cap rate valuation assets. But again, we would look at that relative to what we've got in those particular situations. Those are long-dated leases with very, very, very substantial creditworthy counterparties behind them, in this case Google and LinkedIn, with very attractive escalators. So to the extent that, that just becomes a math exercise, at a valuation that, that makes sense. But absent that valuation, we're better off using that to further buttress an attractive increasing dividend stream with a fair amount of stability and safety built into it. 
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc. 
Jordan Sadler: It's Jordan Sadler. I guess this is -- relates back to the last question, but a prior question as well. But if you were to monetize or reduce exposure to one area in the portfolio among the 5 classes of assets, what would that be and why? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think we're doing that. We have -- we referred to it as our nonstabilized portion of our portfolio, Jordan. So we are definitely looking to reduce that -- that component of our investment portfolio. It's less than 5% and I think the next candidate you could see in that bucket will be the legacy Delphis loan that we inherited when we bought CNL. We're making very good -- the team's making very good progress on that going away. 
Jordan Sadler: But among the core properties or property types, is there anything there? I mean, of those 5, would there be one that you'd look to reduce exposure to? 
James Flaherty: Well, we look at all of them all the time and the reality is given the discussion we just had on the purchase options in the acute care hospital space, absent some incremental activity, you'll see the hospital component of our overall portfolio decline. So you'll see the nonstabilized portion of our investment portfolio decline. But it's all kind of within that 5x5 model. Wherever we think we can extract value for our shareholders, that's what we'll do. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Jay Flaherty, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. 
James Flaherty: Thank you, everyone. We have a good start to spring for those of you who haven't seen it yet, and we'll see you at NAREIT. Take care, and thank you for your interest in HCP. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's First Quarter 2013 HCP Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-12 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2012 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lashonda, and I will be your coordinator today.

 I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, John. Welcome to HCP's 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me in Long Beach this morning are HCP's Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and HCP's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen.
 We will begin with a review of the results announced earlier today. And for that, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. 2012 was another excellent year for HCP. One, we generated cash same property growth of 4.2% over 2011; two, we closed on $2.6 billion of accretive investments led by our $1.7 billion senior housing portfolio acquisition of The Blackstone JV; three, we raised $3.5 billion of debt and equity capital and significantly improved the pricing on our $1.5 billion revolver; four, we received credit rating upgrades from Moody's and S&P; five, we achieved substantial success in sustainability.
 With this summary, there are several topics I will cover: Our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results; investment and disposition transactions; financing activities and balance sheet; and finally, our 2013 guidance and dividend.
 Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Cash NOI from our same-store portfolio increased 4.3% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes. For the quarter, we reported FFO of $0.71 per share, which included transaction costs related to our $1.7 billion Blackstone JV acquisition. Excluding the transaction cost, FFO as adjusted for the quarter was $0.72 per share and FAD was $0.57 per share, which represent increases of 7% and 14% year-over-year, respectively.
 Turning to our full year 2012 results. Cash Same Property Performance increased 4.2% over 2011, in line with the midpoint of our last guidance. The results were favorably impacted by a $4 million onetime rent payment from Google in the first quarter of 2012. Absent this, our year-over-year cash SPP increased 3.8%. We reported full year 2012 FFO of $2.72 per share, which reflected the combined impact of $0.06 per share from noncash charges related to our preferred stock redemption and land sale impairment and transaction expenses for our Blackstone JV acquisition. Excluding these items, FFO as adjusted for 2012 was $2.78 per share and FAD was $2.22 per share, increases of 3.3% and 3.7% over 2011, respectively. The results were driven by same-store performance and accretive acquisitions closed during the second half of 2012.
 Recall that full year 2012 growth is moderated by a $35 million or $0.09 per share gain in 2011 from the early par payoff of our Genesis debt investment. Absent this onetime gain in 2011, we achieved year-over-year per share growth rates of 6.9% and 8.3% for FFO as adjusted and FAD. Our 2012 cash dividend of $2 per share resulted in a FFO as adjusted payout ratio of 72% and FAD payout ratio of 90%.
 We achieved a 21% reduction in our non-stabilized assets in 2012, reducing the pool of assets from $1.1 billion in January to $850 million at year end. 2012 stabilizations included a substantial pay-down of our Delphis debt investment, sale and development of our landholdings in Poway and reaching stable occupancy on 8 life science and medical office buildings.
 Investment in disposition transactions. During 2012, we invested $2.6 billion as follows: first, a $1.7 billion acquisition of the Blackstone JV portfolio, comprised of 129 senior housing communities master leased to Emeritus; second, $280 million of on-campus MOB portfolios representing 1.2 million square feet; third, $315 million of post-acute debt investments, consisting of $215 million in U.K.-based Four Seasons Health Care and $100 million first tranche funding as part of a $205 million mezzanine loan facility with Tandem Health Care; fourth, $110 million of senior housing debt investments, including fundings of $58 million related to our development loan program and a secured loan of $52 million provided to Emeritus as part of the Blackstone JV transaction; fifth, $61 million of pre-leased life science redevelopment projects to build out lab space for the AA-rated and #2-ranked Duke University, and $183 million for other real estate acquisitions, development and capital improvements.
 During the year, we sold 4 properties and a land parcel for $150 million, generating a net gain of $24 million. Fourth quarter disposition activities included 2 senior housing communities in Alabama for $111 million in connection with a tenant purchase option that resulted in the properties being valued at a 7.1% cap rate, generating a gain of $17 million.
 Our financing activities and balance sheet. During 2012, we raised $3.5 billion of debt and equity in the capital markets to fund accretive acquisitions and refinance higher interest rate debt and preferred securities. Proceeds raised during the fourth quarter totaled $1.8 billion, consisting of $979 million in common stock and $800 million of 2 5/8% senior unsecured notes due 2020. We used these proceeds to finance the Blackstone JV acquisition, consistent with our long term capital structure of 40-parts debt and 60-parts equity. We achieved more attractive financing terms than those initially projected, and as a result, the Blackstone JV acquisition on a full year basis is $0.10 and $0.07 per share accretive to FFO and FAD, respectively, exceeding our underwriting by $0.02 per share for each metric.
 We ended the year with $248 million of unrestricted cash, including proceeds from the fourth quarter asset sales mentioned earlier and excess proceeds from our November bond issuance after funding the Blackstone JV acquisition. We intend to use cash on hand to repay $150 million of 5 5/8% senior unsecured notes, maturing on February 28. Our remaining 2013 debt maturities total $695 million, with an average interest rate of 6%, representing attractive refinancing opportunities in the second half of this year. We have no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion revolver at year end, and less than 1% of our debt obligations are subject to floating interest rates.
 With respect to our improved credit metrics, at year end, our financial leverage remained at 40%. The secured debt ratio improved to 8.3x -- 8.3%. Fixed charge coverage for 2012 increased to 3.6x, and for the fourth quarter, improved to 3.8x. Net debt to EBITDA for the year was 5.3x and improving to 5.0x for the quarter. Recognizing the significant positive momentum in our credit profile, during the fourth quarter, both Moody's and S&P upgraded our credit ratings to Baa1 and BBB+.
 Our full year 2013 guidance. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions and reflects the following: Cash Same Property Performance is projected to range from 2.5% to 3.5% on a full year basis, and we expect the growth to accelerate as we move through the year. Excluding the onetime Google rent payment in the first quarter of 2012, cash same-store is projected to increase from 3% to 3.3% at the midpoint.
 2013 FFO is projected to range from $2.92 to $2.98 per share, which at the midpoint represents 6.1% growth compared to our 2012 FFO as adjusted.
 The growth is driven by the accretive benefit from 2012 acquisitions and forecasted same-store growth on a GAAP basis. 2013 FAD is projected to range from $2.39 to $2.45 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint, driven by 2012 acquisitions and forecasted cash same-store performance.
 Our business plan assumes the continued monetization of non-stabilized assets, with projected stabilizations of $200 million in 2013.
 Let me quickly run through a few other detailed assumptions related to our guidance. G&A is forecasted to be $85 million, including amortization of stock-based compensation of $23 million; amortization of below market lease intangibles and deferred revenues of $2 million; amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs of $18 million; straight-line rents of $60 million; DFL accretion totaling $152 million, of which $91 million is reported in income from direct financing leases with the remaining $61 million accounted for as income from joint ventures as a result of our minority ownership in HCR ManorCare OpCo; DFL depreciation of $14 million; leasing costs and second-generation tenant and capital expenditures of $63 million; development, redevelopment and first-generation capital funding of $182 million, including capitalized interest of $15 million [ph]; and projected funding of $30 million related to our senior housing development loan program and assumes Tandem Health Care draws $105 million related to the second tranche funding of our loan commitment.
 I'll conclude with a few words on our 2013 dividend. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.525 per share, marking the 28th consecutive year of dividend increases for HCP. The annualized dividend of $2.10 per share represents an increase of 5% or $0.10 per share over 2012. And based on the midpoint of our guidance, the projected 2013 FFO and FAD payout ratios will improve to 71% and 87%. Finally, HCP continues as the only REIT included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index.
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Now let me review the fourth quarter results and provide 2013 Same Property Performance guidance by segment.
 Senior housing. As of September 30, 2012, our same property senior housing occupancy was 86.2%, a 90 basis point sequential increase over the prior quarter and an 80 basis point increase versus the prior year. Included in this, occupancy for our RIDEA JV was 86%. For the fourth quarter, our RIDEA JV's occupancy increased 120 basis points to 87.2%.
 Same-store cash flow coverage for the portfolio declined [ph] 1 basis point from the prior quarter to 1.11x, driven by outsized fixed rent bumps on our transitioned assets. Current quarter year-over-year same property cash NOI was up 6%. Growth was driven by rent steps, including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators and additional rents earned in our Sunrise portfolio. Full year 2012 senior housing Same Property Performance was up 3.5%. For 2013, we expect senior housing Same Property Performance to increase by 3.75% to 4.75%. There are no lease expirations in our senior housing portfolio for 2013.
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. Coverage metrics in our post-acute skilled nursing portfolio now reflect 4 quarters of lower reimbursement rates under RUGs-IV. For the period ending September 30, 2012, HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage was 1.29x. Rolling forward 3 months to December 31, 2012, normalized fixed charge coverage remains unchanged at 1.29x. This normalized fixed charge coverage excludes $95 million in reserves accrued for prior period liability claims, of which $69 million was accrued in the fourth quarter. Including these reserves, the trailing 12 month fourth quarter coverage is 1.10x.
 CMS' 2011 cuts for skilled nursing facilities had the impact of reducing HCR's reimbursement and increasing therapy costs by $225 million. However, HCR was successful in mitigating over $100 million of that impact through: one, a cost reduction program; two, growth in home, health and hospice; and three, new revenue from developments and expansions placed into service. As a result, the company continues to generate significant cash flow after our rent payment, and in fiscal year 2012, funded $100 million of investments in maintenance CapEx, physical plant upgrades, expansions of our facilities and the development of new facilities. Same property cash flow coverage in our non-HCR portfolio was 1.45x, a 7 basis point decrease versus the prior quarter and a 43 basis point decrease versus the prior year.
 Year-over-year same property cash NOI in our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio for the fourth quarter increased 3.6%, primarily driven by HCR's annual rent steps. Full year 2012 post-acute/skilled nursing Same Property Performance was up 3.7%. For 2013, Same Property Performance for post-acute/skilled nursing is expected to increase by 3% to 4%. There are no lease expirations in our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio in 2013.
 Hospitals. Same property cash flow coverage increased 19 basis points to 5.02x, with our 3 tenant hospitals increasing 17 basis points to 4.51x. Year-over-year same property cash NOI for the quarter increased 2.4%. Full year 2012 Same Property Performance was up 3.6%. For 2013, hospital Same Property Performance is expected to increase by 3.5% to 4.5%. During the quarter, Cirrus Health completed the sale of its interest in 2 of the surgical hospitals in HCP's  loan collateral pool. HCP received $38 million in repayments, reducing our carrying value of our Cirrus loan from $68.8 million to $30.7 million at year end.
 There is 1 lease expiration in our hospital portfolio in 2013, with annual rent of $2.7 million or 0.2% of HCP's annual revenues. The lease is subject to a fair market value purchase option, which has been exercised by the tenant. The sale will occur in May 2013.
 Next week, Tenet Healthcare must provide notice of their intent to renew their below market lease for 5 years or exercise their purchase options on each of the 3 HCP-owned hospitals. The renewal option would take our Hickory, North Carolina, hospital's rent to fair market. While the remaining 2 hospital's rent structure would remain unchanged for 5 years. If Tenet elects to exercise their purchase options on the 3 hospitals, the price would be at fair market value. If the purchase options are exercised, HCP will realize a significant gain on sale, where proceeds can be redeployed into higher growth assets. The renewal or purchase will be effective in February 2014.
 Medical Office Buildings. Same property cash NOI for the fourth quarter was up 1.9%. The growth was the result in normal rent steps, coupled with increased occupancy versus the fourth quarter 2011. Full year 2012 MOB Same Property Performance was up 2.7%, with 2013 same-store growth expected to increase by 3.25% to 4.25%. Our MOB occupancy for the fourth quarter increased 50 basis points to 92%, the highest MOB occupancy in 6 years.
 During the quarter, tenants representing 465,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 313,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Our 2012 average retention rate first was 79%. Renewals for the fourth quarter occurred at 0.9% higher mark-to-market rents, with an average term for new and renewal leases of over 5 years. For 2013, we have 2.4 million square feet of scheduled expirations, including 348,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. Our pipeline remains strong with 190,000 square feet of executed leases that have yet to commence and 900,000 square feet in active negotiation.
 Life science. Same property NOI was up 5.3% in the fourth quarter. Full year 2012 Same Property Performance for the life science portfolio was up 7%, favorably impacted by the onetime $4 million payment from Google received in the first quarter 2012 and the expansion and rent increase from LinkedIn, which commenced January 2012. The life science 2013 Same Property Performance will be lower due to these onetime items and the expiration in January 2013 of a large, above market lease in South San Francisco. The Same Property Performance is projected to decline by 1.5% to minus 2.5%. Excluding the Google payment and the above market lease expiration, 2013 Same Property Performance would increase by 1% to 2%.
 Occupancy for our life science portfolio increased 130 basis points to 91.3%, the highest portfolio occupancy in 5 years, with nearly 1 million square feet of leasing achieved for each of the last 3 years. For the quarter, we completed 171,000 square feet of leasing, bringing the year-to-date total to 978,000 square feet, with a retention rate of 87.7%. Renewals for the quarter occurred at 4.7% higher mark-to-market rents, with an average lease term for new and renewal leases of 6.5 years. For 2013, we have 410,000 square feet of scheduled expirations, representing just 0.6% of HCP's annualized revenues.
 The life science development pipeline consists of 3 redevelopment projects, currently 72% pre-leased, totaling 166,000 square feet, and 2 100% pre-leased development projects, totaling 185,000 square feet, with a total remaining funding requirement projected to be at $45 million. We also completed the sale of 18.6 acres of vacant land in Poway to General Atomics that we announced on our third quarter call. The transaction was part of a larger blend and extend and build-to-suit lease transaction, reducing our total remaining land held for development in Poway by 40%. Positive strategic developments with our life science tenants include Alexza Pharmaceuticals, a tenant on our Mountain View campus, receiving FDA approval for ADASUVE, its leading drug candidate. Additionally, 2 of HCP's tenants on our Redwood City campus were acquired by stronger credits. Verinata was acquired by Illumina, and Incline pharmaceuticals was acquired by The Medicines Company. Also, 2 of our publicly traded tenants, Rigel Pharmaceuticals and Cytori Therapeutics raised a combined $150 million in equity capital.
 Sustainability. In November, we received NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for the health care sector, which honors companies that have demonstrated superior portfolio-wide energy conservation practices and sustainability initiatives. In December, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report based on the internationally recognized Global Reporting Initiative framework, which includes our sustainability achievements, as well as key indicators of our environmental, social and governance efforts. The report is available on our newly-designed website at www.hcpi.com.
 During the fourth quarter, we received an additional 11 ENERGY STAR labels, bringing HCP's total ENERGY STAR labels awarded during the year to 35. This includes an industry-leading 20 labels in our MOB category for the year. Our Soledad Business Park in Sorrento Mesa, California, in the life science portfolio, was named Best Core and Shell LEED project by the San Diego Green Building Council. In addition, we were awarded LEED Gold certification at our 1030 Mass Avenue property in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We established the HCP Social Responsibility Committee during the quarter, which is charged with identifying and implementing employee volunteering and corporate philanthropic initiatives. And finally, the implementation of our best practices and investments in energy-saving technology continue to provide positive economic results. On a same property basis, utility expense savings were $124,000 versus the fourth quarter 2011, and $1.3 million for the full year.
 I will now turn it back to Jay. 
James Flaherty: Thank you, Paul. For those of you affected by Storm Nemo, we hope things get back to normal soon. On our Q3 call last November, Hurricane Sandy's impact was in the process of being sorted out. Today, I'm pleased to report that all of HCP's properties are functioning fine and HCP's economic exposure, net of insurance recoveries, is de minimis.
 2012 was a very good year for HCP. Unquestionably, the most complete year in company history. I'll elaborate on this in a few minutes. But first, I want to emphasize the following: HCP's investment portfolios strong 4.2% Same Property Performance enjoyed substantial contributions from each of our 5 property types. 2012's performance drove year-over-year increases of 6.9% in FFO and 8.3% in FAD, adjusted for the 2011 onetime $35 million windfall from our Genesis debt investment. 2012's $2.4 billion of accretive acquisitions incorporated 4 of our 5 property types and 4 of our 5 investment products. Importantly, 87% of this acquisition volume was repeat business with existing partners, and 88% of the transactions were structured as contractual income streams, either triple-net leases or mezzanine debt investments.
 We also made very good progress with our non-stabilized assets, reducing this pool by $220 million or 21% during 2012. As of year end, non-stabilized assets now represent just 4% of HCP's portfolio.
 Moving from the left side to the right side of our balance sheet. In the past 2-plus years, HCP has received 6 positive rating actions from the 3 agencies that cover the company. This unprecedented credit profile improvement has materially reduced HCP's cost of capital. With our current Baa1, BBB+, BBB+ ratings, there are now only 3 REITs with ratings superior to HCP. One of the REITs, Public Storage, has a unique capital structure, that while we admire, HCP cannot realistically hope to emulate. The 2 remaining REITs, rated above HCP, with single A ratings, have leverage, fixed charge coverage and secured debt metrics that are inferior to those of HCP's.
 I mentioned previously that 2012 was HCP's most complete year in its corporate history. On top of our acquisition, asset management and balance sheet accomplishments, HCP established new, all-time bests in operating efficiency, sustainability and occupancy for our life science and medical office sectors.
 Capitalizing on our fully builtout business model, HCP's G&A expense amounted to just 32 basis points of assets under management in 2012. HCP's multitude of sustainability successes culminated with the company's November 2012 recognition by NAREIT as the top-ranked health care REIT and winner of its annual Leader in the Light Award. And at year end, our life science portfolio was 91.3% occupied, and our medical office portfolio was 92% occupied. Squeezing more juice out of our existing portfolio through prudent overhead management, a continued commitment to sustainability and occupancy gains, on top of attractive Same Property Performance, creates significant operating momentum for HCP and allows us to remain completely opportunistic when it comes to incremental acquisitions. I want to acknowledge the significant contributions made by each of HCP's 150 employees to these important accomplishments. Speaking of these 150 HCP employees, at our current enterprise value of $31 billion, that works out to over $200 million of market cap per employee. Now that's productivity.
 Turning to 2013, the double-barreled engine of strong profit performance and last year's accretive acquisitions position the company's Board of Directors to raise HCP's dividend by 5% 3 weeks ago, the largest increase in over 10 years. As important, at the midpoint of our 2013 FAD guidance, we forecast a FAD payout ratio of 87%, the lowest in HCP's history. And it is with enormous pride that we move ahead into another year as the only REIT included in the prestigious S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index.
 HCP's projected Same Property Performance guidance of 3%, levered at 40% debt, 60% equity, and combined with 2012's accretive acquisition activity, will produce a 9-plus percent increase in 2013 FAD. This assumes no acquisitions for the year.
 The positive recent operating trends at HCR, HCA, Brookdale, LinkedIn and Google, as well as the significant milestones achieved by a number of our life science tenants, bode well for 2013. Strong investor demand for yield assets in the current low interest rate environment and the emerging residential housing recovery have created attractive HCP shareholder value from our Four Seasons, Tandem and Brookdale investments relative to our entry prices. And finally, we are encouraged by the current level of deal dialogue as it relates to prospective 2013 transaction activity.
 Before opening up for Q&A, I want to knowledge Bill Sheriff, whose retirement as CEO from Brookdale was announced yesterday. Bill is an inspirational leader and a man of unquestioned integrity. Bill may not have always waxed eloquent on earnings conference calls, but Bill always, always took care of the seniors that resided in his communities. We wish Bill and Sharon, all the best in their retirement, and we congratulate Andy Smith, who we have gotten to know over the past 5 years, and look forward to working with Andy and the rest of the Brookdale team going forward.
 That concludes our prepared remarks. We are delighted to take your questions at this time. Loshanda? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: Just a couple of quick ones. Do you have any update on the Sunwest portfolio in terms of how their lease-up's progressing, how much of their CapEx program they've gone through since you last gave us an update, I guess, back in October? 
James Flaherty: Well, when we last gave the update, we hadn't closed the transaction yet, Jeff. We've now closed on 129 of the 133. We still have 4 properties that were waiting to come in once we clear some consents. So it's early days yet. But based on 2 months of actual data, EBITDAR is up relative to both where it was at the time of closing but more importantly up relative to our underwriting, which obviously is accretive to the coverage ratio. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. And any update on the lease-up in particular? Are they getting those properties leased-up at the rate that you expected? 
Paul Gallagher: They are up just a little bit over where we had underwritten. So they're performing ahead of schedule. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. And then just moving on to HCR ManorCare, continued drop in coverage as we expected as the cuts work through the system. Just wondering what your thoughts were on the facility-level coverage as we look out a year. I mean, HCR ManorCare spent a tremendous amount of capital on these facilities. The coverage has been overwhelmed by the Medicare impact. But as you look out over the next year, how do you see those rebounding? 
James Flaherty: Well, let me say -- let me make a couple of comments here. First of all, looking backwards, HCR has come through a very challenging 18 months. They've had the triple whammy, if you will, of the RUGs-IV cuts, changes to therapy reimbursement, which made it difficult for HCR to affect some of the cost reductions that they otherwise would have hoped to achieve. And then you've got the GL/PL litigation environment, which resulted in the reassessment by third-party actuaries of the company's potential liabilities for services provided in the prior 6 years. So that's kind of the context of the environment that they've been operating in. We now go -- we always like to look forward and, Jeff, you recall that about 18 months ago on our November '11 call when we were reporting the June 30, '11 coverage results, I had indicated that notwithstanding the fact that you would see the next couple of quarters reported by HCP of HCR coverage continue to go up. In fact, that was going to be a delayed reaction to the August 2011 CMS cuts, where that, in fact, has occurred. And now we're at the next inflection point, which is, you're now going to see these coverages rebound. So I take you to the fourth quarter results, which were quite strong for HCR. Admissions, 90% of which come from hospital discharges, and that's very significant for another reason, which we'll discuss in a minute, were up 3.2% in Q4 2012 versus Q4 2011. In 2012, HCR had its best year ever for patient quality and outcomes. And the Q4 census for each of HCR's 3 lines of business: skilled nursing, assisted living -- recall that 20% of our investment is in the assisted living, specifically the dementia memory care sector; and then their third line of business, home, health and hospice, were all quite strong. The company finished the year with 121 -- $120 million of cash on hand. That's projected to be at $145 million cash on hand at the end of 2013. They have got $100 million of availability of the line of credit. And in 2012, after the rent to HCP, after interest expense and after CapEx, they were positive cash flow to the tune of $50 million. So you're starting to see the lift that we had anticipated on the prior call. I think, in fact, on the prior call, I'd indicated that I expected Q3 2012 results to be a trough quarter were you to look at solely just the fourth quarter results for HCR. So not the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/12, which Paul just cited, but specifically the fourth quarter on a normalized basis, you would see that fixed charge coverage ratio as having increased versus the third quarter fixed charge coverage. So again, as we had indicated. Bringing it back to the overall headline, Jeff, we would expect in 2013 that fixed charge coverage ratio to be in excess of what the -- the 1.29 that was achieved in 2012. So that's a little bit about how we look at the -- a portion of our HCR investment. 
Jeff Theiler: Right. Just any sense of the magnitude of how much it would be in excess of that? Just trying to gauge whether we're looking at 0.1 turns or 0.2 turns there, just in that. 
James Flaherty: I think we've got perfect information for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, which is the fourth quarter of calendar 2012. I think we're going to want to see another quarter or 2 before we get definitive on that. But not surprisingly, the trend, directionally, are going the way we anticipated them. Perhaps much more importantly, because we've also got our OpCo investment that we watch, and I want to bring you back to the comment about 90% of the admissions for HCR come out of hospitals. With what's going on in health care reform, at least as it relates to health care reform being -- taking place in the marketplace, you got some very, very positive developments here. You've got increasing acceptance on the part of both the hospitals and the payers towards risk sharing reimbursement. And when you've got a company like HCR that's got a fully built-out model with market concentrations, you take those cluster markets and they are the beneficiary right now of several CMS-sponsored pilot concepts, which are teaming and partnering HCR with large, managed care companies to create new reimbursement paradigms that are risk sharing in nature. And you'll start to hear more later this year, but perhaps probably more importantly 2014, you'll start to hear concepts like site neutral reimbursement and bundling. And all of these become wind at the back of the HCR platform that generates best outcomes for the lowest cost. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Robert Mains: Looking at discussion of HCR ManorCare, one question, and it's just a number -- I didn't -- I want to make sure I got it right. The total accrual for the prior period reserve adjustments? 
Paul Gallagher: For the prior 12 months? 
Robert Mains: Yes. 
Paul Gallagher: $95 million. 
James Flaherty: That's for the entire 12 months ending... 
Paul Gallagher: That's for the prior 12 months ending December 31. 
James Flaherty: That would be in Paul's remarks, consistent with Paul's remarks. 
Robert Mains: Right. Okay. And then the [indiscernible] the $59 million was in the fourth quarter. Do you have the '12... 
Paul Gallagher: $69 million, Rob. 
Robert Mains: $69 million, okay. And then do you have the '12 for the period ending 9/30? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, it was in the 30 -- $38 million. 
Robert Mains: Okay. Jay, you spoke about feeling positive about the pipeline. When you look out at what's available, have we kind of seen -- continue to see cap rate compression or are the assets you've been looking at sort of in the range of -- well, I'll stop the question there. 
James Flaherty: So what's the question? 
Robert Mains: The question's, what do you see, when you look at your pipeline, are valuations stabilizing, continuing to go up, what -- how would you kind of characterize things overall? 
James Flaherty: Again, I stand by my comments. The deal pipeline is quite robust. Good news for HCP. It cuts from left to right through our 5x5 model and from up to down through our 5x5 model. So we've got a number of opportunities that we're currently either diligence-ing or in dialogue on. I would say the following: I would say relative to a couple of years ago, there are more opportunities presenting themselves. And more in the case -- in the sense of A, absolute dollar value. More in the sense of B, just absolute number of transactions. And interestingly enough, C, more in the sense of different types of transactions. So that, again, I think that augurs well, given we've got our 5x5 model that cuts across a number of different property types in ways that HCP can in fact deploy our shareholders' capital. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then just focusing in a little bit on life science. You seem to -- you're doing some new construction. Are you seeing kind of a pickup in demand there? 
James Flaherty: I would say we're seeing -- we're having very good leasing results. Witness our all-time high occupancy at 12/31, which obviously is expected to, rolling forward 12 months, be at an even higher occupancy by the end of '13. I would say the demand is not the intensity or fever pitch demand that we saw kind of back in '06 and '07. I think a lot of these corporations are being a little more measured in terms of, A, how much space they want and B, where they want that space. So I would say it's -- I would say it's muted. It's positive, but it's muted, would be the way I'd describe it. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And your development in Cambridge, would you kind of view that as planting a flag on the East Coast from which you can expand or is it kind of more opportunistic? 
James Flaherty: Well, it's clearly opportunistic. I guess you could say it's planting a flag, but I'd hasten to make the point that it's quite a small flag. The total building is how many square feet? 
Paul Gallagher: It's 70,000 square feet. 
James Flaherty: Yes. So we'll see. We're very pleased with that opportunity. It was very opportunistic, but in the context of a platform or a flag or a stake in the ground, I think people ought to understand the overall size of it. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, it's more on the latter, it's more an opportunistic opportunity. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley. 
Paul Morgan: Just kind of sticking with the life science question there, maybe you could just -- in the context of your much bigger project in Oyster Point, I know you're kind of working through entitlements and everything now, but can you maybe talk a little bit about that? I mean, you are  having discussions with anchors, is there any possibility given -- maybe it's not quite as active as you'd like that it would not go life sciences given the strength of the market for traditional office out here? 
James Flaherty: Yes, Tim, why don't you maybe talk about where we are with the zoning on the -- this is The Cove property, Paul, you're referring to? And then maybe talk a little bit about the demand. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Paul, obviously, the property you mentioned is adjacent to our existing Oyster Point project. It can go either office. Currently, first of all, it's in the entitlement process. We anticipate completing that midyear. And we can do either office or lab in those buildings, as you know the makeup of that building -- the makeup of that type of the building is generally suburban office. It can go either way. So we continue to look at opportunities, both on the office and the life science side, and we'll be entitled for both in about -- in size-wise about 850,000 to 900,000 feet. 
Paul Morgan: Great. On the same-store performance, maybe just give me a little bit of color, so the adjusted NOI growth sequentially was 6.6%? You added, it looks like the Brookdale assets to the same-store pool. Give me a sense of some of the composition of that sequential growth, whether it is very strong growth from the newly added assets or step bumps from the existing assets that were already in the pool? 
Paul Gallagher: You going sequential quarter-over-quarter, Paul? 
Paul Morgan: Well, you've got 6.6% [indiscernible]. 
Paul Gallagher: Right. Right. It was primarily driven by our -- in senior housing by our transitioned assets that we transitioned away from Sunrise as well as performance in our Sunrise portfolio. 
Paul Morgan: Okay. I mean, given that, it seems like I mean, you do have pretty strong growth in the -- in your same-store guidance for senior housing for 2013. But maybe that was a pretty big step on a sequential basis or I mean, could we even see -- what would it take to even see above the high end of that? 
Paul Gallagher: Well, there's rent bumps in that fourth quarter, Paul. So you have a tendency to see more of our senior housing portfolio steps in the fourth quarter. So you have a tendency to see a higher sequential growth rate. So again, quarters are lumpy, but that's why the fourth quarter is a little larger than what you would see for the year. 
James Flaherty: But Paul, Paul Gallagher, mentioned the spot occupancy increases on our RIDEA JV, which is up 120 basis points, and our Sunrise mansions continue to perform quite well. So -- and then you saw the -- I think some of the summary of the Brookdale results, which came out last night. So again, in terms of positive trends, I don't recall a year feeling this good across the board as this one. You've got nice momentum in senior housing, particularly the metrics that got stronger during 2012 as the year went on. I've already alluded to some of the lift we're seeing at HCR in their fourth quarter results. The HCA results speak for themselves. And then -- so -- and you've got MOB and life science at all-time high occupancies, which are projected to go up from there, so. And again, this is against the backdrop of the 2012 Same Property Performance of 4.2%. In 2011, we were up 4%. And in 2010, we were up 4.8%. So we feel very, very good about not only where we've come from, but where we're going here the next 12, 18, 24 months. 
Paul Gallagher: But to give you a little bit more color, Paul, on the senior housing 2013 growth rate, it's contractual rent steps and continued outsized rent steps on our transitioned assets from Sunrise, to give you an idea going forward. 
Paul Morgan: Okay. Great. And just a quick last question on the acquisition/asset sales. I know that acquisitions aren't in guidance, but what are you thinking about it in terms of maybe asset sales over the course of the year? 
James Flaherty: Nothing aside from the one particular asset in our hospital space that Paul alluded to that's subject to a purchase option that's been exercised. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi. 
Quentin Velleley: Just in -- just sticking with asset sales, how  many assets sort of have these tenant purchase options in them similar to the Alabama assets? 
Paul Gallagher: Right now, we have one portfolio that's subject to a purchase option at the end of 2013. But our guidance takes into account either that's going to get negotiated for an extension or sale proceeds will be redeployed. And if -- no other real material purchase options in the near term. 
Quentin Velleley: Okay. And then just going back to life science, it sounds like you've got one major roll down, which will impact same-store results this year. I know you sort of spoke about this muted demand in the life science space. Are there other future roll downs we should be thinking about across some of -- I guess the secondary lifestyle asset -- sorry, life science assets? 
James Flaherty: No. No, in fact, I mean, if there would be, they'd be in our guidance. So there aren't any, so there aren't any in our guidance. But the January roll down, that was the space we've talked to you previously about, where Takeda came out of one of our South San Francisco properties and we moved them down into San Diego, albeit at a lower, at a rent roll down. So we moved some of that vacancy internally within our portfolio from North to South to accommodate a strategic move on the part of Takeda. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, just to put an order of magnitude on it, they were kind of at an all-time high rental rate in their space in South San Francisco at $5.50 a square foot, and we moved them down into San Diego, into pure office space where they're paying substantially less than that. 
Michael Bilerman: Jay, it's Michael Bilerman. Just wanted to come back to your comments sort of on the balance sheet and the credit ratings and certainly congratulations on being able to get the balance sheet and get the agencies to where they are. And I'm just curious as you talked about how your ratios are actually better than, I guess a Simon, EQR or Avalon -- I can't remember which one. 
James Flaherty: Federal Realty. 
Michael Bilerman: Do you have any -- I guess of trying to be opportunistic and wanting to be opportunistic. Do you want your rating to move up and hamper you any way or do you actually prefer to sort of stay where you are and that way if you do, do some transactions you can sort of let leverage creep for a bit before you term it out and not have the hangover potentially of an A- rating? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think -- I think a couple of things. One, we want our actual metrics to be reflected appropriately with the ratings. So if you take a look right now at things like fixed charge coverage ratio, particularly if you look at the fourth quarter that Tim cuffed at 3.8x and you take a look at fourth quarter debt to EBITDA, which actually was slightly under 5.0, and you take a look at our secured debt ratio at 12/31, which is 8.6%, those are significantly better than the 2 weak single A-rated credit. And if you go back to my last 3 or 4 calls, I've consistently talked about our credit metrics in the context of them being weak single A credit metrics. So that's a fact. Now if the other side of the argument would be yes, but if you take a look at things like tenant concentration, HCP has a tenant concentration that's much more concentrated than the 2 single A-rated REITs that are above us, which I think is a legitimate point. So I think the way we look at it is, we've got tremendous momentum right now with our balance sheet. I think -- I believe that balance sheets are things to take advantage of and create shareholder value from and not things to put on a mantle and admire. And I think the fact that we've got the active deal environment that we're in right now with -- not just a balance sheet, a significant balance sheet capacity, Michael, but if you think about things like capacity to do incremental RIDEA transactions, we've got great, great swath of runway there. If you take a look at things like secured debt, because a lot of times when you make acquisitions, they come with secured debt on them. We're way down on our secured debt metric, and we don't have competing operating platforms in some of these sectors. So we're in a very interesting position on a number of fronts. You mentioned the balance sheet, but there's a number of other more subtle fronts that we're equally well-positioned in. 
Michael Bilerman: And then just thinking about sort of raising capital, you did sell some assets this quarter and you talked about LinkedIn and Google. Do you have a desire potentially to sort of monetize what I'd say is non health care-related leases or buildings to harvest and capitalize on that demand for those geographies and that credit? 
James Flaherty: If the economics were -- made sense for HCP's shareholders, absolutely. But given the absolute dollar amount of rents we've got coming to us from LinkedIn and Google, the escalators in those leases and then the underlying credit, those are very attractive to the extent that we love our assets, but we're not in love with our assets. So economically, it would have to make sense, Michael. 
Michael Bilerman: I'm just trying to think about it from raising equity in terms of, as you enlarge the equity base, perhaps there is this continuation of rotating -- just like you sold assets this quarter, pursuing more of that balanced strategy of tapping equity from your assets relative to diluting the entire organization, even if they are accretive transactions, you're obviously enlarging the equity base. 
James Flaherty: That would certainly be an arrow in our quiver as we look at the strategic universe of opportunities we have in front of us. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. 
Jack Meehan: Jay, you spoke about 90% of admissions for HCR are coming through hospitals. So with the HCR assets, 90% of admissions coming through hospitals. With your senior housing portfolio, have you looked into any opportunities to help structure ACO relationships across the continuum of care? And then what potential investments could that lead to? 
James Flaherty: This strategically becomes quite fascinating and while you may be new to our calls, I would just emphasize that our whole strategic direction in terms of the counterparties we want to be interacting with, they absolutely have to have the following 3 criteria: And the first and most important is quality outcomes. The second is critical mass. And that you should interpret that to be market share and local market share. That's why I talk about these cluster markets and density metrics. And then the third criteria is efficient operations, which is another way of margin, i.e., you've got to make money. So we aggressively seek out counterparties that have those 3 criteria, and we aggressively move counterparties that don't have even 1 of those 3 criteria out of our portfolio and off to the side. In a separate conversation, we can bring you up to speed as to who came in and who came out over the last 3 or 4 years. Now, however, we're moving into what I call kind of market-driven health care reform. And this is where footprints like HCR, like Brookdale, particularly with their ancillary revenue platform, like Emeritus, like Genesis, even to a certain extent, like Sunrise, although they're obviously lower acuity. That's where you're going to create some real value here, particularly as you drill into where you've got overlapping concentrations in specific markets. So we, to answer your question, we haven't made some introductions. We are not operators. But we have put a number of the folks in our portfolio together, discussions are ongoing, and I think they tend to be -- they tend to quickly move towards specific markets where there's overlaps, as opposed to entity-wide or enterprise-wide sorts of situations. I will also tell you that the other 2 types of organizations that are involved in those discussions are acute care hospitals, as well as payors, the HMO. So again, I'm -- personally, I'm fascinated to watch all this play out. But when you have a platform like HCR, who has 90% of its admissions coming from hospital discharges, those hospitals, you may have seen an article yesterday, there's an article that came out that talked about the punitive penalties that will come to fruition to the detriment of the acute care hospitals if patients are discharged and then they have to be readmitted. And this is where a quality partner like HCR -- and again, I would -- I have very good things to say about Genesis, too. But certainly, HCR, with their quality, their clinical, their commitment to clinical outcomes and their ability to partner with payors and hospitals in risk sharing schemes, that is really going to drive some value. And that is what will make our OpCo investment worth significantly more than what it is today in the coming years. So that's a little bit of kind of -- that's a '14, '15 sort of a view as to what's going to happen here. 
Jack Meehan: Yes. That's really interesting. I guess with health care just around -- with health care reform just around the corner in 2014, especially on the acute hospital side, we're in the camp at least that reform is going to be a major positive next year. Has your thought process changed around adding greater exposure there? Are you seeing any new opportunities in the market? And do think that helps you as you're going around, these changes we're seeing in the market? 
James Flaherty: Why, I think what helps us is making risk-adjusted accretive transactions. So again, we're -- we don't pretend to be operators. We are delighted to be riding in the passenger seat of a car that's driven by HCA or HCR or Brookdale or Emeritus, Genentech, Amgen. So where we can be helpful, I think, is being a good capital partner for their real estate needs. That's why if you take a look at our 2012 acquisition volume, that's why I made the point of emphasis that 87% of our 2012 acquisition volume was all repeat business with existing customers. So being responsive to the folks that are in our portfolio today and helping them with their real estate needs is absolutely our top priority. There is, quite frankly, a possibility, I think, in a couple of sectors, in acute care hospitals, Jack, is one of them, that you may see more opportunities for real estate exposure to come into the health care REIT domain, and obviously, we'll  -- if and when those occur, we would certainly look at those and evaluate those. 
Operator: You have a follow-up question from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Robert Mains: Yes, just a simple one. The 2 facilities sold for $111 million, I surmise from that dollar amount they are fairly large? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, they were. They were 2 very large senior housing IL and AL facilities. 
Robert Mains: Roughly, how many units were those? 
Paul Gallagher: I want to say about 250 units apiece. They're a fairly good size. 
Robert Mains: Okay. But they were rental model, they weren't entry fee. 
Paul Gallagher: No, it wasn't a CCRC, just large IL, AL. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Jana Galan: I wanted to ask, now that you've had your RIDEA investment for over a year, can you comment on if performance -- how your performance was versus your initial underwriting, and if the current dynamics within senior housing have you looking to kind of decrease the premium you require for RIDEA versus triple-net? 
James Flaherty: I think -- at the time we made our -- at the time we bought the joint venture partner out at the 7% cap rate and had moved that over to Brookdale, we indicated it would be -- based on our discussion with Brookdale, an 18-month plus or minus timeframe to transition the properties to Brookdale from Horizon Bay and put the necessary CapEx in that Brookdale felt was appropriate to capitalize on the opportunity. We are now -- I think, we announced that deal, Jana, in September of '11. So we're still a couple of months shy of that 18-month window which we had indicated to The Street would be all about transitioning and getting the portfolio up to speed. We're quite pleased with where we are today. I think Paul cuffed the fourth quarter increase in occupancy for that portfolio, which was 120 basis points. So we would expect in 2013 that, that will have a nice result for our shareholders. But we did experience drag from that portfolio in 2012, which was expected at the time we announced the transaction. So that's the answer to the first part of your question. With respect to the second part of your question, no, I don't think there's anything that we've seen that would cause us to change our underwriting discipline. I think the headline here is that if we can achieve RIDEA-like NOI growth without the RIDEA operating risk, that's first prize. And obviously, we are able to achieve that in a very, very significant measure with our October 31, 2012, closing on the Blackstone JV with Emeritus. We may do some more of that, we may do some more RIDEA, but it will all be in the context of looking at risk-adjusted returns. 
Jana Galan: And then maybe just on the life science, I was curious in conversations with your tenants and prospective tenants, are they concerned about cuts to NIH funding and is that part of the muted demand outlook? 
James Flaherty: Let me have our prior head of our life science platform take that question. Tim? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. We have very little exposure to tenants with NIH funding. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Karin Ford: The $0.02 better accretion that you're getting in the Emeritus portfolio, is that solely due to NOI being better than you expected or did better-than-expected financing help that as well? 
James Flaherty: The latter. 
Karin Ford: The latter, okay, so... 
James Flaherty: Karin, -- it's really -- we've only had, I guess what, 60 days of actual results. So even if -- it would be difficult for anything to change just in 60 days, but the financing terms, particularly the debt that we had used to indicate the accretion upon announcement on that transaction, we greatly exceeded to the benefit of HCP shareholders. 
Karin Ford: Makes sense. Next question is on the MOB portfolio, with occupancy at a 6-year high, is it possible that you might see market rent growth start to accelerate there, given Obamacare and some positive demand dynamics in that business? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think -- the best -- our best and most current view on that, Karin, would be to have Paul -- what did you have for Same Property Performance guidance for '13 in MOBs? It is up to your point, Karin. Let me hear... 
Paul Gallagher: 3.25% to 4.25%. 
James Flaherty: So we're expecting at the midpoint, Same Property Performance MOBs to be 3.75% and that would compare to -- what for all of 2012? 
Paul Gallagher: 2.7%. 
James Flaherty: So it's up over 100 basis points right there, Karin. So I think directionally, you're onto something there. And we'll watch that as the year unfolds. 
Karin Ford: Okay. And then last question, could you just handicap what you think the outcome is likely to be with the 3 Tenet hospitals, whether you think they'll purchase, renew or move on? 
James Flaherty: We generally don't like to talk about transactions that haven't been announced yet. But that portfolio is an interesting portfolio. Those 3 hospitals were part of the original -- I'm going to date some of you on this call here, get ready. When American Medical International created a REIT in the early 1990s, called American Health Properties, they seeded that REIT with some of their acute care hospital portfolio. In 1999, HCP acquired that REIT, and that is how these 3 hospitals came on to the balance sheet of HCP. These 3 hospitals are subject to leases that were struck back in the early '90s, and at this point, all 3 of these hospitals are generating below market rent. If we really wanted to take a razor-sharp pencil to our non-stabilized pool, you could intellectually make the argument that these 3 hospitals ought to be included in that non-stabilized portfolio. So we view this as a win-win for HCP, either one or more of the hospital rents will be moved to market, which will be accretive to our shareholders, or these 3 hospitals will be acquired by Tenet, and it's at a fair market value purchase option and we'll have the opportunity to reinvest those proceeds in -- and get something that's more equivalent to tuck [ph] -- some market returns. So we're kind of indifferent with respect to the outcome. Tenet has done a nice job of -- on a number of internal and strategic moves, and their cost of capital, like many of our counterparties, has improved. And they did a debt transaction actually just last week. So we're really outcome-indifferent there, but we do think, either way, it's going to be a win-win for HCP shareholders. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets. 
Joshua Patinkin: Josh Patinkin. Most of my questions have been answered, but I do want to ask you a question, Jay, about just big picture $31 billion enterprise value you mentioned. Is it a fair way of thinking about these -- the largeness of you and some of the others in your sector that you're transitioning from kind of an earnings growth vehicle to a credit enhancement vehicle? And I know it's not all of that, it's somewhere in between. But is that how the sector might transition over the next 5 years as you get bigger and bigger? 
James Flaherty: I'm not sure. Explain a little bit more what you mean by transitioning. I get -- I understand what earnings growth is. What do you mean by credit enhancing vehicle? I'm not sure I understand it. 
Joshua Patinkin: You just got upgraded by S&P. I think that's who it was, jotting down my notes here. And so your cost of capital is getting cheaper, and so that thereby you get growth from a cheaper cost of capital as opposed to just pure NOI cap rate type growth. 
James Flaherty: Well, I think it's probably a bit of both. I think -- where were we? I guess we were down in NAREIT in San Diego in November and I was on a panel with George and Debbie, I'd made the point that I felt that all the health care REITs, not just HCP, but all the health care REITs, were underrated relative to their credit metrics. There's, obviously, been some positive news since I made those comments in November. My guess is there'll be some more positive news in the space. But I don't think -- I don't see that, Rich (sic) [Josh], as an end of itself. I think of that as a means and because now, for every dollar of incremental acquisition, if we have a lower cost of capital, they'll be more accretive to our shareholders. Much like -- I go back to my comments on our operating efficiency and our G&A. We now have a platform that's very well built out. So the incremental dollar of the acquisition volume, we don't need to add a new management team or new sector management or what have you. We've got a lot of critical mass. So if anything, I actually think -- the more I think about your question, Rich (sic) [Josh], I think it actually accelerates the first part, which is the earnings growth as opposed to I think the credit enhancement, more efficient operations, squeezing more juice out of the portfolio, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, commitment to sustainability. I think all of those things are going to come together to make certainly HCP, as I can't speak for my peers, but certainly HCP's earnings potential that much more attractive. 
Joshua Patinkin: Okay. And then is there a way, or would you be interested in, if there was a way, to increase your stake in OpCo, HCR ManorCare OpCo? And -- or get more into the operating and management side of the business with the blurring of the lines in real estate that we're seeing today? 
James Flaherty: Yes. I don't think you want to confuse us with operators. So blurred lines into operations is not kind of our -- I don't think that's where we create value. Timing-wise, it would be -- as I've just taken you through the metrics, I mean, you're at an inflection point, in my view, in the HCR business model, and the 1 or 2 models away from them that share similar sorts of dynamics, which are commitment to clinical, high-quality, clinical outcomes, a large percent -- a disproportionately large percent of your admissions coming from acute care hospitals, things like that. So I think from a timing standpoint, much like I predicted 1.5 years ago, that you're going to see coverages come down. I think now you're on the backside of that cycle. So from a timing standpoint, a think it would be good. I think we are sensitive to REIT rules and things of that nature, which should pretty much keep us at the under the 9.9% number. And I'd also add that, recall that our true economic basis in that investment is effectively 0 because recall that at the time of closing on the HCR transaction, we exercised the call option on the share block that had gone to the private equity firm that we acquired that from. And there was a big pop between the price of the shares at the time we announced the deal versus the time we closed. And we, obviously, exercised that option and the value that we've created there for shareholders for HCP, we effectively reinvested in OpCo. So the true economic basis in that OpCo investment as opposed to the accounting basis is next to nothing. 
Joshua Patinkin: Last question is you how do you feel about HCN having ownership stake in the management company that runs your Sunrise portfolio? 
James Flaherty: I'm very relaxed about that. I mean, I think good people do good things. I think our Sunrise Mansions -- I don't know if we have highlighted or called the performance of our mansions out. If it's not, we can think about that maybe in the supplemental. But they're performing quite well. They're north of 91% occupied. And we couldn't be more pleased with the momentum we have in that mansion product. Recall some of our earlier discussions about moving the BGs, the Brighton Gardens and those things to some of our other partners. And George Chapman runs a very good shop, so we're -- and KKR. They're looking to maximize value for the investments. So we're quite relaxed on all those fronts. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nic Yulico with Macquarie. 
Nicholas Yulico: Just had a question on senior housing. I'm wondering how you're thinking about -- particularly related to the Emeritus-type investment you made last year. If generally, senior housing operators seem to be putting up same-store NOI growth that's well in excess of 4%. What is the real capacity out there for you to continue doing more of these triple-net type investments, where you're perhaps putting up 4% plus type escalators? 
James Flaherty: Well, when you say capacity, from HCP's standpoint, the capacity to do that is just short of unlimited, right? Given the balance sheet, horsepower we've got right now, and given the fact that we've got a de minimis amount of exposure to RIDEA and given the fact that we've got industry-leading, low secured debt exposure. So from our standpoint, the capacity is in the multiples of billions of dollars. It takes 2 to tango, so you'd have to have a counterparty or counterparties, plural, that were prepared to move forward on a similar transaction. And that really remains to be seen. So I think that would be a way to answer that question, Nic. 
Nicholas Yulico: Yes, I guess I was just wondering as far as -- in relation to operators, whether this is a type -- because we're in still, I think, early stages of senior housing recovery, whether operators these days might be able to -- be willing to absorb higher type of escalation in rents in kind of the next couple of years than we've be traditionally seen? 
James Flaherty: I think it depends a little bit on the nature of the owner. I think in the transactions that we've reviewed in the last couple of years, I would tell you, I think, the private equity capital is probably a little less willing to accept some of those fixed escalators, where the -- versus the operators, particularly the operators that have well built out platforms and are in some of these markets and maybe are a little closer to what's going on from an operating performance standpoint. I think they're a little more willing to do that. That would be the way I'd kind of -- I kind of bifurcate the pool of prospective sellers into those 2 buckets, Nic. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Jay, I wanted to go back to Medicare for just a brief second. 
James Flaherty: Do you mean HCR? 
Omotayo Okusanya: I'm sorry, HCR for a brief second. You talked about the recovery [ph] ratios kind of stabilizing from this point on. But I guess what I'm struggling with is, when I look forward and we just kind of went through these therapy cuts from the Tax Relief Act, we possibly have sequestration coming up, 2% cut, possibly there won't be a market basket update this year given the need to balance the budget. I mean, what's the offsetting factor that HCR is going to be doing to kind of offset all these things and still have steady or improving coverage? 
James Flaherty: Well, let's take them one at a time. Unlike a number of its peers, HCR has very, very little outpatient therapy, Tayo, to start with. So to the extent there's much there, any additional cuts there will be more than offset by continued growth in the other HCR business lines as well as the delay in sequestration. But I think people ask us about the property level coverage versus the entity level coverage. The reason why we are so focused on entity level coverage is there's a lot more here than just the skilled nursing post-acute. You've got 2 other lines of business, one being assisted living, with the Arden Court product, which is positioned to almost exclusively in the dementia memory care. And I think you've got better than most a good idea as to what the demand drivers and performance drivers are in dementia memory care right now. And then you've got home, health and hospice, which had a very, very good year. So you got a lot coming together. Those are very, very helpful, particularly right now. The real driver is going to be when in '14 and in '15, when HCR unveils some of the fully built out tactics and strategies in their cluster markets that they're in the process of doing pilot concepts on right now with United Healths of the world and people like that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Carroll: [indiscernible] RIDEA investments interest you more? Or are you seeing better opportunities in? The ones that are similar to the HCR deal or like the senior housing structure? 
James Flaherty: Mike, the first part of your question got cut off. Could you take it from the top, and then we can answer. 
Michael Carroll: Yes, sure. What type of RIDEA investments interest you more, or you seeing better opportunities in the ones that are similar to the HCR deal or the senior housing investments? 
James Flaherty: Okay. Well, HCR is most definitely not a RIDEA transaction, that's a triple net lease with fixed escalators with corporate entity guarantees and things like that. Separate and apart from that, as I just mentioned, we do have a small minority interest in the OpCo. But as I mentioned to you, that came to us effectively in a trade for some economics, so that our economic basis in that investment is next to 0. That is not a RIDEA exposure, that's a triple net exposure. The only true RIDEA exposure we have would be our joint venture with Brookdale. And that concerns 21 properties. And I think Paul talked to you in his formal remarks with some of the momentum we have right there, right now in terms of senior housing gains. So you bring all that back, first prize for us is we get upsized economics with downsized risk, we've been able to do that on some very large transactions in the last couple of years. But we're obviously aware of the market and what's going on there. So we look at everything the same way. We look at everything on a risk-adjusted basis and when the returns are there and they're accretive to FAD so that we can continue to grow the dividend and move into the 29th year next year of dividend increases, we'll pull the trigger. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then in your earlier comments, you said transaction activity remains strong. Do you still expect that 2013 activity will exceed the 2012 activity? 
James Flaherty: Yes, I said transaction -- I don't think I used the transaction, I think I used the words deal environment and I specifically talked about the dialogue. The dialogue, again, which generally tends to be a pretty good leading indicator, I don't think there's any question that the dialogue right now -- the dollar values involved with the acquisition dialogue that's out there are significantly in excess of where they were a year ago. Now what if any of that translates from deal discussion to actual deals remains to be seen. But I was very specific about how I described the current environment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill. 
James Milam: My first question actually, just 2 quick ones on HCR ManorCare. What is the corporate debt structure at ManorCare? I guess how much debt outstanding do they have under the Fixed-or-Floating Rate, do you know? 
James Flaherty: You've got 2 debt facilities there. You've got a term loan and then you've got a $175 million line of credit. The $175 million line of credit has reserved against it, $75 million of letters of credit. So there's availability there that is meant to support, if needed, $75 million of lines of credit. So $75 million of -- sorry, letters of credit. So you've got an availability of $100 million at 12/31. At 12/31, the company was sitting on $120 million of cash. Away from that, the term loan -- Tim, do you have some details on the term loan? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, they have a $395 million term loan, and that's at 5%. 
James Milam: It's fixed at 5%? 
Timothy Schoen: It’s actually LIBOR plus 3.50 but it has a floor. So it's effectively 5%, James. 
James Milam: Got it. Okay. And what's the maturity on that? 
Timothy Schoen: I'm going to say, it's up 4, 5 years -- I think 4 or 5 years from today. 
James Milam: Okay. Great. And then, we look at EBITDARM and then also EBITDAR coverage ratios. I guess I'm assuming -- or I'll ask, what do you guys assume for a management fee to get to EBITDAR from EBITDARM and how does that compare to the way you think about HCR ManorCare's corporate overhead? And the real question there is the profitability when we get concerned about the EBITDAR coverage ratio, but what's really the profitability behind that? 
Timothy Schoen: We assume a 5% management fee when calculating that EBITDAR number.
 But they run about 100 basis points lower than that. 
James Flaherty: They're not running at 32 basis points of G&A but they're pretty lean, mean fighting machine. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. 
Todd Stender: Guys, you mentioned HCR ManorCare funded $100 million of maintenance CapEx in 2012. Is there a contractual obligation that they'll have  to spend this year and are you able to quantify anything like that? 
James Flaherty: Well, absolutely. It's in -- the lease requires them to fund how much in terms of maintenance? 
Timothy Schoen: About $50 million a year, and they've doubled that. 
James Flaherty: Yes, so the takeaway there, Todd, was that in 2012, they actually funded, double the amount, the required amount that was in our lease and that required amount, that doesn't go away, that's in our lease every year. 
Timothy Schoen: And about 1/3 of that capital, Todd, was to expand the existing portfolio and expand their operations. 
Todd Stender: Okay. So anything above $50 million is discretionary on their part? 
Timothy Schoen: That's right. 
James Flaherty: With an eye towards building out their portfolio in anticipation of some of these strategic opportunities that they expect will present themselves with some of the themes I've already talked on this call. 
Todd Stender: Okay, I think that's a good point. They have obviously, have good visibility on where their business is going. 
James Flaherty: They've been doing it for 3 decades. They know what they're doing. 
Todd Stender: Just lastly, any update on the potential timing of when you'll make the Tandem Health Care loan, I think, it's $105 million, that could be as early as next month. 
James Flaherty: No, I think -- that's all contractual. I think it's August, right? 
Timothy Schoen: Right. That's right. 
James Flaherty: Is it August, or is it [indiscernible]. 
Todd Stender: Is it not as early as March? 
Paul Gallagher: They can take it down early, but they have until August of this year. 
James Flaherty: If they elect to take it down. 
Todd Stender: At all. Okay. And does the interest rate change on that throughout this year or was that rate locked when you made the commitment? 
James Flaherty: Yes, the rate was locked when we made the commitment. The second tranche was funded 14%. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: Just a couple of quick ones here. On -- if we're looking at the medical office portfolio and life sciences, what's embedded in your outlook for occupancy change and lease spreads? 
James Flaherty: I don't think we disclosed our projected occupancies, Michael. We do -- just for Michael's benefit, the same product performance for medical office, we've cuffed this year at a range between 3.25% and 4.25%, so you got a midpoint there, Michael, of up 3.75% for medical office and for life science, if you assume, you've got to counteract a lot of the onetime positive developments that happened in '12. If you want to take this out, you're looking at up 1% to up 2%, same product performance in life science. I would tell you that we anticipate both those portfolios having higher occupancy at 12/31/2013 than they certainly had at 12/31/2012. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Trizulio [ph] with Bank of America. 
Unknown Analyst: I appreciate the comments and response to Michael Bilerman's question on leverage. You mentioned that you have some excess RIDEA capacity, some excess secured debt capacity. That kind of leads me to think of Brookdale, and listening to their call today, much of that call was spent on a potential real estate transaction. Given your current relationship with them, do you think that puts you at any type of significant advantage versus other potential buyers if the transaction were to move forward? 
James Flaherty: Tom, I appreciate the question, I appreciate why you're asking the question, but we have kind of a long-standing policy. We just don't comment on -- we're delighted to kind of take you through chapter and verse on any deals that we've announced, but we just do not comment at all on prospective transaction activity. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And you talked about the work you've done to the balance sheet, which has been pretty dramatic and obviously, has resulted in much tighter spreads on your debt as well. But in addition to the metrics you mentioned, I think that lack of RIDEA, or the excess RIDEA capacity as you put it, is one of the big credit benefits that fixed-income investors see in your credit. Can you talk about kind of weighing that versus a potential -- potentially expanding that and taking advantage of some of the market movements you talked about earlier? 
James Flaherty: Yes. I mean, we would definitely. These credit rating upgrades are -- they don't roll-off the table easily. So I think we're very sensitive about the progress we've made there, and kind of detailed. And you probably got a better sense than almost anybody in this call, Tom, as to how much better those credit metrics are than a composite of BBB+ rated grade [ph] credits, which is why I've been talking about weak single A metrics. But certainly, we would take all that into consideration, and again, we like RIDEA-type returns without the RIDEA-type risks. So as jumping off point, that's step one, to the extent  we go down the RIDEA route, it would have to compensate us for all the risks, which include, but don't stop at operating risk but also to the extent anything would change in our capital structure. But I think it's very unlikely you're going to see us do anything dramatic to our balance sheet. We are -- everything we underwrite is at a 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity capital structure. So we're not big fans of secured debt. Sometimes you got to bring it on as part of a transaction. But you saw what we did with the Blackstone JV where all that secured debt went away at closing. So we're pretty sensitive about our credit metrics. 
Unknown Analyst: Great. And then one quick follow-on, I think the increased prevalence of these RIDEA deals getting done says something about your peers', your competitors', whatever you want to call them, outlook on senior housing and willing to take on more risk. Do you think the inverse can be said about the operators, in that maybe doing RIDEA deals as opposed to fixed rate increase, triple net lease deals says something about their outlook on their business? 
James Flaherty: Well, again, I don't think you can generalize. I think every deal dynamic has its own unique set of statistics. I have described in the past the Nirvana scenario for a private equity investor that had an existing investment in a senior housing portfolio. And Nirvana was -- able -- the ability to bifurcate the existing C corp investment into PropCo, OpCo, monetize to PropCo at an attractive valuation, but monetize it at an attractive valuation without the existence of a triple net lease, which requires, Tom, not only the fixed escalators that you've talked about, but also requires them to shoulder the liability for the CapEx. Whereas in a RIDEA, I think people oftentimes focus on just the escalators. But that CapEx liability journals over to the balance sheet from the operator to the landlord in a RIDEA structure. So that's why we look at all those with all those factors involved. But again, I think it's -- I wouldn't start generalizing. I think every deal has got its own sort of pace and unique set of characteristics. I think you got to look at them on a one-off basis. 
Operator: I will now like to turn today's call back over to Jay Flaherty, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. 
James Flaherty: Okay. Thanks, everybody for your time. I know today was a busy earnings day, so happy Valentine's Day, and we'll be seeing a number of you shortly on the conference circuit. Take care. Thank you.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-10-30 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suzette, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]  Now, I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Suzette. Good afternoon and good morning. Some of the statements made during today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, including the statements about our guidance. These statements are made as of today's date and reflect the company's good faith, beliefs and best judgment based upon currently available information.

We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as well as certain related disclosures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, each of which has been furnished to the SEC today and is available on our website at www.hcpi.com.
 I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, John. Welcome to HCP's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen. 
 Let me start by expressing our concern for all those impacted by Hurricane Sandy, especially those seniors residing in our communities. We have had our emergency team in place since last Wednesday, coordinating response and assistance with our operators and tenants. At this point, we have a multitude of communities experiencing leaks and minor flooding and several properties operating on backup generator power. Hardest hit were 2 Sunrise communities in Brooklyn, one of which was evacuated yesterday, and the other where the residents have been moved to the second floor due to flooding. All of the residents are okay.
 With that, we have much to update you on. So let's start by turning the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. Today, I will cover 4 topics: Third quarter results; investment transactions; financing activities and balance sheet; and finally, our updated 2012 guidance. 
 Let me start with our third quarter results. Our same property portfolio again produced solid results, generating a 3.6% cash NOI growth compared to the third quarter last year. The results were driven by contractual rent increases from our triple net leases and occupancy gains in our life science and medical office portfolios. 
 Our quarterly same property results now include the triple-net master leased HCR ManorCare portfolio consisting of 334 properties. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes. 
 For the third quarter, we reported FFO of $0.67 per share, which included a noncash impairment of $8 million or $0.02 per share, resulting from the sale of a land parcel in Poway, California. This sale was part of a larger transaction with our tenant, General Atomics, which meaningfully expanded our relationship to 396,000 square feet under long-term leases through 2024. The transaction monetized in place into development a total of 26 acres of land, allowing us to stabilize additional non-income producing assets. Excluding the $0.02 impairment, FFO as adjusted for the quarter was $0.69 per share and FAD was $0.55 per share. 
 Switching to investment transactions. During the third quarter and through October, we executed on $2.3 billion of investments. First, we announced an accretive $1.78 billion senior housing portfolio acquisition that included 133 properties master leased to Emeritus on a long-term triple net basis valued at $1.73 billion, and a 4-year loan of $52 million secured by 9 properties concurrently being purchased by Emeritus. We expect to close on substantially all of the real estate assets as early as tomorrow, depending on the impact of the storm. This timing is approximately one month sooner than previously anticipated. 
 Second, we closed the acquisitions previously announced in July totaling $486 million, including 1.2 million square feet of on-campus MOBs and the mezzanine loan facility with Tandem Health Care. We made additional funding of development and capital projects totaling $63 million during the quarter. 
 Turning now to financing activities and balance sheet. On the capital markets front, during the last 4 months, we raised total proceeds of $1.5 billion in the equity and credit markets. On October 19, we issued 22 million shares of common stock, generating proceeds of $979 million. During the third quarter, we raised $515 million of debt capital consisting of $300 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 3.15% and GBP 137 million or $215 million 4-year term loan at a fixed rate of 1.81%. Proceeds from these transactions were used to fund the cash consideration for our recently completed acquisitions, including using the term loan that currency hedge our U.K. debt investments in Four Seasons Health Care. 
 The remaining proceeds totaling $1.1 billion represent the 60% equity component of the $1.78 billion purchase price for our senior housing acquisition. In doing so, we've achieved the equity component of our 60% equity and 40% debt long-term financing plan just minutes after announcing the acquisition. 
 Turning to our credit metrics. At quarter end, our financial leverage was stable at 40%, and secured debt ratio improved to 9.1%. Fixed charge coverage for the 9-month period through September increased to 3.5x. Year-to-date, we have achieved a significant reduction in our cost of capital, allowing us to opportunistically capture over 300 basis points in lower borrowing costs upon the refinancing of debt and preferred stock totaling $546 million. This, combined with the accretive acquisition of a large unencumbered senior housing portfolio financed with attractive long-term capital, further strengthens our credit profile. Upon closing, our secured debt ratio will drop below 8.5%. And the trailing 12-month fixed charge coverage will trend at 3.7x. 
 We have no scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of 2012. And looking into 2013, our debt maturities total $873 million at an average rate of 5.9%, of which $150 million is due in the first quarter of 2013. 
 Finally, our updated 2012 guidance. As a reminder, we provided full year guidance 2 weeks ago, including raising our cash Same Property Performance, FFO as adjusted and FAD per share metrics and lowering NAREIT FFO per share due to acquisition-related items in the fourth quarter and the impairment charge mentioned earlier. 
 Let me take a moment to update our projections from 2 weeks ago. First, our new guidance assumes the closing of the Blackstone JV acquisition to occur one month sooner than previously anticipated. As a result, we are raising our earnings projections to reflect the additional accretion and reduced negative carry in the fourth quarter. We are increasing our FFO guidance by $0.03 per share to a range of $2.68 to $2.74 per share. Our FFO guidance includes the impact of acquisition-related items, preferred stock redemption charge and impairments totaling $0.07 per share. Excluding these items, we expect 2012 FFO as adjusted to range from $2.75 to $2.81 per share, which is $0.01 higher than our October 16 guidance. We are also raising our FAD guidance by $0.01 to range from $2.20 to $2.26 per share. In addition, we are tightening projected cash Same Property growth to a range of 4% to 4.5%. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Before I review HCP's third quarter portfolio performance, I'd note HCR ManorCare is now included in our quarterly Same Property Performance results, bringing HCP's same store portfolio to 94% of all investments. 
 Senior housing. Occupancy in our same property senior housing platform was 85.3%, a 20 basis point sequential decrease over the prior quarter and a 40 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Excluding HCR's 66 assisted-living and memory care facilities now in the senior housing same-store portfolio, occupancy for the senior housing portfolio was 85.7%, a 20 basis point sequential decrease over the prior quarter and a 30 basis point improvement versus the prior year. 
 Same-store cash flow coverage for the portfolio declined 1 basis point to 1.12x, driven by outsized fixed rent bumps on our transitioned assets and higher property expenses in our Brookdale portfolio. Current quarter year-over-year same-property cash NOI was up 2.1%. Growth was driven by rent steps including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators, offset by the collection of additional rents in 2011 for one Sunrise portfolio. Net of this nonrecurring item, NOI increased 3.2%. 
 Occupancy for our RIDEA JV for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012, is 86.1%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, average third quarter occupancy increased 90 basis points over second quarter average occupancy. 
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. Coverage metrics in our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio now reflect 3 quarters of lower reimbursement rates under RUGs-IV. For the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, 2012, HCR's fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.29x, a 15 basis point decrease. Rolling forward, for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2012, the fixed charge coverage was 1.21x, which included an increase of $39 million in reserves for insurance claims for the years 2006 through 2010. Excluding this $39 million charge, the fixed charge coverage would be 1.29x. 
 Digging a little deeper into September's trailing 12-month results, HCR's operations generated over $130 million of cash flow after rent. For the same period, HCR invested $101 million or over $2,400 per bed in its facilities, which is almost twice the amount required under our master lease. This significant reinvestment by HCR in our assets reflects the confidence HCR has in its business model.
 Cash flow coverage in our non-HCR SNF [ph] portfolio was 1.49x, a 9 basis point decrease versus the prior quarter and a 29 basis point decrease versus the prior year. Year-over-year, same-property cash NOI was up 3.6%, primarily driven by HCR's annual rent steps. 
 Hospitals. Same-property cash flow coverage increased 10 basis points to 4.83x, driven by strong performance at our Medical City Dallas and Tenant Hospitals. Year-over-year same-property cash NOI for the quarter increased 4.7%. 
 Subsequent to quarter end, Cirrus Health sold its interest in one of the surgical hospitals in HCP's loan collateral pool for $10 million. In addition, Cirrus has entered into a definitive agreement to sell a second surgical hospital with closing subject to regulatory approval. This sale is structured as an asset purchase, and proceeds are expected to be approximately $30 million. Together, the $40 million in net sale proceeds will reduce the carrying value on our Cirrus loan to $30 million. 
 Medical Office Buildings. Same-property cash NOI for the third quarter was up 2.8%. The growth was a result of normal rent steps coupled with increased occupancy versus the third quarter 2011. Our MOB occupancy for the third quarter increased 10 basis points to 91.5%. Excluding the impact of new acquisitions, occupancy would have been 91.9%. 
 During the quarter, tenants representing 615,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 418,000 related to previously occupied space. Our year-to-date average retention rate is 78.3%. 
 Renewals for the quarter occurred at 0.7% higher mark-to-market rents, with the average churn for new and renewal leases at 69 months. Our leasing pipeline remains strong with new and renewal prospects totaling over 1 million square feet, 45% above our remaining 2012 rollover exposure. 
 Life science. Occupancy for our life science portfolio increased 40 basis points to 90%, driven by new leasing in the Bay Area and San Diego. Same-property cash NOI was up 7% in the third quarter, driven by normal rent steps, the previously announced LinkedIn expansion on our Mountain View campus and a decrease in nonrecoverable expenses. 
 For the quarter, we completed 405,000 square feet of leasing, bringing the year-to-date total to 807,000 square feet, with a retention rate of 90.2%. 
 The life science development pipeline consists of 3 redevelopment projects totaling 166,000 square feet and 2 development projects totaling 185,000 square feet, with the total remaining funding requirements projected at $51 million. 
 A significant contribution to the third quarter's life science leasing total was a transaction with HCP's tenant, General Atomics, in Poway, California. The deal has 3 components: First, HCP agreed to sell 19 acres in Poway for $18.6 million. General Atomics will construct a corporate amenities facility on the site, which is adjacent to the buildings leased with HCP. Closing is expected by January 2013, and HCP recorded an $8 million impairment this quarter on the sale of the land. 
 Second, a blend and extend for 2 existing leases for 281,000 square feet, which lowered rents by approximately 16% in exchange for extending lease expirations on average 7.5 years to June 2024, with two 5-year renewal options. Importantly, we negotiated the elimination of the tenant's in-the-money purchase option. HCP provided no landlord-tenant improvements, and the new leases escalate at a fixed 3.25% annual rate. 
 Third, HCP will construct a new $23 million 115,000-square-foot building, 100% pre-leased to General Atomics with a projected delivery in July 2014. The new lease will also expire in June 2024 and will contain the same renewal options and also provide for 3.25% fixed annual rent steps. The projected initial return on cost on HCP's basis is 6%. This transaction reduces HCP's land exposure in Poway, creates a high-quality growing long-term income stream and expands HCP's relationship with General Atomics, the largest tenant in the Poway market by 30% from 281,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet by 2014. 
 Acquisitions. On October 16, HCP announced the 100 -- $1.73 billion acquisition of 133 senior housing communities from a joint venture between Emeritus and Blackstone. Emeritus will enter into a new triple-net master lease and will continue to operate the communities. Emeritus is obligated to spend $30 million for capital improvements during the first 2 years of the lease. This is in addition to $42 million already spent on the properties by the seller over the past 2 years. The lease yield in year one is 6.1%. We'll have a primary term of 15 years, and we'll have annual fixed rent increases that average 3.7% for the first 5 years. At the beginning of year 6, the rent on 34 leased-up assets will increase by the greater of 3% of the previous year's rent or fair market capped at 130% to capture potential upside from these nonstabilized assets. 
 Finally, as a part of this transaction, HCP will provide debt financing of $52 million to Emeritus for their acquisition of 9 remaining properties. 
 On July 31, 2012, HCP closed a $205 million mezzanine loan facility to an affiliate of Formation Capital as part of the recapitalization of its Tandem skilled nursing portfolio. The 68-property portfolio is 100% master leased to LaVie Care Centers, the operators of 208 skilled nursing facilities in the U.S. The loan will subordinate the $400 million in senior mortgage debt and $137 million in senior mezz debt and will be funded in 2 tranches: $100 million funded 2 months ago, at a 12% fixed rate; and $105 million second funding, at a 14% fixed rate. 
 The second tranche will be funded no later than August 31, 2013, and the proceeds will be used to pay down the senior mezz loan. The loan has a blended yield to maturity of 13%. The facility, which closed on July 31, has an initial term of 5 years. The 68-property portfolio located across 6 states has an occupancy of 93%, a quality mix of 52%, an NOI margin of 17%, and in-place rent coverage of 1.3x. This debt transaction provides HCP with an attractive risk-adjusted exposure at a 10.5% rent yield to last dollar investment. 
 Sustainability. HCP was named sector leader in the health care hospitality sector for the 2012 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark survey. We were also designated as a Green Star, the highest designation in the survey. 
 Separately, the FTSE Group, the global leader in providing index and analytical solutions, added HCP to their Socially Responsible Investment Index series, which includes The Global Benchmark, U.S. benchmark and U.S. 100 Index series. These indices measure the performance of companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. 
 Our response to the carbon disclosure projects 2012 investor questionnaire generated a very favorable result for a first-time respondent. During the quarter, we received an additional 2 ENERGY STAR labels in our medical office portfolio, bringing HCP's total ENERGY STAR labels to 77. 
 HCP's best practices, implementation and investment in energy-saving technology resulted in continued positive economic results. On a same-property basis, utility expenses were down $578,000 versus the third quarter of 2011 and $1.2 million on a year-to-date basis. 
 With that, I'd like to turn it back to Jay. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Paul. Too frequently, the quarterly earnings call process nearly focuses on the past quarter rather than providing perspective across multiple quarters. As background for my remarks today, I want to highlight comments from our 4 prior quarterly calls. 
 A year ago on, our Q3 2011 call, I detailed HCP's philosophy of utilizing RIDEA structures for senior housing investments. To compensate for the additional risks of cash flow uncertainty and CapEx liability with RIDEA structures, we expect a premium over the return achievable through a triple-net structure. Said differently, we prefer negotiated, accretive, triple-net acquisitions of unencumbered real estate with creditworthy counterparties. 
 On our Q4 call of last year, I anticipated substantial M&A operator consolidation across each of our property types in the coming years as real health care reform began to take shape in the marketplace. 
 On our first quarter call of this year, with significant activity sourced by our proprietary 5x5 business model, I noted the steps we have taken to prepare our balance sheet for increased transaction volumes and meaningfully reduce our cost of capital by repricing our $1.5 billion line of credit and reducing our leverage ratio to historically low levels. 
 On the very same call, in response to an analyst question regarding our then relatively low level of acquisition activity, I referenced Ted Williams' famous advice of, needing to wait for the right pitch. I also placed a priority on monetizing our nonstabilized investment portfolio. 
 And on our second quarter call, 3 months ago, I noted the increasingly attractive outlook from making accretive acquisitions and predicted that HCP's quarterly deal volumes would ramp sequentially during 2012. 
 Let me now tie these perspectives together with our recent accomplishments. One, we finally got the pitch we were waiting for, and it was a fastball, right down the middle of the plate. HCP's $1.73 billion acquisition of the Blackstone-Emeritus JV was a negotiated transaction of 133 senior housing communities, with significant upside leased to Emeritus in a triple-net structure. This portfolio will be acquired on an unencumbered basis, provides attractive annual escalators and our fair market value rent reset in 5 years on the 34 lease-up communities. 
 The transaction allows Emeritus to secure the long-term management of these properties; generates proceeds to Emeritus of $140 million, which significantly increases their credit profile; and provides funding for an incremental $30 million CapEx investment by Emeritus for this portfolio. 
 By pre-funding the equity component of the purchase price 2 weeks ago, HCP locked in substantial earnings accretion for 2013 which will grow over time. 
 I want to express my appreciation for the extraordinary, diligent and cooperative efforts of the Blackstone, Emeritus, Chicago Title and HCP business and legal teams, which results in our ability to close a transaction of this size just 2 weeks after it was announced.
 Two, we are pleased to have made progress monetizing what we referred to as our nonstabilized bucket of investments. Agreements to generate $40 million of proceeds against our $69 million Cirrus loan were entered into this month, and we expect being able to report additional paydowns in the future. 
 In addition, this quarter's General Atomics transaction extends existing lease term, eliminates purchase options and monetizes a portion of our San Diego County landholdings. We anticipate additional monetization of our land inventory in 2013. 
 Three, our 5x5 model continues to be especially active, with dialogue across each of our investable targets. Year-to-date announced acquisitions are $2.5 billion and have grown sequentially by quarter throughout the year. This $2.5 billion in transaction volume represents a 13% increase in assets under management since year end 2011.
 Four, among a number of sustainability accomplishments, we are thrilled to have been named sector leader for the 2012 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark survey. This recognition represents the successful effort and ongoing commitment of a number of HCP colleagues to our various sustainability initiatives.
 Finally, with regards to our HCP colleagues, like every organization, HCP takes great pride in the accomplishments and value add of our talented team members. 2 weeks ago, Merrill Lynch's global research team noted that our market cap per employee was the highest in the REIT sector, an astonishing $175 million of market cap per employee. One would expect nothing less from a bunch of dividend aristocrats and sustainability sector leaders. 
 With that, we're delighted to take your questions. Suzette? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Michael Carroll. 
Michael Carroll: In the acquisition market today, how many of these, I guess, large portfolio deals are still available? 
James Flaherty: Time will tell, Michael. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then related to the Emeritus and Blackstone deal, I think the press release indicated that will close in phases. Can you kind of give us more color on how large each phase will be? 
James Flaherty: Well again, in my comments of just a minute or 2 ago, I noted the rather extraordinary efforts that have been put forth by the business and legal teams at Blackstone, Emeritus, Chicago Title and HCP. And it now looks, as we sit here today, that we have a very good chance of closing the entire transaction tomorrow, which, when you think about a transaction that was just signed and announced 2 weeks ago, and it's $1.73 billion in total transaction value, representing 133 separate properties, is an absolutely extraordinary accomplishment. 
Michael Carroll: Yes, that would be pretty quick. And then related to, I guess, Jay, your comments that you would monetize more land in 2013, do you mean you'd start more developments or there is more outright land sales? 
James Flaherty: It could take either path. 
Michael Carroll: So it's a combination that you're thinking right now? 
James Flaherty: I said it could take either path. 
Michael Carroll: Okay, great. And then related to the General Atomics transaction, did you buy another land parcel to do that development? 
James Flaherty: No, no, that was part of our initial landholding when we acquired Slough back in August of 2007, and we have, over time, grown our relationship with General Atomics, which obviously is experiencing a very, very favorable demand for its products. And so we've grown that over time rather consistently, and now we're up to 400,000 square feet if you include the [indiscernible] building that we'll be bringing online. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then what am I missing from the previous supplement? It said that you had land held for development of 182 acres, and now it says you have 174 acres, and in the press release, you've indicated that you sold
 consistently, and now we're up to 400,000 square feet if you include the build-to-suit building that we'll be bringing online. 
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then what am I missing from the previous supplement? It said that you had land held for development of 182 acres, and now it says you have 174 acres, and in the press release, you've indicated that you sold 19 acres to General Atomics. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Mike, it's Tim Schoen. There's another -- that sale actually will be effectuated in the fourth quarter so that will come off our landholdings by the end of the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Philip Martin. 
Philip Martin: You noted in your remarks that their investment level going forward is going to be significantly larger than what's mandated under the terms. Number one, is that a surprise to you? And can you give us a bit more detail, I mean, the investment sounds more than just cosmetic or maintenance. Is the investment more representative of a repositioning play with respect to certain assets that may improve the risk and reward profile underlying valuations? Just want a bit more detail on those comments. 
James Flaherty: Yes, your first part of your question cut out. I'm assuming, Philip, you're referring to HCR? 
Philip Martin: Yes, HCR, I meant, yes. 
James Flaherty: Well, they have gone into playing offense mode. They are -- they've got great conviction about their business model, and they're obviously generating a significant amount of cash. They've got a significant amount of cash at quarter end, at September 30, they're sitting on just about $130 million. But as Paul noted in his comments, they've reinvested in their business model in terms of our facilities approximately 2x the amount that is required -- the minimum by the lease. And what you really seen -- I mean, this is really -- you're seeing the early stages of what we call HCR version 3.0. This was the leader in the 90s with respect to the institutional skilled nursing business after the ManorCare investment acquisition in 1999. They morphed their business model to a higher acuity, more complex shorter-stay business model. And now what you're seeing is real health care reform start to play out in the post-acute setting, which involves payers, providers, very large acute care hospital operators. You will see cost shift here. You will see capitation. You may see some bundling going on. And you've got a management team here that has consistently taken advantage of changes in the marketplace. And that's what they're going through right now, and they have moved into, very much with conviction, what I'd call playing offense in their business model. And I suspect you're going to see some very, very good results in the next year or 2 to come. 
Philip Martin: So it sounds pretty comprehensive in terms of service levels being improved, probably technology just within the integrated health system and I'm sure some cosmetic as well, so it's kind of, as you said, going on offense, it's pretty compressive here. And is there a meaningful change in service that's happening from current levels with this investment? 
James Flaherty: That's part of it. Let me just underscore one of your points. This is far more than cosmetics that are going on here, okay? So this is -- HCR is in discussions with dozens of potential partners all focused in their cluster markets. And as they retool here for what will really be true health care reform, not something that comes out of a legislation from Washington D.C. with the likely involvement or inclusion of block grants to the states, they're really getting very well-positioned here for the next couple of year periods. So it's -- frankly, I find it fascinating to watch how this management team is -- continues to evolve and be very dynamic in their response to what is going to be a very, very good opportunity. And of course, everything at the end of the day is a function of the fact that in the health care continuum, they represent the lowest cost setting. So they're sitting there and with that enormous business advantage and now retooling their business model, investing aggressively their own capital into our properties to position themselves to take advantage of this. 
Philip Martin: And again, and I appreciate the color, the -- from an outcome standpoint, have -- in your discussions with them, have you seen an increase and improvement in health care outcomes from the services they provide? Has that been or is that -- is it still somewhat... 
James Flaherty: Their outcomes have always been superior. We are -- year-over-year, you do see a meaningful increase in census. So if you do a spot -- October 2011 versus an October 2012 spot occupancy, I mean, that's up meaningfully. And I think -- so I'd make that observation. 
Philip Martin: Okay. So trends sound positive both from a cost efficiency standpoint and a health care outcome standpoint? 
James Flaherty: Yes, Phil. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler. 
Jeff Theiler: A couple of questions about the Fund West portfolio that you purchased. The initial coverage is a little bit skinny, less than 1 1, but you have some reset potential there. Can you talk about specifically what Emeritus is doing to drive the lease up there? And maybe how much of their CapEx commitment is going directly to those lease-up communities? 
James Flaherty: Yes, well, let me give you the kind of the silver bullet here. They've managed this portfolio for 2 years. In those 2 years, there's been $42 million invested by the venture. And as we sit here today, that has gone into transitioning 52% of the communities so that those are now branded Emeritus. The flip side of that is that 48% of this portfolio today, 48%, Jeff, is not branded with Emeritus' operating discipline. So what you'll see, this $30 million that has now been funded as a part of this transaction to Emeritus, you will see them finish off the job, if you will, in the next 12 months. You'll see them invest that $30 million to convert the remaining 48% of this portfolio into branded Emeritus communities. And this is why it was so important when Paul and Kendall and their team were structuring the transaction, that we had an indirect participation in this cash flow because you can see in the first 2 years, for where they had invested the capital, they had an occupancy spike of 800 basis points. So by structuring the transaction so that we have indirect participation, not 1 but 2 ways, number one, we've got these outsized escalators in the first couple of years starting at over 4%, averaging 3.7% annually for the first 5 years. And then specifically on the lease-up portfolio, which is going to get the majority of this $30 million CapEx, we have the right after 5 years to move that rent to market subject to a cap of 30% of the prior year, which would be the year 5 cash flow. 
Jeff Theiler: Right. And do you have a sense for what the overall occupancy is in those lease-up markets? I mean, what do you consider to be kind of stabilized occupancy because I know those markets aren't necessarily the top markets. They're kind of more secondary type markets is my understanding. 
James Flaherty: Well, the occupancy, I think that was all in the press release, Jeff. The occupancy in the lease-up component of the 133 properties was 74%, 75%. 
Jeff Theiler: And what do you anticipate stabilized -- once Emeritus goes through that transformation and brands all the committees and all that, where do you see that going and over what timeframe? 
James Flaherty: I think you could see that certainly moving up to 80%, and then over time, 85%. Again, we think -- I would go directly to where we set that fair market value reset at the end of year 5, so we think it will take a few years to move that component up, but this is one of many reasons why we're so excited about this transaction. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. And then sorry, one last follow-up on the coverages. So initially, again, it's a little low, can you just talk about what you project out over the next kind of at the end of year 2 and year 3, how fast that coverage moves up? 
James Flaherty: I think you should -- I think it's instructive for you to look at the pace of the annual escalators in the first couple of years. I think that direction will give you a sense as to how fast those coverage is going to move up. 
Operator: Your next question is from Rich Anderson. 
Richard Anderson: Jay, just to that last question there, you said look at the escalators to figure out how the coverages are going up. I don't quite understand that. If your rent escalators are going up, their profitability has to go up by a commensurate amount to maintain coverage above 1. Am I misunderstanding something? Can you explain that last comment you made? 
James Flaherty: Well, if we wanted to maintain 1 but we're not actually maintaining 1. You'll see their cash flow go up not commensurately. You'll see their cash flow go up at a faster rate, Rich. 
Richard Anderson: And that's because of the deployment of the CapEx. But what's the long-term prognosis for this -- or in part, because of that -- what's the long-term prognosis from a CapEx perspective? I mean, I guess the $30 million isn't really deferred maintenance, it's more of a rebranding initiative. So how much... 
James Flaherty: It's part rebranding, part some repositioning, some expansion. Again, we're very fortunate, we have perfect information because we've seen the Blackstone JV invest $42 million and get phenomenal returns on that investment. And then we ourselves have seen what has happened when we've transitioned properties to Granger Cobb and his team. With respect to not 1, not 2 but 3 portfolio transitions we moved from Sunrise that included initial CapEx spend that we funded and we've been able to monitor the very strong results that Granger and his team have affected. So we've got proven commodity here. We've got a ray source in Granger and Emeritus team that has demonstrated on multiple occasions with multiple portfolios the ability to transition properties, rebrand them with Emeritus and grow cash flow. And we've seen that in this portfolio with respect to the stabilized component of that. And now with the benefit of the incremental $30 million that Emeritus will fund into our triple net structure, triple net lease structure, you'll see that the lease-up component come up as well. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. So if your rent escalators are averaging 3.7% in the first 5 years, you're saying that they're going to grow rental revenue at the property level by something more than 4% over those -- that same timeframe, it's going to be even greater than that. It that what you're telling us? 
James Flaherty: Exactly. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And does the coverage include the kind of recurring CapEx that is -- that will happen after the $30 million? And what is that number? Is it $1,500 a unit? Is it $1,000 a unit? What would you say the number is? 
James Flaherty: Well, our coverage is -- our triple net coverages because, again, this goes into our orientation towards when you look at triple net structures, you have that CapEx responsibility is a responsibility of the tenant. So our coverages wouldn't pick that up. If we were in a RIDEA structure, it's much more relevant to look at economic cap rates, because there, the CapEx is a liability of the landlord, the REIT. In this case, the CapEx is a liability of the tenant so it's more instructive to look at nominal coverage ratios. But once the $30 million is invested in the next 12 months to transition and rebrand the remaining 48% of this portfolio, I think you're probably looking at the next couple of years as being plus or minus $500 a unit and then that will grow over time. 
Richard Anderson: That low huh, okay? For class B, C portfolio. Is that the right way to think of it, class B, C maybe? 
James Flaherty: No, I think -- well, I think it depends what the B and C refer to. If the B and C refer to not a top MSA 31 market, I think that's fair. But these are A property or A-quality properties. They're in secondary markets. But for example, I'd give you 2 points of comment there. If you're looking to Emeritus' strategic plan as disclosed in their annual report and their most recent Q, they specifically target this middle market, the market segment that they feel is most attractive to them, which is smaller cities and suburbs with populations of 50,000 to 150,000 people. So when we've transitioned the portfolios that we've transitioned, we've seen them extract and get those portfolios performing by an order of magnitude better than had been previously the case. So I'd be careful with B and C. If B and C, you're referring to not a top-sized MSA 31 market, I think that's fair. But these are very high-quality properties. Paul and I visited one in the Preston Hollow section of Dallas, which is literally located next door to the Carell Clinic, and Preston Hollow is one of the more affluent parts of Dallas. The Carell Clinic would be Dallas' version of the Mayo Clinic. So you've got some very high-quality real estate here, but they are located in sized markets that are next tier down than the top MSA 31 markets. 
Richard Anderson: Great. Fair enough. And just so I understand, call it 1.1 or 1.08 or the number it was, that the coverage coming out of the gate, if you were to include CapEx in that analysis, you'd be below 1. I'm not saying we should -- I'm not suggesting we should do that, but at least for the time being, it's going to be a below 1 cash flow coverage at the profit level, including CapEx? 
James Flaherty: Yes, I think that would be relevant, Rich, if we were acquiring this subject to a RIDEA structure. You've got to change your orientation here. There's RIDEA and there's triple net and they have different economic responsibilities between the landlord and the operator tenant. Paul, did you want to add something? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think, Rich, when you look at what will have been spent over a 4-year period, they're going to spend $7,000 a unit. We did underwrite into our rent steps and into our rent reset in the fifth year over $1,000 a unit in CapEx that the landlord would be spending and took that into consideration when we negotiated what those rent bumps would be. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And then just last question on HCR ManorCare. Would you have a situation like property-level rent coverage, is that 1.04x and the fixed charge OpCo coverage is 1.29x. Why would HCR ManorCare, I mean, just kind of -- it's a rhetorical question but that's kind of weighing down their profitability, right? For 1.04x versus the 1.29x? So is the CapEx kind of that they're going to spend, is that kind of recognition of this and they want to get the 1.04x up to something that's more in line with what you're seeing at the fixed charge level? Is that a fair way to think about it? 
James Flaherty: Well remember, HCR's business model is quite complex. They create multiple cash flows out of our properties that they manage. So they've got a variety of the ancillary businesses that produce very substantial cash flow. You heard Paul's comments for the period of time that ended September 30, 2012, which was the 12-month period most impacted by the changes from August 2011, they still generated, after rent obligations to HCP, $130 million cash flow. So this is a very, very significant business, and it is our properties that allow them in large part to create the value for their shareholders. 
Richard Anderson: But not debating that at all, about the quality of the company, but 1.04x versus 1.29x, they don't want a lower profitable business if they can avoid it, right? So that's the reason for the CapEx, to close that gap. Is that what's going on? 
James Flaherty: I think I made -- in response to a question earlier, what you've seen here is a significant change in this business, the post-acute just in the last 12 months. Everybody took a look at the 11.2% cut, which we never underwrote any of that in our underwriting. But what only now with the benefit of perfect hindsight that people can now see for the industry is the cut was -- the net effect of the cut was far greater than 11.2%. You had very significant changes, increases in the cost structure that related to the group in concurrent therapy. So you've now seen -- you're now experiencing trough coverages, if you use the 12 months ended September 30, 2012. Now recall, we only have the 12 months ended June 30 in our supplemental, so we're kind of giving you a heads-up on what we'll report the next quarter. If you look at these coverages for the 12 months ended 9/30/12, this represents a trough coverage. You'll see in fourth quarter calendar quarter, you'll see those coverages start to come back up. Notwithstanding that, with the changes to this business, this company has aggressively: A, generated cash flow; B, invested much more cash flow than they're required to under the lease; and C, are now in a position, and this is why I referenced the HCR version 3.0 of this business model, to really play offense in 2013 and 2014 with what will likely be part of a grand bargain with whoever is the new President and whoever is sitting in Congress, the beginning of some serious health care reform. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jorel Guilloty. 
Paul Morgan: It's actually Paul Morgan here with Jorel. Just going back to the Emeritus, maybe just I could ask slightly differently. So you've got like 12% to 13% rent growth in the escalations that are sort of before it stabilizes. And what do you think of as -- what are you underwriting for your coverage at the end of that period? And then kind of how are they going the growth in excess of the -- where is that going to come from? I know that you're talking about the $30 million investment. Are there any incremental units? Are they -- is it growth in occupancy because occupancy seems pretty high for the stabilized portfolio? Is it just rent upside from the facelifts to the assets. Just any kind of color about that? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. Paul, in terms of the underwriting assumptions, it's really very mild growth, about 3% upside and rent growth and about 100 basis points in occupancy pickup. 
Paul Morgan: And then where would that leave you in terms of coverage at the end of year 4? 
James Flaherty: My guess is you're probably bouncing between 110 and 115, notwithstanding the outsized annual bumps in rent. 
Paul Morgan: Okay, great. And then I just want to -- I just want to make sure. So you said that what you report next quarter in terms of the HCR ManorCare coverage should be the trough and then we should go from there based on kind of the same type of reporting that we're seeing? 
James Flaherty: Yes, well, we're already close to what it was. In Paul's remarks, he's already gone -- fast-forwarded to September 30 numbers. Recall that we report these numbers on a 3-month lag. But again, we've got those numbers and we've communicated those to you on this call this morning. And we've also noted the rather aggressive actions HCR is taking with respect to investing its  -- reinvesting its business model and the very strong level of liquidity that they have currently. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum. 
Ross Nussbaum: I'm here with the Derek Bower. 2 questions on the Sunwest portfolio. First, Jay, where do you peg your acquisition costs and I guess relative to replacement cost? 
James Flaherty: I think, overall, Ross, I think we're -- I don't have the number in front of me, it could go about $157,000 a unit. I think that number was a little higher on the stabilized portfolio and a little lower on the lease-up. To be honest, I think that's probably right around replacement cost, Ross. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay. If I look out 5 years and I think about the benefit you're going to get from not just the contractual rent bumps but the potential rent reset on the lease-up facilities, based on your underwriting, where do you see the yield on this portfolio in year 5? 
James Flaherty: Well, we negotiated really hard for a higher cap than 130% of year 5 rent. And Emeritus, to their credit, negotiated what we preferred something lower, so we settled at 1.3%. But if you just assume that it goes to the cap, I think your -- I think the 5-year compounded annual growth rate in NOI grows to 4.7%. 
Ross Nussbaum: So if I take 4.7% and compound it for 5 years, you're suggesting that will get me to the right answer? 
James Flaherty: That would the number at -- well, remember, we're not -- with the sharing, HCP is sharing with Emeritus. So obviously, anything north in the scenario of where we hit the max on the cap of 130% in year 6 rent for the lease-up of the year 5 cash flow, we would be capped, maxed out at 130% of that number, and that would calculate out to over that 5 years of 4.7% compound annual growth rate, which obviously, in the context of a triple net structure where the CapEx liability is the responsibility of the tenant from a risk-adjusted return standpoint, is very, very attractive return for HCP shareholders. 
Ross Nussbaum: With the HCR ManorCare. I was looking back at the coverage ratios, a year ago at least, as you reported them at 12/31/11. And at the OpCo, the coverage was 166. At the facility level, it was 137, so we're talking, give or take, call it 35 basis points of erosion in those metrics. And I guess the question I would have is there was a lot of talk over the last year about how HCR ManorCare was going to mitigate the reimbursement change, and I guess I'm not seeing a lot of mitigation in the numbers that you're reporting. But based on some of your comments, you're suggesting that perhaps some of that mitigation will start showing up going forward. And I guess my question is why is it going to start showing up going forward? Why hasn't it already shown up? 
James Flaherty: Well, again, I don't know if you heard the answer to my previous question, but they did a great job mitigating the 11.2%. The problem was and it wasn't just a problem unique to HCR, it was endemic in the industry, the real economics of the August 2011 CMS reductions were far greater than the RUGs-IV benefit going away. They included a substantial increase in the cost structure because of the group and concurrent therapy cost increases. So we're now seeing -- now that you've seen the benefit of the full 12-month effect, you're basically seeing a 1 5 underwritten coverage declined to 1 3 if you eliminate the prior-year 2006 to 2010 insurances, you're $130 million. So basically that increase you can now quantify for the full year of the impact of this new business model as 20 basis points of the incremental costs associated with the August 2011 CMS announcement. Fast-forward to where we are today, we're now in the fourth quarter. They're going to get an increase -- they've already gotten the increase of 1.8%. We'll see what happens with sequestration in the new year. But that's why I've indicated these are -- you ought to think about these coverage ratios as of September 30, 2012, as trough level of coverages. Notwithstanding all that, they've aggressively moved to reinvest in the business because the business model is going to be different in the next couple of years. You're going to see whether you get block grants to the state or not, you're going to see cost sharing, you're going to see some capitation, probably some bundling. And this is a business model that within the cluster markets that HCR operates in is going to have very much of a -- the Affordable Care Act, some of the dimensions in terms of the accountable care organizations and things like that. So that -- you're really seeing a very dynamic change in this market. I would say, if you look across our 5 sectors right now, you've probably got more going on in this post-acute setting right now as people position for what could come out of a grand bargain scenario next year than in any of our other 4 sectors. 
Ross Nussbaum: And just one final question. What is your contractual rent increase in 2013, in those HCR ManorCare assets? 
James Flaherty: It's 3.5% each year for the first 5 years. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Mains. 
Robert Mains: Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, Emeritus, the lease, does that have any purchase options embedded? 
James Flaherty: No, it doesn't, Rob. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then just a follow-up yet again on ManorCare. Given what you're seeing in the opportunities there, would you be interested in -- there's some CapEx spending that you did in the quarter. How interested is HCP in doing more on that front with ManorCare? Would they prefer to fund it themselves? 
James Flaherty: I'm sorry, we didn't do any CapEx spending, Rob. That was all funded by HCR. 
Robert Mains: I realized but you've done some -- HCP has done CapEx spending generically. Would you be interested in doing more with ManorCare or do they want to do it themselves? 
James Flaherty: I'm a little confused. These are triple net lease structures. So the CapEx responsibility is the responsibility of the tenant, much like the Blackstone JV transaction we just announced where Emeritus is our partner in a triple net structure. When we do CapEx spending, we will do that in our medical office where we'll do TIs or potentially in the life science space. But under triple net structures, the CapEx is the responsibility of the tenant. 
Robert Mains: Right. I think we're defining CapEx differently. If ManorCare wants to expand the facility or build up big new gym and it's going to be $2 million or whatever, $5 million whatever to do it, that will be an opportunity for you to invest additional funds in the facility and then get the same, I assume, the same return on that investment that you're getting on the current lease. Is that something that HCP is interested in? 
James Flaherty: Well, first of all, it's HCR, as you know, it's not ManorCare. And secondly, Sure, we'd be interested, but HCR has substantial liquidity. That -- my guess is that they've got higher and better uses for the liquidity than to be adding to the rent obligation to HCP. But certainly, were they to come to us to have that discussion which they've not, I mean, they're generating substantial amounts of cash flow in excess of our -- their rent obligation to us and they're sitting on substantial amounts of cash liquidity. So that's not a discussion that's taken place. 
Robert Mains: Okay, fair enough. And then the last question, given your comments about what you see is the opportunities in that sector, has your view of new investments in skilled nursing changed? 
James Flaherty: No, I think any time you get an external shock to a system, that is a catalyst for M&A activity. And the August 11 CMS announcement was a major shock to the system. I think for the first couple of quarters, people limited the impact to that to merely the benefit, the RUGs-IV benefit that existed for fiscal year 2011 as going away in fiscal year 2012. The reality is, given the cost -- increased cost structures with that CMS announcement, the impact was far greater. As HCR and other leading players have retooled their business model, I think -- I continue to believe you'll see significant consolidation in this space. And by the way, I think you're going to see, as I've said on my prior calls, you'll see significant M&A consolidation in some of the other spaces as well. That will be for different catalyst reasons but in this case, it really -- it all starts with the August 11 CMS announcement. 
Operator: Your next question is from John Roberts. 
John Roberts: Jay, you mentioned the impact of the storm. Have you -- I know it's early in the valuation process but have you seen any charges on that? Or it's covered by insurance? Or are the tenants going to be the ones that cover any potential damage? 
James Flaherty: Gee, we haven't even -- the 2 Sunrise communities that I've pointed out, I've been back and forth with their CEO, Mark Ordan, several times this morning. In fact, his mom is resident in the community that got evacuated yesterday. So all we're focused on right now is the safety and protection of the residents. 
John Roberts: Sure, sure. I understand that. But what I'm looking for is will there be any charges based on potential changes. I mean, you've got those 2 but there's lots of others you have on the East Coast but obviously, at this point... 
James Flaherty: Again, for the most part, in a triple net structure -- first of all, we have significant insurance coverage. Secondly, most if not all of those properties, there are some MOBs, by the way, that have some minor flooding, most of those are triple net structures. But again, that's -- we're not even thinking about that. We're making sure that the residents, that the very dear residents in these senior housing communities are safe and protected. And to the extent we've had to evacuate them, making sure that they're in an equally safe and protected and caring community. 
Operator: I will now turn the call back to Mr. Flaherty, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Suzette. Thank you, everyone. Again, especially for those of you that are impacted by the storm, I'd leave you with 3 thoughts: One, please, please, please be safe; two, please go out and vote next Tuesday; and three, go Irish. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-07-31 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bonnie and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Bonnie. Good afternoon and good morning.

 Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed during the course of this call. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, as well as certain related disclosures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, each of which has been furnished to the SEC today and is available on our website at www.hcpi.com. 
 I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thank you, John. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are HCP's Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen.
 We are enjoying significant momentum, allowing us to increase our FFO, our FAD and our Same Property Performance 2012 guidance, realized a significant reduction in our cost of capital and announced $500 million of acquisitions and an additional $100 million commitment. First, we'll begin with a review of the quarterly results we announced this morning. Tim? 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. Today, I will cover 4 topics: second quarter results; investment transactions; financing activities and balance sheet; and finally updated 2012 guidance. Let me start with our second quarter results. 
 Our same-property portfolio continued to perform well, generating a solid 3.1% cash NOI growth compared to the second quarter last year. The results were primarily driven by contractual rent increases and occupancy gains in our life science and medical office portfolios. Paul will review our operating performance by segment in a few minutes. 
 For the second quarter, we reported FFO of $0.69 per share and FAD of $0.56 per share, which included a $7 million or $0.02 charge related to insurance recovery of past G&A expenses. On a year-over-year basis, FFO as adjusted decreased $0.08 per share and FAD decreased $0.06. The decrease resulted from one-time income totaling $41 million or $0.10 per share, primarily related to the gain from monetizing our Genesis debt investment in the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the one-time items from both periods, year-over-year, second quarter FFO as adjusted was flat, and FAD increased by $0.02 per share or 3.8%. 
 Switching to investment transactions. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced $559 million of investments encompassing 4 different property types and 3 different investment products within our 5x5 business model. These transactions are immediately accretive to earnings and include: one, the GBP 137 million or $215 million debt investment in U.K.-based Four Seasons Health Care at a yield of 12.5% in late June; two, $274 million acquisitions of on-campus MOB portfolios that represent 1.2 million square feet in total and include a DownREIT component with equity units valued at $41 million, and the assumption of $59 million of mortgage debt at a blended rate of 5.7%. We expect to close these acquisitions on or before August 31. 
 Three, we made other additional investments of $70 million during the quarter, including $48 million of development and capital improvements, $8 million for a pre-leased life science development with Duke University and funding for one additional senior housing development loan under our program, bringing the total of committed projects to 6. 
 Turning now to financing activities and balance sheet. On a capital raising front, we've generated total gross proceeds of $890 million in June and July, consisting of $376 million of common stock, $300 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 3.15% and GBP 137 million 4-year term loan that serves as a hedge of our debt investment in Four Seasons Health Care. We concurrently entered into a 4-year interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate at 1.81% plus transaction cost of 17 basis points per year.
 Proceeds from these transactions were primarily used to repay our $250 million bond maturity at an expiring rate of 6.45%, restore full availability under our $1.5 billion revolver and fund the cash consideration for the acquisitions announced this morning. Combined, these transactions will further strengthen our balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage was slightly below 40% and secured debt ratio below 10%. In addition, our fixed charge coverage increased to 3.6x in the quarter and is expected to further improve in the coming quarters, driven by the benefit of these activities. 
 Our remaining 2012 debt maturities are negligible at $29 million. And looking ahead into 2013, our debt maturities total $920 million at an average rate of 5.9%, of which $650 million are due in the fourth quarter of 2013. To help further illustrate our strong credit metrics, we continue to expand our disclosures on Page 6 and 7 in this quarter's supplemental. 
 Lastly, updates to our 2012 guidance. Driven by continued strong performance of our same-property portfolio, we are raising our full year cash same property growth to a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, up 25 basis points from our May guidance. We are raising our FFO guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.76 per share, which is $0.02 higher than our last guidance. This increase is driven by a $0.02 benefit from the accretive acquisitions described earlier, net of prefunding activities, and higher same-store projections, plus an additional $0.01 from $100 million of pending debt investments assumed to close in August, offset in part by $0.01 from several small items. 
 We are raising our 2012 FFO as adjusted guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.79 per share, an increase of $0.02 from previous guidance. As a reminder, FFO as adjusted excludes the previously announced $0.025 charge resulting from the $296 million preferred stock redemption in Q2. 
 Lastly, we are raising our 2012 FAD guidance to a range of $2.18 to $2.24 per share, up $0.02 from our previous guidance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. I'll review HCP's second quarter portfolio performance and highlight the $500 million of acquisitions announced since the end of the first quarter. 
 Senior housing. Occupancy in our same-property senior housing platform was 85.9%, a 10-basis point sequential increase over the prior quarter and flat versus the prior year. Same-store cash flow coverage for the portfolio declined 1 basis point to 1.13x, driven by outsized fixed rent bumps on our transitioned assets and higher property expenses in our Brookdale portfolio. 
 Current quarter year-over-year same-property cash NOI was up 2.1%. Growth was driven by rent steps, including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators, offset by a one-time collection of additional rent in the prior period of 2 Sunrise portfolios. Net of this item, NOI increased 3.7%. 
 The calculation of occupancy in our RIDEA portfolio has been changed to be consistent with Brookdale's methodology of utilizing a unit occupancy calculation. The resulting occupancy for the quarter is 86.5%, a 40-basis point decrease from the previous quarter, utilizing the new methodology. 
 Recently, we have seen an improvement in move-ins as Brookdale has implemented several new programs, including personalized living and therapy services. In addition, we are upgrading the dining services in 5 of our Houston assets. 
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. Coverages in our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio metrics now reflect 2 quarters of lower reimbursement rates under RUGs-IV. HCR's fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.44x, a 9-basis point decrease for the trailing 12-month period ending March 31, 2012. For the trailing 12 months ending June 30, 2012, the fixed charge coverage was 1.29x, which includes an increase in reserves for general and professional liability claims for the years 2006 through 2010. Excluding this charge, the fixed charge coverage would be 1.39x. 
 Cash flow coverage in our legacy same-store SNF portfolio was 1.58x, a 6-basis point decrease versus the prior quarter and an 11-basis point decrease versus the prior year, with cash NOI up 2.2%, driven by normal rent steps. 
 Hospitals. Same-property cash flow coverage increased 21 basis points to 4.73x, driven by continued strong performance at our Medical City Dallas and Hoag Irvine hospitals. Year-over-year same-property cash NOI for the second quarter increased 3.5%. 
 Medical Office Buildings. Same property cash NOI for the second quarter was up 3%. The growth was a result of normal rent steps coupled with increased occupancy versus the second quarter of 2011. Our MOB occupancy for the second quarter increased 20 basis points to 91.4%. During the quarter, tenants representing 585,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 338,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Our year-to-date average retention rate is 78.4%. 
 Renewals for the quarter occurred at 0.5% higher mark-to-market rents. We have 973,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2012, including 195,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. Our leasing pipeline includes new and renewal prospects totaling 900,000 square feet, representing 92% of our remaining 2012 rollover exposure. 
 Life science. Occupancy for our life science portfolio increased 50 basis points to 89.6% and includes a 41,000 square-foot expansion for Takeda Pharmaceuticals on our Torrey Pines campus, where they now lease 167,000 square feet. Same-property cash NOI was up 4.9% in the second quarter, driven by normal rent steps and the previously announced LinkedIn expansion on our Mountain View campus. 
 For the quarter, we completed 113,000 square feet of leasing, bringing the year-to-date total to 402,000 square feet, with a retention rate of 81.1%. The life sciences portfolio has only 91,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2012, including approximately 29,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We are currently tracking over 300,000 square feet of activities on this space. 
 Acquisitions. Since our May call, we have announced 6 acquisitions. First, HCP provided GBP 137 million in financing for Terra Firma's GBP 825 million acquisition of the Four Seasons Health Care, the largest elderly and specialist care provider in the U.K. HCP was the lead investor in the senior unsecured tranche with an 8-year term, 4-year call protection, a 12.25% coupon with an original issue discount resulting in a yield to maturity of 12.5%. The tranche is subordinate to GBP 350 million of senior secured debt and a GBP 40 million unfunded revolver. 
 Terra Firma's significant equity contribution of GBP 345 million results in HCP's loan-to-cost of 62%, a debt coverage service ratio of just under 2x and an EBITDA yield to HCP's last dollar investment of 18%. 
 Second, we executed agreements to acquire, in a DownREIT transaction, a 12-property, 758,000 square-foot, high-quality medical office portfolio located primarily in Utah and Kansas City. The properties, 83% of which are on the campuses of HCA, IASIS and community health hospitals, have an average age of 8 years and occupancy of 88%. The purchase price was $179 million, representing a cap rate of 7.2% and included the assumption of $59 million of secured debt. The deal was sourced in HCP's existing relationship with The Boyer Company, who now manage over 2 million square feet in our MOB and life science portfolio. 
 Third, we executed agreements to purchase an 8-asset, 398,000 square-foot portfolio of medical office buildings in the Phoenix market. These high-quality assets are all on the campuses of Scottsdale Healthcare, the leading health care provider in Scottsdale, Arizona. This portfolio was acquired for $81.4 million at a cap rate of 7.4% and is 89% leased. 
 Fourth, we made an opportunistic acquisition of an 80,000-square foot MOB in Dallas, Texas for $13.5 million. The property is currently 59% leased to HCA and was purchased at a 6.6% cap rate on in-place rents. Upon stabilization, the property is expected to yield 9%. This property is adjacent to HCA's North Richland Hills Hospital campus, where we currently own an 86,000 square foot, 92% occupied medical office building. 
 Fifth, we closed on an $18.4 million development loan on an 86-unit assisted living facility located at the end of the mainline in Willistown, Pennsylvania. This is the sixth transaction in our development loan platform, bringing our total commitment to $119 million. The stabilized return on cost is 11.7%. 
 Sixth, HCP acquired a 115,000-square foot building in Durham, North Carolina for $8 million. The building is 100% leased to Duke University. HCP committed $40 million to build out lab space in this project and made an additional commitment of $13 million to complete buildout of our existing 53,000-square foot building that is also 100% leased to Duke University. The new commitments will provide HCP with an 8% return on cost, and both leases will now have a 17-year term with 3% annual rent escalations. 
 Finally, sustainability. As a result of HCP's sustainability initiatives, utility cost continued to generate positive economic results. On a same-property basis, utility expenses were down $202,000 versus the second quarter of 2011 and $648,000 on a year-to-date basis. 
 We continue to make strides in our green initiatives. Our Soledad Business Park in San Diego was awarded the prestigious LEED Platinum certification. Also during the quarter, we received an additional 7 ENERGY STAR labels, 4 in our senior housing portfolio, 1 in medical office and 2 in our life science portfolio. This brings HCP's total ENERGY STAR labels to 75. 
 In June, as a part of our increased sustainability reporting, we completed our first response to the Carbon Disclosure Project's 2012 Investor Questionnaire, as well as our response to the 2012 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark survey sponsored by NAREIT. 
 With that, I'd like to turn it back to Jay. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Paul. I want to highlight a less well known but critically important component of HCP's real estate portfolio: standalone memory care facilities. HCP owns over 7,000 memory care units, representing 20% of our total senior housing footprint. Included in this total, HCP owns 58 standalone memory care buildings or roughly half of our total memory care units, making HCP one of the largest owners of standalone memory care facilities in the United States. 
 The majority of HCP's standalone memory care facilities were acquired as part of our HCR acquisition, where 20% of the properties from the $6.1 billion transaction are in the senior housing sector. HCR's Arden Court portfolio represents purpose-built facilities developed by HCR in the late 1990s. These properties are often co-located on campuses with HCR's post-acute and skilled nursing facilities and specialize in memory care, dementia and early-stage Alzheimer's disease. 
 Alzheimer's disease research reports that roughly 5.4 million Americans of all ages had Alzheimer's disease in 2012. And by 2050, more than 15 million Americans could be living with the disease, a key reason memory care residents are predicted to double over the next 30 years. 
 The increasing incidence of memory care issues among our nation's aging senior population and HCR's premier national reputation for caring for residents with memory impairment are an attractive feature of our HCR transaction. 
 As Tim described, we enjoyed an active period of capital markets activity. If you look at the first 7 months of 2012, HCP has achieved a remarkable reduction in its cost of capital, an improvement in all of its credit metrics. In January, we issued $450 million of 3.75%, 7-year debt. In March, we repriced our $1.5 billion line of credit on attractive terms and raised $359 million of equity to fund the redemption of our outstanding 7.15% preferred stock, which we closed in April. In June, we raised $376 million of equity to fund in part the retirement of $250 million of 6.45% senior notes. 
 This month, we closed on $0.5 billion in 2 separate eye-opening debt issuances, a $300 million, 3.15%, 10-year senior note transaction and a $200 million, 4-year term loan denominated in pounds sterling at a cost of 1.81%, which will hedge our 12.5% yielding pound sterling investment in Four Seasons Health Care. Together, these balance sheet actions have produced weak single A credit metrics for HCP. 
 HCP's opportunity to achieve further cost of capital benefits expands next year as the company has $920 million of debt maturing in 2013, with an average interest rate of 5.9%. To facilitate your understanding of the dramatic improvement in our balance sheet, please take a few minutes and review the expanded credit profile in this quarter's supplemental report. 
 On our last earnings call, I indicated that our 5x5 business model was sourcing a significant level of acquisition dialogue across our investing platforms. This activity has accelerated in the last 3 months as we closed on 2 of the highest quality MOB portfolios we have ever acquired at cap rates of 7.2% and 7.4%, one skilled nursing debt investment in the U.K. yielding 12.5% and an additional $100 million commitment. 
 With an undrawn $1.5 billion line of credit and approximately $300 million of cash currently on hand, we are positioned nicely to finance our accretive acquisition pipeline. 
 With that summary, Paul, Tim and I are delighted to take your questions. Bonnie? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley. 
Paul Morgan: Jay, if you could talk a little bit about, now that you've had a little time with the Four Seasons investment, kind of your view on the U.K. senior housing market. And then just whether you see this as opening up other opportunities in Europe and whether that might be on the debt and equity or equity side. 
James Flaherty: Yes, sure. No, I understand the thought process and the speculation and even the intrigue of our Four Seasons investment in terms of what that might portend for the company's strategy offshore in Europe, elsewhere. The reality is, it's something much more straightforward. We use our 5x5 business model to source proprietary opportunities that produce negotiated transactions, that result in very attractive risk reward outcomes for our shareholders. And when you cut through it, quite frankly, that's really what was going on here. This was equity light return for debt risk exposure. I would like in this transaction -- we always, when we move away from 100% fee simple real estate transactions, we always look for optionality for those investments to eventually move to 100% fee simple real estate. Realistically, I liken this transaction to the HCA toggle note transaction we made back at the end of '06 where we had the best-in-class operator in the market, in that case HCA, in this case Four Seasons, at an attractive yield but with a very, very substantial equity base below us, 40%. In the case of this acquisition transaction is the Terra Firma equity investment below us, much like the HCA equity investment from the Frist family, Bain, KKR and Merelith Time. So while I think there could be some optionality for us to end up in the real estate, my guess is, with that amount of equity below us, you're looking at either a par plus a premium pay-off. Or potentially as we watch REITs evolve in terms of their acceptance in the U.K. market, there's a potential for that to unfold as well. But this is just a very attractive investment for our shareholders, and the icing on the cake was the execution of the 1.81% 4-year term debt. If you look at the -- not that we project finance our investments but if you look at the 12.5% less the 1.81%, you're at a spread there of almost 1,100 basis points, which is very, very attractive for our shareholders. 
Paul Morgan: I shouldn't read too much into this in terms of initiative abroad. I should try to think of this more of a sort of opportunistic deal in isolation. It could be replicated but, not it's not part of a grand plan? 
James Flaherty: I think that's fair source by our 5x5 model. And again, we like to stay away from auction situations where highest price wins. So this was a very attractive result for our shareholders. 
Paul Morgan: My other question, just on you, made a lot of mention of the cost of capital, which is very impressive these days. How do you think about underwriting, acquisition IRRs given your cost of capital. I mean, are you willing to drop IRRs on new deals? And does it make you more inclined to be acquisitive given changes in your cost of capital over the past 6 months? 
James Flaherty: No, absolutely not. I mean, if anything, you're seeing some backing up of cap rates at least in terms of the deal flow in the transactions that we've announced, which means the spread and the relative profitability of those investments is increasing to the betterment of our shareholders' return. I think it's actually fascinating. If you take a look at the Four Seasons investment and then go back almost 3 years to the day when we announced the second of our HCR ManorCare investments, so that was back on August 3 of '09. This is -- you got to write this down. It's kind of interesting. So the yield there, if you carve out the benefit that accrued to HCP from the seller financing on the second HCR debt investment, the yield was 9.8%. And that was done at a time that the 10-year treasury was 3.64% and our stock price was approximately $26 a share, okay? So 3 years ago, 9.8% yield on a debt investment, 3.64% 10-year treasury and a $26 HCP stock price. At the time we announced the Four Seasons deal, which was about a month ago, the yield there, with the discount that Paul referenced, is 12.5%, the 10-year was about 1.5% and our stock price at the time was $44 a share. So you can see that the differential, it's kind of upside down when you think about it. The yield has widened out by almost 300 basis points, and our cost of capital has come in by almost a similar amount. So I find that very interesting, and that's why we're in such an attractive position right now, and that's why we've got the liquidity that we've built into the balance sheet, both in terms of the 100% availability on our line plus the existing cash balances? Paul. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: Jay, I was looking back in time and post-acute over the past, call it, 2.5 years has gone from 15% of your portfolio to 32%, if I'm doing the right analysis. And that's kind of a dead heat with your senior housing exposure to the overall portfolio. I'm curious, is this a grand plan, as Paul Morgan used that term for the U.K. investment, do you see the balance of post-acute versus senior housing as being attractive? Or again, is this just an opportunistic things that has come across your plate and that there's not a whole grand scheme involved in that change in your exposure to post-acute? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think the grand scheme is kind of a model, the business model that we created several years ago, which has been -- which we've got -- it's been replicated, I guess to a certain extent, in terms of our interest in widening out the property types that we're investing in. We now are a major investor in 5 property types, but also the different levels of the capital stack, if you will, where we apply those investments. I think the nuance to HCP is probably twofold: One, we tend to use that model to source proprietary opportunities that result in negotiated transactions; and then secondly, the organic growth that we've been able to generate because of those -- the outcomes of those negotiated transactions is quite substantial. I don't think we've had a quarterly conference call in the last 3 years where we haven't raised the existing guidance on the performance of our same-property portfolio and you saw that continue again. So if there's any grand scheme, that's the grand scheme. We feel that we've got a very, very attractive business model, which we've attempted to build barriers around. With respect to post-acute, again, I don't think you'd be at 15 -- your starting off point, Rich, if you thought about that in terms of just the real estate investment. I think you're probably putting the debt investment in Genesis at the time, in HCR at the time. So again, we see a tremendous opportunity here in the next couple of years in terms of the reforming of health care, which will not be driven by Washington D.C., it will be driven by the market. And when you do that, again, I think you've heard us say that our 3 top criteria are aligning ourselves with operators that have quality outcomes, that have efficient operations, read that to mean margin, they make money and have a critical mass, read that to be market share. And we feel that HCR is, as we feel about HCA and Hospital Land and Genentech and Amgen and Life Science and HCA to a very real sense in medical office buildings, are the partners we want to align ourselves with. So the HCR, if anything, would've driven the opportunity in post-acute for us. Had that not been HCR, I don't think you would've seen us today with the exposure we have. So that's how I'd respond to that question, Rich. 
Richard Anderson: Would you have made the same deal as substantial as it was had you known about the cuts that were coming? How much did that -- has that kind of taken you a step back in terms of the quality of that investment, understanding it's a quality of the operator and all of the rest? How much of that sobered the view of the investment? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think it's done just the opposite. I think it's increased the attractiveness of the investment just because of now the consolidation play, which we anticipated would be back-end loaded to the second half of the decade. I think we're looking at that here and now with HCR. So that's made that investment and our alignment there much more attractive than we would've envisioned at the time we made the investment. 
Richard Anderson: And as one final question, can you walk through the economics of your direct investment in BKD stock? Where are the IRRs? Where do you expect them to go, that kind of thing? 
James Flaherty: That's just -- that's a relatively small investment that, at this point, we don't mark that to market. 
Richard Anderson: It's down 30%. I'm just wondering how that plays into anything? 
James Flaherty: I think we'll make me very, very good money for our shareholders on that investment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Bower of UBS. 
Ross Nussbaum: It's Ross Nussbaum here with Derek. Jay, you referenced quite a number of times your decline in your cost of capital. How has that influenced, if at all, how you're approaching putting capital out to work? Do you feel that this might be short-lived and there's a short duration and you should take advantage of it? Or do you say, "You know what, I'm just going to remain patient." 
James Flaherty: Well, I don't think this is a short-lived duration. I mean, if you look at the macro issues, you've got an economic recovery that at best is muted. That would be at best. You've got an unemployment situation that is challenged. I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. I think you've got a housing recovery that is tepid. I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. I think you've got an interest rate environment courtesy of the Fed that is likely to remain benign for the foreseeable future. And I think when you put all those things together, I think 2 things: One, those are big issues that are certainly not short term in nature, and I think it will drive investor demand, whether it be the retail investor, whether it be pension fund investors or the dedicated REIT investors. The combination of attractive yields that grow over time, in our case, they've grown for 27 consecutive years, with a very, very strong balance sheet, with ever accelerating Same Property Performance growth organically and some optionality on accretive external acquisitions. I don't think those dynamics are going to change anytime soon. So I would expect that, in part because of the opportunity set that we have in front of us, and in part because of investors -- I think David Rosenberg yesterday authored a piece calling for the end of equity ownership on the part of investors globally with an eye towards more of an income orientation. So I think these are big macro trends that are moving funds flow, Ross, and I don't think these things are going to reverse for the foreseeable future. That said, we consistently look to source very accretive transactions, that's been our hallmark. I think you see the results of that most immediately in the performance of our Same Property Performance results, but increasingly, I think you'll see us add to that staple of organic growth with external acquisitions. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay. A different topic. On Page 10 of your supplemental, it focuses in on what you have on the development side of the business, which is something that doesn't get as much attention. You've got $225 million of redevelopments and then there's another bucket of $390 million of land, and I think there's some activity going on there. Can you just walk us through on each of those buckets, what's the expected yield on the redevelopment? And what should we be thinking about relative to that $390 million investment on those land parcels? 
James Flaherty: Yes, let me just say, we actually -- I would take an exception, I think we've talked a fair amount about group development. We've obviously had an enormous success up in our Mountain View campus with the LinkedIn development, the build to suit there. We've got, which we've continued to talk about in the last couple of quarterly earnings calls, a very successful senior housing development program. I think we're up to 6 communities now. And then we've got the redevelopment opportunities and the development opportunities to land. I've spoken in previous calls about the ability to take the 6% of our overall portfolio that is not stabilized. So in other words, if you take a look at our portfolio, you've got 94% of that portfolio is kicking out 8-plus percent current yields. 6% of the portfolio, which is just under $1 billion when you do the math, is probably generating the plus or minus 3%. And I've spoken before about the opportunity, if we can move some or all of that unstabilized, call it $1 billion of investments, up closer to what the remainder of the portfolio is producing, is a very, very attractive incremental cash flow with not a whole lot of incremental CapEx associated with it. So that's how I would frame the overall perspective to your question. But let me have Paul kind of dig into the buckets, as you referred to them, that are on Page 10 of our supplemental. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, if you look at -- on the pure development, that's our LinkedIn property, that's 100% leased. If you look at the overall redevelopment sector right now, that's tracking at about 45% occupancy across the board, looking at all those assets and incremental return on cost range anywhere from probably 7.5% to kind of mid-teens type returns, depending on the amount of work associated with that. And then with respect to the development land, once those things are developed, we'll probably be looking at probably somewhere in the 7.5% to 8.5% return on cost kind of range. I think Derek Bower has one question. 
Ross Nussbaum: Just one quick one. I know RIDEA is still a small part of the portfolio, but we've seen some pretty positive industry trends so far in 2Q. So can you just discuss what drove that 40-bp decline in sequential occupancy and maybe remind us if there's any geographic concentration in that portfolio? 
James Flaherty: Again, just to set it up, this is the portfolio that we transitioned from Horizon Bay. So new operator, Brookdale versus Horizon Bay, and we perceived and we went out to the market an opportunity to invest some capital in this portfolio and change the profile in terms of a senior demand more from a pure-play independent living, which is why it was so important that we added, when we got down to the final selection process, Brookdale who had the ability to -- with capital, which we would provide pursuant to the joint venture there, the 90-10 joint venture, trick out those communities so that they could begin to have their ancillary revenue opportunity set. And we're well into that investment period at this point. We made an investment in the properties. Paul referenced the change that we're doing. We're adding the bistro concept down in our Houston portfolio of 5 former Horizon Bay communities. So I think Paul can take you through that. But this is a portfolio in transition. We feel better about this opportunity than we did at the time we made the investment. And Brookdale is working quite hard at transitioning this portfolio to where we all believe the upside is going to be for this portfolio. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes. I think if you look in the first quarter, there was probably a little bit more from the move-outs, both from a death and more broadly from an acuity standpoint. And that's one of the reasons why Brookdale has implemented the personal living and the therapy services to kind of help address some of those acuity issues. 
Ross Nussbaum: And then there was no regional concentration mix or anything like that affecting it in the quarter? 
Paul Gallagher: Absolutely not. 
James Flaherty: No. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Theiler of Green Street Advisor. 
Jeff Theiler: A question on HCR ManorCare. I knew that coverage would start a drop off as the RUGs continues to burn off, but it seems to be going a little bit faster than I would've thought at 1.44 we're kind of below the 1.5 coverage that was under it without any RUGs benefit. And I think we saw 6 months of the higher RUGs rates in that number. Can you talk about what's happening there and kind of what do you think the coverages will be by the end of the year after all those cuts have come through the system? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think Paul took you through not with 6 months to go but with 3 months to go what the coverage is, Jeff, in his script. 
Jeff Theiler: I'm sorry, I can go back and read it, but was it -- can you talk about it? 
James Flaherty: Adjusting out the prior year, the 2006 to 2010 GOPO adjustment, the coverage is 1.39, and that's through -- that's with 9 months of activity so you've got one quarter to go. So I think that's one important data point. You've also seen sequential month-over-month-over-month that the company outperformed the previous month so that's doing well. I think things are going along pretty well there. And Paul, I hope you'd add. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes. Just as a reminder, when you look at the portfolio, there's still significant cash flow after the payment of HCP's rent and CapEx, it's over $120 million so there's still quite a bit of cushion there. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. And then I guess we got that market basket increase in skilled nursing rates last week. How are you feeling about that? Is that making you more comfortable with the rate environment? Or do you think this is a little pause as they see how the operators are adjusting to the bigger cuts that they put through last year? How are you thinking about rates going forward? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think that result was completely expected, so I don't think there was any news there. I think, as I've said previously, I think pause is an interesting word to use for the next, I guess, 12 to 18 months. But over the longer term, the country has a mismatch of entitlement commitments with funding. So I don't think anything is going to happen between now and the end of the year on that topic. But I think there's some reason to think that with the new Congress seated, maybe come March, you could see a couple of things that would be helpful for the country and helpful for health care costs in this country and indirectly helpful for the post-acute space. So I think -- but I think you're going to have to work and wrestle with this. I think, my guess is that corporate America will end up driving a lot of the change here given that some of these decisions are the type of decisions that our congressmen and congresswomen don't like to confront. So I think in a scenario where corporate America does for health care what it did for pension reform in the 90s, which is to move America to a defined contribution setup for health care coverage as opposed to a defined benefit, I think that's increasingly becoming likely, and I think in that scenario, low-cost provider wins. And in general, the skilled nursing post-acute space is absolutely in that bucket. And in particular, HCR ManorCare does an extraordinarily good job for a comparable senior that's got a variety of afflictions versus the alternative sites that, that senior might be treated in. So we feel very, very good, and I think these external shocks to the system will continue to drive M&A activity, and we think that the best highest quality, most efficient operators in that scenario are going to do very, very well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from James Milam of Sandler O'Neill. 
James Milam: Jay, you talked a little bit about credit ratings and how you categorize your balance sheet as a weak A- credit. I'm just curious how conversations with the rating agencies are going if you're having any and when you think they might get on board with that view. 
James Flaherty: Well, I mean, those are confidential discussions so we would never comment on that. I think this isn't a discussion about the rating agencies. It's really a question of where our debt trades in the market. I think it's pretty straightforward. So I think we've been able to achieve in particular the last couple of debt transactions, which benefit obviously from the steps that Tim and Matt and others took earlier in the year on the balance sheet, we've been able to realize weak single A pricing on our debt security. So that's not really some speculation. That is what it is and those debts -- those bonds are very liquid, they trade every day. So that's specifically what I was referring to, James. 
James Milam: I understand that. I just -- there are some benefits to having higher ratings. I was just curious if that's a priority for you guys or not, I guess to push those higher with the agencies. 
James Flaherty: I think the priority is to have the strongest possible balance sheet. And increasingly, what you've seen Tim and Matt do is put a spotlight on how strong that balance sheet is on Pages 6 and 7 in our supplemental. And I think the markets are very efficient, and quite frankly, for the sell-side equity analyst on the call, don't take this the wrong way, but I've always been of a view that the fixed income investors have a little sharper pencils than the equity folks. And I think they've figure it out and I think they've attached an appropriate trade valuation for our debt securities. So where that shakes out for the agency, that's for them to discuss. I mean, those are institutions that have their own internal processes, and we very much respect them. But I think our balance sheet is our balance sheet, and those metrics are our metrics, and we've put them out there in the supplemental for any and all to view. 
James Milam: Okay, got it. I guess for the record, maybe I should shift to pen to pencil then as I'm taking notes? 
Timothy Schoen: Actually, James, the expanded credit metrics that we have in our supplemental have been in direct response to our fixed income investors request. So we continue to provide them as much as transparency as possible. 
James Milam: Got it, and that does help us too so we appreciate it. My second question, the operating portfolio, just curious, obviously, you gave us some color and answered some questions already. But was there anything that drove the expenses a little higher this quarter in particular that may burn off or is that kind of a going forward run rate at least the way things stand right now? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. From that quarter-over-quarter, there was about $500,000 of expenses that should have been in the first quarter that really didn't get picked up until early in the second quarter. 
James Milam: Okay, got it. And then Jay, just my last one, on the last quarter's call, you sounded -- you had a fairly cautious tone regarding the macro environment. It doesn't sound like that's changed much but I'm just curious if you feel like there are any changes either with tax code or anything else that may drive greater opportunities for you guys as we go into year end or on the contrary maybe could be a potential risk for you. 
James Flaherty: Yes. Well actually, let's review the bidding because on the last call, I think I identified about half a dozen or so issues that I suggested were kind of acting to dampen transaction volumes, one was Europe. I don't think that's changed a whole lot since we last spoke, although we do believe and now you can see the results that from time to time, very attractive investment opportunities will present themselves, which is by the way, a sound bite for all these issues. We tend to migrate to where there's concern in issues because oftentimes, if your underwriting's solid, you can exploit those opportunities for the benefit of the shareholders. So Europe is still there, that hasn't changed a lot. Fiscal cliff is, I guess, 3 months closer to likely occurring. I don't think the economy or related to that unemployment have gotten a whole lot better in the past 3 or 4 months. I think housing, depending on which survey you look at, it seems to have bottomed but it's kind of bumping along the bottom. The election will obviously drive an awful lot of what I suggested could be -- manifest itself in a grand bargain, maybe as early as the first quarter of 2013 and you still have sequestration. So the one issue that's come off the table was the Supreme Court decision. And I think almost immediately, as I had predicted, you saw that as a catalyst for M&A activity. You saw your Wellpoint and AMERIGROUP's merger, you've seen Genesis and Son and my guess is you'll see others. So that's the 30,000-foot view, James, if I tried to answer that. That said, things are looking increasingly attractive for our ability to make accretive transactions, for some of the reasons that we've talked about and quite frankly some other reason. I think you'll see us in terms of announced transaction volumes. I think you'll see us build through 2012 and early 2013, which is about as far out as our forward pipeline goes, a sequential month -- quarter-over-quarter increases in announced transaction volume. So second quarter was up from the first quarter, third quarter is going to be up from the second quarter, and I suspect fourth quarter will be up from the third quarter. And I think the key word that I referenced on our call last time was that we had very high-quality dialogue across our 5x5 model. And if you look at the deals that we've just announced today, you've got 4 different property types: medical office, post-acute, life science and senior housing, and you've got 3 different product types: DownREITs, mezz debt and the real estate. So I think you're really seeing the benefit of our business model here sourcing very attractive opportunities. And again, no promises but my guess is you're going to continue to see acceleration on this front in the near term for HCP. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citi. 
Quentin Velleley: Jay, just in terms of the $100 million of additional debt investment, can you just give us a little more flavor as to what that might be? What kind of yields it might be? What the underlying assets are likely to be and whether it's in the U.S. or offshore? 
James Flaherty: Yes. That's a commitment. That's one of the many pleasures as we've experienced the last 48 hours of having an earnings call on the last day of the month, which oftentimes, for accounting reasons and other reasons, is a good time to close transactions. So you'll see that be a debt investment, an attractive from an HCP shareholders standpoint, double-digit, high-yielding debt investment in post-acute/skilled space in the States would be how I'd handicap how that comes out. 
Quentin Velleley: Did you say in the U.S. or offshore? 
James Flaherty: I think I said in the U.S. 
Quentin Velleley: Okay. And then just in terms of The Boyer Company now managing a chunk of your medical office building, they've been an active developer. Is there anything else in their development pipeline that might be an opportunity for you guys in the future? 
James Flaherty: Yes, let me just -- I mean, this is -- I want to say this is the ninth or tenth transaction we've done with that family going back, I think, about a decade at this point. And you mentioned medical office, Quentin, but they've also -- they developed and manage our entire life science portfolio which doesn't get the credit that our Bay Area and San Diego life science portfolios get. But they manage -- they developed and managed the life science portfolio that we have in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. So we've been -- that's a long-standing, a very good relationship. We like the alignment that the DownREIT structure brings us. They've been very, very good partners, and they've got a very fine organization. And as you might imagine with a very fine organization, they continue to develop high-quality opportunities, and hopefully we'll continue to maintain that relationship going forward. 
Michael Bilerman: Jay, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. Just a question in terms of making sure I got the pipeline down correctly. You talked in your opening comments about having a significant pipeline as of the last call across the 5x5 model and you said it accelerated further. You talked about all the deals that has come about more recently. Are we -- I guess is the pipeline post those deals bigger than it was relative to the last quarter? Or did you effectively just close some of those significant transactions? 
James Flaherty: Yes, Michael. I think you misquoted me. I never used the word pipeline on our last call. I talked about significant dialogue across our 5x5 model. I think you've seen some of the results of that significant dialogue that we've talked about today. I suspect, as I've just indicated in response to a prior question, you'll continue to see results of that significant dialogue, but I've never talked about nor quantified the pipeline. 
Michael Bilerman: Right Maybe I've confused dialogue with pipeline. I guess from a capital perspective, obviously, you took advantage of the markets being able to equitize and have capacity to do transactions. And clearly with the cash balance you have on the balance sheet post the term loan, as well as an untapped line. You certainly have a lot of capacity to do transactions. I guess how much would you fill up in real estate and loans prior to injecting more equity in? And how should we think about, just from a debt perspective, is it $1 billion of real estate loans that you effectively from this point forward can fund before feeling the need that you want to put more equity on the balance sheet? 
James Flaherty: Again, we don't -- everything we do from a balance sheet standpoint is with an eye towards our long-term target leverage ratio, which to review is 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity. So seeing what we saw in the dialogue that we had off of our 5x5 model earlier this year, we obviously were very proactive in taking out some high coupon debt, some high coupon preferreds and with equity. And then now you're starting to see us build back or slightly below that 40-60 today, build back at 3.15% coupon for 10 years, 1.81% coupon for 4 years starting to see us extract value from those balance sheet maneuvers we do -- we did earlier this year. But we don't -- anything we would do would be in the context of 40-60 debt-to-equity, long-term target ratio, Michael. 
Michael Bilerman: And how about just from a debt-to-EBITDA perspective? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think that kind of falls out much like the fixed charge coverage ratio. You're starting to see very, very -- which is why really I guess for the third or fourth time, I'd encourage folks to look at Pages 6 and 7 of our supplemental. But take a look at the debt-to-EBITDA and take a look at the fixed charge coverage ratios and which I think is more representative. Take a look at them on a run rate of just the current quarter and you can begin to see why the fixed income investors have become begun to kind of recalibrate, if you will, the valuations for our fixed income securities. 
Michael Bilerman: Right. And then as you talked about next year's $900 million of debt rolling between the $550 million of bonds and another $370 million of mortgage debt, how quickly, just given the rate environment today and where spreads are and how attractive the recent financings for you have been, would you prefund any of that? Is any of that earlier '13 versus later '13? Would you sort of warehouse capital, more capital today for that? 
James Flaherty: No, I think and again, just to calibrate this, so you're seeing what's going on with our same-property performance. You've heard us talk about -- it used to be 3.5% but now you can see it's 4% same-property performance levered 40-60 gets you the 6.5% FAD per share with growth, with no external acquisitions. If you then layer in, pick an improvement in terms of that 5.9% on that debt that you just referenced that matures next year, I don't know if it's 300 basis points or 200 basis points or something in the middle. But you do the math on that, you layer that into what we've already got kind of contractual with the FAD growth, you can start -- you continue to grow the dividend, reduce the payout ratio and be clipping coupons here until the cows come home. So I think that's going to be there for us. And again, I don't think, to Ross's earlier question, I don't think this is some momentary drop in cost of capital. I think the macro trends that have brought all this together are going to stay with us for a while. Barclays just last week made a call on the 10-year, touching 1.2% before the end of the year. So if you look at the maturities, Michael, on that debt that you referenced, most of that is back-end loaded. And I suspect given the other opportunities we have, most notably the accretive deal dialogue we've got going on, my guess is we'll deploy our capital to take advantage of those and then wait for the maturing debt opportunities, which are back-end loaded in '13 to present themselves, much like we did earlier this year with the debt issuance, the debt retirements we made. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of Macquarie. 
Nicholas Yulico: Just had a quick one on HCR ManorCare on the OpCo investment. How does that actually -- how does the accounting work for that in that -- I mean, it seems like you guys are booking some income. It seems like the investment was marked up in the quarter, and so I'm just trying to understand what are the drivers of that on the income statement and balance sheet? 
Timothy Schoen: I think the way we account for that is in the equity method for the investment. And it causes a recharacterization of part of our rent that we get from the leases because we have a 10% interest in the OpCo so. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. So I mean it's only a slight-pick up but it did -- the investment did get -- the value of that did go up in the quarter. Does that somehow mean that in the quarter there was actual income that you guys were sort of booking from that investment? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, yes, we have continual income from that investment and there haven't been distributions, so. 
James Flaherty: But we haven't marked up. 
Timothy Schoen: We don't mark up the investment methods. We carry that our basis, and then as the investment makes -- as OpCo makes money, the investment increases. 
Nicholas Yulico: Right, okay. So to the extent that the investment balance is increasing in a quarter, it means that you're actually collecting income, you're not changing the way you're accounting for the investment on the balance sheet? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, it's not a mark-to-market method like you would think it was with a security like stock. I think that's where you're going. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then just wanted a quick question on the hospitals. Jay, just interested to hear your opinion on whether you think some of the consolidation of operators there is going to create some more real estate opportunities, investment opportunities over the next year? 
James Flaherty: Absolutely, just like you're going to see operator consolidation in hospitals, you'll see operator consolidation in post-acute skilled. You'll see operator consolidation quite possibly in senior housing. So that's the next -- we're moving into the maturing of the health care services sector in the country. And when that happens, you get all sorts of consolidation and we feel we are very well positioned, in large part because of the quality of the operating partners we have in our portfolio, and they're in turn likelihood that they will be the consolidators as opposed to the consolidatees to do well in this next period of -- what we expect will be very, very active transaction volumes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Mains of Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Robert Mains: Not a whole lot left. A couple of boring numbers questions. First, Paul, to beat the RIDEA thing to death. You explained that you're doing some repositioning. There's also some expense migration between the 2 quarters. If I do that and I still see a little bit of a drop in NOI, that would be explained by the repositioning that you're doing primarily? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes. 
Robert Mains: Okay. And then, Tim, the $7 million GOPO reserve, was that addition to reserve or a released prior-period reserves? 
Timothy Schoen: No, that was -- that -- on our insurance recovery, the $7 million insurance recovery, that's actually a recovery, but not a charge. I misspoke. It's a $0.02 insurance recovery. I should know you'd catch that, Rob. 
Robert Mains: Okay. So the way I should look at that is that without that G&A, would have been $21.5 million or whatever? 
Timothy Schoen: You're right. That would be, our G&A run rate is $20 million is a good run rate, $19 million to $20 million during the quarter. 
Robert Mains: Fair enough. And then last question on the MOB transactions, this is an asset class that you've been pretty quiet in for a while. And it seems that you're getting some pretty attractive cap rates on that. Should I look at this as being kind of one-off deals or are there -- do you sense kind of a loosening of that market where we've been seeing a lot of stuff from the 6s? 
James Flaherty: Rob, I think we like to talk about the deals that we do, and so we think that those are really -- I mean, those are, with the exception of quite possibly the Medcap deal with HCA back in '03, which augured the arrival of Mr. Gallagher to the company, those are the 2 highest quality MOB portfolios. In terms of age, I think that Boyer portfolio's average age is 8 years old and then you got a lot of, not just on campus but big boy and big girl hospital systems, leading market share systems. And Scottsdale medical, Paul and I have spent an awful lot of time over there in the last couple of months with Tom Klaritch and our MOB colleagues and that's just a wonderful portfolio. So I think these are -- we're probably more excited than that probably. We are more excited about the quality of that real estate and the quality of those hospital systems than we are the economics and, by the way, the economics are pretty darn good. 
Robert Mains: Okay. But I shouldn't read into this as there is -- suddenly, you're seeing a lot of similar quality type opportunities out there. You've been -- We've always been waiting for the MOB assets to kind of get shaken loose, but I assume that this isn't a harbinger necessarily. 
James Flaherty: I guess time will tell. We've got, as I said, I don't know if I mentioned to you before but we've got a very active dialogue across our 5x5 model, and the MOB property type is absolutely represented in that dialogue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Jay, a quick question. You guys have a lot of really good stuff going on in regards to raising same-store NOI growth. You have all this accretive acquisitions that are hitting the numbers. You've got the $0.02 pickup from the insurance recovery. And I guess with all that suddenly in the pot, I'm just a little bit surprised that guidance didn't come up more. Is there something I'm missing on the negative side that's offsetting some of that stuff? 
James Flaherty: No. I mean, I think if you take a look at our portfolio, the vast majority of it is contractual. So while we love the fact that we're exceeding our budgets and you're seeing that manifest itself in consecutive quarter-over-quarter increases in Same Property Performance, we don't have a lot of the portfolio exposed to variability. So I think that's one thing. I think we've got very attractive organic growth rate, and we've got the ability to supplement that with accretive external acquisitions. But I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Tayo, obviously, we have partial year on those acquisitions. That's part of it, as well as the fact that we did end up raising capital very attractive rates and on very attractive terms in advance of these acquisitions, so that's some of it. Obviously, I did mention several small items that went the other way for $0.01. So I think that probably covers it for you. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then just again, I know that RIDEA thing and we'd kind of talked about that a little bit. But again, the repositioning that's happening, was that primarily in the assisted living side because that's where you saw the biggest drop in occupancy. 
James Flaherty: Well, no. I mean, the business opportunity set that Brookdale and ourselves identified was one of largely an independent living portfolio. And to bring that into the Brookdale family with their ancillary revenue capabilities and to take advantage of our attractive cost of capital and reposition that portfolio. So that's -- Paul will expand on that here, but that's the opportunity [indiscernible]. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, Tayo, on that assisted living piece, that's 3 assets. And when you take into account Brookdale's new methodology, what we had in the first quarter supplemental, the 91.6% occupancy, would come down to 82.8%, and that's primarily because there's a lot of memory care in there and double occupancy. And based on the way they're accounting it, it has an impact. Now if you look at where it's actually coming in at, it's up 70 basis points this particular quarter versus the first quarter, utilizing the new methodology. And that's just more occupancy methodology doesn't have anything to do with impacting income or anything of that nature. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, okay. So if I just take a look at the total for the RIDEA assets, the total occupancy in 1Q '12 under the new methodology, what would that number be versus the 86.5% for this quarter? 
Paul Gallagher: For which assets? 
Omotayo Okusanya: For the RIDEA portfolio? 
Paul Gallagher: I think I said 86.9% in the transcripts, apples-to-apples, Tayo. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. 
Todd Stender: How do you feel about how much you've allocated so far to the Four Seasons deal? Are there other opportunities within the capital stack that you'd either take advantage of just to insulate your current investment or potentially just get a bigger seat at the table on an eventual outcome? 
James Flaherty: Yes, good question, Todd. Well first off, it was very important from -- for that very question that we'd be at least 75% of that senior unsecured tranche Todd, which is where we are actually but over that. We fought long and hard about a larger play there that might have morphed into a larger investment but would've taken us into the more senior spot in the capital stack. And we've evaluated that risk return, but at that point of the capital stack, it's much less about risk and much more about return and felt we negotiated a good outcome for our shareholders with sticking at the unsecured. But those are decisions and those are layers of the capital stack that Paul and his team are well traveled in, both from an HCA standpoint, from an HCR standpoint, from a Genesis standpoint. And a lot about the lessons and experiences that we took from those 3 prior transactions were on full display in this one. So I think the answer to -- I think bottom line is, it's 75% of that senior unsecured tranche, we feel very good about what that gets us. I think to have gone more senior would have been accretive but not nearly as accretive as what we've got. And if you look south of us, where you've got 40% of the acquisition value in equity, we feel very comfortable there. I think, and this is why I think it's hypothetical that this will end up resulting in us actually owning the real estate and thus there's a REIT play. But you might just remind, were we to end up -- were all that equity to hypothetically go away, what would the economics be that we would own that real estate, Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: The EBITDA yield to last dollar, if you will, was 18%. 
James Flaherty: Which is why we think it's highly unlikely we find ourselves in that scenario, but were we to find ourselves in that scenario, that, you could argue, would be an even more attractive outcome than the one we think we've struck with both the investment we made and in the corresponding 4-year debt placement to lock in that 1,100-basis point spread. 
Todd Stender: Okay, that's helpful. And just with regard to the 2 MOB portfolios that you've got under contract, how much do you think, if any, the Supreme Court ruling influence the sellers in bringing those to market? 
James Flaherty: Zero. 
Todd Stender: Okay. And then just to kind of finish up, Jay, you gave very good color in the memory care segment, the HCR ManorCare portfolio. What's the occupancy, would you say, in that stand-alone portfolio? It's probably one segment of the senior housing business that we hear most about where there's a pretty good imbalance between demand and supply. Is there anything that you can break out just to... 
James Flaherty: Yes, we're going to -- you should assume that, that's kind of mid-80s. There's -- because of the increasing incidence of that affliction, you're starting to see some significant ramping up of occupancy for that Arden Court portfolio and expansion of margins and things like that. We think this is a very attractive piece, albeit small, of the senior housing space. We think we've got a very meaningful amount of critical mass in the stand-alone piece. And over the course of the next 12 to 15 months, you may see us shine a little brighter light and potentially invest some additional capital into this space if the demand that we suspect is coming, in fact, turns out to be true. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back to Jay Flaherty, Chairman and CEO. 
James Flaherty: Okay, everyone. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your summer. Stay cool. Go U.S. at the Olympics, and we'll see you in the fall. Take care. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-01 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Anita, and I will be you coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead, sir. 
John Lu: Thank you, Anita. Good afternoon and good morning. Some of the statements made during today’s conference call will contain forward-looking statements, including the statements about our guidance. These statements are made as of today’s date and reflect the company’s good faith, beliefs and best judgment based upon currently available information. The statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are described from time to time in the company’s press releases and SEC filings.
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, as well as certain related disclosures, in our supplemental information package and earnings release, each of which has been furnished to the SEC today and is available on our website at www.hcpi.com.
 I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, John, and welcome to HCP's 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen. Let us begin with a review of our first quarter release of this morning. And for that, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. Let me start with our first quarter results. Our real estate portfolio performance exceeded plan, generating same property cash NOI growth of 4.7% compared to the first quarter of 2011. The results were primarily driven by contractual rent increases and a one-time rent payment of $4 million from Google. Paul will review our performance by segment in a few minutes.
 We reported FFO as $0.64 per share, which included a nonrecurring charge of $0.03 per share in conjunction with the redemption of all outstanding preferred stock with a weighted average dividend yield of 7.15%. The redemption charge pertains to the non-cash write-off of the original issuance cost.
 Excluding this charge, FFO, as adjusted for the quarter, was $0.67 per share and FAD was $0.54 per share, representing year-over-year increases of 20% and 10%, respectively, primarily driven by last year's HCR ManorCare acquisition and strong 2012 cash, Same Property Performance.
 During the quarter, we made investments of $40 million to fund development and other capital projects, and sold one medical office building for $7 million, recognizing a gain of $3 million.
 Turning now to financing activities and balance sheet. On the capital markets front, we were active during the first quarter and raised $809 million consisting of: $450 million of 7-year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 3.75%; and $359 million of common stock at a price of $39.93 per share. Proceeds from these offerings were primarily used to clear out the revolver balance at year end and redeem all outstanding preferred stock at par. On April 23, we retired our Series E and Series F preferred stock for a total of $296 million. Going forward, this equity for preferred swap will be accretive to FAD in 2012 and further strengthen our fixed charge coverage ratio. 
 In addition, during the quarter, we improved the terms of our revolving credit facility that included lowering the funded interest cost by 55 basis points and extending the maturity one additional year to March 2016. Our undrawn revolver provides up to $1.5 billion of immediate liquidity at a current rate of LIBOR plus 1.075%.
 Pro forma for the cash used to redeem the $296 million of preferred stock in April, we ended the quarter with $50 million of unrestricted cash.
 Our remaining 2012 debt maturities total $317 million, of which $250 million relates to the 6.45% senior unsecured notes maturing next month.
 Finally, updates to our 2012 guidance. Based on stronger-than-forecasted performance to date, we are raising our full year, cash same property growth to a range of 3.25% to 4.25%, up 25 basis points from our February guidance. We are updating our FFO guidance to range from $2.68 to $2.74 per share, which is $0.02 lower than our last guidance. This change is primarily due to the $0.03 first quarter preferred stock redemption charge mentioned earlier, less an additional $0.01 for several small items, offset by a positive $0.02 from an insurance recovery of $7 million received in the second quarter for past G&A expenses and increased Same Property Performance.
 Excluding the preferred stock redemption charge, we are raising our 2012 FFO as adjusted to range from $2.71 to $2.77 per share, which is $0.01 higher than our previous FFO guidance. We are also raising our 2012 FAD guidance to a range of $2.16 to $2.22 per share, up $0.02 from our last guidance. The increase is driven by the same $0.01 net benefit mentioned in FFO as adjusted and a $0.01 accretive impact from redeeming the preferred stock with equity and the improved revolver pricing.
 Finally, a quick note on guidance regarding comparability for our next quarter's results. Recall that we recognized a gain of $35 million or $0.09 per share from our Genesis debt investments in the second quarter of 2011, which will result in some lumpiness in our year-over-year earnings comparison next quarter. Excluding the $0.09 Genesis gain last year, our updated 2012 FFO as adjusted and FAD guidance at the midpoint are projected to grow by 5.4% and 6.8%, respectively.
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul? 
Paul Gallagher: Thanks, Tim. Now let me review HCP's first quarter portfolio performance. 
 Senior housing. Occupancy in our same property senior housing platform was 85.7%, a 20 basis point sequential increase over the prior quarter and a 60 basis point decrease over the prior year.
 Same-store cash flow coverage for the portfolio declined 3 basis points to 1.15x, driven by outsized fixed rent bumps on our transitioned assets. Current quarter year-over-year same property cash NOI growth for the senior housing platform was up 1.9%. Growth was driven by normal rent steps including higher rents for assist -- assets transition to new operators offset by a decline in working capital recoveries collected from transitioned assets. Net of the effects of working capital, NOI increased 3.5%.
 In our RIDEA portfolio, occupancy decreased 100 basis points sequentially to 88.5%. Rates increased 4% over the first quarter 2011 and margins remained strong at 41% with the portfolio performing at budget.
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. Coverages in our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio metrics now reflect one quarter of lower reinvestment [ph] rates under CMS' 2012 final rule for therapy. HCR's fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.53x, a 13 basis point decrease from the trailing 12-month period ended December 31, 2011.
 Adjusting for nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter 2011, the fixed charge coverage for the same period was 1.57x.
 Preliminary results for the first quarter of 2012 are consistent with the fourth quarter of 2011.
 Cash flow coverage in our legacy portfolio was 1.64x, a 20-basis-point decrease over the prior quarter and a 3-basis-point increase over the prior year. Year-over-year same property cash NOI for the first quarter increased 3.3%, driven by normal rent steps.
 Hospitals. Same property cash flow coverage increased 23 basis points to 4.52x, driven by strong fourth quarter performance at our Medical City Dallas and Hoag Irvine Hospital. Year-over-year same property cash NOI for the first quarter increased 3.8%. 
 In March 2012, HCP reached an agreement with the principals of Delphis and Cirrus Health regarding guarantor collateral securing the Delphis loan. In the aggregate, HCP received $6.5 million in cash and other consideration, which was applied to the carrying value of the loan, reducing the carrying value from $75.7 million to $69.2 million. We continue to work with the borrower towards the orderly liquidation of the primary collateral. Cirrus is in negotiations to sell 3 of its performing hospitals, with a projected net sales proceeds in excess of HCP's current carrying value of the loan.
 Medical Office Buildings. Same property cash NOI for the first quarter was up 3%. The growth was a result of normal rent steps coupled with expense controls resulting in over $500,000 of operating expense savings versus the first quarter of 2011. Our MOB occupancy for the first quarter decreased 30 basis points to 91.2%. Leasing activity improved in Minnesota, Virginia and Kentucky. During the quarter, tenants representing 440,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 376,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Our year-to-date average retention rate was 81.4%.
 Renewals for the quarter occurred at 0.8% higher mark-to-market rents with the average term for new and renewal leases at 58 months. We have 1.39 million square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2012, including 235,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. Our leasing pipeline includes new and renewal prospects, totals 1.12 million square feet, addressing 81% of our remaining 2012 rollover exposure.
 During the quarter, we executed leases totaling 68,000 square feet at our Knoxville and Alaska redevelopment projects, bringing the total leased occupancy to 60% for both assets.
 On February 29, we sold our Southwest Medical MOB in St. Louis for $7 million at a sub-6 cap rate, generating a gain of $3 million.
 Life science. Occupancy for our life science portfolio decreased 80 basis points to 89.1%. The decrease was due to the completion of 2 redevelopment projects that were placed into the operating portfolio. Same property cash NOI was up 10.9% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by a nonrecurring rent payment of $4 million associated with Google's lease amendment, as well contractual rent increases. Absent the one-time Google rent payment, NOI for the quarter was up 3.5%.
 As mentioned in our last call, HCP entered into a lease amendment with Google to lease an additional 41,000 square feet at a mark-to-market increase of 17%. The amendment included an upfront cash payment of $4 million and an extension of the term for 200 -- 124,000 square feet of existing space to 2022 to be coterminous with the expansion.
 Google's total lease commitment is 290,000 square feet or 37% of our 100% Mountain View campus. HCP completed the redevelopment of a 97,000 square-foot life science campus in South San Francisco, which is 28% pre-leased to a new portfolio tenant, Counsyl, a genetic testing company. Additionally, we completed the conversion of our 53,000 square-foot project in San Diego from office to lab for Cibus, a bio-agricultural company, who now leases 100% of the project.
 These completions reduce our life science development pipeline to 2 redevelopment projects and 1 development project, totaling 198,000 square feet. The total funding requirement for the development pipeline are $32 million.
 For the quarter, we completed 289,000 square feet of leasing with the retention rate of 82.3% on expiring space. The life science portfolio has only 127,000 square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2012, including approximately 29,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. To address these expirations, we have over 300,000 square feet of activity on this space. We are beginning to see supply inventories in the Bay Area and San Diego decrease, driven largely by improved office fundamentals as well as an increase in clean tech and traditional R&D requirements. We continue to focus on high-quality prospects and believe our campuses are well located to capture opportunities in both current vacancies and near-term expirations.
 Sustainability. As a result of HCP's sustainability initiatives, utility costs continue to yield positive economic results. On a same property basis, utility expenses were down $460,000 versus the first quarter of 2011. In addition, we received another 10 ENERGY STAR labels during the quarter, 6 of which were in our MOB portfolio and 4 in our life science portfolio. This brings HCP's total ENERGY STAR labels to 68 across MOB, life science and senior housing portfolios.
 With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jay. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Paul. We are in an exceptionally nice spot right now. First, our portfolio continues to outperform, allowing us to raise our Same Property Performance and FAD guidance for 2012 after just one quarter of results for the year.
 Secondly, with a very active quarter of financing, our balance sheet metrics are their strongest in history. 
 Third, our sustainability initiatives continue to produce successful outcomes. 
 And finally, our 5x5 business model is sourcing a significant level of high-quality acquisition opportunities.
 With that summary, Paul, Tim and I are delighted to take your questions. Anita? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital. 
Adam Feinstein: Bryan Sekino here also. Jay, maybe just as a starting point, maybe just talk a little bit about the deal environment. And clearly, you guys have a very strong balance sheet and a lot of opportunities for deals. But just curious to get your thoughts in terms of just the types of deals that you're seeing, and, I guess, with the financing markets being very strong, I guess just what are the implications and so just -- so I guess a bigger picture question, but just curious in terms of what your updated thoughts are about the deal environment? 
James Flaherty: Yes, that's great. I would say we're in a funny period right now. And probably, it's most analogous to the 6 months that existed prior to the passage of health care reform. And, Adam and Bryan, if you recall, for those 6 months, the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, we saw a complete absence of acquisition activity. And then with the March 2010 passage of health care reform, it was as if -- almost as if a whistle blew to start the football game. And what a game it was, with the ensuing 12 months of transaction volumes exceeding the prior 3 years combined. Fast-forward to now. You have the likely June 2012 Supreme Court ruling on the validity of the health care reform bill. You've got the sequestration at year end, which is likely to give rise to the mother of all lame-duck sessions. You've got pending CMS reimbursement rulings. You've got the November Presidential election. And if that's not enough, you've got the European economy largely in a recession at this point, continued Middle East tension and a subpar U.S. economic recovery. In anticipation of this very significant ramp in transaction activity, I don't it's any real mystery as to what we've been doing. We've simplified and strengthened our balance sheet. We've repriced our $1.5 billion revolver on very favorable terms, we've banked some excess cash, and we've made sure, that for our existing portfolio, all the trains are running on time so that have minimal distractions going forward. So that's how I'd -- that's the observation I think I'd make, Adam. 
Adam Feinstein: Okay, that's very helpful. Maybe one quick follow-up question. Jay, just -- if I could follow up on the acquisitions or investments that you guys are seeing in your 5x5 model, just maybe if you could provide us with some additional color on the types of investments that you're seeing, be it similar loan-to-own strategies that you've done in the past or some loans for CapEx that you've done with Brookdale, could you -- if you could provide us any color, that would be helpful. 
James Flaherty: Again, I think, if you -- understanding our 5x5 model the way you guys do, which is to say that while there may be 25 hypothetical areas for us to focus on, there really are less than half that. The interesting thing right now is that we've got very significant dialogue across each of those 10 or 11 target areas. So it certainly includes the ones that you've indicated, but it's broad-based. And in my experience, Paul's experience, the best leading indicator, if you will, as to what sort of acquisition volumes you end up closing at a given point in time is absolutely the quality and the intensity and the breadth of the dialogue. And that's quite strong right now. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Derek Bower with UBS. 
Derek Bower: Just a follow-up on the acquisition commentary. Just in light of the prior comments, given that you've been pretty quiet on the deal front over the last few quarters, especially compared to your peers, can you just comment if that's more a reflection on your view of private market valuations or if perhaps there's more larger deals on the table that may be occupying your investment team's time, just if you could comment on that. 
James Flaherty: Yes, I think I'd just reiterate, Derek, my earlier comment that within the context of our 5x5 model, we've got extremely active dialogue right now. 
Derek Bower: Okay, fair enough. And then on just on the RIDEA operating margins, the 41%, is there a seasonal benefit there in the 1Q that we should be thinking about? And how do you expect that to trend for the remainder of the year? 
Paul Gallagher: We would probably expect it to trend over the course of the year up a little bit, but probably no seasonality in that particular number. 
James Flaherty: Derek, if you go back to the high-water mark of that portfolio, which I guess would have been about 3 years ago, I think at one point, those margins touched 42%. So again, this is -- we're pleased with -- we're early days still. We've only got, I guess, 2 quarters in the books, but we're pleased with the performance of that portfolio, with what Brookdale is doing there and very much validates our approach on that particular portfolio, to use -- to move away from a triple net structure and use RIDEA there. 
Derek Bower: Great, got it. And then just lastly, the 4.7% cash NOI growth, what would that number be excluding the Google lease? 
Timothy Schoen: Excluding the Google lease for life science, that would be in the 3.5% range. 
Derek Bower: Do you know what it would be for the entire portfolio? 
Timothy Schoen: Actually, it would be -- I'm sorry, for life science, it would be closer to 3%. For the entire portfolio, on a normalized basis, it would be around 3%. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jorel Guilloty with Morgan Stanley. 
Wilfredo Guilloty: I want to get some clarity on Paul's comment regarding the 1Q '12 HCR ManorCare exposure ratio. So Paul mentioned that the results were consistent with 4Q, does this mean that the coverage ratios for 1Q '12 are expected to be 1.57x? 
James Flaherty: No, the 1.57, Jorel, is a 12-month. We had disclosed on the -- so that's a 12-month. Fourth quarter was the first quarter of the roll down in the RUGs-IV benefit. 
Wilfredo Guilloty: Yes. 
James Flaherty: But Paul said that the first quarter of 2012, which is actually the second quarter of activity without the RUGs-IV benefit, is consistent with the fourth quarter. 
Wilfredo Guilloty: Okay. But no -- I guess there's no coverage ratio that you announced as of now for that? 
James Flaherty: We -- what we just said, it's consistent. So we typically show our quarterly coverages in our triple net lease portfolio on a trailing quarter basis. 
Wilfredo Guilloty: Okay. The other question I have is even though the cuts have been in place for about 6 months now, do you feel comfortable with the post 1.5x fixed charge coverage ratio that you suggested for HCR ManorCare previously? 
Paul Gallagher: I suggested for -- we are very, very comfortable with how HCR has made the transition to the new cost environment. In part, they've done it by cost reductions, but their real focus has been maintaining and increasing their capability to care for complex patients. And they've got the largest share of that resident population, and we expect that share will grow here over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill. 
James Milam: I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the acquisitions. I guess 2 things. One bigger picture, and I know, Jay, you've kind of touched on this a couple times. But are there specific portfolios or assets that you guys have your eye on in case there is maybe a disruption in the capital markets given the risk that you presented? And then second, can you just talk a little bit about the buyer of the St. Louis MOB? And what type of institution that was? And if you think there are more buyers out there willing to pay, what seems like low yields to us, just given I guess, kind of the search for yield in the environment that's going on right now? 
James Flaherty: Yes, sure. Let me take the second question first. The buyer of that MOB was actually the hospital system. So as is often the case, we've talked about this in the past, with the advent of increasing technology, medical office buildings, which maybe 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, were primarily used for office visits. With the technology advances, you're now seeing noninvasive kind of procedures that don't require a stay in hospital, moving into the medical office building portfolio. So this hospital had a strategic interest in acquiring that, and that's what happened. So that's -- I think that's one of the benefits of having on-campus medical office buildings, quite frankly. With respect to your first question, in terms of the acquisition activity, again, the dialogue we have within our 5x5 model now is -- relates to very, very specific transaction opportunities. And so they certainly include some of the ones that you've alluded to. 
James Milam: Okay, great. And then just a quick one on the ManorCare, HCR ManorCare OpCo coverage. So it sounds like some of the reason why that fell a little bit more relative to -- I guess for one-time items in the quarter, are those things like severance cost and just things that had to do with dealing with the impact of the Medicare cuts? Is that the right way to think about that? 
James Flaherty: The fourth quarter of 2012 was the first quarter of a lot of the reductions in cost structure they put in place. But you've also got some kind of normal, at least normal for HCR, kind of fourth quarter true-up things relating to insurance reserves and things like that. 
James Milam: Okay. And would you guys be willing to provide sort of an annualized number off that fourth quarter result? Or do we need to kind of wait and see how the full year impact comes in? 
James Flaherty: We can provide it if you want. I'm not sure that, that would be terribly relevant because I think you'll see HCR performance continuing to improve as they fully have now transitioned to the new environment. And so, you can do anything you want with numbers, but I think their core business platform is performing nicely. But more importantly, from our standpoint, it's gaining momentum. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: I have a question related to senior housing. One of the more successful areas in senior housing over the past couple of years has been memory care. But when I talk to people in the industry conferences and so forth, it seems like there's a lot of interest about development and redevelopment of the assisted living facilities into more memory care type units. I'm just kind of curious as to what your thoughts were on the memory care space in particular, and then what you're seeing in terms of overall development activity in senior housing, more broadly. 
James Flaherty: Well, I think we're big proponents of the memory care. In fact we've funded a number of expansions or redevelopments, if you will, of our existing independent living and senior housing, to position our portfolio for that. In fact, that was one of the key reasons we went with Brookdale on the RIDEA joint venture we have. That was a central thought there in terms of the, a, the opportunity, but more importantly, Brookdale's ancillary revenue platform. So that's absolutely a trend that we like, a trend that we've taken advantage of, and a trend that we anticipate will continue going forward. I don't think we're in the camp where we would want to develop our own standalone memory care properties, Jeff. I think we view that as again, part of a continuum within either an actual CCRC sort of setting or effectively, a virtual CCRC setting when you've got operators that are in the process of putting critical mass into local markets. Now with respect to the second part of your question, which was development. Realize that we've got about a 5 or a 6 community development program right now that we talked about, Paul talked about in some length on last call. That is going well. It's -- we're ahead of where we thought we'd be. But I think we're going to be very moderate and disciplined in terms of ramping that up. I could see us continuing to grow that, but I don't think you should expect that to be doubling or tripling in terms of the shareholder capital that we deployed at that opportunity. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay. And then just in terms of competition from other people on the supply side, are you seeing that pick up yet or not so much? 
James Flaherty: There's some new supply, but it's minimal. I mean I think one of the things we benefit from is it's still, the construction financing made available by the banks, it's still quite minimal. My guess is if you start to continue to see some improvement in the U.S. economy, I think that will probably increase a little bit, at which point, you could see some additional supply. But for now, we're in a nice spot given our cost of capital advantage and our ability to deploy that with the sort of programs that we've got going right now. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Dan Bernstein: Jay, I just wanted to go back to your original -- your first comments about risks that are coming in the economy, Congress and the election. If you had to rank in order your concerns, what would they be? Is it, all of it together concern you, or are there certain items within that, that are causing you to be concerned? 
James Flaherty: I don't really view them as concerns. I view them as catalysts for some opportunities. I think our stepping off point is that the portfolio that we have constructed right now is, if not bulletproof, extremely well protected, to whatever might come our way. If you're at 3.5% to 4% Same Property Performance, cash, for this year, next year, the year after, and you lever that 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity, that gets you to plus or minus 6% of FAD growth, with not a lot of things that are going to go bump in the night. So that's our starting off point, which was the last part of my comment, that right now, in addition to the moves that Tim and Matt have made with respect to the balance sheet and the revolver, Paul's got the portfolio really humming, which is nice because we don't have to spend time allocating resources, time resources to things that aren't humming along. So that's very good. So I think that's the most important part from HCP shareholders' standpoint. I think going forward, I think a lot of the stuff is more -- not that there's going to be necessarily a good result or a bad result, but it'll just be, the uncertainty will clear. And that's why I made the analogy to the March 2010 passage of the health care reform. A lot of the deals that ensued for the next 12 months, the economics didn't necessarily change a whole lot because of health care reform. It was just that the uncertainty was removed. And I think that's a little bit of what's going on with that. I would say the most -- absolutely, the most important of the issues that I flag there is the pace of the U.S. economy. And then related to that, the U.S. housing market and the unemployment. I think those are the 3 things that we watch the most. 
Dan Bernstein: And you've refinanced a lot of, I guess, preferred, and you fixed your balance sheet this quarter. It looked like there was some debt in the JVs that are also higher cost. Is that correct? Is there any opportunities to refinance some of the debt in the JVs and maybe get a little bit extra cash flow out of those? 
James Flaherty: Well, the big opportunity -- the big near-term opportunity, of course, is next month's $250 million of 6.45% debt. Obviously, you can see, in terms of where our existing debt trades, that's a very significant opportunity. Away from that, there are certainly some secured debt in the joint ventures. For the most part, kind of, I think the make-whole penalties and things like that, make that relatively unattractive from our standpoint. We'd prefer to be taking that capital and growing the portfolio by external acquisitions. Tim? 
Timothy Schoen: Dan, on a pro rata basis, the -- our share of that JV [ph] debt's only about $9 million for 2012. 
James Flaherty: In terms of what's maturing. 
Timothy Schoen: In terms of what's maturing. So that's a very small number for the next couple of years. It's actually $11 million, $12 million over the next couple of years. 
Dan Bernstein: And then the other question I had is on the RIDEA assets. The occupancy was down 1% in the quarter. And obviously there's always seasonality in 1Q. But your same store occupancy on the leased assets was up. So if you can talk about maybe the differences in those portfolios and what may be causing that difference, is it asset type, geography or... 
James Flaherty: No, I think you should view that portfolio as not stabilized right now. Remember, we're affecting, with our operating partner, Brookdale, a fair amount of change there. We're repositioning some of those communities. We're expanding some of those communities. We're putting some memory care in some of those communities. So we're putting -- like in Houston, we're doing a very large dining upgrade. So I think, notwithstanding that, we've had a nice move on rates and the margin is what it is. So again, this completely validates our thought process there to -- that we would have a better economic return for our shareholders by positioning that with a quality partner like Brookdale in a RIDEA format, as a triple net. That'll continue to perform well and increase its performance over the next 12 months. 
Dan Bernstein: But I shouldn't play too much on quarter-to-quarter? 
James Flaherty: I think the better thing will be to look out 12 months and then look back and -- I think we -- remember, when we bought the joint venture out, I believe, we talked about the fact that while we had bought it with -- at a cap rate of 7.7% in terms of trailing 12 months in-place income, we felt that with what Brookdale could do with their model over an 18- to 24-month timeframe, that you could see that adjusted cap rate reset from 7.7% up to 9%. And we still feel good about that opportunity, Dan. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: Just a couple of quick questions, and then a bigger picture question. I guess to Tim, was the insurance recovery that you're expecting in the second quarter and the $4 million Google payment, in your previous guidance, or are those new additions to the new guidance? 
Timothy Schoen: The insurance recovery and the Google payment was in our guidance. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. That's what I thought. And, Jay, just maybe to refine the acquisition question a little bit for you, what -- of the 5x5 matrix that you talk about, what property type within that, do you think fits best in an environment that you're describing, with a lot of uncertainty, that you would say, this is the -- maybe the least risky or the best fit in the environment that you're in right now? 
James Flaherty: Well, if you want to call the ballgame based on lowest risk, that would probably be... 
Richard Anderson: I think risk is part of the conversation, but... 
James Flaherty: I'm just thinking your question. You defined the question in terms of risk. If you want to know what the lowest risk piece of our economic business model is, it's probably on-campus medical office buildings where the hospital is the #1 or #2 market share hospital system in a growing area. But that's just, that was -- from our standpoint, we wouldn't stop there. That would be an important input, but the opportunity to increase cash flow once a property or portfolio of properties is acquired, the valuation, there's a whole lot of other elements that go into that decision to pull the trigger. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. But what would be some of those other elements where you'll pull the trigger in this environment? 
James Flaherty: Valuation, condition, i.e. fiscal obsolescence, CapEx obsolescence of the portfolio that we're acquiring, quality of the counter party, both from the standpoint of -- you've heard me talk forever about, we want to have counter parties that have 3 criteria: quality outcomes, efficient operations and critical mass. So those are the whole -- it's kind of a -- it's a large algorithm that comes into play. 
Richard Anderson: Do you think life sciences is well placed right now in this environment? 
James Flaherty: I think life science located in one of the 4 or 5 concentrations that are the recipients of the NIH grants is how I'd start that discussion. However, then you have to get and look at the characterization of the tenants. Are they more VC-backed private companies that are working 1 or 2 drugs through a Phase I, Phase II, Phase III ultimately FDA approval process? That would have a lot of risk associated with it. Or are they very substantial companies like Amgen, like Genentech, like Takeda, like Pfizer, like Google, like LinkedIn, sorry. That would have a different element to it. And then I think you really need to think about -- this isn't going to impact anything in terms of 2012, 2013. And we could have blinders on because we're sitting out here in the, what used to be known as the Golden State. But if the U.S., over the next several years, if because of fiscal policy, monetary policy, the U.S. economy as a whole begins to look like California, then I think we need to be cognizant of the country losing its leading position in life science expertise. I think you folks have probably seen the net move-outs versus move-ins in the state of California. There was a piece over the weekend that now even indicated that we've got the reverse migration out to Mexico, which is a huge sea change for the last couple of years. So if a lot of those things continue to not be addressed by Washington and, effectively, the can is kicked down the road, at some point, there's going to be an impairment, I think, in the nation's global leadership position in life science. So that's something that we watch. Again, that's not going to change overnight, but I think we've got to be thinking about that. 
Richard Anderson: And then lastly, just, I think more of a comment. I think your coverage or your unwillingness to provide an outlook on a full year coverage, including all of full year CMS cuts on your HCR ManorCare portfolio, I mean, I think it's probably fairly easy math. I don't think anyone just thinks it's going to be an absolute disaster with that quality portfolio. But I think maybe if you provided some color, like many of your peers are doing, that would relieve some tension, in my opinion. And I just offer that, and hopefully you can reconsider and provide us a number in the next conference call. 
James Flaherty: Well, we'll certainly take it under advisement. They're just not -- as you know, there's not a lot moving around. But we like to give guidance on our company's results. We think it's a little inappropriate for us to be giving guidance on another company's results, particularly when they have their own strategic plan that they're... 
Richard Anderson: You can take their results out of it, and just say what happens to your results in terms of coverage. Anyway... 
James Flaherty: We're certainly willing to take a peek at that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi. 
Quentin Velleley: Just in terms of, I guess, some of the uncertainty that you've been speaking about in the U.S. and the pause in transactions that have occurred in the U.S., have you sort of been spending some more time looking at overseas or global markets as a place of investment? 
James Flaherty: Again, Quentin, I think we take a look at everything that's moving around. Some of that is with an eye of potentially making some investments, some of it is with an eye towards getting up to speed and learning about different markets. So that's just a constant -- that's a constant part of our -- of Paul's team's acquisition thought process. And it doesn't go up or go down because things are slow or not slow. As I mentioned, dialogue-wise, things are quite active right now so -- but that's certainly in the mix. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. 
Jana Galan: I was wondering, can you break out the 2012 guidance for Same Property Performance by segment? Or maybe just talk to which segments do you think will kind of outperform that range. 
James Flaherty: Sure. We did all that on the last call. But, Tim do you want to review that for Jana? 
Timothy Schoen: Sure. In terms of segments, it's actually similar to what I gave in my February 2012 guidance. To give you a shorter answer, the 2 areas that are up are senior housing portfolio and our life science portfolio, and both of those are up in the order of magnitude, 20 to 30 basis points, from the last February guidance. 
Jana Galan: So senior housing should pick up from the first quarter? 
Timothy Schoen: From my last guidance, senior housing and life science are the drivers there. 
Jana Galan: And then maybe just to talk about the expense savings, if that $500,000 in the MOB portfolio, can we do that going forward? Or is part of that a little bit of seasonality or better weather? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think you've got a couple things going on there. Most of that savings was coming off our sustainability initiative that Tom Klaritch has done a great job on. By the way, as an aside, I'd congratulate NAREIT. They've really kind of set the bar out there in terms of establishing metrics and working with Washington and things like that to make this very important initiative, to incorporate that into all of its member companies. But a big chunk of that was the sustainability. There was a little bit of seasonality in there. But we've had now, for several quarters, thanks to Tom Klaritch and his team, very nice gains relative to cost savings, energy savings because of that sustainability commitment that HCP is [indiscernible]. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Macquarie. 
Nicholas Yulico: I just wanted to see on the medical office side, with cap rates coming down so much and you keep hearing about new pension funds interested in the sector. Does it make sense for you guys to think about exploring, doing another institutional fund? 
James Flaherty: We think about that as part of our calculus. Our stepping-off point, though, is that the economics have to clear the bar if -- for a 100%-owned portfolio. There were some companies in some other sectors that got a little sideways back 3 or 4 years ago when they were moving forward on acquisitions, joint venture format, that they really needed the extra juice from the joint venture in order to make the math work. So from our standpoint, we would certainly consider that. We have, we obviously have a very meaningful platform in that regard. But the extra juice would be gravy on top for our shareholders who wouldn't use that to justify doing a JV. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then back in fourth quarter, I know you gave the actual calendar fixed charge coverage of 1.37 for HCR ManorCare. Were you saying earlier today that the, that coverage is sort of very similar in the first quarter, when you were talking about a sort of a similar coverage level? 
James Flaherty: Yes, I think the word -- Paul's words were "very consistent." 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then just lastly on -- also on HCR ManorCare. Is there any reason to think that the coverage decline that has gone on, has it all been due to leverage picking up at the OpCo at all? 
James Flaherty: No. Absolutely not. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. 
Todd Stender: Jay, just circling back to your comments on California, and then really looking at the life science specifically, what are your tenants saying? Or really better yet, what are they doing? If the brand name biotech companies are really -- the tech companies, are you seeing them expand? Are they going into other states maybe a little more business friendly, like South Carolina or Texas, just seeing what you're seeing from the tenant perspective? 
James Flaherty: Yes, well I think, not only is that an interesting question, but you qualified it the right way. Forget about what they're saying. Look at what they're doing. I think it was Google or Apple, someone just made a very significant decision to put a number of its employees down in Austin, Texas. So 1 or 2 decisions does not a trend make, but I think the state of California, and going forward, I think the country as well, need to kind of keep an eye on that. So it's early days. We're watching it. Again, from our standpoint, it really -- it doesn't impact our existing portfolio, given the quality of the tenants we have in our life science portfolio and the fact that we're at approximately 90% occupancy with very long-dated leases, very little lease roll, and we're a grand total, I think, of 750,000 square feet of leasing from taking the entire portfolio, 100% leased. So it's really -- it really impacts, Todd, more of our thinking in terms of whether we want to go bigger or not into the space. And that's the context in which I presented that. 
Todd Stender: Okay. And really, it's a highly specialized space with high barriers to entry. How long would it take for new supply to come into the market? Really, from breaking ground to being open? And what kind of regulatory overhang...? 
James Flaherty: Yes, I think I'll kick that to our former head of life sciences. Tim? 
Timothy Schoen: Assuming you have the land entitled like we do, you're talking, depending on the build out, 18 months for a device-type use and 24 months up to a more intensive biology or chemistry use. That'll hopefully couch it for you. 
Todd Stender: That sure does. And I guess just looking at the direction of the rent renewals in the quarter. Any drivers behind that? Or really does life science have any seasonality, if some of the rents came down in Q1? 
Timothy Schoen: No. We had a big renewal that was flat, and it's really just one tenant that was driving that within our portfolio out of Hayward that's driving that negative mark-to-market. It's only about 30,000 feet. It's just a small [indiscernible], sort of a small denominator problem. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Molly McCartin: This is actually Molly McCartin on for Mike. I just have a quick question. And I believe you said on the last call, you gave the average pre-leasing for the redevelopment project was 33%. Do you have an updated number on that? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, we do. It's up slightly, closer to 40%. It's in that 35% to 40% range, but closer to 40%. 
Molly McCartin: And it's similar in there as a couple of that are pretty high. And there are some -- it's a wide range of pre-leasing? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. 
Molly McCartin: Okay. And then for the life science building that just went online in January, can you give a timeframe for stabilization? 
James Flaherty: Yes. We continue to talk to tenants in those buildings all the time. It's about 1/3 pre-leased, and we continue to have discussions. We like the size of that project. It's the reason we brought that project into the portfolio. It gives us 30,000 to 60,000 square foot, an opportunity to get the 30,000 to 60,000 square-foot tenants within our portfolio. And we didn't have that opportunity before. So it's pretty binary. We get another tenant, and that project will fill up fairly quickly. 
Molly McCartin: Okay, great. And last question. For the same-store NOI guidance, what percentage of your portfolio is included in that this quarter? 
Timothy Schoen: Just over 60%. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Philip Martin with MorningStar. 
Philip Martin: Questions for you on your overall growth strategy. When you look at the overall growth strategy, can you characterize for us organic growth versus external growth? And where those trends are going? And how they may or may not have changed over the last 12 to 24 months? 
James Flaherty: Well, we can certainly, with a fair amount of precision, calibrate our internal and organic growth. The external growth is, as you know, we don't forecast that. But beginning this year, we have talked about an overall same property cash performance of plus or minus 3.5%. Now in fact we're trending above that. But again, if you go with, at 3.5% and you take our balance sheet metrics, which are 40 parts debt, 60 parts equity, that generates 5.5% to 6% FAD organic growth for this year, for next year and for 2014. The reason we've got the ability to go out with that sort of visibility in terms of length of visibility and precision is that the existing portfolio is largely contractual relationships with high-quality, credit-worthy counter-parties that has next to nothing in the way of any lease roll, and we've got minimal and manageable debt maturity. So when you put it all together, it's a relatively straightforward process to look at the organic FAD growth per share for each of the next 3 years including 2012. Now again, externally, I think I've made some comments at the beginning here as to what we're seeing and why we're seeing what we're seeing. So that'll be the wildcard. I think you should read into the fact that we wouldn't have taken the steps we've taken with respect to strengthening our balance sheet, banking some cash, reducing the line, the economics in terms of our revolving line of credit, were we not to anticipate a significant amount of ramp in the external acquisition, but that's just not something that we predict. 
Philip Martin: How about the makeup of the organic or internal growth? Certainly, there is lease maturities and fixed increases, et cetera. But how about in terms of value-add or redevelopment, repositioning? I have to assume health care systems, as they look to reposition or reconsider their investment in growth strategies around their real estate portfolios, maybe coming to you looking for ideas, et cetera. Just I'm trying to understand kind of the makeup of this internal growth if there's a little more on the redevelopment value-add and value creation side of the business. 
James Flaherty: Yes. That's actually a very good question. And the makeup of that 5.5% to 6% FAD growth per year for this year, next year and the following year is just a stabilized portfolio, okay? On top of that, which we do not include in the organic growth rate, so this is further juice for the shareholders, is the fact that we've got 94% of our portfolio stabilized. So that 94% is producing that economic return I just discussed, the 5.5% to 6%. However, we've got 6% of the portfolio, and when you have a portfolio the size of ours, that's $1.1 billion, that is currently yielding about 3%. So we've got 94% of the portfolio yielding approximately 8%, and 6% yielding 3%. You can do the math as well as anybody else, but if you move that other 6% from 3% up to 8%, you've got an enormous increase in cash flow. Now we're working on that hard, but we don't predict when that drops. But just to give you a flavor for some of the assets that are in that 6%, that would include our land holdings down in San Diego County. It would include our land holdings up in South San Francisco, most notably The Cove that we bought from Genentech last year. It would include our equity ownership interest in Brookdale and HCR and it would include the remaining balance on our Cirrus loan that Paul had given you an update on. So all that, all those things, which again, is 6% of the company, but more importantly, $1.1 billion of value, when they stabilize, would be additive to that 5.5% to 6%. So really, when you think about growth drivers for HCP, and we'll be giving some little more precision on this as the year evolves, you've really got 3 growth drivers. You've got the stabilized organic portfolio. You've got the non-stabilized portfolio that people are working quite hard on ramping that up. And then you've got external acquisitions. So it's a nice combination of growth levers. We're only out there talking about the first bucket. So if and when the second and the third buckets drop, you can rest assured we'll be talking about that as well. 
Philip Martin: Okay, I appreciate that. I just want a little more clarity and level of magnitude, and that helped. Lastly, and I'll yield the floor, when you look at your post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio, over the last few years, has this portfolio experienced any meaningful change in payer mix and/or margin as health systems again reposition or integrate the care better, deliver the care in a different way, et cetera? 
James Flaherty: Well, you're talking about the post-acute/skilled portfolio? 
Philip Martin: Yes, really the skill as opposed to the LTACH. 
James Flaherty: Well, we -- remember we -- we don't include LTACH in skilled, by the way. We really sold out of all of the institutionalized, Medicaid-based skilled nursing properties. We did that back in '06. So what you have left is really 2 portfolios. One is what Paul referred to as our legacy portfolio in this space. And that's been kind of cherry-picked. That's the stuff we didn't sell. We liked it. We've restructured it. We've got it master leased. And that's clicking along at a coverage of what? 
Paul Gallagher: One second, I'll give it to you. 1.64x. 
James Flaherty: 1.64x. And if you were to take a look and take a snapshot of that portfolio and look at metrics like quality mix, margin and things like that, they would all be significantly higher than the large portfolio that we sold back in '06, so you draw a box around that. Then you move to HCR, and there you've got another standard deviation or 2 move up both in terms of quality mix and in terms of margin, because they've really distinguished themselves as the leader in that space. So you had asked the question over the timeframe in the last couple of years. If you asked your question that way, I think I'd point you in the direction of our, what we call our legacy portfolio, realizing that the HCR portfolio didn't come in to our company as an owned portfolio until April of last year. 
Philip Martin: Exactly, okay. The skilled care portfolio is really looking at type of care that they've provided historically and their role. I've been interested to better understand the role of the skilled nursing community today versus 5 years ago given the payer mix, given uncertainties with Medicaid, Medicare, et cetera. And it doesn't sound like it's a broad-based opportunity. It sounds like it's more of a system-by-system opportunity. 
James Flaherty: I'm not sure it's system-by-system. If you're talking about a portfolio or the sector that would be most consistent with what we sold, I would tell you that, that business is not going to go away. Recall that, that's funded largely by the state. So you need to be very careful in terms of how the various states' budget deficit and surplus situation is and is likely to be. And then if in fact there's this big -- if you get something that starts to look like what Paul Ryan is talking about, a lot of that, forget about reimbursement and stuff like that. A lot of that is a shift from the federal government to the state government. So I think you need to think about that. But I would say that the institutionalized Medicaid, preponderance of Medicaid revenue, skilled nursing business is a business that's not going away. It's going to be a low margin business. And with the right capital structure and with the right operators, that's a legitimate business. I don't think that's going to go away. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Karin Ford: Jay, the items of uncertainty that you listed earlier that is causing delay in some of the transaction activity, are those things concerning the sellers? Or are they concerning HCP as a buyer and causing sellers to be hesitant or you to be hesitant or both? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think it's largely on the part of the sellers. Again, I think, that's why I said, I don't think -- I think what needs to happen here is just some resolution of these issues. I think it's the uncertainty that people tend to not like. I mean, people can make -- and by the way, not to say there's going to be a complete absence of transaction activity for the next couple of months, because there are going to be some transactions, and I anticipate we'll be involved in them. But a lot of what's going on here is that people want to know, are we dealing with health care reform in 2014? Are we -- is that going away? And then we'll probably cut a market health care reform in the lame-duck session later this year, in large part because of the pressure coming from the aerospace defense industry that does not want to see the sequestration occur? So there's a lot of things like that, that are going on. But I don't think -- I think some of those issues, depending on how they drop, might impact valuations. But it's not at all to suggest that there'll be an absence of transactions going forward. It's just that for now, there's some period of uncertainty, and people would rather -- sellers go to their Boards of Directors, their investment committees, and they say, well, what happens if this happens? And they say, I don't know, but in 2 or 3 months, we'll know. And they say, well, why don't you wait? 
Karin Ford: Got it. Has HCP been close on any transactions this year that have fallen through? 
James Flaherty: We never, as you know, Karin, we never comment on speculative deals, things like that. We confine our comments to deals that we've closed or signed. 
 Okay, everyone. I thank you for your time, and thank you for your continued interest in HCP. Take care. Have a good day. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-14 12:00:00) =====

 I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Flaherty. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, John. Happy Valentines Day, everyone, and welcome to HCP's 2011 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
 Joining me this morning are Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, Paul Gallagher; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Tim Schoen.
 Let us begin with a review of the fourth quarter results that we released this morning. And for that, I turn the call over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Thank you, Jay. 2011 was another strong and productive year for HCP. One, we generated cash, same property growth of 4% over 2010; two, increased FFO as adjusted by 21% year-over-year to $2.69 per share and FAD by 13% to $2.14 per share, both of which are at or above the midpoint of our last guidance and represented all-time highs for HCP; three, closed on $7 billion of investments led by our $6.1 billion acquisition of HCR ManorCare's real estate assets for which we replaced all stock consideration due seller valued at $33.14 per share with cash; four, transitioned 37 senior housing communities to Brookdale, including 21 under our RIDEA structure; five, raised $3.7 billion in the capital markets and renewed our $1.5 billion revolver; six, improved our investment grade credit profile and received positive rating changes from all 3 rating agencies; seven, delivered 18.7% total shareholder return; and eight, continued to be a leader in sustainability as recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and NAREIT.
 With that summary, there are several topics I will cover today: Our fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results; our investment and disposition transactions; our financing activities and balance sheet; our 2012 guidance; and finally, our dividend.
 Let me start with our fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results. For the fourth quarter, we generated year-over-year cash Same Property Performance of 2.2% which was negatively impacted by a working capital adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the transition of 27 properties from Sunrise to Emeritus. Excluding this, cash Same Property Performance increased by 3.1%. Paul will review our performance by segment in a few minutes.
 We reported fourth quarter FFO of $0.37 per share which included the charge resulting from the settlement of all outstanding litigation with Ventas. Excluding this charge, FFO as adjusted was $0.67 per share and FAD was $0.50 per share.
 Turning to our full-year 2011 results. 2011 cash SPP increased 4% over 2010 which was 25 basis points above the midpoint of our last guidance, primarily driven by improved fourth quarter performance in our senior housing segment. We reported full-year 2011 FFO of $2.19 per share, $0.01 above the midpoint of our most recent guidance. The results included a  fourth quarter litigation settlement of $0.31 per share, a third quarter impairment of $0.04 per share related to our Cirrus loan and HCR ManorCare merger-related items of $0.15 per share. Excluding these items, FFO as adjusted for the year was $2.69 per share which also exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01, and FAD of $2.14 per share was in line with the midpoint of guidance. The results reflected several one-time items, most notably a 9% gain from the early par payoff of our Genesis debt investments in Q2.
 Turning to our investment and disposition transactions. During 2011, we invested $7 billion as follows: $6.1 billion acquisition of HCR ManorCare's real estate portfolio; $560 million representing the buyout of our partners' 65% interest in Ventures II, inclusive of assumed debt; and $300 million for other real estate acquisition, development and capital improvements. During the fourth quarter, we sold 3 senior housing properties for $19 million and recognized gains of $3 million.
 Next, our financing activities and balance sheet. In 2011, we raised $3.7 billion in the capital markets, consisting of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes and $1.3 billion of common stock. Proceeds from these offerings were used to fund a portion of our HCR ManorCare acquisition. In particular, $852 million of the equity proceeds issued at $35.79 per share were used to replace, at our option, all of the stock consideration due to the seller, valued at $33.14 per share, which resulted in a $68 million benefit to HCP.
 Also, last month, we issued $450 million of senior unsecured notes due 2019 with a coupon of 3.75%. The 7-year term fits nicely into our maturity schedule and proceeds from the transaction were used to clear out the balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. Our financial leverage of 41% remains stable and in line with our long-term target.
 Fixed charge coverage was 3.1x in 2011, up from 2.9x in 2010. We expect trailing 12-month coverage to continue improving, as we capture the first full year ownership of our 2011 investments.
 Switching to our full-year 2012 guidance. Our guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions of real estate and reflects the following: cash Same Property Performance is projected to range from 3% to 4%. It should be noted that on a full-year basis, our same-store portfolio includes only 60% of the company's operating real estate. The remaining 40% principally relates to our HCR ManorCare and RIDEA assets which are excluded from same-store due to the timing of these acquisitions. 2012 FFO is projected to range from $2.70 to $2.76 per share, which at the midpoint, represents a 1.5% growth compared to 2011 FFO as adjusted. The growth over 2011 reflects one  additional quarter of our accretive HCR ManorCare acquisition, offset in part by the one-time Genesis gain of $0.09 recognized in 2011. Excluding the Genesis gain, FFO per share at the midpoint is projected to increase 5% over FFO as adjusted in 2011.
 2012 FAD is projected to range from $2.14 to $2.20 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 1.4% at the midpoint, primarily driven by cash Same Property Performance and HCR ManorCare, partially offset by the Genesis gain. Excluding Genesis, FAD per share at the midpoint is expected to increase by 5.9% compared to 2011.
 Let me quickly run through a few other detailed assumptions related to our guidance. G&A is forecasted to be $80 million, inclusive of stock-based compensation of $22 million; amortization of below-market lease intangibles and deferred revenues of $4 million; amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs of $15 million; straight-line rents of $40 million; DFL depreciation of $13 million; DFL accretion of $96 million which represents a $59 million recharacterization to income from joint ventures due to our minority ownership in HCR ManorCare OpCo; leasing cost and second-generation tenant and capital expenditures of $58 million; development, redevelopment and first-generation capital funding of approximately $155 million, including capitalized interest of $25 million; and funding of $70 million during 2012 for 5 senior housing development loans under a participating mortgage program.
 Finally, our dividend. In January, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.50 per share, marking the 27th consecutive year of dividend increases for HCP. The indicated dividend of $2 per share represents an increase of 4.2% or $0.08 per share over 2011.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul. 
Paul Gallagher: Thanks, Tim. Now let me review HCP's portfolio performance. 
 Senior housing. Occupancy for the third quarter in our same property senior housing platform was 85.5%, a 30-basis point sequential increase over the prior quarter and a 70-basis point decrease over the prior year. Cash flow coverage for the portfolio remained steady at 1.19x. Current quarter year-over-year same property cash NOI growth for our senior housing platform was up 2.8%. This growth was driven by normal rent steps including higher rents for assets transitioned to new operators.
 Full-year 2011 senior housing Same Property Performance was 6.6%. For 2012, we expect senior housing Same Property Performance to range from 2.5% to 3.5% driven by contractual rent steps. The 21 RIDEA assets owned in a joint venture with Brookdale Senior Living, which closed September 2011, has been transitioned and integrated into the Brookdale platform. Quarterly same-store performance data will be available in the fourth quarter of 2012 on the first anniversary of our contribution of the assets to the venture.
 During the fourth quarter of 2011, HCP closed 2 senior housing development loans under a participating mortgage program we launched in the first quarter of 2011, bringing the total amount committed under the program to $101 million on 5 projects. HCP receives current income and participates in the projects' appreciation, which combined, is expected to achieve a low- to mid-teens unlevered IRR on these projects. Upon stabilization, HCP has the option to purchase each of the properties. All 5 projects will be managed by Brookdale.
 Post-acute/skilled nursing. Our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio metrics this quarter reflect a full-year of RUGs-IV reimbursement rates for Medicare. For the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, 2011, HCR's fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.66x, a 6-basis point increase. For the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding nonrecurring expenses, HCR's fixed charge coverage was 1.37x, bringing fixed charge coverage ratio for calendar 2011 to 1.57x. For our same-store skilled nursing portfolio, cash flow coverage improved to 1.84x, a 6-basis point increase over the prior quarter and a 32-basis point increase over the prior year.
 Year-over-year same property cash NOI for the fourth quarter increased 1.5% driven by normal rent steps. Full year 2011 post-acute/skilled nursing Same Property Performance was 2.6%. For 2012, Same Property Performance for post-acute/skilled nursing is expected to range from 2% to 3%.
 Hospitals. Same property cash flow coverage increased 21 basis points to 4.29x driven by improved performance at our Medical City, Dallas, and Hoag Irvine hospitals. Year-over-year, Same Property cash NOI for the fourth quarter increased 3%. Full-year 2011 hospital Same Property Performance was 4.6%. For 2012, hospital Same Property Performance is expected to range from 2.5% to 3.5%.
 Medical Office Buildings. Same property cash NOI for the fourth quarter was up 2.4%. The growth was the result of increased base rate from occupancy and normal rent steps, coupled with expense controls resulting in over $1 million of operating expense savings versus the fourth quarter 2010. Absent a one-time deferred revenue adjustment of $500,000 in 2010, normalized NOI growth was 3.5% for the quarter.
 Full-year 2011 MOB Same Property Performance was 2.8%. For 2012, Same Property store growth expected to range from 3% to 4%. Our MOB occupancy for the fourth quarter increased to 91.5% with improved leasing activities in California, Florida, Utah and Arizona, and over 82,000 square feet of net absorption for the quarter.
 During the quarter, tenants representing 593,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 420,000 square feet related to previously-occupied space, bringing total 2011 leasing to 1.9 million square feet. Retention for the quarter was strong at 86%, increasing our full-year average retention to 80.2%.
 Renewals for the quarter occurred at 0.4% higher mark-to-market rents. We continue to have success extending the terms on leases. For 2011, our average lease term on new and renewal leases was 66 months, a 22% increase over the same period in 2010.
 Looking forward to 2012, we have 1,871,000 square feet of scheduled expirations, including 256,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. Our pipeline remains strong with 220,000 square feet of executed leases that have yet to commence and 721,000 square feet in active negotiations.
 Life science. Same Property cash NOI was up 1.1% for the quarter. This increase was driven by contractual rent increases offset by vacancy and mark-to-market rent decreases. Full-year same property cash NOI for the life science portfolio for 2011 was 1.1%. For 2012, Same Property Performance is projected to range from 4.5% to 5.5%. Occupancy for the life science portfolio decreased 10 basis points during the quarter to 89.9%. The life science development pipeline consists of 4 redevelopment projects totaling 253,000 square feet and one development project totaling 70,000 square feet, with the remaining funding requirements projected at approximately $42 million.
 As we announced on our third quarter call, the 70,000 square-foot development project is 100% pre-leased to LinkedIn as part of the larger 373,000 square-foot lease transaction completed in the fourth quarter at our Shoreline campus in Mountain View. Construction activities have already commenced on the new building, with an anticipated delivery in the first quarter of 2013.
 Additionally, at the same Mountain View campus, and subsequent to year-end, HCP entered into a lease amendment with Google to lease an additional 41,000 square feet at a mark-to-market increase of 17%. The amendment includes a $4 million cash payment, extends the term for 124,000 square feet of Google space to 2022 and is coterminus with the expansion. This amendment increases Google's entire footprint to 290,000 square feet. Upon completion of the new building for LinkedIn in 2013, Google and LinkedIn will account for approximately 84% of the Mountain View campus' total square footage, all on long-term leases, with annual contractual rent increases of 3% for Google and 3.5% for LinkedIn.
 For the quarter, we completed 449,000 square feet of leasing, bringing total 2011 leasing to 949,000 square feet, with a retention rate of 61.2% on expiring space. Including leases executed with new tenants, over 88% of the expiring space was leased without any downtime. Renewals for the quarter occurred at 30% higher mark-to-market rents with an average term for new and renewal leases of 9.5 years. The life science portfolio has only 185,000 square feet of scheduled expirations in 2012 including approximately 33,000 square feet of month-to-month leases.
 We are currently tracking over 700,000 square feet of requirements in HCP's various life science markets and are working closely with a number of existing tenants and potential new tenants to address current vacancies and near-term expirations. HCP's tenants experienced a strong quarter in their ability to access and raise capital. This effort was led by South San Francisco headquarters for total pharmaceuticals which raised over $100 million in 2 separate transactions, including a collaboration with Biogen Idec. Additionally, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, The Serra Pharmaceuticals and Exelixis raised over $200 million in total. We continue to monitor the credit quality of our tenant base and note that less than 1% of HCP's total revenues come from life science tenants with less than 12 months cash on hand.
 Finally, let me recap Same Property Performance guidance by sector for 2012: senior housing at 2.5% to 3.5%; post-acute/skilled nursing at 2% to 3%; hospitals at 2.5% to 3.5%; MOBs at 3% to 4%; and life science at 4.5% to 5.5%, for a total HCP portfolio Same Property Performance for 2012 of 3% to 4%.
 I'd like to turn it over to Jay now. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Paul. HCP moves into 2012 with tremendous momentum following an impressive 2011 result where we achieved total shareholder returns in excess of 18%. Once again, our real estate portfolio led the way, registering a 4% Same Property Performance increase with each of our 5 property sectors generating positive contributions. Our balance sheet is strong and we are recognized by each of the 3 rating agencies that rate our debt with positive rating actions in 2011. With HCP's credit metrics now tracking at single A rated levels, our cost of capital as is at an all-time low, and last month, we issued $400 million in 7-year unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.75%.
 Turning to our operating environment, recent improvement on the unemployment front, while remaining below historic recovery norms, is helping to change end-user behavior for our real estate. This is most evident in our Bay Area portfolio where the demand from technology and social media companies is driving impressive gains at our Mountain View and Redwood City campuses. In our senior housing sector, recent NIC data has steadily improved, allowing us to launch a senior housing development platform which is currently sized at over $100 million. In addition, our primary care hospital partner, HCA, and our primary post-acute care partner, HCR, continue to perform well.
 HCP's sector-leading sustainability initiatives, under the leadership of Executive Vice President, Tom Klaritch, continue to garner well-deserved recognition and lower the company's carbon footprint. In November, we received the innovator award at NAREIT's Annual Leader in the Light competition in Dallas. In addition, our North suburban medical office building campus in Denver, Colorado, won first place in the medical office building category in ENERGY STAR's national building competition. We received 20 additional ENERGY STAR labels during the quarter consisting of 14 Medical Office Buildings and 6 life science properties, bringing our total ENERGY STAR labels to 58.
 Sustainability initiatives continue to deliver good economics to HCP with the reduction of utility expenses for the year of over $1.4 million on a same property basis versus 2010. We have now incorporated sustainability goals into each of our 2012 property sector budget plans.
 The favorable earnings outlook for HCP over the next several years continues to provide for organic FAD per share growth of between 5% and 6%. Given this backdrop, last month HCP's Board of Directors increased the company's 2012 indicated dividend by 4.2%. This represents the 27th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend, a fact that S&P recently recognized by including HCP in its S&P Dividend Aristocrat Index. This select index includes just 10% of the S&P 500 and is comprised of companies in excess of $3 billion in market capitalization that have raised their dividend every year for 25 consecutive years.
 In 2008, we were very proud that HCP was the first health care REIT added to the S&P 500, and we are equally proud that HCP is now the first REIT in the world to be included in this index, joining such blue-chip organizations as 3M, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Walmart and Walgreen.
 Reflecting back on the past quarter's century of success at HCP, this significant accomplishment is the result of visionary leadership by our Chairman Emeritus, Ken Roath, the successful repositioning of our real estate portfolio in the mid to late portion of the last decade, and the outperformance of our company during the great recession. Recall that during the 2008, 2009 recession timeframe, many REITs were forced to reduce their dividend and/or adapt a policy of paying their dividend in stock instead of cash.
 Now that we've been named to named to S&P's Dividend Aristocrat Index, we want to make sure that HCP stays there. Our portfolios go forward 3.5% same profit performance expectation, driven by contractual escalators and minimal lease expirations. Levered ratio of 40% debt, 60% equity will generate a positive 5% to 6% growth in FAD per share before external growth opportunities.
 With the strongest-rated balance sheet in the health care REIT sector available to fund additional accretive acquisitions, incorporating attractive risk-adjusted returns, we are in a good place.
 Let me finish off with a couple of housekeeping matters. First, in light of the unusually strong reception we received from fixed income investors last month, we have revamped our supplemental disclosure to incorporate the substance of our rating agency presentation excluding all forward-looking information, on Pages 5 through 7 of our supplemental. Our credit metrics have improved so quickly, especially our fixed charge coverage and secured debt ratios, that a number of fixed income investors encouraged us to be even more transparent with our disclosures in this area. Second, for our East Coast-centric participants, we have 3 upcoming events organized by Institutional Investor Magazine-ranked research analysts. On February 29, 2012, we will be in New York City for investor dinner hosted by Adam Feinstein of Barclays. On March 1, Mark Streeter of JPMorgan will host a fixed income investor luncheon. And on March 12 and 13, we will be in Palm Beach, Florida, for Michael Bilerman's Citibank conference. With that, we'd be delighted to take your questions. Zenita? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital. 
Adam Feinstein: Congrats on getting added to that prestigious S&P index and also on a great year. So maybe, Jay, just curious to get your thoughts in terms of deal activity. Just -- obviously, we hear about some of the public things that happen but just curious in terms of just things that maybe aren't necessarily in front of us. Has there been an increase in activity? I was thinking primarily in the post-acute care space just in terms of the informal conversations you guys may be having. And since you do have such a strong primary partner, as you mentioned, in terms of looking for opportunities, just curious in terms of whether there's things being shopped around and maybe we'll see an increase in the coming year. 
James Flaherty: Right. Let me take the big picture and then I'll end on the post-acute space, Adam. I would make a couple of comments. One, looking back at 2011, we closed a large volume but if you actually think about our incremental 2011 commitments, so commitments that we initiated in 2011, and think about those in the context of commitments in excess of $100 million, we actually only made one. And that was, of course, our commitment to effectively buy back $850 million of HCP stock at a price of $33.14 and then refinance that out at a higher price. So we've been very -- I think we've looked at everything, obviously, and we require, when we go forward with the transaction, we require that there's a positive spread to our weighted average cost of capital. And that incorporates reasonable underwriting assumptions, not seller-provided assumptions. So I think a lot of it -- we kind of think about the -- the Ted Williams quote that "You've got to wait for the right pitch". So that's a little bit of looking back at 2011. Moving to 2012, I would say that within our 5x5 business model, we have active discussions going on in each of our property sectors at the current time. So I think there's absolutely an increase in chatter and dialogue, and I think that's, without a doubt, the best leading indicator in terms of ultimate transaction volume. So that's how we kind of talk about the macro transaction environment. With respect, Adam, to the post-acute space, I would say that we obviously had a fourth quarter that was the first quarter of the RUGs-IV benefit going away. So for the most part, what we have seen with HCR and then more broadly within that space, we've seen people necessarily focused in the fourth quarter on the various cost-mitigation strategies that they have put in place. At this point, most of the heavy lifting is behind the sector and I think it's actually fair to say that as a result of that, kind of coming out of the year-end numbers, the accounting sign-offs and the reporting out of those numbers, there's been an uptick in dialogue in the space. Now let me also say, I've read a couple of sell-side pieces that have come out in the last week or so, talking about storm clouds parting in the skilled space and maybe things aren't as bad as they thought. I would just say that this is going to remain a challenging space with the political partisan reimbursement kind of backdrop. But we feel obviously, very, very good with the operating partner that is HCR and we work with them very, very closely. And so I'm optimistic that there will be some opportunities that present themselves that are good opportunities from the standpoint of HCR and from the standpoint of HCP. 
Bryan Sekino: Jay, this is Bryan Sekino. Just a follow-up here. Given the favorable rates on your recent debt raise, do you see this as possibly giving you more cushion to go after some lease structures with more upside but risk as well? Or do you expect to kind of protect the consistency of your rent increases with some of the triple net leases? 
James Flaherty: We don't -- that's a disconnect from the way we think. We think about -- when we think about acquisitions, we think about risk-adjusted returns, and again, with reasonable underwriting assumptions, and they've got to create an attractive spread to our weighted average cost of capital. So all other things being equal, which of course they never are, if you're alluding to the fact that our cost of capital is now at an all-time low, were the opportunity sets that's out there to remain totally the same, then sure, that spread would've gapped out. But as you know, the financing markets and the acquisition environment are, to a certain extent, inversely correlated. In other words, the best time to make an acquisition is, in our experience, the time when the financing markets are most challenged. And you flip that around, when the financing markets are most frothy, oftentimes that's when it's tough with seller expectations to make the numbers. So again, that's how I'd answer that question. You should not -- we don't -- we're not going to change our investment discipline because our cost of capital has gone down. We certainly incorporate that lower cost of capital in each of the opportunities that come before Paul's investment committee, but that's how I'd answer that question. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel Nicholas. 
Dan Bernstein: Actually, just -- the senior housing development is not a really large part of your business but it seems like you made a strategic decision to launch a senior housing development platform and I wanted to get your thoughts behind some of that and is HCP going to be a larger developer going forward than buyer? If I could get some of your thoughts on that. 
James Flaherty: Yes. Let me say -- let me take the macro piece and I can let Paul talk a little bit more about the specifics of the development program that we are now -- we've now rolled out and we're blowing and going on. From a senior housing standpoint, you've got some favorable tailwinds. Those obviously include the aging baby boomer and the lack of new supply. It's that point that our development platform is specifically targeted at. That said, it's kind of for a different reason than I just alluded to in terms of some of the perspective that's out there that the worst is behind the skilled operators. You got 2 major headwinds for the senior housing space that are going to be with that space for the foreseeable future. One of which is affordability in light of all that's going on with the seniors' net worth and their incremental family obligations. And the other is CapEx. So we think it's an interesting space. We've obviously done very, very well. If you take a look at our coverage ratios for our senior housing portfolio, they have, very impressively, I think, in light of the last 3 years operating environment, gone up each year. But we do see an attractive opportunity to get some outsized economic performance in terms of unlevered returns. And therefore, outsize the spread over our weighted average cost of capital with this development platform. So with that, let me have Paul maybe elaborate a little bit more on what we're doing there. 
Paul Gallagher: Yes, I think one of the pieces of your question, was it going to replace our acquisition? It's to supplement acquisitions of our senior housing projects. And just a little bit of color as far as kind of what it is that we're looking at, these deals range in size from 75 to 100 units, primarily assisted and Alzheimer's. We have one project that's a little bit larger that has a larger I/O component. Property locations in Germantown, Tennessee; Olney, Maryland; Horsham, Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Roseland, New Jersey. What we structured is we structured a loan for up to 85% of costs with the borrower putting in the first 15% in cash. Our loans per unit is less than $200,000, and the interest -- we receive interest payments, we participate in the value creation and we expect kind of low, mid-teens types of returns on these. 
Dan Bernstein: You're only doing the development with existing operators or you're looking to build new relationships? 
James Flaherty: No, we're concentrating -- the 5 that we've got up and running, we're concentrating those with Brookdale. So again, I think that's another element of this when we take a look at where we want our partnerships. We want to concentrate, as we said before, with partners, whether that's in the acute care hospital space, the post-acute space, senior housing space -- with operators that have quality outcomes, have efficient operations and have critical mass. 
Dan Bernstein: And one other question I have is following up on the broad picture on the acquisition environment. When I look at the buyout of leases today Brookdale announced, that the senior housing guys clearly want to own their real estate so where are the opportunities -- we also know that you can grow without acquisitions but when you're looking at acquisitions, what spaces do you see acquisitions of scale available? 
James Flaherty: Oh, I mean, like I said in answer -- in response to Adam's question, we've got, right now, within the context of our 5x5 model, we've got opportunities of size. We're in dialogue with concerning opportunities of size in each of our 5 property sectors. Let me just say first of all, welcome in a primary coverage responsibility to the space. But for those of you who don't know, Jerry Doctrow has announced his retirement effective March 1, and I'd just like to pass on to Jerry, on behalf of HCP, we want to congratulate you and thank you for multiple decades of quality support of the health care real estate industry. And we wish, jerry, you all the best in your future endeavors. 
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley. 
Paul Morgan: Just kind of 2 related questions. First, from the bigger picture, you gave 3% to 4%, I believe, kind of 2012 same-store NOI guidance for the portfolio. Admittedly, that's 60% of the portfolio right now. But kind of from a high level, is that what you think given your current portfolio mix, the company can generate on a same-store basis? Is that -- is there any reason to think that kind of over the cycle, that 3% to 4% or a different number, perhaps, would be achievable? And then kind of specifically on the life science portfolio at 4% to 5%, I just wanted to get a quick question about how much of that is driven by sort of what really aren't life science tenants but the Billington and Google deals and maybe if you have a number kind of absent those. 
James Flaherty: Yes, we don't have a number absent what's going on at Redwood City and Mountain View campus. It's all in the life science vertical. I mean perhaps, we should expand our model and add a fixed property type technology and social media so we'd have a 6x5 model instead of a 5x5 model and then perhaps we could get a social media valuation for HCP. But returning to reality, I would say the following: if you go back and look at our initial guidance for 2011 on this call a year ago, Paul, we went out at 2.25% to 3.25%. So we had a midpoint of 2.75%. We obviously ended up at 4%. If you take a look at the guidance for this year, we're at 3% to 4%. So we're up -- that's materially higher than the guidance of a year ago. You point out correctly that only 60% of the portfolio is included in the guidance that gets to 3% to 4%. So I think those are a couple of comments. Let me turn it over to Tim because I think he wants to maybe make a comment about that other 40% that's not in same property that'll eventually this year. We waved -- on the first anniversary of our acquisitions, that's when we place our properties in the Same Property Performance. We're pretty disciplined on that. We don't deviate from that pattern. So let me have Tim pick up on a couple of comments, related to both that dynamic and also the life science technology space. 
Timothy Schoen: Paul, to answer your question for what's not included in our same-store, you got the HCR ManorCare portfolio that is projected to grow at 3.5%. So that's within our range. And then the RIDEA assets which would be at the midpoint of that range or at the higher end of the range, and that would kind of get you the whole pie. With regards to our life science portfolio, the growth is really a combination of contractual rent steps and then the increased rents that we've seen down in our Mountain View and Redwood City area. So if you take those 2 combined, they're about equally weighted, that will get you to the 5%. 
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. 
Jeff Theiler: You've had a few months now to see how HCR ManorCare is handling these Medicare cuts. Any update on their mitigation efforts and what kind of mitigation results you'll expect to see in the future? 
James Flaherty: Well, I think Paul took you through the fourth quarter results which is the first quarter, Jeff, of the non RUGs-IV. I mean I would add to that. If you want some color commentary, I would say that HCR feels they've made the transition to a new cost structure well. In part, that involved cost reductions. But perhaps more importantly, the real focus was on maintaining and increasing the capability to care for complex patients. HCR has the largest share of that market and I suspect you will see them build share here in the next 12 to 24 months. So that -- the pieces that are in place there. I think, again, if you think back to the fact that HCR has been proven over many cycles to be the low-cost provider for a wide variety of post-acute care patients requiring short-term rehabilitation, that augers well for that platform, and by extension, our real estate portfolio and by extension, our investment and outcome. 
Jeff Theiler: Okay, great. And just quickly, you sold a few senior housing facilities this quarter. Any additional information on why that was? Just general pruning. Do you expect to do any additional pruning of the portfolio going forward? 
Paul Gallagher: Those 2 particular assets were turnaround assets that we've moved to a new operator several years ago. Gave them a way-out-of-the-money purchase option that they ultimately executed. The other asset was a $1.5 million asset that's part of the Horizon Bay transition that we decided to sell jointly. 
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. 
Ross Nussbaum: Here with Derek Bower. Jay, I just want to focus in on the same-store NOI growth, specifically for the life science and the medical office. The guidance ranges you gave of, I guess, 4.5% to 5.5% for the life science is a pretty material pickup from the performance over the last year. Can you help me understand what's the primary driver behind that level of growth? Is it occupancy? Is it you got some new, higher lease spreads coming in? What's driving that? 
James Flaherty: The most important point is we've got some, finally got some top-notch leadership in our life science space but other than that, I'll turn it over to Tim. 
Timothy Schoen: Ross, is really 2 things that make up life science. As I just said, it's the contractual rent steps associated with those leases. That's about half of it and other half is the increased rents related to the southern part of the Peninsula and San Francisco really, our Mountain View campus with the leases we've executed with LinkedIn and Google. 
Ross Nussbaum: And then on the MOB side, there's a little bit of a pickup there. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. On the MOB side, it's mainly contractual rent steps and slightly higher occupancy. 
James Flaherty: Ross, at 30,000 feet from the life science standpoint, if you were to go back and take a look at our Same Property Performance guidance for the life science sector a year ago on this call, we projected mark-to-market declines. If my recollection is correct, somewhere in the 15% to 20% down. Where we ended up for the year was in fact up 30%. So that's another way of looking at the swing there, just during 2011, Ross. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay. While we're on that topic, can we talk a little bit about the Page 9 in the supplemental? You've got quite a few life science and MOB assets under redevelopment. Can you give us a sense of where you are in terms of leasing your occupancy on, let's call it, what, nearly $250 million worth of investments there? 
James Flaherty: Yes. Why don't we -- do you want to start, Tim, with the life science? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, on the -- looking at page, the top of Page 9, Ross, the Mountain View asset is 100% pre-leased to LinkedIn. The Modular Labs asset is about 28%. The Soledad asset is 100%. The 1030 Mass. Ave. is 10%. The Durham research lab is 100%. The Knoxville asset is about 22%. And then the remaining MOB assets, there's about 4 there, those don't have any pre-leasing and then the Fresno that's on the bottom is 100% pre-leased. So a fair amount of pre-leasing on those assets. 
Ross Nussbaum: And any prospects down in Redwood City at the Saginaw asset that's already in service? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. There's -- we continue to talk to tenants there. We've actually had a pickup on occupancy on that campus. We had a medical device tenant move in to one of the 3 buildings here in the last couple of quarters and continue to talk to people about the 500/600 Saginaw building both on the medical device side and the life science side. 
James Flaherty: And it's possible, Ross, you'll see some people displaced out of the southern part of our corridor given the demand from the technology and social media tenants and have those people migrate up to our Redowood City campus. So it's got a kind of a collateral benefit for us. 
Ross Nussbaum: And do you have an update on what expected yields you're looking at on the, let's say, the $270 million on top of that page for development or redevelopment? 
Timothy Schoen: Incremental probably in the low teens. 
Ross Nussbaum: Okay, that's it for me. I would just throw in it would be, I think, very helpful going forward if we can get those occupancy numbers and even perhaps a date for when the occupancy is going to be commencing with those assets so we can perhaps model those in from a timing perspective a little better. 
James Flaherty: Got you, thank you for the comment. 
Timothy Schoen: And just as a follow-up, Ross, the pre-leasing percentages on the pipeline as a whole is about 1/3. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi. 
Quentin Velleley: I'm here with Michael Bilerman as well. Just in terms of the potential acquisition pipeline, I know in the past, you've sort of given some goalposts or given the size or a potential size of what the pipeline might be. Could you sort of give us a sense of what that might be? 
James Flaherty: I've never done that, Quentin. I've talked about the macro health to real estate sector in its entirety but I've never talked about or quantified our pipeline or given any acquisition-specific targets. 
Quentin Velleley: Perhaps if you could give it for what the macro is or the entire health care real estate pipeline? 
James Flaherty: I think it's pretty substantial. I'd leave it at that. 
Michael Bilerman: Jay, if I remember, I think you did when you gave raised equity. I think it was like 2 Januaries ago when you talked about the pipeline being bigger than to the time prior to CNL and this was prior to doing HCR ManorCare so that would have implied a pipeline greater than $6 billion at that point. 
James Flaherty: I may have given a relative comparison but never a specific dollar amount, nor do I intend to do that this morning. 
Quentin Velleley: And then if you look across your 5 sectors you've spoken about, it sounds like there's quite a bit of potential deal activity across those 5 sectors. But if you look at the risk-adjusted or the potential risk-adjusted returns from each of those sectors, where are you sort of seeing the best opportunities at the moment? 
James Flaherty: We've actually -- again, you've got to put this in the context of our 5x5 model. So within a sector, we can play a sector multiple ways, but we've got interesting opportunities in each of our 5 property sectors as I mentioned in response to Adam's question. 
Michael Bilerman: Jay, how do you think about and you've never been shy to sell assets when you thought the opportunity is right and harvest some gains, where do you sort of see -- and also in your comments about the best -- the weakest opportunity to buy is usually when the financing market comes back, and that's what makes the acquisition market more difficult today. Are you more inclined to try to trim assets or pieces of the portfolio? I don't know if you'd look at selling Mountain View given what we have now with Google and LinkedIn or other pieces? 
James Flaherty: I think that's a smart observation. I'll say that. I'll also say that we have absolutely 0 in the way of dispositions included in our 2012 guidance. But we're economic animals, so we'll see. 
Michael Bilerman: I mean, it's a higher cost of capital to sell an asset relative to what's being implied by your equity or your debt and so I understand that, that... 
James Flaherty: It depends what the valuation is on what you sell. 
Michael Bilerman: I mean, do you want to aggressively put things in the market in this environment or -- I recognize nothing's in guidance but... 
James Flaherty: Again, I think is a very smart observation. We have no dispositions included in our 2012 guidance and we look at things both on the acquisition side and the dispositions side based on a weighted average cost of capital and what we can do to create incremental shareholder value. So I think we got a track record of that and then if something comes out of that, we will certainly keep you guys posted. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill. 
James Milam: I know Obama's budget was out this week and there are a couple of proposals in there that obviously, I don't think the budget is likely to pass but there are a couple of proposals in there that kind of keep coming up. And I just wonder if you could give us some comments on, first, what the potential impact of the bad debt reimbursement cut could be and then second, if you think there's any possibility that down the road, CMS actually is able to start targeting Medicare margins? 
James Flaherty: Look, I mean, I think I kind of feel the same way that I did back in October, November when I think I got about 10 questions a day as to what was going to happen with the super committee. So we're not in the business of handicapping what's going to come out of Washington given the partisan politics that are being played there. But I will say, again, as I made the comment a couple of minutes ago, when I read a lot of sell-side pieces in the last week or 2 that are unusually positive about maybe an easing government reimbursement environment or I think one was entitled Storm Clouds Parting. I would say that this is continue to be a challenging space, I'd say that. But I think you've got to look at not just the potential challenges but there's the potential for some opportunities to come out of that, particularly for HCR. And I think the one opportunity would be if CMS moves to a site-neutral reimbursement sort of protocol for patients that had a surgical procedure in an acute care hospital and make that discharge, whether it's to a rehabilitation property or an LTACH or a post-acute property. If they make that site-neutral in terms of the reimbursement, which is not the case today, that obviously, given HCR's low-cost model, that would actually be quite an interesting development. So again, we don't speculate as to what's going to happen. We're taking it all in and we will respond accordingly through our operating partners, which in this case, in the post-acute space, is HCR. 
James Milam: I guess, just a follow-up. Do you have any sense from HCR ManorCare what the impact on a coverage basis could be if the bad debt reimbursement goes from say, 70% to 25%? 
James Flaherty: We have not asked them that specific question, no. 
Operator: [indiscernible] -- capital markets. 
Richard Anderson: Tim, did you say for -- or same-store run rate for the RIDEA was in the range of 4%? Is that what you said in your comments responding to a question? 
Timothy Schoen: I said that the -- of the assets actually not that, it wasn't specific to RIDEA, the assets that are not in our same-store portfolio are within the range of our 3% to 4%. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, so could you have any commentary about how RIDEA is performing relative to your expectations and if you might reconsider your more conservative view on that structure as it's relative to the portfolio as a whole? 
James Flaherty: I'm not sure I understand. You want us to what? we would reconsider our... 
Richard Anderson: You've been conservative about using the structure. You've kind of been the one outlier in terms of your hesitancy to use the RIDEA structure. I'm just wondering how it's doing relative to expectations and how that might have changed your view about the structure for HCP. 
James Flaherty: Yes, I don't think we've been hesitant to use the structure. I think we've been unwilling to move forward unless we have an appropriate risk-adjusted return, which in our view, requires a premium to a triple net execution and not a discounted return to a triple net execution. That's our only hesitancy. Yes, we found, with all the transactions we looked at, we found one of those that cleared that hurdle internally and that was our RIDEA 1 and it's early days. You've only got 4 months of actual operating results in there so far and ourselves and Brookdale are working through that and we're pleased with the results so far. But it's early days. We're repositioning some of the assets, we're putting some CapEx in to change a little bit of the profiles for some of those assets. So we feel very good about that. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. Next question is on the HCR portfolio, and specifically, the cash flow coverage. Understanding you have your guarantee in place. But can you give some commentary about where that is and where it might go based on the future? 
James Flaherty: Well, Paul took you through the -- we report our results one quarter in arrears. So Paul took you through a fair amount of detail which is also included in the supplemental for the 12-month period ended 9/30, September 30, and then he also gave you the -- both the fourth quarter coverage ratio as well as what that would have meant to the entire calendar year. So I think we've given you everything that we are in a position to provide. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. I'm sorry. I might have missed that detail. Now onto the life science portfolio, and specifically, what some might view as kind of blurring lines between the office business and the life science business. You've obviously made some good deals with LinkedIn and Google. But I'm just curious as to what's creating that. Is it a lack of opportunity or is it just the Google and LinkedIn, these leasing opportunities are coming in and they're just too good to pass up? I just -- if you could give tops-away view about the incorporation of more conventional office tenants into that portfolio. 
James Flaherty: Yes, let me -- I'll have the specifics answered by Tim or Paul but I take you back, Rich, to the call we made when we announced the Slough acquisition back in the middle of 2007. One of my first comments was that if you take a look at that Bay Area portfolio, it is book-ended by Stanford University and Palo Alto to the South of our real estate portfolio there, which obviously includes -- didn't include then, includes now, more of a technology-focused component of tenancy. And then to the North, our Genentech campus up in South San Francisco, then you've got a lot of real estates in between. So that's a good location. And so that hasn't changed at all. I think, if anything, we're seeing the benefit of that. But in terms of the specifics of the lease, and stuff like that, Tim, do you want take that? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes. Rich, it was just a -- we just evaluated the rent relative to the TI investment, and given where office rents have gone, they're a much higher return for us. Those buildings can support both life science or technology. So we just evaluate those -- that demand as it comes in and the superior financial outlook for us was to continue to expand LinkedIn and Google on those campuses. Now we do have a couple of remaining life science tenants on those campuses, so as I say, we'll continue to evaluate the rent relative to the incremental TI investment and choose the best financial outcome. 
Richard Anderson: Can you say the presence of Google and LinkedIn creates a draw that you might see more conventional office users versus life science users? 
James Flaherty: Sure. But I wouldn't limit your thought process there to Google, LinkedIn. I'd add Facebook to that and any one of a number of other social media companies right now. It's a very hot space. 
Paul Gallagher: And Rich, that rent dynamic has moved up substantially over the past 12 to 18 months from an office standpoint versus the lab space. 
Richard Anderson: What do you mean it's moved up? 
Paul Gallagher: Well, if you look back 18 months ago, pure office space in that particular market was maybe lower than where life science rents were. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, understood. And then last for me, the FAD guidance implies, if I'm doing this right, about $245 million or $250 million of absolute dollars of either non-cash or CapEx. And I'm coming about $30 million or $40 million short of in terms of the number that you provided. I've straight-lined CapEx, DSO income related to the capital lease accounting and other issues and above and below market rents. But what's in that other FAD adjustment line that you typically provide in your disclosure? 
Timothy Schoen: That other FAD adjustment line, that's the recharacterization of part of the DFL, Rich, from our DFL line item down to JV and other income. Because of a -- because we have a minority ownership interest in HCR ManorCare OpCo. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, so could that be as big as $30 million or so for 2012? 
Timothy Schoen: It's actually $59 million. 
James Flaherty: I think Tim took you through the -- Tim took us through it in his high level remarks, Rich. 
Timothy Schoen: I'll be happy, Rich, to go through that in detail with you offline. 
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan. 
Rob Mains: Just a couple of odds and ends here. Tim, the $4.7 million mark-to-market on marketable securities, could you explain what that was? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, that was our ownership in Brookdale stock. The accounting regs there require you to take that quarter end price, which was $17.40, Rob, which is obviously, the stock is higher today but that's what that's all about. 
Rob Mains: Right, okay. Remind me then. It's a rule then that you book -- you take -- you mark losses but you don't mark gains, or am I wrong about that? 
Timothy Schoen: Until you actually realize the gain. 
Rob Mains: Okay, all right. Jay, you talked about the kind of the asset types that look good right now. Given sort of where you see strategically, sort of the health care delivery system moving towards, are there any asset types that you're not interested? I think in the past, you talked about for instance, specialty hospitals. 
James Flaherty: Yes, specialty hospitals, LTACHs, to be honest, acute-care hospitals. But kind of for a different reason. We're not concerned that acute-care hospitals are going to vanish in the next round of reimbursement changes but we do believe that space is very, very operational-intense and likely to become more operational-intense, whether it's their cost structures, with labor and union activity, and then the constant demand for more technology and then you've got the reimbursement environment, you've got the managed care providers who've become quite substantial in size. So in hind --again, I preface everything by, when people ask us about what sectors we're looking at, within the context of our 5x5 model, I think we're more likely to do something incremental on the hospital space if that was more of a debt sort of product as opposed to equity ownership. We love what we've got in acute-care hospitals but I don't think you should expect to see us add materially to that from the standpoint of an equity ownership. So that's how I'd kind of answer some of those thoughts, Rob. 
Rob Mains: Okay, great. And then that's actually a good lead into my next question which is given the increasing complexity the acute-care hospitals are facing and some of the ways that they're reacting to ACAs, ACOs and the like, I think this question comes up all the time. Starting to shake loose any of the medical office buildings that they own that arguably they shouldn't, are you seeing any activity towards that? 
James Flaherty: That's the great hope, right? That the tax-exempt markets continue to be challenged and the operating challenge is in that space, that's the great hope. I think you've got a barbell effect going on there, not dissimilar to some of the other sectors, which quite frankly, you could include healthcare REITs as well. The strong are getting stronger and the folks that aren't so strong are likely to go away. I thought I saw yesterday where HCA sold some new debt at a coupon that started with a 5. So they are certainly -- have very access to very, very attractive cost of capital. So I think to date, you've seen 1 or 2 instances of the health care system monetizing some of its MOBs with an eye towards reinvesting those proceeds in their physical plant. I would say for the most part, that's been more of a defensive move by those hospital systems as opposed to an offensive, kind of a strategic call to say hey, we're getting out of the bricks and mortar of MOBs. But we'll see what happens here over the next year or 2. 
Rob Mains: Okay. So clearly, it's not a trend? 
James Flaherty: At this point, I think it is not a trend. All the elements in terms of -- that it should become a trend are certainly -- have been in place and remain in place today. But you haven't seen much in the way of actual transaction volume to support the thought process. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Todd Stender: My question is related to life science, so probably directed to John. Just looking at the portfolio, how is that going to look 5 years from now? Is this in general a property type that's offers good visibility on space demand? And just geographically, are we going to start to see the portfolio move away from South San Francisco and Torrey Pines and then move towards markets like Utah? 
James Flaherty: Oh gosh, no. No, I think if you think about life science, you want to be in the 4, maybe 5 geographic markets that are the largest beneficiaries of the NIH grants from the government. So in ranked order those are #1, the Bay Area; #2, Boston, Cambridge; and probably #3, it might be tied for the Maryland, Baltimore corridor and San Diego; and then probably, 5 would be Seattle. So I think to the extent you see us do life science, it'll likely be in those markets. So that's how I'd answer the geographic part of your question, Todd. With respect to what this portfolio looks like, I would say in addition to -- this is the safe -- of our 5 property sectors, this is the property sector that has the preponderance of land for future development. So -- and we've got some of that in Northern California, in the Bay Area at the Cove, which is in South San Francisco and our Sierra Point parcel, which is in Brisbane, which is right between South San Francisco and downtown San Francisco. And then you got some down in the San Diego area, most notably in Carlsbad and Poway. So my guess is you'll see some activity on those parcels which could look like build-to-suit with pre-leasing commitments or could take other forms of monetization as well. 
Todd Stender: And just what are your tenants saying? Are the tenants in general willing to give out where they want to be 3 to 5 years from now? And does that -- how does that relate to what they were saying say, 3 to 4 years ago? 
James Flaherty: It really hasn't changed in the life science. I mean that ranking that I just gave you, 1 through 5, the Bay Area; Boston; Cambridge; Baltimore, Maryland; San Diego; Seattle, that would have been -- those would've been the same 5 markets 5 years ago. They might have been ranked a little differently. I think San Diego 5 years ago might have been second, and Boston, Cambridge third. But that really hasn't changed an awful lot. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add something. 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, Todd, I would guide you towards the investment that continues to happen in that space. There continues to be, over the last 3 years, a record  amount of investment into the life science space in the $65 billion range, primarily partnering with larger pharma -- with some of our life science tenants. So the investment continues to be very robust in that sector. 
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Jay, I realized that most of your leases are triple net, but just curious what you were hearing at his point about the potential for Prop 13 in California to kind of start to exclude commercial real estate just given you guys own so much commercial real estate in that state. 
James Flaherty: We've got again, I think I probably have the same answer, Tayo, that I gave to the request to have any comment on what might be coming out of either health care reform or the President's budget which was announced last night. I mean, we take that all in, we look at it but it remains to be seen whether any of that is actually going to end up being reality. 
Paul Gallagher: Tayo, it shouldn't impact any of our existing buildings. It's going to be a real factor on the acquisition of new buildings if for whatever reasons, your valuations have to go up and it's going to impact valuation. So at that point in time, we'll have to just assess it. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: I just have a quick follow up on the senior housing developments. Just wondering what drove the decision to do construction loans as opposed to developing on balance sheet and just leasing to Brookdale? 
James Flaherty: Can you say that again? 
Michael Mueller: Yes, for the senior housing developments, what drove the decision to do -- to structure these as construction loans as supposed to developing on balance sheet and just ultimately doing a sale leaseback? 
Timothy Schoen: Well, you currently have the income associated with the loans as opposed to the drag from development. 
Michael Mueller: Okay, and how long will the loans be outstanding? 
Paul Gallagher: It's a 5-year term. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Macquarie. 
Nicholas Yulico: Just going back to the development loan business, did you say it was $100 million that's the  commitment outstanding right now? 
James Flaherty: Is that the Nick Yulico? 
Nicholas Yulico: That's me, live and direct. 
Nicholas Yulico: The Nick Yulico, the author of the proprietary Macquarie's sniff test? That Nick Yulico? 
Nicholas Yulico: That's right. 
James Flaherty: You want to take the development question? 
Timothy Schoen: Yes, we've got $100 million commitment outstanding right now. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And do you have -- can you give the total unit side that? 
Timothy Schoen: I don't have the total numbers right now. 
James Flaherty: 5 separate communities. 
Timothy Schoen: 5 projects averaging in size between 75 and 100 units so it's probably close to 600 or 650 units. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay, and would these all fall into the Brookdale program max process? 
James Flaherty: Well, they're all going to be managed by Brookdale. It's probably premature yet to see... 
Paul Gallagher: Remember, we're debt in this. There's a borrower here so Brookdale is managing. And to the extent we exercise purchase options upon completion, then we would look at what type of structure we might have at that point in time but right now, we're just purely a debt investor. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. But you said that there was a purchase option, right? 
Paul Gallagher: Yes. 
Nicholas Yulico: That you guys have? Can you just talk, I mean, when these facilities might get delivered and a little bit more about how the purchase option might work? 
Paul Gallagher: It's about an 18-month construction process. We have the ability to purchase upon stabilization, for the outset after the fourth anniversary of the start of the project. And we also have a first right of refusal if they look to sell the properties. So we kind of cover ourselves on both sides. 
Nicholas Yulico: So presumably, this could be used -- this whole program could be used as a way to perhaps expand our idea platform with Brookdale in the future? 
James Flaherty: Sure. I mean we would look at that upon stabilization, and we'd make the same -- same way we look at all these opportunities, triple net versus RIDEA. If there's a sufficient premium for a RIDEA structure, we would certainly give that serious consideration. 
Operator: And there are no further questions on queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jay Flaherty, Chairman and CEO. 
James Flaherty: Thanks, Zenita. Thank you, everyone. Happy Valentine's Day, and we look forward to seeing you soon. Take care. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
