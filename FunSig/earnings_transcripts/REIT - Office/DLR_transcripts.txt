===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Digital Realty Trust, Inc. First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Callers will be limited to one question and we will aim to conclude at the top of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s senior vice president of public and private investor relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s first quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief investment officer, Greg Wright, chief technology officer, Chris Sharp, and chief revenue officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q and A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance, and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, we posted strong overall leasing in the first quarter of $242 million consistent with a record pace set in 2024 and driving our backlog of booked not billed leases to a new record of $919 million. Activity was robust across our primary product segments. Second, core FFO per share growth accelerated ahead of our expectations for the quarter and with our record backlog have strong visibility for the remainder of 2025 and growing momentum for 2026. And third, we further evolved our funding model this quarter, following the successful formation of our first US hyperscale fund. Enabling us to meet the growing needs of our customers while scaling our balance sheet and enhancing our returns.
Andy Power: Thanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. The first quarter of 2025 was fraught with attention-grabbing headlines focused on advances in AI and the potential implications for the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out. But Digital Realty Trust, Inc. continued to execute our full spectrum meeting place strategy and posted strong results. With the strength of our one key results, and the visibility provided by a record backlog, we remain confident in our 2025 growth targets and are encouraged by the 40 plus percent increase in our 2026 backlog since the beginning of this year. At 100% share, our backlog of signed but not commenced leases exceeded $1.3 billion at 03/31/2025. Despite the headlines, demand for data center capacity remains strong and our value proposition continues to resonate. Evidenced by nearly $400 million of new leasing completed in the quarter or $242 million of new leasing at Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s share. With healthy contributions from both our major product categories. Leasing in our zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment was $69 million, our second highest ever behind only last quarter's record. This quarter's total included $15 million of interconnection bookings. The leasing achieved in the first quarter in this segment was ahead of pace relative to last year's record $250 million of leasing. Which is a reflection of our team's intense focus and execution on our meeting place strategy. We completed nearly $325 million of greater than a megawatt leasing in the quarter reflecting the demand we are capturing and executing across platform digital in the quarter. At our share, greater than a megawatt leasing was $102 million. Demand for large capacity blocks remains strong and diverse. Over the past five quarters, we've topped $100 million of leasing volume in the greater than a megawatt category four times. With four different customers signing the largest lease in each of those quarters, including this quarter. In fact, the single largest lease in the first quarter of 2025 set a new record for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. in terms of total annualized rent signed. In our experience, hyperscale customer activity is more likely to rhyme rather than repeat. Each customer typically beats to its own drum, so when some slower pause others push forward. Today, we continue to be encouraged by the secular demand drivers of digital transformation, cloud, and AI which have been in place for the last several quarters and are supported consistent interest across our portfolio including large capacity blocks. Reflecting this dynamic, pricing reached a new milestone in the quarter, with the overall rate on new data center leasing $244 per kilowatt per month up 10% from the prior record. Reflecting strength within the greater than a megawatt category. Looking ahead, our pipeline remains healthy and diverse. Customer and partner interest and engagement were high throughout the quarter and continued into 2Q. Customers continue to see significant value in contiguous capacity in core markets that can support multiple use cases. Network optimization to hybrid clouds to artificial intelligence. While it is important to acknowledge the risk posed by elevated uncertainty, capital markets volatility Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s product pipelines remain near record levels. In the meantime, we continue to focus on serving our 5,000 plus customers in the major markets around the world. This quarter, bookings were strongest North America hyperscale, but we are seeing demand from all regions and for both products. To meet this growing demand, we increased our development pipeline by another 70 megawatts since year-end 814 megawatts at a % share. Of this total, 63% is preleased with the lion's share of the remaining hyperscale availability focused in Northern Virginia. We continue to see healthy interregion activity across our global platform in the first quarter, EMEA was the biggest importer with strong activity from all other regions. We also had very strong enterprise export activity from The Americas and APAC with EMEA as the preferred destination from each region. It is clear that our global full spectrum data center platform is a key differentiator for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Is a key component of our value proposition, as customers may onboard to platform digital with just a cabinet but can then scale to a cage that leverages hyperscale cloud compute and will soon provide access to AI for all customers. During the first quarter, we added another 119 new logos including a leading global semiconductor equipment manufacturer deploying high-performance computing in pairs to take advantage of the well-developed cloud and network communities along with an emerging AI community on platform digital. Other key wins in the quarter include a leading high-frequency trading fintech is expanding on platform digital to add private AI by increasing their HPC platform to a new market while improving cloud access and business continuity. An Oracle partner is expanding its footprint on platform digital to Zurich, to support Oracle's dedicated region integrated solution for private cloud. To address data localization and data sovereignty. A leading blockchain provider is also expanding to a new metro on platform digital to deploy infrastructure to support decentralized private and public networks. A Fortune 500 payments and transactions company is expanding their global presence on platform digital into The Nordics to self-compliance and data localization needs. And an AI inference and training company and a new logo is utilizing the connectivity available on platform digital to provide a scalable solution for their AI inference applications. We continue to expand the reach and connectivity of platform digital during the first quarter, with our entrance into Indonesia, We partnered with a leading Jakarta-based carrier-neutral data center platform to create Digital Realty Persama. Which will expand its connected campus, offering direct access to a wide array of networks and services, including a direct connection to Indonesia's largest Internet exchange provider. Supported by a young and large population, growing cloud adoption, and access to multiple subsea cables, Jakarta is an attractive expansion location that complements our existing APAC footprint. We also launched our Heracleion One data center in Crete, earlier this month. Which complements our Athens campus and adds a key connectivity hub in the Eastern Mediterranean. Strategically linking Europe with Asia The Middle East, and East Africa via a dense network of highly connected subsea cables. Also during the quarter, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Console Connect announced a strategic collaboration that will expand the reach of Service Fabric to more than a hundred new third-party data centers, access to more than 75 new cloud on-ramps. Enriching the global connectivity options available to enterprises across platform digital. In closing out our connectivity-oriented advances, this morning, we announced the addition of three new Azure on-ramps. One in Atlanta, one in Brussels, and one in Vienna. These on-ramps expand our global relationship with Microsoft as we now host 15 cloud on-ramps across four continents. Moving over to the financing side of the business, after more than a year of hard work across our team, this year, we announced our first US hyperscale data center fund. Continuing to evolve our funding model and further expanding the pool of capital available to support the growth of hyperscale data center capacity. The fund offers a unique opportunity for private institutional investors to invest directly in hyperscale data centers alongside the world's largest data center provider. It is dedicated to investing in high-quality hyperscale data centers located across top-tier US metros, including Northern Virginia, Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte, New York Metro, Silicon Valley. We've seeded the portfolio with five operating assets and four land sites for data center development, and have received very strong interest and limited partner commitments from some of the world's savviest investors. Including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and other institutional investors. The investors have done their due diligence committed capital, and placed their trust in Digital Realty Trust, Inc. We are targeting $2.5 billion of equity commitments from our LPs and we expect to maintain a 20% or greater interest to ensure alignment. All told, the fund will support approximately $10 billion of hyperscale data center investment enabling us to serve the robust demand of our customers while enhancing our returns through fees. We received more than $1.7 billion of commitments through our first closing, placing us ahead of schedule relative to our year-end target. And we continue to field investor interest. As Matt will discuss in a moment, our progress puts us well on track to meet our capital recycling guidance for 2025 and to fund growth in 2026 and beyond. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global sustainability progress. During the first quarter, we opened Friday team, a 16 megawatt data center adaptively reusing the historic and iconic site while delivering cutting-edge technology solutions with a deep focus on sustainable performance and water conservation. Draw eighteen is optimized for AI, and high-performance compute applications with advanced liquid cooling along with the integration of service fabric for enhanced data security and connectivity. Importantly, this state-of-the-art brownfield development is powered by 100% renewable sources as are all our facilities in EMEA. This sustainable building in Frankfurt continued Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s leadership in the industry with high-performance green buildings. We added a 90 megawatts of third-party certified green data centers in 2024. Also in the first quarter, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. reached 100% renewable energy coverage for operations in Singapore a top priority in that market given the country's resource constraints and its Smart Nation initiative. We have installed solar on our facilities over the past couple of years, And in the first quarter, signed a PPA with Tuos Power for Biomass and other regionally sourced renewables to fully cover our load. This further expands the more than 150 data centers around the world that are matched with 100% renewable electricity and adds to our portfolio of 1.5 gigawatts of contracted renewable capacity. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. continued to post healthy results in the first quarter, as strong leasing pushed our backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases to a new record. While the formation of our first hyperscale fund added a new horse to our funding stable. These milestones enhance our visibility and predictability of earnings growth, improve our returns, and further reduce our reliance on any single capital source. While enabling Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to responsibly invest to serve the needs of our customers. In the first quarter, we grew core FFO by 6.1%. Posted strong leasing, results, and increased the capacity under development by another 26%. Despite delivering nearly 50 megawatts of new capacity during the quarter. A great start to the year. We signed aggregate leases representing nearly $400 million of annualized rent. At a % share in the first quarter. Which was the second highest in Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s history. At our share, we signed $242 million of new in the first quarter. Notable strength across each of our two segments. We completed nearly $69 million of bookings in our zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment. Which marked the second highest quarter for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. following last quarter's record. This activity also exceeded the prior four-quarter average bookings by nearly 10%. We also signed $172 million within the greater than a megawatt category at our share, largely driven by hyperscaler leasing in North America. Consistent with our objective of improving Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s long-term sustainable growth, more than 85% of our bookings included fixed rent escalators of at least 4% or were linked to CPI. Our backlog at Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s share totaled $919 million at quarter-end. An increase of 7% above our prior record. As $119 million of commencements was more than offset by our strong new bookings. Looking ahead to the rest of 2025, we expect to see strong commencements in the next two quarters providing momentum into the end of the year and beyond. For 2026, currently have $440 million scheduled to commence. While another hundred plus million commences in 2027 and beyond. Providing strong visibility for multiyear growth. For context, our 2026 backlog is already more than double the backlog we had for 2025. At this time last year. During the first quarter, we signed $147 million of renewal leases at a blended 5.6% increase on a cash basis consistent with our four to 6% full-year guidance. Renewals in the first quarter were heavily weighted toward our zero to one megawatt category, $127 million of renewals at a 3.8% uplift. Greater than a megawatt renewals were relatively sparse at only $5 million. With a 4.6% uplift. We remain on track to meet our full-year guidance. For the quarter, churn declined and ended at 1.5%. As for earnings, we reported first-quarter core FFO of $1.77 per share. Up 6% year over year. Reflecting strong same capital operating results combined with new commencements over the past year. On a constant currency basis, we reported core FFO per share of $1.79. In the first quarter. During the quarter, operating expenses were $0.01 to $0.02 lower than expected due to a slower ramp in repair and maintenance spend following an uptick in the fourth quarter, while property taxes benefited from a 1¢ refund in the quarter. Data center revenue was up 7% year over year as the combination of strong renewal spreads rent escalators, and new lease commencements more than offset the drag associated with the dispositions completed over the last twelve months. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% year over year, reflecting the growth data center revenue combined with expense controls. Same capital cash NOI growth was healthy in the first quarter. Increasing by 5% year over year on a constant currency basis driven by 5.7% growth in data center revenue. Moving on to our investment activity. During the quarter, we spent approximately $1 billion on development CapEx on a gross basis including our partner share. And roughly $700 million on a net basis to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. We delivered nearly 50 megawatts of new capacity 83% of which was preleased. While we started another 219 megawatts of new projects highlighted by 200 megawatts in Northern Virginia that is 50% preleased. At quarter-end, our data center development pipeline increased to $9.3 billion at a 12.5% expected stabilized yield. In addition, as Andy highlighted, we invested approximately $95 million for a 50% interest in Digital Realty Persama. Expanding into a highly connected platform in Indonesia. We are also pleased to announce the formation of our first US hyperscale data center fund, which has the potential to support up to $10 billion of data center investments. In the second quarter, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. expects to contribute a portion of five existing operating assets with an aggregated agreed value of more than $1.5 billion which will satisfy the majority of our disposition guidance for 2025. Turning to the balance sheet. We have spent the last two and a half years positioning Digital Realty Trust, Inc. for the opportunity that lies ahead. By deleveraging our balance sheet and bolstering and diversifying our capital sources. Leverage is still well below our long-term target at 5.1 times while liquidity remained robust at more than $5 billion before considering the capital from our new fund. Early in the quarter, we raised €850 million of 3.875% notes which was used to pay off the £400 million of maturing 4.25% gilts. With the balance used to reduce outstandings on our credit facility. This leaves us with €650 million of maturity debt through the rest of 2025. Looking further out, our maturities remain well laddered through 2035. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity was four point five years, and our weighted average interest rate ticked down to 2.6%. Approximately 83% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 93% of our net debt is fixed rate, and 96% of our debt is unsecured. Providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are increasing our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2025 by 5¢ to $7.05 to $7.15 per share. To reflect our updated FX assumptions for the full year. The new core FFO per share guidance now aligns with our constant currency guidance. Is worth noting that while our constant currency core FFO per share is trending toward the high end of the range through the first quarter, we have chosen to maintain this guidance range given the heightened degree of macro and geopolitical uncertainty today. The midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance represents approximately 6% year over year growth reflecting the underlying strength in our business balanced by meaningful step up in development spend, and a substantial reduction in leverage year over year. On a normalized and constant currency basis, we continue to anticipate total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 10% in 2025. Reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals of our business. In accordance with our updated FX assumptions for the year, we are increasing both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2025 by $25 million while our G and A assumption increased by $5 million. We are maintaining the rest of our guidance assumptions for 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q and A session?
Operator: We will now open up the call for questions. In the interest of time and to allow a larger number of people to ask questions, callers will be limited to one question. To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question is from John Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Atkin: So I was wondering, as you factor in the trends that you saw in the first quarter, and coupled with some of the recent commentary surrounding hyperscaler demand, and the increased uncertainty we've seen over the last several weeks how do you see the leasing environment over the next several quarters?
Andy Power: Thanks. John. So we're obviously off for a very strong start to the year. Both in the enterprise colo segment and also in hyperscale and including in the hyperscale that largest signing we had was signed in the month of March, so not that long ago. Now the backdrop has certainly changed in just the last few weeks. Which has certainly created significant market volatility and a fair bit of uncertainty. But despite this, our pipeline of bull across both of those customer segments remains very robust. So on the enterprise front, even coming off of now a string of several pretty fantastic quarters, our pipeline is at a record level. And on the hyperscale side of the equation, you can see from what we've disclosed, we have a runway of numerous sites. With those large contiguous capacity blocks installed after locations. I could tell you in just the last several days, quotes for those large capacity blocks have been requested by customers and are going out across multiple markets. I think it's important, though, to remember something that's a different differentiating point about our strategy. So one, when it comes to the markets, we have and we continue to focus on markets with both robust and diverse demand, so enterprise service providers cloud availability zones for compute, and now AI, serving vocational and latency-sensitive workloads. And those markets have and we continue to see experiencing supply constraints. Two, we never lost our focus or eye on the ball when it came to accelerating our enterprise and colo execution on multiple fronts. So you've seen that in the customer wins, the new signings, where we're growing as we highlighted in the prepared remarks. All the way to our latest new country entry with Indonesia. And then lastly, when it comes to hyperscale, we focus on places where we believe we can best serve our hyperscale customers. We're not trying to be all things to all hyperscalers. So be it our tremendous track record for delivery and operational excellence, having these must-have runways for growth or that boots-on-the-ground experience. This has really allowed us to support those hyperscale customers when they need us most to solve critical capacity problems often in our core markets when others simply cannot.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Cho with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. I know there's a lot of uncertainty around this question, but
Richard Choe: the best you could, given the current state of things, If prices and tariffs kinda come through your supply chain, when should we expect to see that in your development costs? And how would you kinda mitigate that? Thank you.
Andy Power: Thanks, Richard, for the question. So first off, I think you gotta take a step back as it relates to digital in that question because I don't think the answer is gonna be all data center providers are gonna be created equal in this category. And you heard from us for several quarters, if not years, We have, call it, long-standing vendor and partner relationships with the vendor-managed inventory programs, and the consistency, building and delivering operating in our markets called keeping our folks at work with consistency. Which I don't think I could say that I was at a different data center provider. For from our standpoint, based on the current facts and circumstances, which we all know are evolving, almost minute by minute, We're seeing a very modest, call it less than 5% impact to potential build costs when it comes to digital. That has a lot to do with how we operate our business, That has to do with our supply chains being both very US-focused as well as if not US, very Mexico and Canada, and governed under current USMCA carve-outs from tariff implications. So not nothing, but very modest numbers. At the same time, we are not sitting idly. We have been even leading up to the chain of events that have unfolded, been proactively getting out ahead of this. Our supply chain team owes a lot of kudos for that. In terms of ordering components wherever we could to pull forward components that we need to derisk potential incremental volatility or outcomes that could happen on the tariff front. So I don't think you'd see this really unfold in probably until call it, several quarters when it comes to actual development cycles. Given what you have today on our in under construction have called actual contractual orders for equipment. And I do think it's gonna be pretty modest assuming there isn't a dramatic change of events to what our current understanding of the tariff implications.
Operator: The next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thanks. Can you provide a little bit of color on the land acquisitions in Atlanta and Charlotte? Both which are markets where you've had a retail presence but not much of a hyperscale one? I think previously, been perhaps a little bit hesitant to expand into The US market. What what makes these attractive, particularly Charlotte?
Andy Power: Sure. Thanks, Ari. I'll toss it to Greg to to touch on our expansion of our capabilities in those markets.
Greg Wright: Yeah. Thanks for the question. All right. Let me start with Charlotte. Look, I think it's it's not surprising. I think all investors on the phone know that traditional markets are expanding and, you know, Charlotte meets our criteria in terms of a target market. Me just remind folks. We've operated in Charlotte for a long time. We have the key connectivity hub in what's called Uptown Charlotte. But now we're seeing availability zones coming in from several of the major cloud providers. So as we see this, you know, we're creating this campus that's consistent with our traditional connected campus strategy, by developing a hyperscale campus that's within 10 miles of a highly connected facility. And, just to remind folks again, our facility there, we have I think it's north of roughly 25 networks, significant cross-connect count, roughly 40 customers. Know, and we've recently been awarded an on-ramp. We look at that and look at the components of what makes a market competitive and attractive. We really do believe Charlotte is is is is well on its way to be a tier one market. We have a location that's a latency-sensitive location. So it, you know, checks all those boxes. That we we tend to to like. Also, let me remind you, Charlotte you know, is home to a large number of enterprises especially in the financial services business and many of the Fortune 500 companies. And one last point, and then I'll get to Atlanta, is that our site in Charlotte you know, has power available on a very competitive basis. So I guess another way to say it is it's land with, you know, pressure power timelines, if you will. And most of those points we've made all apply to Atlanta as well. You know, we're we're we we've purchased a a parcel of land. That's gonna have a a mix between hyperscale and loc colocation. The colocation facility will be within 10 miles downtown Atlanta, which we love, obviously, given our our ownership of 56 Marietta. And as you know, when you look at the underlying fundamentals of a market like Atlanta, you know, there's a lot of the vacancies are very low. 1% or less. Power, you know, same thing. It's the power is in place on a very competitive basis. So when we look at that, we think those are both critical markets for us, and we're really excited to have, you know, between those two projects over 600 megawatts of developable capacity.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. My question relates more to hyperscale and I guess in recent weeks and months, we've been reading more about deep seek more efficient. AI models, and I guess, also a little bit more questions around revenue use cases tied to AI. And so I'm wondering whether, you know, less so macro but more around recalibration of overall CapEx being invested into AI, whether you're seeing or hearing any evolution in how some of your larger cloud and hyperscale customers are approaching CapEx investment plans? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Matt. Maybe I'll start off briefly then kick it over to Chris to talk a little bit about the evolution of of the infrastructure and and some of the deep sea early implications. I think again, I don't think all hyperscale is equal, and I think it comes back to focus on markets that have diversity of demand. So serving cloud availability zones, and AI being incremental use cases to that. I think it also makes sure you're not in places with numerous cloud availability zones. As I as we shared in the prepared remarks, the the the flow of of business when one customer may be slowing down, others are called steaming ahead. I think you've seen that now in the last call it, five quarters where we've had robust signings. In the four largest of those quarters, the largest lease each four of those was signed by a different customer. So four different hyperscalers called front of the pack for us at Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and none of those four are actually our top customer. So further emphasizing the diversity of that demand. But, Chris, why don't you call speak a little bit to some of the deep seeking locations as well?
Chris Sharp: I appreciate the question, Matt. Yeah. So you know, no one hardware or software advancement you know, are gonna win. So no single model, no single, you know, vintage of GPU It's an amalgamation of multiple capabilities coming together in the market. And I think that's what was represented with DeepSeek. It was a a pretty substantial step in efficiencies associated with models coming to market. But you're gonna see more of these. And I think what's interesting is the capabilities and ecosystems are driving a new utilization which is unlocking performance across the overall know, landscape of infrastructure represented in the market today. I think it's important to really emphasize that we're always focused on enabling inference because the second part of your question is around the monetization of AI. And so inference is where that monetization will happen and also associated with private AI deployments coming into the facility as well. So we're always focused on how can we support the interconnectivity in that broader ecosystem of capabilities coming to market, and that's really what's represented in our portfolio and some of the pipeline that we've referenced in the prepared remarks.
Operator: The next question is from Waters with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Alex Waters: Perfect. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just to start off, Andy, you noted in your prepared remarks you had the largest lease in kinda, like, greater than one megawatt. Could you help us frame just kind of the size of that and then what portion of that greater than one megawatt was quote, unquote, AI related? Thanks.
Andy Power: So so, Alex, without going into the the nitty gritty of individual customer contracts, let me frame it as this. So we did about $400 million total signings, %, and our share was at two forty plus. So you can kinda get back into portions flowing into builds or operational capacity that we are delivering or and managing on behalf of private capital partners. AI overall is about just over two-thirds, I would say, of our signings. So a a a a it's a new high watermark in terms of contributions. Again, as you look, all of those signs again were into our traditional core markets. That we've been serving for some time. So, certainly, customers pushing their AI needs into the the the the major markets that also have cloud availability zones. The you look at the composition of AI wins, I would say more hyperscale driven than enterprise this quarter in particular. But if you look at the pipeline we have on the enterprise AI use cases, I would say we've seen a a step up in size and quality of pipeline. The deal sizes when that Obviously, not major deals, but they're they're growing in size as well as power density. So I think that fits well with where our portfolio could help see these customers scale their infrastructure.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the leasing quarter and kudos to you, Greg, for the, for getting the fund rate. Just a blast from the past here. We're going back to the Teraco and the Ascenty acquisitions that you did. Could you just give us a reminder in terms of Teraco, if there's an option for the remaining stake and kind of what the thought is there? And then also, an update on on Ascenty, and if there's anything that's likely to happen there. Thank you.
Greg Wright: Greg, you wanna hit both of us? Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the kind words. Look. First, in the order of the question, let's go to Terraco. In Terraco, there is in 02/1926. There is a there's a put call mechanism that may or may not take place. And then that goes on. You know, it's originally it's a put period for two years. And then if that's not exercised, there's a call period after that. So that's halfway through '26. I may be a quarter or so off. But that's roughly the time period there. But, you know, look, I think, you know, that business continues to perform exceptionally well. And, we couldn't be happier with the investment in the management team there. They really do have a dominant position down there in South Africa. With respect to Ascenty, you know, again, Ascenty is going well. You know, partnership with Brookfield's great. Chris Torto and his team continue to execute. We're happy that market remains strong. They've made a lot of progress on the enterprise front down there. Historically, that was a more of a hyperscale play. But Chris and the team have been working really hard You know, they've adopted, you know, Andy's Andy's strategy here at Platform Digital. And they're doing a great job down there. So, look, I would say and and and just as with Teraco, we're very pleased with the team, with the assets, the performance. So and, you know, that there's there's no there's there's no rights for for or anything like that. So hopefully, that answers your questions.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jim Schneider: Just wonder if you can make a couple of comments. One on the backlog comment you made. I just see you talked about record backlog in enterprise. Is the hyperscale backlog also at record? Or has there been any kind of diminution there? Then can you maybe just sort of talk about the kind of current environment and whether you know, any pause or any kind of activity you're seeing in the current quarter would prevent you from sort of sustaining strong leasing quarters into q q two and q three. Thank you.
Andy Power: Hey. Thanks, Jim. So just to I think pipeline just to and I'll I will touch on backlog because I think it's important, or Mac and and amplify that. So pipeline, we did call out record on the enterprise side. I'm not sure if we're at a necessarily record on the other piece of the equation, but I'll tell you the speed of where the deals have been moving in that category are have been exceptionally fast, including, I think, our largest signing last quarter may have been done in record pacing for especially for a large deal. And as I mentioned, that had the end of response to the first question, we are actively engaging with customers who are requesting new quotes for those large capacity blocks. You did ask you did mention backlog, which would probably should touch on as well. I mean, we're we do have a record backlog of signed but not commenced contracts. $1.3 billion in total. Our shares just over $900 million. Those are at attractive rates and returns, long-term contracts. Attractive escalators, call it either CPI or north of 4% or higher, And we just had a call. If you look at the 2026 component, that stepped up about 40% in just the last quarter. Which is really gonna help contribute to our algorithm of accelerating our bottom line and generating better, long-term sustainable growth per share.
Operator: The next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Rob: Hey guys, this is Rob on for Frank. Thank you taking my question. So you might have touched on this a tad earlier, but what would have to change on your end in order to see releasing spread dip again? And do you potentially see pricing weakening in any of your markets?
Andy Power: The so let's maybe just well, break that down into into two components. In the in the zero to one megawatt side, we had to call it close call it close to 4% cash mark to markets on the new steel signing side, the new signing component, and they call it second highest quarter in the company's history off the back of a record quarter back to back. We have positive price action in almost every single one of our markets across the board in that zero to one category. So I don't see any lack of momentum continuing there. And on the larger deal side, we also had positive price movement can see that by the overall rates we were able to achieve in that category. And that the the latter that being more hyperscale somewhat comes back to supply demand dynamics. And when you look at where we've concentrated our bets, to support those hyperscale customers, we've really focused on places, like I said previously, that has robust and diverse hyperscale demand. Customers need to put those workloads and grow. Where they have the ability to have land large capacity blocks that have future-proof growth, and where supply constraints do not seem to be really being relieved to a great extent rapidly. Which all those ingredients together in the places where we're supporting hyperscaler seems to keep pricing firm on on our behalf.
Operator: The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. This one probably go to Greg. Given the volatility in interest rates, and equity markets we've seen over the past few weeks, have you seen any change in cap rates for stabilized turnkey data centers And then if you could just comment too, I think you said $1.5 billion of stabilized assets would go to the new fund. Was the cap rate on those? That'll be helpful for modeling.
Greg Wright: Sure. Thanks, Dave. Hope you're well. Well, look, the two points are related. But look, the answer is and and look. You've seen this, and I've seen this over time. Cap rates are impacted not just by interest rates, but also by growth rates. Right? So I think when you look at when you look at the data center space today, clearly cap rates have gone up. But I would also say there's been more than an offset in terms of commensurate growth, if you will. So the answer is we have not seen a change in cap rates that's meaningful. In fact, know, we see that across the board actually. In the different transactions we're seeing in the market, they've remained consistent. Again, rates are higher, but I think people are underwriting greater growth now. So that's the offset. With respect to the cap rate on the it's a little north of a billion 5. Of the assets that went into the fund. That was, you know, call it high fives. Cap rate, give or take.
Operator: The next question is from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. So I had another one related to pricing for new leases. Yeah. I I think, you know, positive trends are mostly broad-based, but especially pronounced in The Americas. Greater than one megawatt segment at two hundred fifty fifty two fifty seven per kilowatt. Can you just talk about the drivers of pricing strength on some of your new leases? Whether there were any one-offs or, you know, which markets were these new new leases were in. So, you know, any details on this would be helpful. Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Ervin. So the the success recently has been very US-focused. Because you've seen a compounding of demand from traditional enterprise IT, digital transformation, cloud computing demand, AI training, and and and the budding of AI inference from hyperscalers. And that's been a heavily US-focused phenomenon to date. We have in the last several quarters, captured that in a few markets including Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago. And this last quarter was particularly Northern Virginia led. I do think this phenomenon is will continue to globalize. Just like cloud computing globalized on the back of data sovereignty. Over time. And you're seeing that for numerous countries looking to really invest and and and grow AI and digital data center infrastructure. So I think that we are well positioned when that globalization phenomenon starts to bud. But it's it's what we I just described really driving the the accentuation of pricing in the in The US in particular.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. I appreciate you taking the question. You know, Andy, I think you mentioned that your enterprise funnel was at record levels if I heard you. So I wanted to dig into the you know, the the the enterprise segment in the the less than one megawatt, and I I suppose there's some in the largest larger footprint as well. Obviously, there's been a little concern to just just in the past few weeks with all the the tariff and macro noise. There could be some delayed decision making at the enterprise level. So I just wanted to confirm you're not really seeing that at this point, and, I think you've talked about growing your less than one megawatt bookings this year versus last. Just wanted to make sure that's still on track. Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Eric. I'm gonna turn turn it to Colin But the one thing I just wanted to highlight, I can't recall if we mentioned this, It's it's it's phenomenal. It's it's great to be out of the gate strong in that category in particular. On the backs of two really strong third and fourth quarters. To put up a number in the first quarter in the zero to one megawatt interconnection. The, let's call it, is 10% above the pacing we did last year. And last year was a great year. Overall. But I was gonna call in a little bit provide some color on on what results we saw in the pipeline ahead.
Colin McLean: Thanks, Eric. Yeah. As Andy highlighted previously, the demand profile continues to be robust and diverse across the regions. In our segments, global large enterprise and commercial. As Andy quickly just highlighted, a quick reminder on Q1 second highest booking quarters to date. That's a third straight quarter, zero to one megawatt performance, strong contribution, large enterprise in particular, that's 53% of the overall bookings. We saw six 16 industry subsegments book over $1 million and a strong interconnection performance, which speaks really the value of our platform. As it relates to the future pipeline, we have the largest zero to one megawatt pipeline on record. Regarding the overall opportunity creation, you know, within the global accounts, we continue to see multiple use cases emerge across network. And compute enterprise as 55% of the overall opportunity, and the trend is very much hybrid. On the commercial side, as we define it as a billion and below, there's record new logo pipeline performance. So all underscored with a really strong partner contribution, which about 33% of the overall pipeline. Key use cases and characteristics, hybrid cloud continues to emerge. Data localization, which is really driving distributed architecture is becoming prime. And we're seeing early stages of artificial intelligence as part of the overall pipeline. So as it relates to the zero to one megawatt pipeline, we're continuing to see demand really across all our markets.
Operator: The next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe breaking up your thought between sort of hyperscale and more cloud or enterprise demand you talk about the visibility you have in both segments from the perspective of historically, cloud is maybe a little bit more economically sensitive where versus maybe on enterprise, it's obviously very specific. So I'm wondering just in light of your comments last quarter where you talked about delayed decision making, How do you see both those segments in today's environment? And and just if if you still believe this year is a is likely a record year. Thanks.
Andy Power: Vikramad. So maybe parse through that here. So at a high level, going back to last piece, were you're saying we we had a a landmark $2,024,000,000,000 dollars in signings. And within that, great composition, both the zero to one and also greater than megawatt. Great, I think, 600 ish new customers. To the fold. Great verticals, segmentation, imports and exports. So all in all, great. And to be out of the gates now, almost pacing where we were on on a on in in the first quarter is is a great start. Now we got we got several innings left in in this game for this year, but quite pleased where we are out of the gates Maybe I'll let Colin talk to a little bit more about the enterprise versus the hyperscale cloud in terms of buying cycles? And any potential thoughts related to the macro environment implications?
Colin McLean: Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question. As Andy mentioned, hyperscale demand continues to really cement around large contiguous capacity blocks. So we're having active conversations you know, frankly, in our core markets where we have available capacity. On the enterprise side, you know, the buying cycle, you know, typically is is a little bit shorter that we haven't really seen any real changes, frankly, quarter over quarter in terms of timeline to make decisions and execute. That's been pretty solid. As it relates to enterprise and cloud compute.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Rawlings with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rawlings: Thanks and good afternoon. Curious if you could discuss the opportunity to try to compress the time frame to bring new development online, especially where there may be energy constraints. And within that context, if you're you're able to shorten this time frame based on the conversations that you're having with the hyperscalers do you think that would yield more sales sooner or based on the time frames that they're on, you're kind of, you know, working on a path that's complementary to their you know, their current prospects. Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Michael. So the compressing timelines is is I think remains a key attribute to increasing your win probabilities and better outcomes. There's no question about that. And we're we have been doing that, and we continue to do that on multiple fronts. And it obviously, it's it's a multileg stool to do that. Having the balance sheet that we've got today with, call it, $5 billion liquidity, The the commitments in hand for our first fund to fund that growth are key is a key attribute required and allows us to move more expeditiously to seize upon opportunities. Having supply chains set up and having folks on-site constructing in a continuous fashion is a key element as well. And having now our development pipeline, let's call it 9 and half billion dollars to date, very highly preleased, call it, almost 55% overall, with the lion's share of the unleased play in in the prime markets of, like, Northern Virginia. That that allows us to call it you know, work more nimbly. As well. And then lastly, these I would one of the key attributes that Greg touched on a little bit in a prior question is the land that's been recently acquired that has been competitively advantaged land. That has opportunity to serve customers in the near win nearest windows. So things that are are most attractive, not that is a big kudos to our team finding these opportunities, working with utility working with other partners to seize upon them, to essentially help customers in more critical locations. Like we have been doing and delivering the results you've seen in the last several quarters.
Operator: The next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question guys. You've disclosed working with a leading, Neo Cloud customer in a couple of locations. Can you talk about what sort of demand you're seeing from Neo Cloud is more broadly and how you're thinking about them from a new business perspective and a credit risk perspective? Thanks.
Andy Power: So that's that's correct. We have been we have supported we have been expanding our customer base to support, the Neo Cloud universe We are can tell you we're obviously being judicious like we are with almost any customers to make sure we're curating our base and campuses with diverse demand, to preserve and create long-term value for us and the customers That is that and that's that has been something that's been consistent with us for some time. We've seen demand from those customers, called big and small, and and we've I said, won our fair share of that without being overexposed certainly. And in some instances, we're in environments in the markets where we're serving customers where we already have other major customers that sometimes beat those NeoClouds to the punch. Because they sometimes move faster or want something that is really critical to them, and we would try to help them. And we try to help all of our customers. So I can't say that the neoclouds have climbed the ranks with us some of our other customers have rapidly climbed. Then last but not least, I some of them, not all, but have been tremendously successful to date. And we're rooting for them. We we wanna expand the hyperscale customer base. We wanna expand all of our customer base and allow numerous technology providers to take advantage of of the infrastructure they are providing through their GPUs and so on.
Operator: This concludes the q and a portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.
Andy Power: Thank you, Gary. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. led off 2025 with strong results in the first quarter. Continuing the momentum we demonstrated in 2024. Demand for data center capacity remains resilient and broad-based given the strong secular growth proliferation of technology across the globe. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. continues to work to support our customers' growing requirements as evidenced by the substantial growth in our development pipeline and the successful evolution of our funding model. We remain focused on our key strategic priorities and expect success to be realized through the acceleration of bottom-line growth in 2025 and increased visibility of better long-term sustainable growth. Scaling our business across the globe is a tremendous effort and I am extremely grateful and appreciative of our incredibly talented and dedicated team. I'm excited about the future and remain focused on seizing the at hand. Thank you all for joining us today.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-13 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question and we will aim to conclude at the top of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. First, we posted a second consecutive quarter of record leasing in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, contributing to a record $1 billion of total leasing completed in 2024. The 0 to 1 megawatt product continues to be a significant focus for Digital Realty, and we are encouraged by the growing strength and momentum of our execution. Second, in the quarter, we raised over $2 billion of new debt and equity capital as well as over $500 million of net proceeds from asset sales and JV contributions, boosting our liquidity to over $6 billion and reducing our leverage to 4.8 times at year-end. And third, we posted 6% core FFO per share growth in the fourth quarter, foreshadowing our expectations for 2025. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andy Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 2024 was a breakout year for Digital Realty as we capitalized on the surge in demand for data center infrastructure, positioned the company for the opportunity that lies ahead and continued to execute on the key strategic priorities that we outlined on this call two years ago, to enhance our long-term sustainable growth. Back then, we said that we would strengthen our customer value proposition and we are doing just that. The evidence from 2024 lies in over $1 billion of bookings, a convincing new record for us with a few several hyperscale transactions and nearly $250 million from the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection category, another record. Not to be outdone by new bookings, we also saw record lease renewal activity in 2024, which also approached $1 billion with cash rents rolling up 9% on average. We added a record number of new logos during the year, nearly 600 while expanding our connectivity rich solutions. We expanded the capacity of our total portfolio by over 200 megawatts in 2024, while scaling our development pipeline by over 75% to 7 billion plus of projects underway that are 70% pre-leased in order to serve our customers' growing data center needs. I also talked about innovating and integrating across our unmatched global portfolio. And we've rolled out new products and services such as high-density Colo 2.0, a cooling solution to support densities of up to 150 kilowatts per rack, the expansion of ServiceFabric to 38 metros around the world, and private AI Exchange, an open platform available through ServiceFabric, which enables enterprises to seamlessly integrate their data with AI capabilities and other technology solutions. By combining these leading-edge solutions with our global full-spectrum strategy of connective campuses that offer Colo, scale, and hyperscale capacity, customers can count on Digital Realty to meet all of their data center needs. Finally, we vowed to diversify and bolster our capital sources to expand our capacity to support our customers' growing requirements, improved capital efficiency, and reduce our leverage while increasing the returns to Digital Realty shareholders. We've done this by adding to the menu of debt and equity capital options, opportunistically recycling capital out of stabilized and non-core assets, and partnering with a diverse and high-quality list of private capital providers. Some of these activities have resulted in short-term headwinds to our results, but all of them have enhanced our operating momentum and financial position, enabling us to accelerate our bottom-line per share growth. But there is still tremendous opportunity to be seized upon as we lead this dynamic in an increasingly global industry. Demand for data center capacity remains robust, both for larger AI-oriented capacity blocks and to support growth in cloud and digital transformation, while data center supply remains tight. Highlights for the fourth quarter include $100 million of new leases signed at Digital Realty share, driven by a 16% sequential uplift in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings for a new record of $76 million. Unsurprisingly, greater than a megawatt bookings dipped sequentially following last quarter's blowout, though the pipeline remains strong. Looking inside our 0 to 1 megawatt bookings, we experienced strong and balanced growth in both the Americas and in EMEA, with both regions achieving new records in the quarter. We continue to see a growing healthy mix of various-sized deployments within our 0 to 1 megawatt business, reflecting how our full spectrum strategy enabled Digital to provide solutions for large and small deployments along with everything in between. Some customers might simply need a network node to utilize our robust connectivity in the Central City Hub, while smaller enterprises might choose to locate a [sub 1] (ph) megawatt deployment for compute or storage requirements in a facility outside of the city center. Interconnection bookings were also strong at $15 million, nearly matching last quarter's record. Finally, the strength and breadth of data center demand and the progress of our go-to-market initiatives are also reflected in our addition of a record 166 new logos. We continue to see healthy inter-region activity across our global platform. Hyperscalers drove a portion of this activity with our largest global customers driving record export activity to other regions around the world. EMEA exports were again at record levels with heightened transatlantic bookings for deployments landing in the Americas. Our record bookings in 2024 pushed our backlog of booked but not yet billed leases up to roughly $800 million at year-end, providing strong revenue visibility for this year and beyond. As Jordan mentioned, we also continue to bolster our balance sheet and diversify our capital sources during the fourth quarter with support from asset sales, hyperscale development joint ventures, and highly successful debt and equity raises. These activities helped to push leverage below five times. Matt will provide more details on these activities in just a few minutes. Over the past few weeks, we have seen commitments for data center spending continue to grow. The new administration announced a $500 billion effort to support American-based AI development and others around the world are following suit. Earlier this week, I was pleased to join French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, along with US Vice President, JD Vance, and many other heads of state and industry leaders for France's AI Action Summit, which was geared toward convening the international community to discuss the use of AI for the common good. As I highlighted two years ago on my first earnings call as CEO, technology begets technology. In the past, innovation has typically led to greater efficiencies that ultimately spur incremental demand. At the time, we noted that we are at the precipice of the next wave of innovation that we thought might drive the next decade of data center demand. In 2024, we signed data center leases that were 80% higher than the next highest year, driven by steady growth in cloud and digital transformation as well as a surge in AI-related use cases. Today, we see a similar dynamic playing out to what we've witnessed in the past. And the rates renovation remains in full effect, while recent efficiency gains appears poised to facilitate the proliferation of AI to the enterprise. We heard from hyperscalers earlier this reporting season and none seem ready to moderate their pace of investment as data center infrastructure remains a critical resource to support AI innovation. Within our sales organization, we continue to see robust demand for data center capacity, including large capacity blocks driven by digital transformation, cloud, and AI. AI innovation is occurring on both the hardware and software side and Digital Realty is pleased to support and enable this innovation. One of our wins this quarter was Tenstorrent, a developer of scalable AI accelerators for both cloud and edge computing. During the fourth quarter, Tenstorrent leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to host their R&D lab in a 2-megawatt high-density colocation suite in a new metro that addresses their stringent engineering and time-to-market requirements. As they develop their leading-edge chips, Tenstorrent works with a number of partners, consistent with our median play strategy, they improve their efficiency by interconnecting with their partners on PlatformDIGITAL. So together, we partnered to deploy an AI-hosted desktop solution for AI model development and testing that included another Tenstorrent partner, resulting in another new logo to PlatformDIGITAL. That's an example of the network effect of being the meeting place. Other key wins in the quarter include a Global 2000 international banking group expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and localizing data for hybrid cloud. A world-renowned research and cultural institution was brought to us by a partner as they upgrade their HPC infrastructure, supporting Biology and Physics research workloads by taking advantage of PlatformDIGITAL's high-density colocation capabilities. And the Global 2000 insurance and reinsurance provider is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL to take advantage of robust networks and cloud ecosystems. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global ESG progress. During the fourth quarter, Teraco, our South African affiliate, started construction on a 120-megawatt utility-scale solar power plant, the first time a data center operator will own and utilize a solar power plant to support its data center load. The plant is expected to begin generating power in late 2026. This project will upgrade existing transmission infrastructure and enables the plant to add renewable energy into the grid and to be distributed to Teraco's campuses, improving its reliability and keeping Teraco on course to meet its clean-energy goals. In Chicago, we signed community solar agreements for a share of three separate solar projects totaling nearly 20 megawatts under the Illinois Shines Program. This new and local clean energy supply for our data centers in Chicago supports our 100% clean and renewable energy coverage there. Both actions in the fourth quarter add to Digital Realty's leadership and commitment to renewable energy. We now have more than 150 data centers around the world that are matched with 100% renewable electricity, with more than 1.5 gigawatts of contracted solar and wind capacity. But sustainability is not just about renewable energy. We are also excited about our collaboration with Ecolab to deploy an AI-driven water conservation solution in 35 of our US data centers to further enhance our water use efficiency. We expect this solution to reduce water use by up to 15% at those sites, while also extending the life of our equipment. Finally, Digital Realty was awarded NAREIT's Leader in the Light award for the eighth consecutive year while our VP of Sustainability, Aaron Binkley, will serve as Chair of NAREIT's Real Estate Sustainability Council in 2025. Big congratulations to Aaron. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Andy. As Andy noted earlier, 2024 was a transformative year for Digital Realty. Over the past 12 months, we posted record leasing results and increased the capacity under development by over 75%, while at the same time reducing our leverage from 6.2 times to 4.8 times. This achievement was a direct result of our strategy to bolster and diversify our capital sources. By recycling capital out of stabilized, slower-growth hyperscale and non-core assets and bringing in private capital to support hyperscale development, combined with the support of our public shareholders, we were able to simultaneously accomplish seemingly incompatible goals. We dramatically ramped development to better serve the needs of our customers while de-levering the balance sheet below our long-term leverage target and by the fourth quarter meaningfully accelerating our bottom-line growth. As we sit here today, with more than $6 billion of liquidity, below-target leverage, and a broad and diverse array of capital sources, we are positioned to fund the investments that are underway and the attractive opportunities that we continue to see ahead. Like other challenges, this achievement took a tremendous amount of teamwork. So I want to thank my fellow Digital Realty teammates for their efforts in 2024. Let's jump into fourth quarter results. We signed $100 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, led by a record $76 million of bookings in our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which exceeded the prior quarter's record by 16%. We also signed $23 million within the greater than 1-megawatt category, which was mostly weighted toward EMEA and APAC, following last quarter's outsized strength in the Americas. Pricing in our 0-1 megawatt category was strong, led by transactions in APAC and Americas, while pricing in the greater than 1 megawatt category reflected the modest sample size and market mix. Importantly, nearly 60% of leases signed include annual rent escalators of 4% or greater or/are linked to CPI, which bolsters our objective to drive better long-term sustainable growth. Our backlog at Digital Realty share totaled $797 million at year-end, modestly below the third-quarter record as $147 million of commencements exceeded new bookings. Looking ahead, of the nearly $400 million backlog that is scheduled to commence in 2025, about two-thirds is slated to commence by midyear with the balance starting in the second half. Looking further out, we are already -- we already have over $300 million scheduled to commence in 2026 and another $100 million slated to commence in 2027, setting a strong foundation for the multiyear growth. During the quarter, we signed $250 million of renewal leases and a blended 4.7% increase on a cash basis. Renewals were fairly straightforward and largely consistent with the original 4% to 6% uplift in cash releasing spread in our original 2024 guidance provided one year ago. For full year 2024, re-leasing spreads were 9%, aided by package deals that we have highlighted on prior calls. Excluding those deals, our full-year renewal spreads were still a healthy 5.2%, which is consistent with the guidance that we are issuing for 2025. Breaking down renewals by product category, cash renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt segment were a healthy 4.9% in the fourth quarter, while re-leasing spreads in the greater than 1 megawatt segment were up by 3.7%. For the quarter, churn remained well-controlled at 2%. In terms of earnings, we reported fourth-quarter core FFO of $1.73 per share, up 6.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued healthy growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Data center revenue growth accelerated to 8% year-over-year as the combination of strong renewal spreads, rent escalators, and new lease commencements more than offset the drag associated with more than $1 billion of dispositions throughout 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 7.4% year-over-year, broadly consistent with our growth in data center revenue. Normalized total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth were 10% and 13%, respectively, in full year 2024. Same capital cash NOI growth increased by 1.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as 2.5% growth in data center revenue was partially offset by higher property operating costs in the quarter. For all of 2024, same capital cash NOI increased by 2.8%, which was approximately 200 basis points higher when normalized for the outsized utility margin realized in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity. During 2024, we spent approximately $3 billion on development CapEx on a gross basis, including our partner share, and roughly $2 billion on a net basis to Digital Realty. In the fourth quarter, given the strong demand for data center capacity, we backfilled all of our deliveries with new starts, ending the year with the same 644 megawatts under construction. More specifically, we delivered 42 megawatts of new capacity in the quarter, while we added another 42 megawatts of new starts. The overall pipeline is 70% pre-leased with average expected yields hedging up to 12.1%. Consistent with the third quarter's record bookings, almost all the development underway in the Americas today is pre-leased with expected stabilized yields ticking up slightly to 13.7%. Some development capacity remains available in both EMEA and APAC, with both currently expecting double-digit stabilized yields. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, driving leverage below our long-term target and substantially enhancing our liquidity with nearly $3 billion of fresh capital raised since the end of September. On the debt side, in November, we successfully issued $1.15 billion of 1.875% five-year exchangeable notes, and we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding on our US dollar term loan. We also raised over $900 million of equity under our prior ATM program during the fourth quarter. In January, we issued another EUR850 million of 3.875% notes due in 2035 and then repaid GBP400 million gilts at 4.25%. This leaves us with only EUR650 million in maturing debt through the rest of 2025. Looking further out, our maturities remain well-laddered through 2035. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 4.8 times by year-end 2024, and today we have over $6 billion of total liquidity available. Moving on to our debt profile, at year-end, our weighted average debt maturity was over four years and our weighted average interest rate ticked down to 2.7%. Approximately 83% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 91% of our net debt is fixed-rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are establishing our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2025 at $7.05 to $7.15 per share on a constant-currency basis. The midpoint represents 5.7% year-over-year growth, reflecting the underlying strength in our business, balanced by a meaningful acceleration in development spend, along with a substantial reduction in our overall leverage. On a normalized and constant-currency basis, we anticipate total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 10% in 2025, reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals of our business. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow 3.5% to 4.5% on a constant currency basis. As for other guidance items, we expect the positive operating environment for data centers to continue. Cash renewals are again expected to be up approximately 4% to 6% and upside is partially mitigated by relatively high expiring rates in our greater than 1 megawatt portfolio. Occupancy should improve by another 100 to 200 basis points. CapEx net of partner contributions are expected to rise to between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, while gross CapEx will reach approximately $4.5 billion with development yields expected to remain in double-digits. And we will also continue to recycle capital with $500 million to $1 billion of dispositions and JV capital expected this year. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey guys, thank you so much, I really appreciate it. I guess, that I'd like to start maybe if Chris is available to kind of get, Chris, your perspective on how -- again we should be talking about DeepSeek, Andy, you referenced this roughly in some of the prepared remarks at the beginning, but we've historically talked about a framework, tokens to watts to dollars. And I guess it would just be great to hear kind of how your conversations with the hyperscalers subsequent to their reporting and their growing their CapEx outlooks. How this all fits together to make the outlook for Digital Realty better as opposed to maybe more concerning? Thank you.
Andy Power: Thanks, Dave. I'll hand to Chris in a second to talk through some of those elements. But I think you hit the nail in the head. We just -- on the heels of the DeepSeek news had the opportunity to listen from several of our top customers and really heard nothing but consistency in terms of, yes, this is a great accomplishment. This is a new player in the arena driving more efficiency to the model, but that doesn't take us off the course of the tremendous investment our top customers need to make on building out their AI infrastructure. And I think the CapEx [indiscernible] north of $300 billion compounding a tremendous rate year-over-year for now several years. And so we've heard that publicly on earnings calls like this and we've obviously heard it from our team who've had a lot of contact with our customers over the last several weeks, pre-DeepSeek, certainly, and post-DeepSeek. So I don't see there is a wavering in the course here of overall demand coming to digital. But Chris, why don't you expand upon some -- more of the intricacies?
Chris Sharp: Yeah, I appreciate the question, David. It's just that I agree with you, the tokens, watts, dollars is a good way and a good framework to look at the overall industry. I think we're going to continue to see AI being democratized not only through software models such as DeepSeek in which they represented the efficiencies, but also with like GPUs and there is going to be step functions that we'll continue to see in the industry. But this shift will drive higher and higher AI utilization to more and more customers, ultimately creating more and more demand for our facilities. And I would emphasize that a lot of our facilities, as we've talked about in the past are AI-ready with HD Colo and some of the elements that Andy mentioned in his prepared remarks. These will continue to be in a place where we can continue to support as inference comes to market or even private AI. And essentially, at the end of the day, we believe Jevons paradox will outpace Moore's law essentially.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi. I wanted to ask about the cash renewal outlook, it was 4% to 6% for this year. That's where you start off last year, but you ended up at 9%. Could we see a similar result or would that take more packaged deals to get there?
Andy Power: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So as you noted -- this last year we started out our guidance, we were at that 4% to 6% as you noted. We're in a similar position here for 2025 and our guidance today. And the reason we outperformed in '24, getting to that 9% was we had packaged deals that we were able to pull forward from outer year expirations into '24. Our guidance does not assume that there is any of that within our 4% to 6% number for 2025. And similar to along the lines of discussions we've had in '24, you're still seeing somewhat of an elevated rates -- expiry rates in '25. So we're still seeing positive mark-to-markets there, but you're going to be seeing an improving mark-to-market environment as you go out into outer years.
Operator: The next question is from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. So I wanted to ask about your bookings expectations looking ahead. And I understand that bookings by nature is a very lumpy metric and that's not something that you necessarily -- or you guide to, but you did do $1 billion this year or a little bit above that. Based on what you're seeing in the current pipeline and your 3.5 gigawatts of buildable capacity, do you think this $1 billion annual bookings rate is repeatable over any future 12-month period?
Andy Power: Hey, thanks, Irvin. So I think you really got to divide these into the larger capacity blocks and everything else categories. We obviously got to a record $1 billion of new signs last year, which was close to two times our prior record that has really created a development pipeline now that [indiscernible] 70% pre-leased at just over 12% ROI. And you can see from our bookings backlog, it's starting to roll out in 2025, but then a lot more of it starts hitting our P&L in 2026 and full-year contributions come thereafter. We are -- on the larger capacity loss, when you do so much leasing, the next batch of your leasing kind of goes into the deliveries that are just further out. And you can see that our unleased development pipeline, the megawatts in there, call it about 40% of that is Colo megawatts. So they're not going to get pre-leased on that far in advanced. We will have 500 megawatts of shell, either -- already built in already, which is fantastic and that will be the next batch. But you can see our delivery schedules, they're not going to deliver till end of the year or into 2026. So we're not necessarily in a panicking rush to fill those. We need to make sure that they're curating those to the right customers and the right outcomes to build thriving diverse campuses to help our customers wherever possible. And the sooner they deliver, the more precious they are to those customers. Meanwhile, on the other end of the curve, in our 0-1 megawatt interconnection category, we were delighted to put up a record. In 3Q, we put up another record on $76 million in 4Q, that was up 16% quarter-over-quarter, contributing to a record full year. And that is a place where we have ample capacity to keep selling into and put incremental records on in 2025 as well.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So you've been kind of messaging last year the guide that you gave today kind of in the mid-single-digits and you also had indicated that you do expect this trend to accelerate. So as we look forward beyond this year, what sorts of acceleration curve should we accelerate? Should we think about when it comes to core FFO per share given the conversion of your significant bookings to billings over the next several quarters? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Jon. I mean, I'll turn it to Matt to give you much of the puzzle pieces for the call thereafter 2025, but we stand by what we said earlier in the year, and I think we see all that in the guidance here, which is, call it normalized growth at the top line and EBITDA line in double-digits, flowing down to a bottom-line mid-single-digits or even better on a constant-currency basis. And Matt can give you some of the possible pieces of where we go from there for 2025 into 2026 with acceleration.
Matt Mercier: Yeah. Thanks for your question, Jon. I mean, this is a -- which I think is a good thing where we're consistent with what the messaging has been. We're delivering on the mid-single-digits growth in '25 and we have a view to work, as we've noted before, continued improvement in growth in years beyond. And I think a lot of what we did in '24 has really set the stage for that improving growth. When you consider we've got the inventory to do it, we've got 200 megawatts available under development today with 500 megawatts of shell behind it. We've got $700 million of backlog set to commence just over the next two years. And as I noted on a product basis, we've got an improving mark-to-market outlook as we look ahead towards expiring leases, which is part of what you're seeing and also improving same-store growth as well. So on top of that, we put ourselves in a position where we've got $6 billion of liquidity and below leverage targets. So I think all of that puts together into the mixing bolt to put us in a great position to continue to build on what has been improving bottom-line growth in '24, '25, and beyond.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Two topics. First, just digging a little bit more into the under 1 megawatt business. When you look at the improving performance and the back-to-back records that you recorded on leasing, do you see that as a rising tide that's just lifting all boats, including yours or do you see Digital taking share? And if you can expand on the characteristics within each of those? And then just secondly, on the net-debt leverage coming down, as you look at the incremental capacity that you have, is this solely directed at organic development opportunities or are you preserving some flexibility for some potential inorganic activity at some point? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Mike. So I'll hand it over to Colin. But maybe just in reverse order, we are very focused on using our now very ample liquidity and strong balance sheet as well as numerous levers to continue to fund organic development activities. So that is the main priority. When it goes to the under 1 megawatt, I mean, you're really just seeing this momentum unlock throughout 2024, and I believe it's going to continue into 2025. It was broad-based. [We’re looking at] (ph) number one quarter for Americas and EMEA, in addition to a number one quarter overall, it had great diversity of wins on different size breaks. The price action was strong on the new sign-ins. The price action was also strong almost 5% on the renewals in that category. I'll let Colin speak a little bit about the diversity of the demand and the outlook as well.
Colin McLean: Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question and I appreciate the comments on the quarter overall. We are really pleased on the 0-1 megawatt segment. That's really -- we feel like it's manifesting well our strategy and how it comes off as the full spectrum of offerings to our clients. And I think our clients are really recognizing global reach in core markets and large contiguous blocks really matter. And we saw that diversity of demand across the board, this was one of the larger -- large enterprise segments of the business, we've seen over 50% of the 0-1 megawatt bookings came out of the segment. We also had a really strong service provider quarter as well. So again, those two customer types playing off each other. So enterprises attract service providers and vice versa. And we're also pleased with our focus on the channel side. So 2024 is a landmark year for the channel, and we expect that to continue into the future.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. More of a clarification, as you think about growth for next year, I think you guys have talked about sort of organic growth that's 10% plus. I'm just wondering maybe for Matt, if we can think through what's embedded in the 5.8% to 5.9% around FX headwinds, potentially lower utility reimbursements, and any other factors that may be mitigating some of the reported growth next year? Thanks.
Matt Mercier: Yeah. So in terms of -- I mean, you saw what we put in terms of our constant currency. So we're looking at from an FX perspective, we're looking at roughly 200 basis points of headwind kind of from a -- probably from a P&L perspective that winds its way down to little less than 1% down to core FFO. I think the other -- so that all leads into, I think what Andy mentioned in terms of when you're looking at top line revenue down to adjusted EBITDA, we're really looking at in '25, 10% plus on a normalized basis. And so that normalized basis is really comprised of two main elements. There's FX, which I just mentioned, was around, call it 200 basis points. And then we're also normalizing for dispositions, joint venture transactional activity, which we had both, and what closed in 2024, we had some of that in the fourth quarter as well, as some in the first quarter. But also what we're expecting to happen in 2025, which is related to the disposition of private capital that we have in our guide of $500 million to $1 billion. So I think long-term, we're looking to maintain that, call it, top line to adjusted EBITDA 10% plus growth.
Operator: The next question is from Ari Klein with BMO. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thank you. There is been a lot of talk within the industry around inference, particularly post-DeepSeek. And I was hoping maybe you can describe how you see that potential demand around inference evolving. And whether you'd expect it to be more beneficial to your 0-1 megawatt business or greater than 1 megawatt business? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Ari. I'll hand it back to Chris. I think a stat that we didn't put in the prepared remarks that we forgot to call out, [38%] (ph) of megawatts we signed during the quarter were AI related and obviously we had a very much enterprise-heavy quarter given the record contributions in the 0-1 megawatt interconnection category. So certainly starting to see our fair share of AI come to the core markets coming to enterprises, certainly come to inference. But I believe we're still at the tip of an iceberg here, and I'll let Chris expand upon that.
Chris Sharp: Yeah, I definitely appreciate the question, Ari. It's definitely early innings of AI, right? And so I think a lot of the inference we see today is around augmenting current capabilities. So I think as you see some of these newer feature sets coming through AI by model, where you're seeing video and other things coming to market, that's going to drive a higher and higher demand in the overall. So what is required? So these capacity blocks that Colin was referencing earlier become more and more important. So maybe it doesn't fall in that sub-1 megawatt because we're actually seeing that these will be larger capacity blocks that may be larger than 1 megawatt. But just to kind of press upon the demands of inference, it will still have more and more proximity to the end consumer. I think that's the important piece that we always look at and where we apply our capital, is that long-term durability of where that inference matures because that's where the actual consumption or monetization of the AI will happen. And that's why we're very excited about how that will be maturing over time. I would also be remiss not to mention the other element of this that we're very excited about is private AI, right? So inference, you'll see that coming from a lot of the hyperscalers bringing their capability to market. But then on the averse of that, you're going to see a lot of private AI capabilities coming in where that too has an inference element to it. But we're very excited about our AI-ready capabilities in our facilities to support that broad spectrum of not only capacity blocks but power density demand as well.
Operator: The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. I want to go back to that less than 1-megawatt new leasing activity. Can you just comment maybe on the majority of the deals signed? Were those in legacy assets, which will hopefully provide a much-needed boost to same-store occupancy when the leases commence? Or were the majority of those deals signed and maybe the newer construction assets that are better catered towards the current deployment requirements today?
Andy Power: Thanks, David. I mean, it's pretty broad-based. I mean, you look the top markets were Northern Virginia, London, Los Angeles, Frankfurt, Chicago globally. I can tell you, London, Los Angeles, and Chicago, those are not -- I mean, that's [3B Cermak] (ph) at 600 West segment, even El Segundo. Our whole London portfolio, whether in the Docklands or Woking, we've got -- we've had much more enterprise play there. And we've not been built a new brand new asset in a long, long time, probably till I started Digital close to 10 years ago. So these are Colo obviously oriented use cases across numerous business segments, financial services, insurance, healthcare, we quoted a few along the way. So, and -- when I look at the overall quantity of signings, signing that went into call it first-generation or second-generation, that has been pretty consistent, if not a little higher to round-up the year. But you did bring up the point in same-store occupancy, we did almost have a little self-inflicted wound there with, I think one of the [indiscernible] transaction converted from 100% leased [PUV] (ph) suite to back the vacancy, plus not even a full customer-base there, but that creates an opportunity. And I know we're actively quoting to refill that capacity, obviously, a much better economic outcome along with call it meeting our core priorities in building out our enterprise customer base along the way.
Operator: The next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Sorry about that. Thank you. Can you give us an idea going forward, so what percentage of your facilities you're going to set aside for sort of less than 1 megawatt, where do you see that going? And within that less than 1 megawatt, what percentage of that floor space are you building that is for high-power density compute versus just regular machines? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks. Frank, I mean, not just very recently, but for a long time now, the last couple of years, we have been prioritizing, making sure our customers are seeking enterprise cohort capabilities, be it network-oriented or public and private cloud or high-performance computing pushing the power densities have ample runway to grow within our portfolio. There are certain places that are clearly network-oriented like the ‎56 Marietta in Atlanta, for example. But on our campuses, we're building with the modularity and flexibility to span their power needs. So -- and we're often now moving towards places where we can get it scaled and build a sizable build-in given how much success we've had in the category in various markets to have dedicated for those customers, on the same cap as far as the dedicated buildings for those customers, and have a little bit less mix and matching within that -- within a building. So that's a priority. We've been doing more of that. You're going to continue to see us doing more of that. And that's why -- that's how we're going to get this growth. We've been putting up, call it what, 22%-ish growth in that final category just this last year and look for further acceleration next year.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Andy, I think at the top of the script, you mentioned the Stargate announcement. Some of your customers are directly or indirectly involved in that announcement on some of your largest customers in fact. So what conversations have you had with some of these customers since that announcement about their interest in sort of maintaining or expanding their relationship with Digital Realty in the future? And then maybe you can make a broader comment on hyperscalers and their willingness to look out even further into the future in terms of pre-leasing capacity. Do you think that's kind of on the margin a little bit greater or lesser than it was maybe three months ago? Thank you.
Andy Power: So, thanks, Jim. So the Stargate announcement, I would say twofold really was partial announcer of activity that transpired quarters and months ago. And also I put it in a category of conviction from top customers to continue to deploy significant dollars towards infrastructure. So I don't think that -- some of that was transparent while we were signing with some of our biggest customers. Just last year, I think, I said previously that of the three-quarters where we had record signing during the year, we had a different top hyperscale customer, be it a record signing customer each quarter, so there was diversity. And based on where I've seen things go this year, I think we could add a different customer [indiscernible] in any given quarter as we work into 2025. I will say at the same time, the size of this demand is getting to a place where the spigot of demand is not running at full -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. These packages with more expensive GPUs and infrastructure or larger capacity blocks are going up to the highest level of the big company's Boards for approval and they don't do that every other week. So while the capacity -- we see continued up in the right, there certainly be a week or two a month where we'll see a lull and then they came back, which is part and parcel with exactly what we saw transpire in 2024. And I think we're very well-positioned to obviously support those customers in some of the large capacity blocks, which you can see, we have delivering, call it significant data capacity in our development pipeline, 500 megawatts of shell. And we just grossed up our land holdings with some near-term delivery opportunities to about over 3 gigawatts of growth.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hi, appreciate it. I just wanted to touch on the capital recycling or JV picture for the year. I know you talked about $500 million to $1 billion, but maybe you could -- maybe touch a little bit on the potential mix of outright dispositions, JVs, and then new programmatic fund-like structures that you've alluded to in the past, how we think about the mix of that this year versus using other sources of capital like issuing equity? Thank you.
Andy Power: Thanks, Eric. I’ll let Matt give you a quick breakdown of the numbers and then flip it over to Greg to give you a quick follow-up on where we are on our strategic capital initiatives?
Matt Mercier: Yeah. Thanks, Eric. So I mean, simplistically, we're looking at -- if you just break it down, we're looking at roughly $300 million to $400 million of that is going to be associated with our continued efforts around our non-core asset disposition. And the remainder of that will be targeted towards the continued expansion of our private capital efforts. And for that, maybe I'll turn it over to Greg to give a little bit more color.
Greg Wright: Yeah. Thanks, Matt, and thanks, Eric. Look, I think there is a couple of things. One is, Andy and Matt have told investors for some time now as we look to diversify and bolster our capital sources. As you mentioned, the fund is clearly the next logical step in this progression. I think all we'd say at this point is it's going very well. And as we continue to make progress and have more to report, we look forward to talking to you about it. But again, we think it's -- we think it is the next logical step and like the flexibility associated with it.
Operator: The next question is from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. So you laid out mid-single-digit core FFO constant currency growth in 2025, and it sounds like there is a lot of momentum in the business for acceleration beyond that. But what are some of the factors that maybe could derail this thesis as you think about some of the things that might impact the business? Thanks.
Andy Power: If you look at our components here, most of the big signings are not flow through to 2025. So any big signings we do from here, which we anticipate doing are really building out growth in 2026 and '27. So our near-term execution opportunity goes back to where we've been very successful recently and need to continue in the 0 -1 megawatt interconnection, filling that vacancy in our portfolio that does not have that pre-lease window of that scale. Continue to execute on commercialization, we've delivered tremendous amount of value to our customers. And obviously, we need to make sure the commercials are adequately rewarding, which you see through our cash mark-to-markets. Continue to expand the value prop through our interconnection signings, which we had a strong fourth quarter, coming off a record third quarter, but continue on that growth. And then obviously, making sure we use these tools that we've built over the last 18 months in terms of how we fund this business, in terms of continuing to be able to spend and accelerating $4.5 billion of gross CapEx, but use our own liquidity, retain capital and obviously development private capital partnerships, as well to make sure this all flows to the bottom line like we are guiding in 2025 and looking to do better than that in 2026.
Operator: The next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I just wanted to clarify two things you mentioned. So one is just the rush or the velocity of deals that tenants are wanting to sign and you're wanting to engage in. It sounds like in the less than 1 megawatt segment, there's like a -- I don't want to call it renewed rush, but certainly an upward trajectory, and hopefully that continues. But in the larger than 1 megawatt, it's very lumpy like you said. And I'm just wondering the combination of those two, does that put like just hypothetically the next two, three years in a different zip code of velocity and size of your bookings? I'm not looking for a number, I'm just trying to think over the next few years versus the last, call it, seven years. And then same question on pricing power, with all this velocity can you expand a little bit about how you're viewing your own pricing power going forward? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thank you, Vikram. A lot to unpack in there, let me try [indiscernible]. 0-1 megawatt enterprise colocation interconnection, we see a growing market where we're taking more and more share. And we believe we'll continue to do that with a very compelling value proposition. We have the power densities and runway for growth for our customers to expand with us across 50 metropolitan areas and the connectivity solutions for today and tomorrow for these customers. So I think you're going to continue to see that, call it stair stepping of improvement, walking and tackling in a positive robust backdrop, even before I think the days of inference becoming tremendously robust with enterprise happens. The other megawatt is certainly going to be lumpy because when we sign a 100-megawatt deal, a 50-megawatt deal in one quarter versus another, it swings it. The point I was just trying to make is based on the deliveries of our inventory timing, there isn't a panicky rush to trade-off volume from commercials, right? So we are trying to create to the right customers and the right financial outcomes for those prices capacity blocks because we've seen as time goes by, the sooner the capacity delivers, the more value it becomes and helpful to those customers. On the pricing power, I don't have a lot of data points given the composition of greater than 1-megawatt signings in the quarter. But I can tell you in our most -- on large market, we're still quoting to multiple customers or large capacity blocks, call it, 200-ish type rates for what we view as incredibly valuable to these customers. In the smaller 0-1 category, I think you can see the cash mark-to-markets are close to just under 5% and our pricing is helped in there pretty firmly. Order back is a big step up in volume in that category.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit on the supply chain side of things. What's the latest situation with getting power to your new developments? Any other items in the supply chain? Are you generally able to hit your timelines, hit your cost per megawatts? And any color around that would be great.
Andy Power: Thank you, Simon. I mean, the supply chain, in my opinion, first and foremost with power remains incredibly tight and everybody wants something sooner than it can usually get delivered in almost all markets. We are -- call it, using our relationships, we're using our scale, we're being creative to find out ways to accelerate solutions for those customers wherever possible. But my dissent is that if more power were delivered to where we have our campuses sooner, we’d be having more demand because customers need it. The broader supply chain on physical elements which kind of ties -- first ties back into, I mean, we today own 3.5 gigawatts or 3.6 gigawatts of land and shell. We're not going to look for that -- that is on our balance sheet. Much of that's been on our balance sheet for quite a while now. It's not like we just tied it up and after super front-end of permitting or getting pad ready, which puts us in a great position to make sure that we're able to keep delivering. Our supply chain is, I think with the vendors is on the tight side as well and we'll see what happens when the talk of tariffs comes to data center land in terms of impact, but our current view of that outlook is we look like we're pretty well insulated, given how we've gone ahead in terms of supply chain procurement.
Operator: The next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Your development yield in the Americas is almost 14% now that stepped up pretty nicely last quarter. You're sort of in the 10% to 11% zone in EMEA and APAC. Should we expect to see the development yields in EMEA and APAC start to move up and narrow that gap some versus the Americas? Or do you see there being factors that restrain where you can get in those regions?
Andy Power: Thanks, Nick. So I mean, that's a product of the Americas region of having the most accentuated from me and well outpacing supply on the larger capacity blocks. Now, we do have a sizable Colo footprint in EMEA, which is obviously a higher ROI piece of our business. But when we look at the megawatt, it's those learning capacity blocks that right now are swinging rates and returns. So I believe that you're going to see AI globalize. I don't know if it will be the same extent of growth and build-out you've seen or we'll see in the United States. But based on, including meetings I was part of this week, dialogue with customers, I think that you're going to see and kind of following the footsteps of cloud and data sovereignty and cloud to cloud, you're going to see that go up. And I can tell you, as that does come to fruition, it's going to come to fruition in markets that have the same issues as the United States in terms of power, transmission, and other supply chain elements.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Andy, you've done a great job expanding yields and you're getting to 13.7% yields in the Americas. If I ask you to put your prognostication hat on, where do you see development yields? And as part of that spot market pricing for hyperscale data center deals going, particularly in light of where the private market is clearing deals? Any color there would be great. Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Michael. I mean, it's -- I'm sure there is a private market competitor that will settle for a lower economic yield than we have in our North American schedule as we speak. I don't -- we're very blessed that we have numerous private capital partners to have some good intelligence on this. So I don't think they're all that much lower in terms of returns and they still look healthy and profitable returns. I think we'll be able to outshine that is because we're potentially picking our spots. We're not just chasing volume at the detriment of price and return, which has allowed us to keep our returns probably a couple of hundred basis points higher than the average Joe data center competitor.
Operator: The next question is from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Quick question for Matt. What type of core FFO contribution do you expect from the JV portfolio in '25? And then I saw you recently closed Blackstone Phase 2. Maybe could you give us an update on how you're expecting that JV to impact the JV metrics in '25? Thanks.
Matt Mercier: Sure. So in terms -- I'll answer it in terms of like the broader disposition JV Capital. So we're not expecting that to have a material impact on our bottom-line core FFO growth in 2025. That's a mix of, call it, timing, size, and when things might come to fruition. So there's some variability there. So we're not including material impact there. As it relates to, I think the -- maybe to your point on the broader joint venture private capital, you've seen -- I think where you see that come through is you're seeing our fee income line pick up. You saw that in the fourth quarter, which was largely tied to the closing of our Blackstone Phase 2 and the fees that we got from that more from the development side, we also closed on an acquisition within our SREIT, so that had some impact in our fee income as well. And as we now have the full Blackstone closed, and we look to expand on that, I think you'll see additional fee income contribute to our 2025 growth. In particular, as those assets start to stabilize and we transition from development fees to more, call it asset management, property management type recurring fees. So that's how we -- that's how we're taking a look at that for next year -- for this year.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Andy Powers for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.
Andy Power: Thank you, operator. Digital Realty had a remarkable 2024, reflecting strong demand for cloud, digital transformation, and AI. Digital Realty is ready to support these customers' requirements as well as private AI and a potential avalanche of AI inference demand we anticipate around the world. We set a number of new records throughout our business, executed on our key priorities, and positioned the company for an acceleration of bottom-line growth in 2025 and beyond. I am extremely proud of how our team executed to deliver this year's results and I'm excited about the future and remain focused on seizing all the opportunities at hand. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Digital Realty's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, new leasing volume of $521 million at our share, shattered our prior record and even our own expectations for the realm of possibility in a quarter. In fact, 3Q leasing was more than a full year's growth by previous standards as activity in the quarter exceeded the leasing completed in all of 2023, pushing our backlog of signed, but not commenced leases up to nearly $860 million. While greater than 1 megawatt leasing was the primary driver over 0 megawatt to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment also posted record bookings in the quarter. Second, strong fundamentals translated into improved pricing for data center capacity, and this was evident across both new and renewed leases with record rates on new greater than 1 megawatt leases, 4% escalators on the majority of new leases and a record 15% uplift in cash renewal spreads in the quarter. And third, our development pipeline increased by nearly 50% sequentially to 644 megawatts under construction and is now 74% pre-leased at a 12% average expected yield as a result of successful leasing of shell and land capacity in North America. These results continue to move Digital Realty closer to management's objective to improve longer-term sustainable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I don't often start this way, but this quarter was certainly one for the record books. As Jordan noted, we posted record results across a broad array of metrics. These results are the product of Digital Realty's team capitalizing on a favorable demand backdrop, but are also a testament to our efforts to enhance our value proposition and to drive long-term sustainable growth. Demand for data center capacity remains strong, both for larger capacity blocks in our core markets and to support continued growth in both cloud and digital transformation. We are well positioned to take advantage of this favorable environment, given our full spectrum strategy, our global footprint across six continents and a robust land bank that can support 3 plus gigawatts of incremental development, together with an investment grade balance sheet that is complemented by a diverse group of capital partners and the expertise to put it all together and operate these facilities on behalf of the world's leading technology companies and enterprises. Highlights for the third quarter were abundant and include $521 million of new leases signed at Digital Realty share, more than double our prior record in the first quarter of this year. Greater than 1 megawatt bookings in North America led the way, driven by large hyperscale deals in Manassas, Ashburn and Chicago. New leasing volume in this segment was up more than 75% from the 1Q record, while pricing moved up nearly 30%. Included in our greater than 1 megawatt signings was a large lease in our hyperscale development venture in Manassas. Like, all of our JVs, we report these leasing results at our share or 20% in this case. The total leasing into our facilities at 100% share was in excess of $700 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the significant appetite for data center capacity. Given the size of those numbers, it might be easy to overlook a very strategic and important milestone with a sizable record quarter in our 0-1 plus interconnection business, which saw more than $66 million of new bookings, topping our prior record in this product category by over 20%, with particular strength in small deals under 0.5 megawatt, which accounted for 80% of our 0-1 megawatt leasing. Not to be forgotten, new interconnection bookings also hit a record in the quarter. We view these bookings very favorably as it further validates our full spectrum product strategy and provides us with growing momentum in a segment with durable pricing power and steadily increasing customer demand. Our strength in this category was also characterized by a record 149 new logos for the quarter. PlatformDIGITAL offers our customers the convenience and simplicity to manage their global data center needs and is reflected by record export activity in the third quarter, which were 50% plus higher year-over-year with Americas to EMEA exports leading the way, followed by APAC into the Americas. With a record $859 million backlog of favorably priced leases, largely commencing over the next two years, we are positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth. In support of our customers' growing requirements, and all of the new leasing accomplished in the quarter, we also substantially scaled our development pipeline in the third quarter, increasing the capacity underway by almost 50% to 644 megawatts under construction today. And we maintained another 3 gigawatts of buildable IT load capacity in land and shell condition. As we noted last quarter, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe with the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus in Slough. During the quarter, we also continued to bolster our balance sheet and diversify our capital sources through a combination of favorable debt and ATM issuances. Matt will provide more details on these activities in a few minutes. Over the past few weeks, we've seen several examples of the lengths that some hyperscalers will go to reserve enough power for their fast growing compute requirements. We've seen a deal to reactivate 3 mile Island, another hyperscaler partnering with an existing utility to develop small modular reactors and the third executing power purchase agreements to purchase nuclear energy for multiple SMRs that have yet to be built. These agreements are similar, in that they are seeking long-term carbon-free energy solutions to help power growing data center portfolios and speak to the longer-term demand outlook for data center capacity. Yet each of these plants is still years away from beginning to generate power, underscoring the value of lower capacity blocks today and perhaps for the next several years. And sourcing available power is just one piece of the data center infrastructure puzzle. Supply chain management, construction management and operating expertise are all challenges that customers rely on Digital Realty to solve, and they are clearly a critical aspect of the overall value proposition that we bring to the table. While the large hyperscale deals get plenty of focus, customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty's meeting place can bring to their private cloud and hybrid IT applications around the world. We continue to see a meaningful share of our 0-1 megawatt wins influenced by our partners, expanding our reach into more enterprises around the world. Our wins this quarter include a Global 2000 telecom provider who partners with one of our largest customers choosing PlatformDIGITAL to deploy a distributed cloud solution to alleviate geographic data gravity challenges. A leading health care provider and a new logo for Digital Realty, which also came to us from a partner, modernizing its infrastructure to take advantage of the cloud connectivity available on PlatformDIGITAL, while maintaining data compliance for personal health information privacy. Another new logo, an international financial institution critical to global financial and monetary policy, chose PlatformDIGITAL to secure their cloud requirements while maintaining global access. A Global 2000 technology company is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL in support of its autonomous driving solution. A top 20 Japanese electronics and semiconductor manufacturer is joining PlatformDIGITAL through another partner as part of an integrated tech-refresh initiative where robust connectivity was a critical differentiator. And a global cloud optimization provider is deploying additional capacity on PlatformDIGITAL across two continents to support their expanding enterprise customer base, who require access to rich and scalable connectivity solutions. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global ESG progress during the third quarter. We continue to lead the industry in green building IT capacity, the 178 megawatts certified in the last 12 months, while our Swiss team achieved the first ever Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association Gold Plus certification for our data centers in Zurich. Digital Realty also continued to be recognized for ESG leadership, including Broad Group's Datacloud Global works 2024 for AI data center on the year, The Tech Capitals, Digital Infrastructure Action Global Award 2024 and Frost & Sullivan recognized our Japanese joint venture, MC Digital Realty with the 2024 Japan Data Center Services Company of the Year Award. Moving to Green Finance, where Digital continues to be a leader in the data center industry. During the quarter, we issued EUR850 million green bond, adding to Digital's long history of support for linking its debt to sustainable projects. Additionally, we maintained a sustainability linked pricing component on our new credit facility, further demonstrating the company's commitment to ESG. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed $521 million of new leases in the third quarter, of which $450 million fell into the greater than 1 megawatt category and was heavily weighted toward the Americas. We also signed $50 million of 0-1 megawatt leases and $16 million of interconnection bookings. Each of these figures were new records for Digital Realty. Importantly, more than 75% of the dollar volume of leases signed include annual rent escalators of 4% or greater, which bolsters the growth profile associated with our portfolio of long-term hyperscale leases. Our backlog at Digital Realty share increased by more than 60% sequentially to $859 million at the end of September, as new leasing dramatically outpaced $180 million of record commencements in the quarter. To offer some perspective, the backlog now represents 20% of this quarter's annualized data center revenues and we expect more than 85% of these leases to commence by the end of 2026. Looking ahead a $100 million of the backlog is scheduled to commence by the end of this year, with another $350 million scheduled to commence next year, and over $300 million already slated to commence in 2026, setting us up for accelerating multiyear growth. During the third quarter, we signed $258 million of renewal leases at a 15.2% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date cash renewal spreads to 10.5%. Similar to the first quarter, these robust releasing spreads were driven by a package deal that pulled forward a sizable renewal that was not scheduled to expire for several more years. Excluding this package deal, overall renewal spreads were still a healthy 5.8%, which is more consistent with the 5% to 7% guidance we previously provided for 2024. While the package deals demonstrate the levers available to capitalize on the current pricing environment and also reflect our customers' views of the overall market, they are less predictable in nature. Breaking down renewals by product category, cash renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt segment were up a healthy 4.5% in the third quarter, while releasing spreads in the greater than 1 megawatt segment were up by over 30%. Excluding the package deal greater than 1 megawatt renewals were still up 8.6%. For the quarter, churn remained low and well controlled at 1.5%. In terms of earnings, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting continued healthy growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Data center revenue grew by 7.5% year-over-year as the combination of improved renewal spreads, rent escalators and year-to-date commencements more than offset the drag associated with – the more than $2.5 billion of capital recycling activity since the middle of 2023. Pro forma for the transaction activity data center revenues were up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% year-over-year, principally due to a near 200 basis point improvement in margin from the flow-through of higher data center and interconnection revenues with improved pricing. Same capital NOI growth increased by 0.8% year-over-year in the third quarter, as 2.5% growth in data center revenue was offset by higher property operating costs and roughly 200 basis points of bad debt reserves in the quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 2.6%, which continues to be negatively impacted by about 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $651 million on consolidated development in the third quarter. Gross development spend at 100% share was $855 million in the quarter. Given the strong demand for data center capacity, we doubled our development underway in the Americas and added more projects in EMEA for an almost 50% increase in our pipeline, ending the quarter with 644 megawatts under construction. More specifically, we delivered just 36 megawatts of new capacity in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with another 244 megawatts of new starts at 100% share. The overall pipeline is now 74% preleased, up from 66% at the end of 2Q, with an average expected yield of 12%. Almost all the development underway in the Americas is preleased with an expected stabilized yield of 13.6%. Some development capacity remains in both EMEA and APAC, with both currently expecting stabilized yields over 10%. Over the first-nine months of the year, we spent $2.4 billion in development CapEx at 100% share, which has been balanced by nearly $900 million of partner contributions, keeping us on track and well within the range of our original full year spending expectations. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the third quarter, with over $800 million of equity raised on the ATM. On the debt side, we paid off $250 million gilts in July and added an EUR850 million green bond in September. We also upsized and extended our credit facilities to $4.5 billion in September. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $5 billion of total liquidity, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.4 times. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over four years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.8%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 89% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no remaining debt maturities until early 2025, and the maturities remained well laddered through 2033. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are raising our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 to $6.65 to $6.75 per share, increasing the low end of the range by $0.05 per share and maintaining the high end. The increase in our guide at the midpoint of the range reflects the strength in our year-to-date leasing and commencements and the benefit of stronger than expected renewal pricing, partly balanced by the impact of customer bankruptcies in the second half of this year and balance sheet positioning to capitalize on the robust opportunity we are seeing. We are also adjusting our total revenue guidance to reflect the impact of lower utility expense reimbursements and are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect better than expected leasing volumes and higher pricing. Accordingly, we are also adjusting the following operating assumptions. Reflecting our success on cash renewals to date, we are increasing the full year range to 8% to 10% from 5% to 7%. We are also tightening full year same-store guidance to a range of 2.75% to 3.25%. In terms of investing expectations for 2024, we tightened the range of our net share development spend to $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and maintained our recurring maintenance CapEx ranges. Lastly, on financing, the EUR850 million bond raise was completed slightly ahead of previous expectations, but was mitigated by higher short-term rates than we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Looking to the fourth quarter, Core FFO per share remains poised to increase as the momentum from strong year-to-date leasing increasingly contributes to bottom line results. Looking out in 2025 and beyond, Digital Realty's growth remains poised to accelerate for 2024 levels as the fundamental environment for data centers remain strong, and our robust backlog commences. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. When we were together last in September, and you mentioned there could be another record before the end of the year, this was bigger. So congrats to you and the team on this. Maybe the first question with respect to that is, how much of the demand is at a risk of maybe pulling forward what the natural opportunity for Digital Realty is? And for the capacity that's in the pipeline, but not in development today, how much of that is power ready that's ready to sell into the market? Thanks.
Andrew Power: And thanks, Mike. Really appreciate it. So going to your question, obviously, a quarter of this magnitude, any one of those sizable deals that slipped the quarter were really change the density of where our fourth quarter looks like. So I won't say there was zero pull forward. But at the same time, we are far from anywhere near selling that. Some of our largest signs during the quarter, selling the capacity blocks that are literally adjacent the most identically sized capacity blocks with nearing power deliveries in the very same markets we highlighted Manassas and Ashburn being one and two, and Chicago being three in terms of our top signings. Those specific markets, going to your second question, they are not ready -- the available capacity in those specific locations that comes next or not necessarily powered today, but those deliveries are approaching rapidly. And we have those in many markets, be it Dallas, Santa Clara in the U.S., EMEA, we have Frankfurt Paris, Amsterdam, Seoul, South Korea, as well as similar in South Africa and South America. And those all aggregate to north of 3 gigawatts of capacity, including Shell capacity that we can activate quickly. So – and last but not least, we also – as you saw in some of the release, we’ve not been sitting idle. We’ve made some very attractive additions including a parcel that will be adjacent to our Richardson campus in Dallas, I think approaches 80 megawatts of growth capacity and more to come. So I don’t – I wouldn’t call this as a massive pull forward. Quite frankly, the scaling of demand we’re seeing to take place here, I think, is just overall restrained from numerous factors.
Operator: The next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Petersen: Great. Thanks. Really impressive quarter, good job guys. I wanted to ask, so clearly, given the size of these leases, it seems like we're probably talking about AI use cases and some of the latest GPU technology out there. So maybe can you give us some more color on some of the design changes that are required to meet these power densities? And then also, the rental rates were looked really impressive. But I'm kind of curious if the build cost side of it is also higher on some of the leases that you signed this quarter?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jon. Really a massive team effort from obviously the leadership team on the call with the Florida’s Digital Realty efforts globally to contribute to this type of quarter. Going to the second, then I'll hand it over to Chris and Colin to have an egg, the AI use cases and contributions from AI. Yes. We've seen some inflationary trends and build costs, bringing more higher power densities has been part of our heritage and that requires incremental CapEx spend. But the size of that as a percentage of the build is in the, call it, closer to single-digit percentile increases relative to what you've seen now in the rental rate movements that have well outpaced those inflationary elements. But maybe, Colin, can you just give us a little color on the composition from AI and then Chris can chime in on the -- what we're doing on the tech infrastructure front?
Colin McLean: Sure. Thanks, Andy. Yeah, Contribution was significant about 50% of our overall bookings came from AI. The larger tranche capacity, which obviously our heritage comes well supported from, it is a real value in these use cases. These large capacity blocks are in high demand across our core markets. And so clients are certainly looking to take advantage of that. I would also say, it's a growing part of our less than 1 megawatt framework, Chris and team have rolled out a substantial program in HD Colo, which you can probably highlight in just a moment that really fits in the sweet spot of where we're taking our platform on the whole, so Chris?
Christopher Sharp: Yeah. No, I appreciate it. And I appreciate the question. This is something that we've been contemplating for many years. So we've seen a lot of the cloud infrastructure densifying, but then as artificial intelligence has come to market, just working on the data center design, and we've talked about this about modularity and the modularity around cooling and being able to maximize the utilization of air, and I think a lot of understand that liquid is coming into play, which is a core component that we've always anticipated and how we can retrofit in an efficient fashion to bring that liquid in to meet this demand on a case-by-case basis. And so I think that's one of the critical elements that we've always watched in the market. I think the other thing is the capacity block. Just the sheer sizes that you just heard Andy walk you through that’s also very aligned to what a lot of the AI use cases are looking for. And I think one of the things we're always watching is how inference comes into play. And part of the data center design is also the interconnectivity of that. And so how we allow those different types of AI environments, be it inference, be it different types of recursive models, where how this advanced solutions are coming to market, that's core to what we've been watching and understanding at a very granular level. And then to Colin's point, I think it's important for us to understand how that gets fitted out within the data center. So we've launched an offering called HD Colo a while back. And I think what's interesting about what we're able to do with HD Colo across 30 markets, 30 metros, 170 facilities within 12 weeks, we're able to build in a capability that takes you to 150 kilowatts a rack. And what’s important about that to put a little context on it, is that supports three NVIDIA H100 systems with them a single rack. And so that’s what’s really – we’re seeing in a lot of the form factors coming to market. And I think the state of the play today is the latest GB200s from NVIDIA as well. We’re constantly staying aligned to how we can support a lot of that infrastructure coming to market.
Operator: The next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Okay, that's a great quarter. But Andy, I guess a couple of questions, if I could. So this quarter was so strong in the wake of a record quarter in 1Q, a far from record quarter in 2Q, it kind of, I think, scrambles people's expectations about how we think about what's the new normal and when we were talking about the first half, we were saying, well, it was a record first half. And the average of the first half was about $200 million in new bookings. And now we got this crazy number in the third quarter. Just could you level set people now that we've kind of run the bell about what is the new normal for this? And then the second question was just related to, I think what we just heard, which was that like the first quarter, record quarter, which was 50% AI bookings, the third quarter, a record quarter is also 50% AI bookings which suggests that we're having record everything else to? And could you speak to what is driving that? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, David. So maybe I'll try to tackle in reverse. I think it's very important what you just highlight there we're estimating based on numerous data points we have in terms of infrastructure, customer references, applications, estimation of AI today, that could be changing down the road. These customers, as you can see from our lease terms starting 10, 15 year contracts, and we have the ability to retrofit our infrastructure along the way. But I think it's important that the core demand fundamentals that preexisted before Gen AI came on the scene are still massive and growing, be it digital transformation for enterprise and hybrid IT and cloud computing. I'm hoping to get a lot more questions on the highlight of $66 million in 0-1 megawatt interconnection. That's up 20% over our prior record nearly 150 new logos this has not just been about just big large capacity blocks. This is what we've been spending many years in making -- and certainly, our execution has been growing and the fall through on that category has been a major contributor and more to come on that front. Going back to your definition of the new normal. A couple of data points that we highlighted two quarters ago that I think are important. First quarter record was based on 10% more megawatts and 60% higher prices. This quarter record is on top of that, 70% more volume, again, on 30% higher prices versus the prior record we just said. So these -- both levers, the volume and the price are contributing to this growth algorithm. When I look at it, I think there's two important other takeaways. We're not going to be able to put up a record quarter like this in Q4, especially in a quarter with so many holidays approaching us. There's no question like that. But if you look at our inventory blocks, we do have a runway to repeat this record down the road. There's no question. I don't think we top ticked for Digital in any regard, that’s one thing. Two, a lot of these signings are really, call it, turning into long-term contracts with great escalations that are going to commence in late 2025 and 2026 and really hopefully translating into long-term sustainable growth that flows from the top line down to the bottom line. That’s another big piece of the composition. And lastly, I try not to focus necessarily on just the fluctuations in the signings. But let’s look at our backlog. After a record commencement quarter – during the quarter, we’re in a record backlog that represents, call it, 20% of our revenue base today. And that record backlog not necessarily maybe next quarter, but I think that record backlog has a lot of potential to keep growing and derisking our revenue run rate for years to come.
Operator: Next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. So just given the strong backlog and inventory blocks that you've talked about, just wondering, if you could talk about the implications for future CapEx levels given all the demand and delivery ahead as well as balance sheet leverage goals. Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jon. I'm going to pass it over to Matt to walk you through those elements.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Jon. So look, I think in terms of CapEx, we're sitting here today, our CapEx for '24. We narrowed it down. We're still within the range. I think for '25, as we look forward, I mean, we'll obviously give more specific guidance as we get to the fourth quarter, but just considering where we are in terms of the megawatts under construction, I don't suspect that it will be lower than what we're seeing for '24 and again, we'll give more as we look ahead towards guidance at the start of the year. But I think probably somewhat more important and going to your second point, from a balance sheet perspective, we're sitting here today, given all the things we've done to put the balance sheet back in place where we're already at our leverage targets. We've got $5 billion of liquidity and ultimately, we've -- I think we've got ahead of, and we've -- our plan, we prudently funded, I think, 325 with a view that we'll be able to stay within those leverage targets as well.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi. I wanted to follow up on these large package deals. You've done two of them now. How many more are out there that can be done? And is that driving the 4% escalation in the large deals or is 4% kind of something that you're looking at for all deals that are being done?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Richard. So taking the escalation first. We have, for some time now been looking to push on all the levers on our business, and it's whether it's rates, returns, duration of contracts. And that was, I think -- I believe we were a leader when CPI (ph) was escalating to kind of bring more CPI clauses into our contracts and our escalations, and especially the larger contracts, even moving up and up for some time now. Obviously, when you have core handful of larger deals, having the higher escalation certainly helps the weighting along the way. And going to your prior question on packaged deals. Listen, this is very episodic. I think the good news is, even if you take off our largest mark-to-markets, we're still at cash mark-to-market like close to about 6%, 7% on the high end of our guidance on the cash mark-to-market. So one specific deal that you referred to done really underlying deals were also great renewals as well. In terms of more, this is again, it’s a product of having a large installed customer base, which you can see from our top customer role, having customers in 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 locations around the world to help them. And in times like today, we’re seeing some customers having real business needs and urgency around their requirements and being able to come a table with a holistic solution to help them that brings kind of these packages to the table. So again, I can’t promise them in any given year or any given quarter, but I think it speaks to breadth of relationships and using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize our growth formula.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Appreciate you taking the question. So just curious, I know you have about 3 gigawatts of land in Shell that haven't been developed yet. But given the size and the speed of the deals that you're leasing up now, how are you thinking about maintaining that runway either from new land in existing markets, potentially new markets, where you could extend your reach even further? And then separately, you touched on it a little bit on Northern Virginia. I think we've seen some reports here as long as a seven year wait time for power in parts of that footprint. I think you said, you still have some capacity blocks in Manassas and in Ashburn. So maybe just an update on power delivery within your footprint would be helpful. Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Eric. I'll take the second part first and then hand it over to Greg to speak to what he's been spending a lot of time on this year. In Northern Virginia, I highlighted those are two major -- those markets were two of our largest capacity signings went into and in those markets, we have adjacent buildings literally identical sizes. So almost 100-megawatt IT load in both our Digital Dallas and then a similar one in Manassas. And they're coming on in short order not necessarily call it, early 2025. But one of the two, I think, can be brought into late 2025, potentially certainly 2026. And thereafter, we've got another 230-ish in the next series of buildings, where actually the power will be delivered with more substation and it's really called substation components on our end that will push those deliveries, call it closer to 2027. So that starts tipping away and call it getting when you add that all up closer to, call it, 400 to 450 of Digital Dallas and rounding up 200 megawatts in total of Manassas, which leaves us another 0.5 gigawatt at least at Digital Dallas another couple -- we've got another 100 megawatts not in Digital Dallas, in Northern Virginia. So long runway of growth and I would say, capacity blocks as their deliveries keep getting near and year and time goes by, it just keeps getting more and more precious. Greg, why don't you speak to a little bit of what we've been doing on the -- adding to that on the other end of our supply chain?
Gregory Wright: Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Eric. Eric, I think the first thing to highlight is Andy's point about our buildable capacity on balance sheet. So, clearly, within existing markets, we have over 3 gigawatts of buildable capacity. So I think when you think about the context of where new growth is going to come from, that's pretty sizable. I think there's probably very few that have that kind of pipeline, that we can bring to service in a relatively short period of time. So look, I guess I would summarize is, we're buying land primarily in our existing markets. buying land, purchasing power and the like, and really across the globe, whether it’s North America, South America, Europe, particularly in the flat markets, Africa, particularly South Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town and then throughout the major markets in APAC. So, that strategy hasn’t changed. We still think that’s the best risk-adjusted return on our capital. And with that said, we’re selectively looking at new markets, but that will not be the primary driver of our growth on the development front.
Operator: The next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So you've talked to us earlier about looking at some markets where you've seen a lot of data center demand popping up and the long-term visibility is a little bit less clear, and you're kind of avoiding some of those as you're looking at some of these larger deployments. Are you still holding to that? And how should we think about that? And then how are you set up for funding for these developments and thoughts on capital for the next 12 months? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Frank. So -- and I think this dovetails well with Greg's answer. What we're doing is continuing to focus on markets that we believe a robust and diverse demand. That is, call it, enterprise digital transformation, hybrid IT demand, service provider, data cloud demand as well as various stages of AI demand. We believe that certainly exist and has for some time in our, call it, 50 metropolitan areas where we're operating today, call it, runway in addition to operating capacity growth 3 plus gigawatts. And we are -- I think that dovetail Greg's point, we're expanding into markets where we're operating today, but maybe now at a bigger scale, a bigger presence, i.e., markets we're looking at where we are the major player in the connectivity hubs, or have a strong enterprise hand but a much smaller scale or hyperscale plan and looking at those as adding to our footprint in those markets. What we're not doing, which I think is even more relevant, is chasing demand for demand stake to market that we just don't believe are there for the long term. I'm not suggesting data centers and demand won't be in some of those markets, and there'll be opportunities for one-off builds and contracts with customers. But we've been a company now for just reaching our 20 years as a public company. We've been through cycles before. And we're looking to generate long-term sustainable growth. And within a key element when it comes to that is having a robust and diverse customer demand. So when renewals do come, you can maintain your pricing power and generate that sustainable growth.
Operator: The next question is from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question and congrats on the strong bookings. You indicated that you were positioned for acceleration multiple times in your prepared remarks. And if I recall correctly, you previously also said that 2025 growth should be somewhere closer to mid-single digits. But is it safe to assume that based on where your commencement schedule looks like today, there is potential for upside versus this growth expectation? And if so, how should we be thinking about your medium growth -- medium-term growth algorithm?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Irvin. I'll ask Matt to unpack the 2025 and the financial algorithm from there.
Matthew Mercier: Yeah. Thanks, Irvin. I feel like I think I lost the back because I thought for sure the growth question will come before the first 15 minutes. So -- but thanks. So look, I think I think a few things, I've been pretty consistent, I think, all year in terms of our mid-single digit growth for '25 and setting that as a foundation and keep in mind, that's in spite of doing, call it, 1.5 turns of deleveraging over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months. We continue to focus on our objective to improve the company's long-term sustainable growth profile. You've seen that in the results we put up. Some of those things accrue to the bottom line a little faster than the others. Obviously, our renewal spreads in the 0-1 comes in the financials a little bit sooner. The greater than 1 megawatt takes a little bit longer, and you see most of that in terms of our backlog, which is already at $350 million for next year. And I think even more importantly is at $300 million for 2026. So, which if you looked at that same step a year ago, in terms of where that would have been, kind of in a two year forward view. It's $200 million more. So again, this quarter really derisks the plan to achieve the goals that we set out, which provides a solid foundation for accelerating growth, not only in ‘25, but even further beyond that. And I would say we were confident in what we said before about that, and we're even more confident now.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
James Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you can maybe talk a little bit about the complexion of the bookings in the quarter. And roughly, how many customers kind of contributing to the sort of the 60% or 50% or 80% mark of that, meaning the concentration of customers in that booking. Can you maybe talk to any of the -- whether any of those customers of substantial size were, in fact, new customers in the quarter?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jim. So why don't I ask Colin to kind of walk through some of the highlights. Maybe Colin you can try to break it down to two categories, one by one.
Colin McLean: Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jim. Appreciate it. Yeah. Obviously, successful quarter, a lot of impact across the board, both new customers, existing customers and growth. We have about 1,000 customers booked within the platform in Q3. A good chunk of those 149 were new logos. This predominantly came in the commercial segment. We think about the segmentation of customers within global large enterprise in commercial, the large number of new logos come out of that commercial basis, but we're putting more and more focus on large enterprise. So in that $66 million of bookings, we had about 52% of that on a large enterprise, which is an all-time high. So again, that's a growing segment with our business. Again, I think that references to what Andy's talking about the diverse demand that's hitting PlatformDIGITAL across digital transformation, cloud and AI. So we continue to see that characteristics at our pipeline. Current pipeline for Q4 aggregate all-time high, particularly key strong characteristics in the 0-1 megawatt variety. Maybe a little bit more context as to what we're seeing across the platform and just double down on one of the questions that proximity matters. So our core networks in terms of bookings variety 80% plus were in our primary markets, our top 20 markets. So we continue to see strength there, continue to see indirect focus, so about 26% of our bookings were indirect future pipeline, about 30%, so that's going to continue to grow. And frankly, our flexibility to support the various density and scalability requirements for our clients will continue to be a big value proposition for our clients. So this adds up to a pretty robust quarter, very robust in terms of number of customers, new logos and types of customers landing up on the business.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Hey. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations to whole Digital Realty team on a really exceptional quarter. I want to switch focus and actually talk about the enterprise. The great bookings in the enterprise segment. What I'm curious about is, kind of what changed there from the prior run rate of bookings where you were on? Was it that the enterprise backdrop got better for you guys or was it something that you shifted in terms of your go-to-market? And just as part of that, what are you seeing in terms of the ability to price up enterprise customers, i.e., what are you seeing on the renewal spread side with them? Are we getting past some of that price hike fatigue? Those are my questions. And again, congratulations to you guys.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Michael. Before I -- Colin touched a little bit on this in his last question, but before I turn it back to him, going back to your pricing question, and this kind of dovetails what I think maybe Frank asked about spreads and bumps. I mean, we've been looking at, call it, making sure we have a strong value proposition for our customers. This has been many years in the work and building momentum, and you've seen the success grow. And certainly, this is a milestone quarter. But I don't -- definitely, this will not be a record in that category. We're going to build on that record, that is an incredibly important strategic priority to this company, given the long-term value it provided to customers and the growth it provides. If you look in the 0-1 megawatt signings category, we've been flat based on the cash mark-to-markets. They’re up, call it, 4.5% on an LTM basis. I think they're up about 70 basis points just quarter-over-quarter. You can see that the asking rates as well. I think we'll have more -- we have more opportunity to go on the interconnection side in terms of continuing to make sure our value we bring to the customers is appropriately commercialized. And that's even with a record interconnection signing in this quarter. So -- we're looking at all levers. And again, it's about giving more value to the customer. It's about their infrastructure and their power densities. It is about helping them connect it all pain points. It's about being their one-stop global shop from no matter what side of the deployment of workflow be it, enterprise hybrid IT, cloud or certainly AI, which is starting to percolate in that category. Colin deserves a tremendous amount of credit as well. And -- but I'll turn it over to him to kind of walk through what his insights on the inflection this quarter as well.
Colin McLean: Yeah. Thanks, Andy. I appreciate it. I think one point to make is this is not one quarter in the making. This is a multiyear transformation, a platform oriented company servicing service providers and enterprises. And the way that you do that is you make your platform more attractive. So we announced a couple of [indiscernible] this quarter. One in Dallas. We did a couple in Europe, in Zurich and Amsterdam, that's material in attracting enterprises. Andy mentioned that the digital transformation is now in full steam, but we still think it's early innings. So we think that our platform will continue to grow because enterprises see value in PlatformDIGITAL. One key metric that I'll leave you with, that's a really good sign of a platform-oriented approach of our exports were a record 43% 0-1 megawatt. That's material that shows customers sustain value, but they're expanding across the platform into other geos. So again, strong contribution across the board for the team to bring this to fruition.
Operator: The next question is from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Georgi Dinkov: Hey. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. So I just noticed the development yields are now 12%, which is higher compared to the second quarter. And given the strong market rent growth, can we see development yields move even higher? And is there a cap on how high they can go? And also, can you just provide more color on what the contracts on the development pipeline look like in terms of land and caps on the renewals? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Georgi. So again, this goes back to the accelerated development CapEx sizably 50% higher. And we did that based on demand. So you could see, overall, we're close to north of 75% preleased. In North America, now 97% preleased. Some of the signings in North America, in particular, actually, I've called on the longer end of our sign commencing trail. So they were resigning capacity that the Shell is just getting delivered. Last quarter, we signed nearly 50-ish megawatt deal in the land state. So they're close to two years, so they elongated. So that means we didn't sell just the nearest term capacity blocks we sold at what the customer needed given the facts and circumstances. We're doing everything we can to maintain, if not improve our yields. That's a product of making sure we're scaling our infrastructure and economies of scale and where we deliver and obviously, seizing upon the right rates and translating to better returns as products in that development life cycle of to roll up. In today's market, we're looking to have, again, all the levers of the commercials in the discussion, rates, escalations, real estate, tax base tops and certainly, renewal options, we’re not entertaining called capping when those contracts come to.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the question. I will keep it to one question, and I know that was specified upfront. On the AI front, I know you mentioned there was about half of your bookings. Is there any contribution from enterprise or sovereign players or is it primarily traditional hyperscalers and newer AI model builders. Thanks.
Andrew Power: First off, Matt, thank you for being a role follower. Really appreciate that. Chris, why don't you give a little percentage, 50% overall, but how much in the call it, enterprise and then give us a little more color on some of the AI demand we've seen upon in the quarter and also within the pipeline.
Christopher Sharp: Yeah. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. And so there's a lot happening across AI, which I think is at the core of your question. So it's not just about the hyperscalers. And I think it’s pretty important to understand that the demand is pretty broad across all of the segments. And one just to particular highlight, and I don't speak about any customer specific details. But one of the things that we have great history with NVIDIA, right? And so we've been DGX certified, one of the leading providers, 30-plus data center is already pre-certified, but what's important to us is just yesterday, we were able to host Jensen Wong, CEO of NVIDIA and a kickoff of the largest DGX supercomputer in Europe. And so, it's just very exciting to support Novo Nordisk Foundation in that overall effort. And like, one of the things that I think is pretty interesting that highlight it is that Jensen quoted that it was the factor of intelligence. So something like that is fundamental in showing this private AI deployments are very relevant in coming into our overall portfolio. And the last piece I’d like to just say is just to highlight that, that Digital Realty is foundational in that, and we’re able to do it in a sustainable way because that facility runs on 100% renewable power.
Operator: The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. On your greater than 1 megawatt new leasing in the Americas, rents on a GAAP basis were almost 225-kilowatt this quarter. I'm guessing Manassas in Chicago, you called out were below that number. But does that suggest that hyperscale rental rates in Ashburn are pushing close to that 225 or maybe even 250-kilowatt number? Just any color you could share on the relative spread between markets would be helpful.
Andrew Power: So -- those are GAAP rates, just a reminder. So you got to take the duration of the lease. You know the drill, David, in terms and the bumps. So they've certainly pushed them over. I can tell you in Ashburn, we had multiple customers, call it, face rates in the call it, 175 or 200 or higher, just slightly over 200, and call it, 8 megawatts or higher type of capacity blocks. Where we go from here? I'm not sure, you're going to see this repeat itself immediately. But the other markets have been catching up, but I think we'll continue to catch up over time, certainly, the comparables in the Chicago, the Dallas that have always trailed, the Ashburn trailing the Santa Clara and now trailing in Ashburn. And I do think you're just going to see more and more markets coalesce at these higher rates over time.
David Guarino: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. You've obviously got a ton of development work underway that's going to grow. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the steps you're taking to ensure that you're able to deliver all that on time, on budget without hiccups?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Nick. So, first off, it's very important that we just didn't call it the [indiscernible] income and just get it yesterday. This company has been solely focused on this business for 20 years now. And we've been in these markets that I really touched on. We've been consistently operating, assembling land, building and delivering for our customers for many, many years. And in green to the communities with the utility providers. As we saw this opportunity evolve in scaling certainly came to mind, and that is what we did. -- that was feeling our supply chain. Our teams have call it, a great relationships with their vendors and making sure that we are future proofing those supply chains and being very collaborative with our partners. If one utility, some switch gear that we have in one market, we can bring it to another market, we're bringing those economies of scale. We're certainly scaling our team as well operationally. We're delivering a lot of capacity for our customers, and we're investing in our team, in our systems and actually the great training development of our team along the way. And then lastly, the capital. Massively capital intensive business and the great work of our organization over the last year to supplement our use of public equity with some great private investment partnerships, both on the stabilizing development. We see a really fantastic runway of capital intensive growth here interesting the fruits of our labor in terms of the rates and the returns bearing fruit, and we see this playing out for years to come. And we want to make sure that we have stable partners to help fund this business to generate long-term growth for our customers and our shareholders.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Gary. Digital Realty posted a remarkable quarter in 3Q, reflecting the strong demand environment and demonstrating how Digital Realty is meeting the challenge to support our customers around the world. We set a number of records throughout our business, raise guidance and position the company for accelerating growth in 2025 and beyond. I am extremely proud of how our team executed to deliver this quarter's results. We are excited about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. But most importantly, we remain focused on seizing on the opportunity at hand. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jordan Sadler. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information, reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, we continue to execute within a very favorable demand environment with $164 million of new leasing executed in the quarter, again marking one of the top quarters in our history, which together with last quarter's record leasing drove a record first half of the year. Second, our operating momentum continued through the second quarter as a record level of commencements translated into meaningful improvement in both total and same capital occupancy, while cash releasing spreads remained firmly positive and continued growth in cross connects drove interconnection revenue to a new record in the quarter. And third, through capital recycling and demand-driven equity issuance in the quarter, we reduced our leverage to 5.3 times at quarter end, below our long-term target level, helping to position Digital Realty for the opportunity that we continue to see in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The momentum we experienced in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. In the first half of 2024, our new leasing was up over 100% from the activity we saw in the first half of 2023, with a strong and steady contribution from our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Demand for data center capacity remains as strong as we've ever seen, especially for larger capacity blocks in our core markets. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this favorable demand environment given our track record of execution across six continents, a robust land bank and shell capacity that could support 3 gigawatts plus of incremental development, reduced leverage, and our growing and diverse array of capital partners. During the second quarter, we remain focused on our key priorities. We signed $164 million of new leasing in the second quarter, which excluded another $16 million of bookings within one of our newest hyperscale private capital ventures. While bookings integrated a megawatt category were once again the primary driver, there was no contribution from our largest hyperscale market, Northern Virginia, as Dallas led the way in the second quarter. Importantly, we posted one of our strongest quarters ever in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment with record new logos and near-record bookings in each of the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection categories. This leasing strength is a positive reflection of the value that our 5,000 and growing base of customers realize from our full spectrum product strategy. We also delivered strong operating results with 13% data center revenue growth year-over-year pro forma for the capital recycling activity completed over the last year. In addition, we have enjoyed healthy growth in recurring fee income associated with our new hyperscale ventures. In the first half, fee income was up 26% over the first half of 2023, primarily reflecting the formation of almost $10 billion of institutional private capital ventures over the last year. And we would expect this line item to continue to gather momentum. With the record commencements in the second quarter and the healthy backlog of favorably priced leases ready to commence in the second half, we are well positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Subsequent to quarter end, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe through our entrance into the sought submarket of London. With the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus, which we expect to be highly complementary to our existing co-location capabilities in the City and the Docklands. The new campus supports an existing community of more than 150 customers, utilizing over 2,000 cross-connects. Consistent with our key priorities, we continue to innovate and integrate as we unveiled our HD Colo 2.0 offering in the second quarter with advanced high-density deployment support for liquid-to-chip cooling across 170 of our data centers globally. In addition, just last week, we announced the deployment of a new Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute Cloud On-Ramp at our Dallas campus, along with the launch of the new Azure Express Route Metro Service in the Amsterdam and Zurich market. We also bolstered our balance sheet and significantly diversified our capital sources, availing Digital Realty of more than $10 billion of private capital over the past year through our new hyperscale ventures and non-core dispositions. During the quarter, we expanded our existing Chicago Hyperscale venture with the sale of a 75% interest in CH2, the remaining stabilized data center on our Elk Grove campus. We also sold an additional 24.9% interest in a data center in Frankfurt to Digital Core REIT, increasing their total position in the campus to just under 15%. These two transactions together raised over $0.5 billion. Finally, we raised approximately $2 billion of equities since our last earnings call, including the $1.7 billion fallout offering in early May and proceeds raised under our ATM. These transactions together with the others of the past year have positioned our balance sheet to capitalize on this unique environment and construct the capacity that our customers demand. Artificial intelligence innovation is reshaping the global data center landscape. As new applications are developed and proliferate across industries and around the world, AI is driving the incremental wave of demand for robust computing infrastructure. According to Gartner, global spending on public cloud services is projected to grow over 20% to reach $675 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow another 22% in 2025 with AI-related workloads driving a significant portion of this growth. Digital transformation, cloud, and AI are fueling demand for data center capacity worldwide. Traditional data centers were already being pushed to their limits on demand for cloud and digital transformation. Whereas demand for AI-oriented data center infrastructure is being accommodated in upgraded suites in our existing facilities and in newly built facilities. These AI workloads are taking place on specialized hardware with massive parallel processing capabilities and lighting fast data transfer speeds. Fortunately, Digital Realty's modular data center design can accommodate these evolving requirements. The growth in demand is global. We're seeing strong demand across our North American metros first, but it is spread and beyond with interest in locations like London, Amsterdam, and Paris in EMEA, and Singapore and Tokyo in APAC. Our global footprint is well-suited to capture this growing demand, whether it'd be for major cloud service providers adding to an availability zone, a major enterprise digitizing their business processes, or an AI model being trained or be it or put into production. However, this exponential growth in data center demand is not without its challenges. The environmental impact of these energy-intensive facilities is growing alongside the scaling of user requirements. According to the IEA, data centers consumed almost 2% of global electricity in 2022, a figure that could double by 2026, absent significant efficiency improvements. I will touch on Digital Realty's latest sustainability highlights in a moment. As we look to the future, the interplay between AI advancements and data center evolution will continue to shape the global technology landscape. IDC predicts that by 2027, worldwide spending on digital transformation will reach nearly $4 trillion, driven by AI, further accelerating the demand for data center infrastructure. We believe that the providers who can officially scale their capacity while addressing sustainability concerns will be best positioned to benefit from these three key drivers, digital transformation, cloud, and AI in the years to come. Customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty can bring to their applications around the world. During the second quarter, we added 148 new logos, marking a new quarterly record. A growing number of these new logos are being sourced by our partners who have officially expanded our sales team to reach into enterprises and around the world. The wins this quarter include Global 2000 advanced engineering and research enterprise developing a private AI Sandbox on PlatformDIGITAL to enable experimentation and development by federal agencies and brought to us by one of our large connectivity partners, Lumen Technologies. Another partner bought a new logo that is an AI-enabled SaaS provider repatriating all public cloud to save costs and enable growth. That same partner was also assisting two large financial institutions to increase their capacity on PlatformDIGITAL in APAC and North America. And yet another example of our growing partnerships, an AI SaaS provider and recognized leader in natural language speech synthesis is growing their commitment to PlatformDIGITAL with an expansion of current AI workloads where proximity is the driving requirement. A Global 2000 manufacturer is rearchitecting their network on PlatformDIGITAL with a regional hub to improve efficiency, lower their network costs, and implement controls while eliminating the capital cost of maintaining their own facilities. And two leading financial services firms are both leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to extend their respective virtual desktop infrastructure environments to improve performance and user experience across their North American and EMEA employee base. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG performance. We were recognized by TIME and Statista as one of the world's most sustainable companies of 2024. We also released our Annual ESG Report in June, highlighting our ongoing efforts to develop and operate responsibly. As described in our ESG report, we further increased our renewable energy supplies with 152 data centers now matched with 100% renewable energy. We improved water efficiency and expanded the use of recycled water, which accounted for 43% of our total water consumption last year. We also launched a new supplier engagement program to drive sustainability and decarbonization through our supply chain. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second-quarter results. We signed $164 million of new leases in the second quarter with two-thirds of that falling into the greater than megawatt category, the majority of which landed in the Americas, with healthy contributions from both EMEA and APAC. Not to be overlooked, however, was the $40 million of 0 to 1 megawatt leasing and a standout $14 million of interconnection bookings. Our fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $50 million in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Turning to our backlog, we commenced a record $176 million of new leases this quarter, which was largely balanced by the strong second-quarter leasing. As such, the $527 million backlog of signed and not yet commenced leases moderated by only 2% from last quarter's peak and remains robust at more than 9% of our total revenue guidance for the full year 2024. Looking ahead, we have over $175 million scheduled to commence through the remainder of this year with over $230 million already scheduled to commence next year. During the second quarter, we signed $215 million of renewal leases at a 4% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date renewal spreads to 8.2%. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions. Last quarter, we noted that the underlying renewal spread after stripping out two outliers was 3.4%. Our cash renewal spreads in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment were up 3.8% in the second quarter, while the greater than 1 megawatt segment was up 3.9%. As a reminder, the 0 to 1 megawatt segment is the primary driver of our overall re-leasing spreads, given the heavier weighting of lease expirations in this category, which are typically shorter-term leases with inflationary or better escalators. 0 to 1 megawatt deals renew reliably and predictably, making them track closer to market over time, thereby reducing the outsized movements that can come with larger or longer-term lease renewals. On the greater than 1 megawatt side, renewals reflected the strong pricing environment with leases renewed at $159 per kilowatt compared to the $133 per kilowatt achieved on greater than 1 megawatt renewals last quarter. The key difference between the quarters was the rate on the expiring leases. This quarter, leases in this segment expired at $153 per kW, while last quarter's leases expired at an average of $112 per kilowatt. For the quarter, churn remained low and well-controlled at 1.6% and our largest termination was immediately backfilled at an improved rate. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.65 per share, reflecting continued healthy organic operating results, partly balanced by the impact of the meaningful deleveraging and capital-raising activity executed over the course of the last year. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements, a comparison that is likely to persist throughout this year, given the decline in electricity rates in EMEA year-over-year, along with the impact of substantial capital recycling activity. Despite the deleveraging headwinds, rental revenue plus interconnection revenues were up 5% on a combined basis year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 5% year-over-year through the first half and remains well on track to meet our 2024 guidance. Pro forma for the capital recycling completed since last July, rental plus interconnection revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, in the second quarter. Stabilized same capital operating performance saw continued growth in the second quarter with year-over-year cash NOI up 2% as 3.6% growth in data center revenue was offset by a catch-up in rental property operating costs, which were flat last quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 3.5%. And as we have previously highlighted, same capital NOI growth is expected to be impacted by nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity, we spent $532 million on consolidated development in the second quarter, plus another $90 million for our share of unconsolidated JV spending. We delivered 72 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with 71 megawatts of new starts. The blended average yield on our overall development pipeline moderated 20 basis points sequentially to 10.4% as a result of a market mix-shift of completions and starts in North America during the quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent a bit over $1 billion in development CapEx, tracking closely towards our full-year guidance. As the second half should see a ramp from newly commenced projects along with the typical seasonal uplift. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the second quarter with the closing of the two transactions in April that we disclosed during last quarter's earnings report and was referenced earlier by Andy. Together, these two transactions raised just over $500 million of gross proceeds. Additionally, since our last earnings report, we sold 14.7 million shares, including a 12.1 million share follow-on offering in early May and incremental ATM issuance raising $2 billion of net proceeds while using cash-on-hand to pay off a €600 million bond that matured in April and a GBP250 million that matured last Friday. At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $4 billion of total liquidity and our net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 5.3 times, which is below our long-term target. Moving on to our debt profile, our weighted average debt maturity is over four years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, after paying off the euro notes in April and Sterling notes last week, we have zero remaining debt maturities through year-end. Beyond that, our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued strength in our core business, partly balanced by the front-half weighted capital recycling and funding activity, which helped to reduce our reported leverage by a full turn to better position the company to fund development in 2024 and beyond. We are also maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, as well as the operating, investing, and financing expectations that we previously provided. Looking forward to the balance of 2024, core FFO per share remains poised to increase in the second half as the backlog commences and the impact of prior deleveraging moderates. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi. I wanted to ask about the long-term pipeline, you're seeing for the -- over 1 megawatt category. I think there is some concerns that right now we might be in a kind of pull-forward or kind of elevated cycle. And just wanted to get your sense of how far out this pipeline of deals that you're looking at in the current environment could last. Thank you.
Andrew Power: Hi. Thanks, Richard. So I would say in the greater than 1-megawatt category, we're seeing a continuation of the trends we've been playing out for the last several quarters. The biggest customers are desiring, one, contiguous capacity blocks that are very large; two, they want them right now or as soon as possible; and three, the desire of fungible markets, i.e., markets where they can service certainly GenAI workloads, trading ultimately inference, but also if they miss the measure, they can support their cloud computing needs as well. So we have not seen a -- the ease in terms of the demand for those attributes in the market.
Operator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Irvin.
Irvin Liu: Sorry, I was muted. So I wanted to double-click on renewal rates. So, I guess, a couple of items stood out. One, in the Americas, the $146 per kilowatt monthly rate and for the greater than 1 megawatt segment, that marked a sequential decline. Similarly, you know we've seen rates on new leases decline sequentially as well. So can you help us understand what's driving the sequential declines versus a quarter ago? Was this step-down mostly a function of markets and mix or were there other sort of industry dynamics that we should be thinking about?
Andrew Power: Hi, thanks, Irvin. So I think the one big deal or the one market you were pointing to is just the North America greater than 1 megawatt. Now just a mix of composition of deals. This quarter, in particular, Dallas market really led the way. It's had outside strength and this is actually a quarter where we didn't actually have any signings into our Northern Virginia market, which was not a lack of demand for that market, and we still have some great options for customers available at large capacity blocks in two parts of that market, but we just didn't penned anything in this particular quarter. So if you look more broadly, I think almost all the other, call it regions in both segments had an uptick in rates and that's always on apples-to-apples that the mix in the region could be different metros like that one example I just gave you, but that would be only outlier is the one that I just discussed.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Curious if you could talk about some of the ideas that you shared in the past around working on ways to participate in private capital recycling, whether it's trying to establish mechanisms to be able to react to when some of your private capital partners are going to hit their kind of maturity dates of those investments, what to do with those as well as maybe other opportunities in the category where there is private investments in other data center assets?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. Maybe I'll kick it off and then Greg can expand upon this. So this topic is not new. I think we have embarked on this journey at least 18 -- or at least a year and a half ago and made great progress, call it accumulating north of $10 billion or call it hyperscale private ventures with numerous parties. You've seen that few places, which we called out in the prepared remarks, we've seen our fee revenue having a step up of a recurring revenue basis in the P&L. Two, you've seen that in the balance sheet. Those private capital initiatives have obviously certainly moved our balance sheet from a defensive posture to an offensive posture and allow us to now pull forward some of these great projects in our land bank that's north of 3 gigawatts of runway of growth for our customers. And maybe I'll ask Greg just to give you a slightest preview of what's next in that evolution when it comes to our private strategic product accounting initiatives.
Gregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Michael. I think the first thing I would say is consistent with as Andy said, we laid out a year ago, January. We're going to continue to bolster and diversify these private capital sources and that's just what we're doing. And as he said, we did a lot of transactions over the last 18 months. We're continuing to evolve that strategy. And when we have something to report, we will. I think it's important to note that the importance of that capital because if you take a look at the demand profile for the business right now, the hyperscale business in and of itself between now and 2030 is expected to grow almost three times and that includes AI hyperscale and non-AI hyperscale. So look, we think that the strategy that Andy laid out and that we embarked upon was the right strategy, but we're not done yet. And as we said, it's continuing to evolve. And when we have something to report on that front, we'll tell you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes, good afternoon. I wonder about kind of the speed at which you can kind of deliver on your new starts that you've commenced recently, supply chain, access to energy, access to heavy equipment, and so forth. Any kind of color there?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jon. So I mean, we are -- if you almost think it was like a continuous conveyor belt of trying to deliver timely product for end customers' needs, that's certainly playing out in our enterprise colocation markets model. And now apply more than ever on the larger capacity blocks. This quarter and -- this quarter the book to sign a commencement was elongated out to about 20-ish months. That was based on one particular customer that we serviced and they had a very locational sensitive need than a radius restriction. And the only thing where we had in that radius was the land state. Luckily, it was on a cadence where we own the land and we were ready to get moving on. So that obviously elongated to be called delivery timeline for that particular signing. We excluded that, where we were basically call signing commencing like 4.5 type months. So we're continuously obviously delivering capacity and adding new capacity, whether it's from land to sell active suites and making sure we're maintaining our production slots and vendor relationships from that time of delivery in our 50 plus metros around the world.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk about some of the larger greater than 1 megawatt lease expirations that are coming up in the coming quarters. How many of those have fixed renewal options and how much can be mark-to-market rents? And if I can sneak in a follow-up question, I think there is a $168 million impairment in the income statement. Just curious what that is really into.
Matthew Mercier: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So in terms of lease expirations, so what I'd say is less than half of our or greater than 1 megawatt leases have options with total fixed increases on them. But I would call that significantly less than that are typically renewed pursuant to those options. And that's generally for a few reasons. One, our customers must provide us notice of renewal within the proper period and that doesn't always happen to -- renewals must come in essence without any changes. So if there's any additional space, term, anything changes that opens up the contract. I think as we've talked about in the past and third, some of those customers also end up churning. So that all gives us an ability to be able to bring those contracts to market for the majority of what ends up rolling within a given period. On your second point on impairment, yes, we did have -- we did have impairment associated with a few of our non-core assets, which are part of our disposition plans and those are all located in the secondary market. We -- and I'd also put that in context to the fact that we've generated, call it, close to I think over $1.3 billion of gains from the capital recycling efforts that we've done over the last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thank you. I guess, just the comments on the pipeline coming off two very strong quarters of leasing and with the development pipeline, 66% leased, including 80% in the Americas. How should we expect CapEx to trend from here? And then what's your appetite to add new domestic markets given what seems like a broadening of demand?
Andrew Power: Hi, thanks, Ari. Why don't I first let Colin just speak to the pipeline overall and then we can kind of talk about a little bit development side of that as well as new markets?
Colin McLean: Yes. Thanks, Ari. I appreciate the question. Andy highlighted strong performance over 1-megawatt -- pipeline overall for 1-megawatt trends to -- is trending positively below 1 megawatt, which we deem as important as heading in the right direction as well, record pipeline driven from digital transformation, cloud, and AI. And you saw that trending positively in our results, both directly and indirectly. Indirect execution has picked up the last quarter and we're now 23% of our pipeline being indirect, which we think is a positive sign on value proposition there. One of the things that Andy highlighted is the key value of metros. With the demand cycle, we're seeing enterprises and hyperscalers like zero value of proximity and the metro play that we have in key metros across the globe being particularly important. Finally, the ability both for enterprise and hyperscalers to grow in scale and capacity is of keen value really across the spectrum of low and above 1 megawatt.
Andrew Power: Then Ari, on the second part of your question, I would say, we remain very focused on our core markets, north of 50 of them around the world, nearly 30 countries on six continents. Those markets we continuously see robust and diverse customer demand. I'm talking cloud commute from the numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid, IT, and service providers in markets where we see really long-term barriers. And to be speaking to our actions on those, a sizable piece of our activation in shells moving from our 3-plus gigawatt land bank into shells and ultimately to be delivered in suites is all in those same core markets.
Operator: The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hi guys. Thanks a lot. So I guess, two, if I could. Andy, I guess last quarter you talked about how 50% of these record bookings were -- or roughly 50% were AI-related. It obviously stepped down sequentially. But to your point about the lengthening of the delivery period, it seems like there is still some very large customers in what was the new leasing number this quarter. Could you kind of revisit on an apples-on-apples basis, how 2Q unfolded versus 1Q from an AI versus non-AI type of new leasing pattern? And how do we think about this? Is there going to be a seasonality to this sort of thing? That would be kind of my first question. And then the second question is, I was just going back to 2019, you guys generated $6.65 of core FFO, which is kind of what you're guiding to for 2024. And I know that you've laid out a hope that there will be growth -- more meaningful growth in the forward-looking periods. Also, you said that your balance sheet is now less in a defensive and more in an offensive position. And historically, when you've been offensive, it's meant dilution to secure future growth opportunities. So I was wondering if you could kind of, Andy, revisit the bull case for growth to take all these great things that are happening with the top line and turn them into bottom line growth? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Dave. So obviously posted apples-to-apples from a 50% contribution last quarter to this quarter is probably closer a quarter of our science. We would say, we really pin on AI use cases. But I would caveat that in a few ways. One, that's in a quarter that's not our record quarter, but I think the top four quarter overall signings, great contribution of both 0 to 1 and plus 1 megawatt, as well as a near record in interconnection signings. And that means we're still winning with the traditional demand drivers of digital transformation, cloud computing, and the like, that though that demand is not nearly exhausted shelf or played out. I would also say that there was certainly a deal that I didn't count in the category of AI that is certainly pushing the envelope on power density and post-ink drawing, already thinking about evolving that capacity block or signed with them in towards what will ultimately be supporting AI down the road is my guess, which I think speaks to the modularity of design and how we're able to scale infrastructure to the demands of our customers as they needed. The second part of your question, let -- first off, I don't want to confuse the word offense with M&A. I think we've not done any real M&A or external growth for several years now. You can maybe save the resolution of the Cyxtera relationship, but that was I think making lemonade out of lemons more than anything. And when I use the word offense, I mean, that's converting this 3 plus gigawatt land bank, which we've assembled over the years, i.e., we didn't just go buy that yesterday and turning that into a great product for our customers to land and expand in -- at great returns on our investment. And you've been seeing that play out now with our ROIs and development schedule, crescendoing into the double-digits. You've seen that in the pricing power and you've seen our value proposition really resonate in all of our customer segments across our core markets. And lastly, our eye is on the price of accelerating the bottom line. That's where we reoriented our strategy 18 months ago about our value proposition, integrated, innovating, bolstering, diversifying our capital sources. And all those things were about, call it making sure we're driving per share -- FFO per share growth that's accelerating and it's going to be continuously compounding for years to come. So there is been no divergence in that conviction of what comes next for the rest of 2024 and what we've said about 2025, next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. So Andy, could you maybe comment on what type of market rent growth you're seeing right now in some of your key metros on an apples-to-apples basis relative to last year and whether that continues to evolve as this year has progressed? And then as you look out into the future, do you see an opportunity for market rent growth to continue to outstrip your development costs and we can see the kind of 10% to 12% development yields you have in your pipeline move even higher? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Eric. I mean, I would outcast that market rent growth is continuing to move in our favor. You've seen two elements happening, the most precious capacity blocks in the key markets like in Northern Virginia continue to set new records in terms of rates. And you've also seen a catch-up phenomenon where other markets in North America or outside of the U.S. are catching up a fair bit in terms of their trajectory of growth. Listen, I look at this, you've got these waves of demand being cloud computing and digital transformation, hybrid IT, and now AI that are just getting going in some of these. They're large and dynamic and it's happening in a supply constraint backdrop from numerous avenues of supply constraint. And those elements are ultimately resulting in the increases in rate that we've been able to execute on for several quarters and I believe will be three quarters in common. And I also believe they will likely outstrip the -- whatever inflationary cost we see in terms of build costs and at least maintain these ROIs, if not continue to notch it up slightly higher.
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
James Schneider: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. On the topic of power constraints and supply environment you see relative to transmission. With the time horizon, let's say, 12 to 18 months, do you think the outlook for power availability is getting more constrained, less constrained, or staying about the same relative to new projects you have either under development or contemplating?
Andrew Power: Jim, I think that there is a few phenomenons happening. One, we're getting closer, I mean, some of these constraints popped up now a years in a rearview mirror. And we're obviously inching our way close to destinations of resolutions, be it in Northern Virginia, which I think 2026 is supposedly above or within like in Santa Clara and there is other non-U.S. markets as well. At the same time as we approach the power constraints, there is obviously a good potential that the delivery dates may not deliver on time. These are multifaceted projects that require easement, substations, construction projects. At the same time, the demand didn't standstill while the power was constrained. The second phenomenon I think they're seeing is -- this is becoming a more pervasive topic. It was very focused on one cloud center of the universe market with Northern Virginia and we're hearing more and more about other markets. And lastly, I wouldn't pin it just on power. Yes, the power has got broader generation issues in the economy that we're trying to green. It's got transmission issues that navigate municipalities and substation deliveries and transmission lines cutting through the backyards of folks that rather not have them there. But there are also other elements of sustainability concerns, moratoriums in certain parts of the world. And so I think that this is a multifaceted supply constraint, which I would also mention that even if it does get fixed, has a propensity that could -- history could repeat itself here. So I think this is going to make our value proposition with what we deliver to our customers even more compelling and valuable at the end of the day.
Operator: The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vikram Malhotra: Hi, good afternoon or evening. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a bigger picture, you've talked about leasing spreads in greater than 1 megawatt improving over time given the differential of what's expiring versus, I guess, market, but you also referenced market rent growth improving quite a bit. So with that and just some recent comments from hyperscalers, just talking about the risk of oversupply or just too much CapEx. Can you sort of just frame the near-term opportunity set in the greater than 1 megawatt from -- maybe bookings, but more so pricing standpoint versus the puts and takes over time just from a demand-supply? I'm just wondering, is there a risk that you see the spreads theoretically improve, but there is a lot of supply coming down the pipe?
Andrew Power: I'll take the -- mainly the second -- first and second part of your question, I'll ask Matt to comment on our outlook on leasing spreads and really kind of talk about the stairstep in our exploration schedule, which does -- call it, become even more attractive in its coming years. But I think from -- the heart of your second question is the broader AI theme question you're hearing more on -- in the mainstream media over AI overdone, this is a bubble, what could come next? I think some of that is not unnecessarily 100% germane to what we're seeing. And the reason I say that is in our business, when it comes to AI, we are signing long-term contracts, I'm talking 15 years with some of the largest, most established technology companies ever. Two, and I mentioned before, we're doing that, we're not chasing this out to unproven territories. We're focused on core markets with robust and diverse customer demand where traditional use cases, be it cloud commuting from numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid IT, and service provider demand are continuing to grow over time, and even if the AI has peaks and valleys. And we're doing it in markets that we believe are real term -- real long-term supply constraints. And lastly, all this is happening probably in the most supply-constrained moment in the last 20 years of data centers. So I don't -- I'm not sure or convinced that even if AI takes a breather on its long-term innovation trajectory. I think that volatility -- we are somewhat insulated in our sector from that volatility based on how we're pursuing it. But Matt, why don't you hit on the question?
Matthew Mercier: Sure. So what I look, what I call it is -- if you look at the greater than 1-megawatt leases that are expiring, call it the next 18 months, the rate -- average rate on that in the 140 to 145 area. But then it steps down pretty gradually to as low as 111 by the time you get to 2029. So I think you're going to see a continued positive trajectory on our leasing spreads, not only in the greater than 1-megawatt category, but I think also across all the categories. So I think you'd also recall within our 0 to 1 spreads have been positive. I think throughout our history, those are typically more regular steady inflationary type increases or better. So I think this puts us in a -- I think in a good position considering where market rates are, where some of the supply constraints are to where we'll see market rates now continue to remain positive and grow and continue to accrue benefits to our releasing spreads as we go through time.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So in talking before, you mentioned you're prioritizing retail Colo over hyperscale. How should we think about that practically and kind of track that? Is that part of the reason the sub of megawatt bookings have remained a little bit elevated? How should we think about that trend going forward?
Andrew Power: Colin, why don't you -- I think that's a great question because we are obviously spending a lot of time on the bigger deals right now. But Colin, why don't you walk-through on the highlights of the quarter?
Colin McLean: Sure. Frank, thanks for the question. I'm not sure I'd use the word prioritize. We definitely want to emphasize a full platform to have an offering set. So as highlighted in Andy's opening remarks, performance in Q2 was particularly strong 0 to 1, fourth consecutive quarter over $50 million, which I think was -- which is in also the third highest ever from 0 to 1. We think this consistency is really driven from our ability to serve the full spectrum of requirements for our enterprisers and service providers across the Global 5000 focus of customer set. New logos are also pretty strong as well, most solid ever in terms of 148% with 40% of that coming from the indirect side. Channel also which I highlighted earlier was a particularly strong point with over 20% booking contribution from the indirect side overall. So we view this segment as continuing on our value proposition out to our client set. And a lot of the drivers Andy talked about around digital transformation, cloud, and AI are also playing out in 0-1 segment across enterprises and service providers. And Andy highlighted a couple of those key wins on opening remarks, namely Fortune 5,000 clients, excuse me, offering their virtual desktop requirements and the global manufacturing win we had on the enterprise side. I also want to highlight the particular highlight of the Microsoft ExpressRoute launch into Dallas, which we feel like is a presumably strong representation of our platform.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Andy, in the past, you've talked about CapEx being an accordion that you expand and contract to the end of solving for consistent bottom line growth. So as I'm thinking about it, given the leasing success that you've had over the last two quarters and also as part of that like the market opportunity in both hyperscale and enterprise. Is now the time to be expanding that Accordion and really hitting the gap on CapEx? And if so, I just want to be clear, what is the explicit FFO per share that you can grow -- that you guys are solving for as part of that algorithm? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So the -- just to clarify, I would say, CapEx is the core and I think it's how we funded, which I think the same concept you're outlining in your question. The CapEx intensity is being pulled forward, right? We talked about this of greenlining more shell capacity, ultimately suites in a super highly leased -- pre-leased development pipeline at very attractive returns. So we're seeing the CapEx intensity increase. We're intersecting at great rates, great returns for our business for good -- and supporting great customers in numerous markets. And we've now positioned ourselves in a balance sheet position of greater strength, not only just from our leverage standpoint but from our liquidity and our diverse sources of capital. And what we're trying to do is essentially use the levers of using our public capital and our private capital to get back to, call it mid-single digits, call it floor to our growth next year and then it's further acceleration on top of that. And do that in a consistent year -- method of compounding that growth for numerous years to come. So it's really those levers of using public and private capital to drive that bottom line to new levels and on a consistent framework.
Operator: The next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. I appreciate the industry statistics you guys included in your investor presentation. And I wanted to ask specifically about the declining global vacancy you highlighted, which it's around 6%. But when I look at your stabilized portfolio, the vacancy level is about three times higher than that. So I guess, first, why is it so much higher? And then second, given the record demand we're seeing across the industry, how long do you think it's going to take before digital's portfolio resembles more like the industry is?
Andrew Power: I think Dave - you got to remember that our portfolio is not all -- just call it hyperscale. And the hyperscale portion of this business can literally be 100% leased in many buildings or markets, right? And my gut is that chart, which I think data center walk, which they're doing the best they can, is very much about more of a hyperscale lens. I was actually pretty pleased on the occupancy front. We're up 100 basis points in the same-store occupancy quarter-over-quarter and we have a big same-store pool. It's not mountain. We're also actively taking it one step backwards sometimes on occupancy to take two, three, four steps forward when vacant -- when suites come back and scale and we convert those to Colo and really support our customers' Colo growth as well. So this was the year we said that with occupancy, we're going to be moving the needle and we have been moving the needle. We got more to do in that arena. So I think we'll be seeing -- see it move up. And if you look at, you can also look to get a number of apples-to-apples. If you look at their occupancy, we show by markets. There are certain markets of way less than 60% vacancy that are just very much heavily weighted towards our hyperscale business. They just have a much, much smaller a footprint like Northern Virginia, where if you parse through it, especially on a megawatt basis. I wish, I had that type of vacancy to sell right now and we just don't.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me on. I had two follow-ups. First, on the Colo side, so you cited the record new logo is 148 this quarter. I'm just wondering from a macro perspective, any change in terms of macro impacts across different customer sizes within that sub 1 megawatt base? And then secondly, you talked about leverage getting back under 5.5 turns, the prospect of improving bottom line growth from next year. How do you think about the dividend and the potential for forward growth in the dividend relative to some potential incremental investments in the business? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Matt, why don't you hit the dividend question first and Colin, and I can hit a little bit on what we're seeing in the enterprise demand piece of the puzzle?
Matthew Mercier: Yes, sure. So thanks, Matt. So in terms of the dividend, look I think it's back to kind of what we've said historically. I think we've got a unique opportunity here to take advantage of what we see as a tremendous growth opportunity throughout our global portfolio and one of the easiest and cheapest forms of capital within that is internally generated funds. And so we continue to look to try to maximize our cash flow as part of our funding strategy on that front. And on top of that, we're also -- I think as we've also mentioned throughout this call, we're keenly focused on growing the bottom line and accelerating that growth in outer years. So as we grow the bottom line, which is going to benefit and accrue benefits to not only core FFO but then on to AFFO, we then look to keep our dividend growth in line with that bottom line per share growth as well.
Colin McLean: Great. On the new logo question, a couple of trends just maybe to highlight in that question. So first, we really believe it's in the hybrid world. So we're seeing that continued trend in the new logo base, hybrid work, cloud, data that our new logo requirements really are served well across our global platform. Number two is the mix of that 148 was very much split between commercial and Global 5000 accounts. So we're seeing continued interest in the platform across the larger customers who buy with more frequency in the smaller area of the spectrum. Not sure that we can necessarily point to a growing density in that particular base of clients yet or capacity. But I can tell you this particular base of clients sees real value, as I mentioned in our global platform, which really serves well across their requirements.
Andrew Power: And just one, Chris, why don't you just chime in on the early reads on the HD Colo 2.0, with some of the -- I would say an uptick in the enterprise segment?
Christopher Sharp: No, so I think I agree with you, Andy, on the macro trend of what we're doing with HD Colo is just really aligning the right capability to cool some of these higher-power density requirements coming into the market. And so we see a lot of the capabilities that we brought in across the 170 facilities. We can execute these higher-density solutions in 12 weeks or less. And I think what's interesting about that is the capacity blocks are getting larger, but like the capabilities that customers are trying to bring to market are definitely challenging for a lot of your traditional Colo offerings where we've really started to see that come to market about six to seven months ago. And so we've been able to pre-procure a lot of these capabilities to get ahead of that challenge. But just kind of current rack densities in the market today are 6 to 8 kilowatts. And I think one of the things I think you're really hitting on is like what are some of these new requirements coming in. And so healthcare, we're seeing 10 kilowatts of rack. I mean, gaming, we're seeing 15 kilowatts of rack this last quarter. And then some of the AI software capabilities, 40 kilowatts. But at the end of the day, we can meet a customer requirement of 150 kilowatts. So we have a lot of runway with that. And to put a little context to it, in the most recent state-of-the-art NVIDIA GB200, we can support that requirement in an under 12-week fashion with our current HD Colo offering. So definitely seeing a lot of growth in that market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Anthony Hau: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed that the weighted average commencement period for new leases are 20 months away. I'm assuming most of these leases are probably for 2026 deliveries, but are customers looking to sign leases for 2027? If they are, what type of customers are looking to pick up space thus far out?
Andrew Power: Thanks. So I mean customers are -- especially when it comes to larger capacity blocks, they're really trying to future proof and that's where our 3 gigawatts of growth comes in handy. So they certainly -- the nearest-term deliveries are precious, but I think in the years ahead. Now that particular example, as I mentioned, the 20 months was elongated because that customer -- one particular customer had very much their eyesight on a particular market and then various restrictions about where they could grow and where we can support that growth, we are literally their capacity. So that we were able to do deliver as fast as we could, but it certainly elongated. Look, excluding that one outlier, we're close to 4.5 months. And I think you'll -- I wouldn't count on those outliers consistently popping up, they'll be more sporadic.
Operator: The next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Question for Matt. Can you talk about not updating the guidance at all? Maybe there is some moving pieces from FX and the recent acquisition that you call out. Just as I was looking at it, if you look at the first half of the year and annualize it, revenue really need to accelerate while adjusted EBITDA would need to be backwards, actually to hit the midpoint of your guide. So I guess, the question is, is the EBITDA FFO guidance is conservative? Are there some uncertainty in terms of timing of commencements, unusual expenses? Hoping you could just unpack that for us. Thanks.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. I don't -- look there's a -- I would, again, I'd probably focus kind of on the bottom line. If you look at -- if you look at where we are halfway through the year, we're a little less than halfway through the midpoint of our core FFO guidance. And we talked about -- we expected this quarter would be -- would have a little bit of pressure because of the capital recycling efforts that where we've concluded with closing CH2 and having the related income from that come out this quarter. And so look what we're going to see is in the second half, growth we're expecting to improve and accelerate as the backlog of deals and signings come online. And as we expect -- as we haven't changed the guidance, we've obviously given a wide range. But if you look at -- I think where we are this year and the expectations for accelerating in the back half, which I think will set us up very nicely for 2025. We feel pretty good about the midpoint of guidance and being able to achieve that.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd like to now turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.
Andrew Power: Thank you. Digital Realty posted another strong quarter in 2Q with record leasing in the first half, demonstrating how Digital Realty is positioned to support the elevated level of demand we continue to see for data center infrastructure. Fundamental strength continued through the second quarter with robust leasing volume, healthy pricing, and record commencements poised to drive an acceleration in bottom line growth. We continue to innovate and integrate with the rollout of HD Colo 2.0 and the addition of new cloud on-ramps to PlatformDIGITAL in the quarter. Then we have repositioned the balance sheet by recycling capital out of stabilized assets, diversifying our capital sources, and reducing our leverage. All of this was done with an eye towards improving our growth profile while supporting our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and remain optimistic about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 10:35:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Please note that this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. 
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer; Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. 
 Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. 
 Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate as reflected by an AI-driven acceleration in leasing activity that drove our overall leasing volume to a new record. First quarter leasing was more than 40% above our prior record, principally driven by an improvement in pricing. 
 Second, our fundamental strength picked up where 2023 left off with record cash re-leasing spreads and strong, stabilized same-capital cash NOI growth of 4.7%, reflecting continued strength in data center fundamentals combined with the benefit of the improvements that we have made to our portfolio over the past year. 
 And third, we've made meaningful progress on our 2024 funding plan [ already ], with just over $1 billion of fresh capital raised from asset sales and joint ventures to date, putting us above the low end of our guidance range for 2024, just 1/3 of the way through the year. 
 As a result of our efforts, reported leverage fell from 6.2x at year-end to 6.1x at March 31 and remains at 5.8x on a pro forma basis, reflecting completed and announced transactions. 
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Following the successful course we set in 2023, Digital Realty experienced accelerating momentum in the first quarter of 2024, headlined by a collection of multifaceted AI opportunities that drove a number of new leasing records as demand for our capacity in core markets remains elevated while visibility surrounding competitive new supply remains cloudy. 
 At Digital, we continue to focus on our strategic priorities and on delivering on behalf of our expanding list of 5,000-plus customers across our 50-plus markets in 25-plus countries on 6 continents. 
 During the first quarter, we posted record leasing results surpassing our prior record by more than 40% and exceeding our leasing results for all of 2019 in just this 1 quarter. We also delivered strong operating results as evidenced by healthy stabilized same-capital growth and the highest re-leasing spreads in the company history. 
 We continue to innovate and integrate a further expansion of ServiceFabric through the launch of our Service Directory marketplace, which has seen the addition of over 90 members offering more than 150 services, including secure and direct connections to over 225 global cloud on ramps, creating a vibrant community for [ seamless ], interconnection and collaboration. 
 And just last week, we launched Private AI Exchange powered by ServiceFabric, which enables enterprise data to be at the center of an AI architecture, directly adjacent and interconnected with AI capabilities. This architecture are leading the data [ crafted ] barriers that emerge as data is generated and exchange with multiple applications across end-to-end AI-enabled digital workflows. 
 We also continued down the path of bolstering our balance sheet and diversifying our capital sources with the expansion of one of our stabilized hyperscale joint ventures and the addition of a new hyperscale development JV, together with our first transaction with our perpetual capital partner, Digital Core REIT and well over the year. These transactions help to fund development pipeline capacity that our customers are seeking while reducing our overall leverage. 
 Operating and financial results in the first quarter were encouraging. We posted sequential growth in our core data center revenues while growing adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share. Development returns also continued to improve and we further enhanced the product mix of our portfolio while maintaining strong liquidity and lower leverage. 
 Bookings and renewal results were even better with a number of metrics reaching new records, reflecting a strong demand environment and limited new capacity. Total bookings were $252 million, well ahead of our prior quarterly record of $176 million, reflecting the impact from the acceleration of AI and the improved pricing environment. 
 Importantly, when comparing this quarter's leasing to the prior record set in 3Q 2022, we leased an incremental 10% of IT load capacity while REITs in a greater than 1 megawatt segment for approximately 60% higher than those achieved 18 months prior. 
 Perhaps have been overshadowed by these record-setting results was another strong quarter in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which delivered a third straight quarter of over $50 million. Demand for connectivity-oriented capacity remains healthy and pricing remains firm. 
 Our mark-to-market renewal spreads were up by 11.8%, aided by a record 18.5% increase in our greater than 1 megawatt category. Churn remained low and well controlled at 1.7% for the quarter. 
 Same capital cash NOI growth also remained healthy, growing by 4.7% year-over-year in the quarter. And marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive same capital growth. A year ago, data center demand was strong, driven by the growth of cloud and digital transformation while supply was tightening in power transmission constraints, supply chain delays and other factors. Since then, AI has become a significant driver of demand as hyperscalers race to develop, deploy and implement the technology while enterprise begins to explore the potential of this wave of technological evolution. 
 McKinsey recently forecasted data center demand growth at a double-digit CAGR through 2030. This growing secular demand is broad and deep and both enterprises and service providers need a significant new data center capacity to accommodate their expanding needs, fueled by trends such as enterprise AI adoption, AI as a service, IoT and the relentless growth in data creation. 
 Reflecting these trends, I want to highlight 2 highly strategic AI signs that came to fruition during the quarter. First, we were selected to host one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in one of our data centers in Copenhagen in a collaboration spearheaded on the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark where researchers from Denmark's public and private sectors, access to a cutting-edge NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer in addition to NVIDIA's software platforms, training and expertise. 
 Second, Digital Realty further strengthened its collaboration with Oracle to accelerate the growth and adoption of AI among enterprises, aiming to develop hybrid integrated solutions that address data gravity challenges, expedite time to market for enterprise deploying next-generation AI services and unlock data and AI-based business outcomes. Oracle will deploy critical GPU-based infrastructure with Digital Realty that leverages PlatformDIGITAL's open, purpose-built global data center solution and caters to enterprise and AI customers critical NVIDIA and AMD deployments among others. 
 Our 0 to1 plus interconnection customers also continue to recognize our demonstrable strength and value proposition whether that related to power dense applications, a network of globally-connected data centers or other critical infrastructure requirements. 
 During the first quarter, we added over 128 new logos. Our wins included a leading Fortune 500 AI component maker, is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL to a new EMEA market to support their streaming service capabilities. 
 A global cloud computing and content distribution provider are leveraging the leading connectivity proposition of PlatformDIGITAL in Mombasa to support their global edge pop expansion project. A global 120 manufacturing company is building an AI HPC environment in Frankfurt to support its autonomous vehicle project. 
 A leading French cloud service provider is deploying on PlatformDIGITAL to build out its edge cloud offering across the globe to support their enterprise customers' hybrid infrastructure by delivering low latency performance while retaining mobile data residency. 
 Fortune 500 technology distributor in [indiscernible], IT service provider chose PlatformDIGITAL and Phoenix to support data exchange and interconnect with key partners. And a Fortune 500 health benefits provider has expanded into 2 additional North America metros to take advantage of cloud and network [indiscernible] available on PlatformDIGITAL. 
 Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. During the first quarter, we leased approximately 80 megawatts of capacity in a supply-constrained quarter in Eastern Loudoun County. Demand for our capacity remains strong. And while hyperscale leasing is typically lumpy, we continue to see healthy traction on the remaining capacity, and we are focused on helping our customers and partners source the incremental data center infrastructure that they require. 
 During the first quarter, we worked with Dominion Energy to help address the transmission [ model ] at Ashburn by providing them with a easement to land a southern line at the Mars substation that they plan to construct on a quarter parcel, along 450-acre Digital Dallas campus. 
 We remain cautiously optimistic about getting access to additional power with Dominion's current forecast for completion of the Southern Line transmission project by late 2025. 
 Today, we have roughly 80 megawatts of remaining capacity available for lease within our first building on our Digital Dallas campus in Loudoun known as Building 7. And we have almost 200 megawatts available for development for our [ regular ] campus in Manassas, which was contributed to our JV with last [indiscernible] in the first quarter. As a reminder, Manassas is currently outside of the constrained area and [indiscernible] is accessible there. 
 Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the first quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress and be recognized for our strong ESG performance in 2024. We went live with a switch to 100% renewable energy supplies for our Texas, New Jersey, and Sydney data center portfolios, benefiting 30 sites and addressing more than 10% of our mobile electricity footprint. 
 We are recognized by the EPA as Energy Star Partner of the Year with sustained excellence for the fourth year, and we added a new green building certification at our MRS 4 development at Marseille, France. We also announced a partnership with a leading global energy solution provider to use our UPS systems to support Ireland's transition to renewable energy. 
 And we've announced a significant expansion of our use of HVO diesel, a cleaner fuel made from waste, cooking oils and fats to power our backup generators. This will up our use of HVO to 20 global sites and 15% of our global portfolio by IT capacity. 
 We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. 
 With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. 
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a record $252 million of new leases in the first quarter, led by $175 million of greater than a megawatt leasing in the Americas and another $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, with interconnection bookings remaining firm at $13 million. 
 Turning to our backlog. Given the record leasing, the backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases swelled to a new record of $541 million at quarter end, with new leasing outstripping a record $156 million of commencements during the quarter. Looking ahead, more than half of the record backlog is slated to commence during the remainder of 2024, indicating that commencements are likely to remain elevated. 
 During the first quarter, we signed a record $248 million of renewal leases at a record increase of 11.8% on a cash basis. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions, with particular strength in the Americas. Re-leasing spreads have been increasing steadily for well over a year now, and while we expect that they will remain very healthy, they're likely to moderate in this quarter's record given the significant weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1-megawatt segment for the remainder of the year. 
 In addition, we think it is important to consider a normalized view of the headline renewal spreads as 2 separate items skew our reported spreads higher in the first quarter. First, there was a notable outlier in the other category that should not be considered recurring or repeatable and removing this transaction would reduce our overall reported spreads by 250 basis points to 9.3% for the quarter. 
 Second, there was a significant early renewal transaction in our greater than 1 megawatt segment that was part of a large package deal as we work to support this customer's broader data center capacity needs in one of our tightest markets. While this transaction enabled us to opportunistically pull forward some of our below-market expirations from the outer years, our forward year lease expiration schedule remains dominated by our 0 to 1 megawatt segment, which tends to experience spreads in the low to mid-single digits, akin to what we saw in the first quarter. 
 Excluding both the outlier transaction and the packaged deal renewal, re-leasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 3.4% on a cash basis. We feel that this is a more predictable aspect of our portfolio, that we will continue to see opportunities and may periodically be able to capture the growing mark-to-market opportunity in our greater than 1 megawatt portfolio. 
 In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting strong organic operating results, partly balanced by dilution associated with the stabilized asset sales and JV contributions completed early in the year and the ongoing deleveraging of our balance sheet. 
 And normalizing for the sale or JV of $3 billion of stabilized assets completed since the beginning of last year, total revenue growth was 7% year-over-year in the first quarter due to the benefit of improved leasing spreads, along with favorable new leasing. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements as electricity rates fell sharply in EMEA year-over-year. 
 Normalized adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue growth and modest increase in operating expenses. As Andy noted earlier, stabilized same-capital operating performance saw continued strength in the first quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 4.7% driven by 4% growth in rental plus interconnection revenues and further supported by expense control. 
 Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $550 million on consolidated development for the first quarter, plus another $23 million for our share of managed unconsolidated JV spending while delivering 32 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers. 
 It's worth mentioning, the approximate $300 million of sequential decline in our development spending this quarter which highlights the effects of the contributions of our 3 development JVs. However, seasonal and other timing-related factors also contributed to less CapEx spending in the first quarter. 
 Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the first quarter with the closing of previously disclosed transactions, including the Cyxtera transaction, the first phase of the Blackstone hyperscale development JV and the sale of an additional 50% share of the 2 stabilized hyperscale assets in our Chicago JV to GI Partners. 
 During the quarter, we also completed a hyperscale development JV with Mitsubishi for 2 assets in the Dallas Metro. In terms of new news, we also sold a piece of land in Sydney, Australia for $65 million, and we provided an easement to Dominion Energy to build the Mars substation on our Digital Dulles campus for $92 million, which all contributed to a reduction in our reported leverage to 6.1x at the end of the first quarter versus 6.2x at the end of 2023. 
 Then in April, we continue to recycle capital by selling 75% of CH2, the third and final stabilized hyperscale facility on our Elk Grove campus at a 6.5 cap rate to GI Partners, raising nearly $400 million. And we sold to Digital Core REIT, an additional 24.9% interest in our Frankfurt site where Digital Core REIT previously owned 25%, raising another $129 million. 
 In addition, we used some of our cash on hand to pay off the $600 million of maturing euro notes. After adjusting for these transactions, along with the anticipated closing of Phase 2 of the Blackstone transaction later this year, pro forma leverage is 5.8x. 
 We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion on hand and over $3 billion of total liquidity at March 31 to support ongoing investment opportunities. 
 Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. 
 Finally, after paying off the [ earnouts ] in April, we have $316 million of debt maturing through year-end 2024. Beyond that, our maturities remained well [ levered ] through 2032. 
 I'll finish with guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2024 of between $6.60 and $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued improvement we are seeing in our core business. Positive underlying operating trends are partly balanced by potential acceleration in development spending and additional capital recycling, as we move our leverage down towards the long-term target and position the company for the accelerating opportunity in front of us. 
 We are maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, so we are notching up our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads along with our same capital cash NOI growth expectations, reflecting better-than-expected execution on the leasing front in the first quarter, and the strength in fundamental conditions that we continue to see across our portfolio. 
 Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are now expected to increase 5% to 7% in 2024, up 100 basis points at the midpoint from the prior 4% to 6% range. And same-capital cash NOI is now expected to increase by 2.5% to 3.5%, up 50 basis points from the 2% to 3% range we provided in February. 
 Highlighted in our investor presentations, excluding the nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds that we have previously discussed, our same-capital cash NOI growth for 2024 would be 4.5% to 5.5%. While these improvements and stronger core FFO per share realized in the first quarter bode well for the balance of the year, there are a few mitigating factors to consider as you're refining your models. First, we will see a modest drag on the $500-plus million of capital recycling completed in April. Second, we are only 1/3 of the way into the year, and there is still significant potential for both development spend and asset sales guidance to reach the high end of their guidance ranges. 
 In addition, it is worth pointing out that the interest rate outlook and curve have changed considerably since we provided guidance and remains another source of uncertainty for the balance of this year. 
 Just one final reminder and update. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects are completed and stabilized. The expected yield on our stabilized pipeline ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting the addition of higher-yielding projects and the completion or contribution to joint ventures of lower-yielding projects. 
 To help provide increased transparency around this important and evolving aspect of our company, we have enhanced our development life cycle schedule on Page 25 of our supplemental to: one, reflect our proportionate share of total data center development, including our unconsolidated joint ventures; and two, to provide increased disclosure around our available developable capacity in terms of [ IQ logo ]. We hope you find this helpful. 
 This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you please begin the Q&A session? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. 
Jonathan Petersen: Great. I guess I could start with -- actually, let me start on the leasing side. So the -- I was curious how much of the leasing that was done this quarter was inside of some of the joint ventures, like maybe the Blackstone joint venture, that you did.
 And in terms of the yield on development in Northern Virginia -- or North America, I noticed that was up 200 basis points to 12.3% as your expected yield from last quarter. I guess, is that kind of a good number to think about of what new developments you're signing today are as kind of in the 12-plus percent range. 
Andrew Power: So John, thanks for the question. So I'd say the lion's share of high, high percentage was not done into any of the JVs. I don't have the exact stat given we have now numerous strategic capital partners across our hyperscale platform, be it stabilized JVs. But I'm very confident that none of the leasing we reported in this quarter went into the deal you identified with Blackstone. We are seeing great traction on those projects. But this quarter, none of that lease went inside.
 On your second question in terms of improvement in ROIs, in particular in North America, I would say we've definitely moved the needle quite dramatically on that category from some of our build-to-suit projects that we'll call closer to 7% that we joint ventured to now north of 12% ROIs. And we're still working through projects that are obviously weighing that down a little bit, and we have projects that are entering that schedule on the higher side as well given the rapid improvement in the rate environment. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. 
Jonathan Atkin: So you mentioned rate environment and maybe continuing on that theme a little bit in terms of pricing. As we think about next year's core FFO per share growth rate, you gave a little bit of commentary on that in the last call. And any updated thoughts in terms of what we should be considering around puts and takes as that number potentially goes higher, whether it's execution of leases or pricing or renewals or whatnot? 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jon. Maybe I'll speak to market rates and where we are able to execute on new leases signed and also renewals first and then hand it over to Matt in terms of FFO trajectory into next year.
 As you saw from our results, we're obviously benefiting from overall supply/demand dynamic with robust demand trends be it enterprise digital transformation, cloud computing and now AI on top of that, that's playing out in our 0 to 1-megawatt category as well as our greater than megawatt category. And that's all having a backdrop of supply constraints from numerous sources. And we were able to continue to push rate both on the existing contracts that were coming up for renewal as well as on new contracts to higher and higher levels. That is, obviously, you see in the leasing results and believe that trend is going to remain intact for some time.
 Matt, why don't you speak to the FFO trajectory, please? 
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Jon. So what I would say is I think we're -- based on our first quarter results, we -- our optimism is improved -- has improved in terms of our -- what we expect to see and what we talked about last quarter in terms of improving growth as we look to 2025.
 And a big part of that, I would say, is driven by the successful leasing execution that we saw this quarter, $250 million and the shorter signed commence lag, which is at 7 months, it really sets us up for accelerating revenue and therefore, bottom line growth as we exit this year and into next year.
 But from boiling all that down, I would say that the growth algorithm is generally similar to what I discussed last quarter, which is we'd expect to see, call it, plus 4% related to our stabilized same-store portfolio. On top of that, you'd add another, call it, 2-plus percent as we deliver developments into our operating portfolio at yields that are continuing to improve. There'll be some offset, call it, in the 1% area, given higher rates and the debt refinancing that we have over the next couple of years. And I think that kind of sets us up for mid-single-digit and greater growth going forward. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. 
Eric Luebchow: I wanted to dive into Northern Virginia a little bit. Can you maybe just provide an update on the timing of the Dominion transmission upgrades and when you think you can get even more capacity into that market? And then on rental rates in Northern Virginia, I think that probably had a big influence on the 170-plus you reported in North America. Could you just talk about where you're seeing rental rates in that very supply-constrained market and what that kind of -- how that influences your yields, your underwriting and your development table? 
Andrew Power: Sure. Thanks, Eric. So Northern Virginia, obviously, has been a highly dynamic market for some time here. We were very pleased to come together and support our partner at Dominion with a very strategic easement to be the landing of the Mars substation, which we are -- it is our understanding, they are on track to be delivering power and bring power back online by the beginning of 2026 from that southern line. So there's not been a divergence in terms of timing what that was previously expressed to us.
 We definitely benefited from the increase in rates in that market. Our largest signing was in that market as well as a few other decent-sized signings, although we also had some very great signings in the London market, and north of a megawatt signings also in Copenhagen. So they were not the only contributors in the plus the megawatt category.
 The rates, I would say, the market rates in general are call it, continue to improve in that market and as the precious capacity becomes more and more finite, as you saw on that slide, we now have -- are turning our attention to really 80 megawatts remaining at Digital Dallas as well as the Manassas campus, which is not impacted by the power delays. And I'd say rates in both Manassas and Loudoun County are converging right at this moment, call it in the 165, call it to almost 180 type area on a market basis. That'd be the cash rate, not a GAAP rate that we report. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Barden with Bank of America. 
David Barden: I guess if I could just explore, Andy, the commentary around how AI is contributing already to your business. A lot of the retail data center-centric companies have kind of said that's not really a thing for them yet. So could you kind of elaborate a little bit on within that greater than 1 megawatt category, how much of that is the hyperscale? Is it really hyperscale? Or is it these maybe more bespoke Copenhagen Nordisk Foundation engines that are coming online? And what do these builds look like, in what way are they different than maybe what you've been doing historically? And how is that informing how your development is evolving? 
Andrew Power: Sure. Thanks, David. So let me just give you the tops of the ways then I'm going to turn it to Chris on how we're tapping our infrastructure capabilities to really excel in this category.
 Obviously, the data points are smaller in the more enterprise-oriented wins, but they are there. We, I would say, call it, less than 0.5 megawatt supported through a partner, a global manufacturing company, on its AI journey in Europe. You noted the slightly larger than that, but still not -- certainly not hyperscale. The great win we had with Novo Nordisk supporting them in their NVIDIA-backed chips with a real landmark win with a supercomputer in their market.
 And then for some time, we've seen the emergence of the hyperscalers with larger capacity block needs. And the largest of our wins in the quarter, I would characterize as an AI win as well. And all in all, it's probably close to 50% of this quarter's signs, which is up relative to prior quarters. And I think there's a lot about what our platform offers that really allows us to capture this demand, maybe even earlier in the an evolution of AI than some others, but Chris can speak to that as well. 
Chris Sharp: Yes. No, I appreciate it, David. This is Chris Sharp. And so a couple of comments. I think you're thinking about it correctly in that there's 2 lenses, right? There's kind of that hyperscale lens that has AI built within it. And then there's this other pocket that we kind of look at that's definitely emerging with private AI. And so these are these larger deployments that we're seeing come out from multiple types of enterprises.
 And I think it's important to understand from a design perspective, it kind of starts with a little bit broader in how we master plan our campuses. And so I think the work that we've been doing around building out substations and doing a long-term plan within the market has allowed us to then bring a very large capacity block design to market, which is very modular. And I think in that modularity, it's something that we continue to ideate with our customers to be able to support the varying power densities.
 And I think we talked last call about HD colo and being able to do what we're very proud about wit  70 kilowatts, but then you'll see us start to evolve over the next quarter here, the ability to even support 150 kilowatts. And so being able to support these densities, which is representative of the AI workload is absolutely paramount to our modular designs and be able to do that very efficiently.
 And then I think the last piece is the heritage. The heritage of the team on a global basis, being able to really meet and ideate with these customer bases is what's really building a distinct differentiator for us to not only capture that hyperscale AI, which we see growing and burgeoning, which you see in the prepared remarks with Oracle and some of those customers.
 But then I think directly to your point, David, these smaller, if you will, from a hyperscale perspective, private AI around Novo Nordisk Foundation and just we really are at the cusp of a lot of this AI demand coming into the PlatformDIGITAL globally. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. 
Jyhhaw Liu: Maybe to piggyback on the prior question related to retail and enterprise. Do you see potential for AI tailwinds to perhaps drive meaningful acceleration to your 0 to 1 megawatt segment, similar to what you saw in the greater than 1 megawatt segment this quarter just as AI workloads begin to evolve towards private AI and inferencing? 
Andrew Power: Sure, Irvin. So I mean, the here and now I think AI is having a numerous positive implications for the sector. And I'll have Chris speak into what's next because I don't think we're really at what's next, be it inference, private data sets, enterprise consumption. But the here and now you have a backdrop of big existing customers with desires to have immediate [ see ] around the capacity.
 There's still -- we're winning that in our core markets where we see robust and diverse demand. We are not falling. We're chasing this demand into unproven locations. We're intersecting it, we're supporting availability zones or on ramps, where there's network density and not in unproven markets.
 You're also seeing new players pop up that obviously are not front of queue for those larger capacity blocks who are going to try to get their hands on what we have and are often able to fit in some of the more challenging places in our portfolio to sell, but they're going to take it because they have urgency around their business models and bringing their AI models on. That's the right now, the last quarter, the next quarter, but there's more to come here in this AI story. And I'll let Chris expand upon it in terms of the next chapter. 
Chris Sharp: Yes. Thanks, Irvin. Absolutely. And I think one of the things that we really have thought about for some time now is the data is at the core of a lot of these AI kind of capabilities coming to market. So being to able place that algorithm right next to the data in that market, I think is everything that we've been looking at and doing that algorithm in proximity to the data is absolutely paramount for a lot of these kind of 0 to 1 megawatt offerings.
 And so what we've been thinking about with HD colo and why I talk about on a rack by rack basis, is allowing our customers to leverage a lot of their existing kind of inventory and architecture to bring AI in proximity to that capability. And I think that's where, even recently, we talked about private AI exchange, that's really focused on removing that technical barrier. So customers can get the right state-of-the-art infrastructure, be it NVIDIA, be it AMD and being able to support those power densities in an existing environment. So we do see the future of that coming to market in that fashion.
 I will tell you that -- you brought up inference. Inference is being done within training today just because of time to market, but we do see inference picking up and being a longer-term demand cycle over the years, which I think PlatformDIGITAL is well positioned to continue to support. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. 
Richard Choe: You noted a pull forward of leases in Northern Virginia. Do you have other -- are you having other conversations? And should we expect to see more of those? 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Richard. Maybe I'll hand it to Colin here in a second to talk about the broader backdrop for both the enterprise and also the hyperscale AI side. But I wouldn't call our Northern Virginia activity as a pull forward. As you could see, they're signed to commence time, materially step down, there is urgency around the capacity blocks. We still have significant runway of precious capacity in the Northern Virginia market between now and 2026 that our numerous customers have desires for and we're in various stages of negotiation.
 And it's not just in Northern Virginia story. We have the similar types of opportunities in other parts of the North America portfolio, be it Santa Clara, Dallas, New Jersey. And we'll also have the equivalent in the major flat markets in Europe, and in parts of Asia Pacific. So -- and I think this trend is going to continue for some time. Now again, you can't predict some of these large capacity blocks executing on consecutive quarters necessarily but I believe it's going to continue. But Colin, why don't you speak a little bit about the pipeline we see on both sides? 
Colin McLean: Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, overall, I would say our pipeline kind of reflects some of the same characteristics or bookings this quarter. So pretty AI heavy, as Andy highlighted, of 50% of our bookings this quarter were AI. I would say our pipeline is representative of that. But honestly, it's a pretty diverse characterization overall between enterprise, namely hybrid, IT, cloud compute and then AI. So I think it's a pretty robust platform across the globe, and you saw that in some of our bookings, in particular, London really jumped up this quarter.
 If you look at the sub-1-megawatt, and really what's going on in the digital transformation story, the explosion of data and really the IT spend, you're seeing a pretty pervasive enterprise activation going on where that is really taking place really across the globe in a big way. That's, in our view, enabled by channel, which this quarter, we had about 22% of our business go through channel, which was, I think, substantive. And those channel partners are really helping us tap into new logos, which you might have seen was 128 this quarter, which I think was fourth highest on record. So I think that's substantial.
 So overall, I'm pretty pleased with the balance we're seeing across the portfolio and the pipeline and hope to see that continue in the future. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. 
Michael Rollins: Just curious if you take a step back, where does the overall mark-to-market it for the portfolio and the anticipated duration over which you could achieve that if pricing were to stay at current levels? 
Andrew Power: I think you asked the overall mark-to-market on the portfolio, Mike? 
Michael Rollins: Yes. 
Andrew Power: So as I think  you can get the -- obviously, you look at the in-place rates even pro forma for our recent positive cash mark-to-market on our schedule. I think that question provide more focus on the greater than megawatt category, which we've seen the greatest resurgence or uptick that it does tick down, call it lower for the next few years, call it down to the 130s and then it even hits 100 upon exploration as the low watermark in a few years' time.
 And I just commented on the Northern Virginia rates, if they call it, 155 to 180. Not all markets are at Northern Virginia. There are some markets that are ahead of Northern Virginia. But it does feel like big deals are gravitating towards that mid-100s type area pretty quickly and universally and it does not seem like that trend is taking any cessation or pause. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. 
Frank Louthan: Great. And kind of to that point, when you're looking at new investment and expansion, how much are you focused on retail colo expansion versus wholesale? And what's kind of pushing you in one direction or the other? 
Gregory Wright: Frank, it's Greg right here. Look, I think consistent with past practice, we continue to play across the product spectrum, and it's going to vary by market, right? I mean, as we've mentioned, we're using our third-party capital model to continue to support our hyperscale customers and grow that element of the business. As you know, demand for that business is projected to increase 2.7x between now and 2030.
 And then when you look over at the colocation in the enterprise segment of the product spectrum, that's still supposed to grow. It's still a very large market. People forget about how large that market is, and the solid growth in that market, too, is still like 2.3x. So I mean, we're not sitting here today saying, hey, it's a zero-sum game. We're only going to do enterprise/colo versus hyperscale. It's going to vary by market and what our customer needs are. But we're actually pretty bullish and optimistic on both right now in terms of underlying fundamentals and potential for rent growth. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. 
Simon Flannery: Great. Great to see the leasing in Loudoun County. It looks like the Americas was about 80% of your leasing. Could you just talk a little bit about Europe and Asia Pac? It seems like AI is sort of starting off in the U.S. You talked about Copenhagen as well. But just help us think about broadening this out beyond the kind of key U.S. markets. And then, Matt, on the leverage. Could you just update us on getting -- once you get to the 5.8, what's the plan from there? 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Simon. So I'll do the quick non-U.S. world tour. You're correct, Americas had put up some record results in contribution, and that was not just in the greater than megawatt category. It was also a major contributor in our less than megawatt category, which is great to see.
 Outside the U.S., starting in EMEA on the 0 to 1 megawatt category, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London shined. And on the greater than 1 megawatt category, which Colin, I think touched on, London turned out to be a big contributor this quarter, which has not been for a while, which is also great to see. We saw a fair bit of importing business into Europe from outside of Europe, on both sides and firm pricing.
 In APAC, while this particular quarter, we did not have a significant contribution from the greater than megawatt category, we did have strong results both in pricing and volume on the 0 to 1 megawatt category with Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul leading the way. And I would just say that the greater than megawatt category is just the fact that there's just fewer markets in APAC that we're landing big deals into so it's not as consistent of every single quarter being a major contributor. But all in all, I agree with your sentiment that AI is certainly landed on the U.S. shores sooner than the rest of the globe, and I think it has a great propensity to likely globalize as did cloud. 
Matthew Mercier: Yes. Makes sense. So on the leverage front, I mean, just to take a little step back. I mean, hopefully, as you've seen, we've made some considerable progress. You go back a year ago, we were at a little over 7x. We're now at a reported 6.1x, so a full turn of leverage that we've taken out in the last year, thanks to all the work and execution that the broader team has done.
 We continue that. As Greg is seeing, even subsequent to the quarter, we brought in another $500 million of proceeds from some additional JV activities as well as transaction within our Digital Core REIT showing the diversity of capital sources we have. We're going to continue to see as a result of the strong operating fundamentals, continue to increase our overall EBITDA and we're now sitting at approximately $3 billion of liquidity.
 So we're well on our way, and we feel confident about being able to achieve our goal of getting down to 5.5x leverage this year. And I think we've done a lion's share of the work. So we'll continue to execute and feel pretty good about it. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. 
Aryeh Klein: I guess one of your larger customers is at risk of a potential ban in the U.S. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you perceive the risks around that? And maybe the potential mark-to-market opportunity if it came to that. 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Aryeh. So on all scenarios, we don't want to speak to confidential customer information whatsoever. Obviously, anyone who's picked up a newspaper can refer to the scenario you're talking about. 2 comments: first one, which is just from the cheap seats, I would -- my personal opinion is not to jump up to any draconian conclusions on outcomes just yet. There's a lot of innings left in that game and a lot of outcomes that could happen. So I won't jump to a doomsday scenario for Digital, depending on what plays out in ensuing months.
 And even under that scenario, I would group them among all of our hyperscale customers that have maximized the pricing curve when markets were less softer and have contracts that are, like all our hyperscale customers, some of the best contracts on the books in terms of markup opportunities, certainly, on the south of 100 side rather than the north of 100 side, by and large. So if the doomsday draconian scenario was to play out, which I'm discounting, we would have some churn to refill, but probably couldn't come at a better time with a better mark-to-market opportunity for the company. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. 
Matthew Niknam: Just bigger picture question. With pricing seeing the type of growth it's seeing, supply chain constraints that I think largely plagued the industry a couple of years back are now largely resolved. Can you help us frame what you're seeing in terms of new hyperscale builds that are in-sourced relative to outsourced to partners like yourself?
 And I guess, more importantly, how Digital can enhance the utility it offers its larger customers in what's looking like a firmer pricing backdrop that's likely to persist for some time. 
Andrew Power: Matt, so I would not characterize the world of supply constraints or just hindrances to supply as being in the rearview mirror in general. And maybe we're not talking about the proverbial waiting for your refrigerators COVID supply chain equivalent. But the friction to supply, whether it is power transmission, power generation, supply chains on data center components or just positions in queue for production or components for substations, broader sustainability concerns, nimbyism in general, that friction is existing, and it's happening in a backdrop where I think we can add more and more value to our customers than probably ever before.
 And even despite historical preferences or to often do it yourself, I think by and large, the customer base is seeing having the benefit of global outsourced trusted partner with 20 years of experience operationally, delivery-wise, and really turn in to Digital in their times of need and really at a time or it could be continuing of urgency around those capacity blocks. And that's certainly been highlighted in the Northern Virginia market, but I think that's a broader Americas phenomenon and a growing global phenomena. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. 
Michael Elias: Congrats, guys, on a record leasing quarter. Just a quick one for me. I know it's been a while since you guys have done an acquisition. Maybe for Andy or Greg, curious how you're thinking about the potential for M&A, particularly given where your stock is trading right now? 
Andrew Power: Going to Greg on that one, Michael. Thank you for the compliment. 
Gregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Look, I think right now, our appetite for acquisitions, unless they're smaller tuck-in strategic acquisitions. Michael, I think we've discussed this before. It's not that great right now.
 When we look across most markets, we think we already have the footprint and the product and the team to continue to drive our business and succeed. And as you know, most of our legacy M&A activity was either gaining access to markets, to product or to teams in select markets where we didn't have a real presence. We don't have nearly as much of that today, particularly when you look across the Americas and EMEA.
 Over time, would we continue to look in markets through APAC to potentially grow, yes, but there's not a lot of those platforms, if you will, for example, there's not the logical interaction sitting in APAC for us to try to do a strategic transaction. So while you never say never, I think we look at things today. And Matt and Andy and the team laid out where we are in our development yields and the like. And you look at this on a risk-adjusted basis. And we still prefer right now, at least given current conditions, to buy land and build organically. And we think that's a better risk-adjusted return than what multiples would imply in the M&A market. So I don't think you're going to see a lot. But again, you never say never. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. 
Nicholas Del Deo: Andy, earlier you said that you're not going to chase demand into unproven markets, which you're seeing a fair bit of demand today. I guess what sort of thresholds would those markets have to cross before they might become interesting in your eyes, especially if power constraints in key markets remain exceedingly tight or even get worse? Or are they like so far down the list of priorities that we really shouldn't be thinking about them? 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Nick. So I think if you look at our strategy, we're focused on supporting workloads, be it enterprise, digital transformation or hybrid or hyperscale cloud or AI in markets with robust and diverse demand and supporting applications with latency and locational sensitivity.
 The cloud has been around for a long time and did not put [ AZs ] as in every single NFL city in America or it's equivalents around the globe. They picked locations where GDP, population, infrastructure and data are essentially there, which I think lends itself to greater longevity and sustainable growth in our asset class and our strategy and our business.
 Now there's markets that have been added to that list over time. They didn't get -- put chiseled in stone and put away on a shelf years and years ago. But -- so I think new markets for us would have to give us the similar conviction we have, invest in our core markets to want us to go there. So that could happen. That certainly could happen in a rapidly changing world, with power becoming such a precious resource as well as other precious resources. But anything we're thinking about is investing in -- we're not in this [ risk trade ], we're investing in this for the long term, for long-term sustainable growth.
 And we're fortunate, if you can look at our newly tweaked and disclosure on our development cycle, we've got north of 3 gigawatts of growth in land capacity or shell capacity in those core markets. So we've got a lot of runway to harvest that demand before even feeling the urgency to chase into less proven markets. 
Operator: And our final question today comes from Erik Rasmussen at Stifel. 
Erik Rasmussen: Obviously, North America is very strong, greater than 1 megawatt. And I think based on your commentary, a lot of that was AI driven. And then also, it seems like it's going to -- AI will sort of follow a similar pattern as we saw with cloud. So would you expect -- I mean I wouldn't expect similar levels of quarterly leasing, but would you expect sort of a similar outperformance throughout the year in North America, especially the greater than 1 megawatt based on sort of the other regions? Just want to get a sense of sort of how the year could be shaping up in terms of the bookings. 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Erik. So just more on the tactical on the quarterly bookings. I mean, we're out of the gates here with a great start on both the less-than-megawatt category, call it north of 50 for several consecutive quarters now. I think 2 in a row, north of 53, great new logos contribution and obviously, an overall record which we discussed. By and large, I wouldn't say usually another record follows the prior record on the one hand. But on the other, we're certainly in a different territory right now in terms of demand. We have the large capacity blocks that are deeply sought after. We have a team focused on executing, and we got 3 more at bats in 2024 to put those results up.
 Bigger backdrop. If you look back at cloud globalizing, it's one of those things that the famous quote "It happened slowly and then it happened really fast." I can remember years of the thesis being it's going to globalize forever and ever, and then it really took off. So I'm not -- I wouldn't -- I couldn't pound the table and say 2024 year is the year that AI globalizes like cloud. But signs do point that it should follow a similar trend over time. 
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead. 
Andrew Power: Thank you all for dialing in. We really appreciate it. Digital Realty had a strong first quarter with record leasing results that reflected the growing impact of AI on our business. Fundamental strength continued through the first quarter with healthy same-capital organic growth and robust re-leasing spreads.
 We've continued to innovate with the expansion of ServiceFabric, new products like our Private AI Exchange, along with modular designs to accommodate increasingly power dense workloads.
 Finally, we've closed a number of transactions already this year bringing in additional private capital and enhancing our ability to deliver new capacity to meet our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and look ahead with continued optimism. The 3 key demand drivers, AI, cloud and enterprise digital transformation are showing no signs of letting up, and we are well positioned with over 300 data centers across the key markets around the world.
 I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world running. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This conference has now concluded, and we thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful afternoon.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-15 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be placed in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question and we will aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will also contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter and our full year. First, we are seeing a robust wave of demand across our platform, and we are optimistic about our ability to execute. Leasing in the quarter was healthy, highlighted by strong volume in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, record pricing in the greater than megawatt category and the second highest quarter ever of new logos added. Second, our fundamental metrics capped off the year on a high note with the strongest cash re-leasing spreads and same capital cash NOI growth we've seen in years as our unique and differentiated value proposition continued to resonate. And lastly, in the fourth quarter alone, we announced nearly $8 billion of new development joint ventures and completed over $1 billion of equity issuance under our ATM bringing total capital sources raised during the year to more than $12 billion and reducing pro forma leverage below our year-end 2023 target. The execution on our funding and capital plan in 2023 has positioned Digital Realty to be able to support our customers' data center infrastructure needs as the next generation technology unfolds. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 2023 was a milestone year for Digital Realty, as we made strong progress toward our strategic objectives despite significant volatility in financial conditions and broader uncertainty around the world. For me, 2023 will be revered as the year of AI's arrival to the data center forefront, ushering in an unprecedented new wave of data center demand, driving a step function of change across the industry's landscape. The year that Digital Realty enhanced its customer value proposition by adding connectivity-rich solutions while also scaling our capacity for hyperscale and AI workloads. We expanded our footprint with new connectivity-oriented locations around the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Enhanced our joint venture in India with the addition of Reliance Jio and increased the number of direct access points on our campuses to the leading cloud and service providers. We accelerated the growth of service fabric with more than 70 discrete services added to the platform and over 100 unique services available by year-end and enhance its capabilities with new composes like service directory. We also added 9,000 new cross connects in the year, indicative of our growing connected data communities. 2023 was a year that we integrated and innovated at a faster pace than ever before. We strengthened our leadership team and aligned our platform to three regions to be consistently structured around the world. We adapted our product portfolio to meet market demand, evolving our offering to efficiently support next-generation chips like the NVIDIA H-100 in numerous data centers. Our high-density colo capability deployed across 32 markets spending all three regions is equipped to handle three times the H-100 requirements. And we continue to add green energy solutions to power many of these power dense applications. Like our large solar PPA in Germany and our agreement supporting 100% renewable power in Texas, San Francisco, New Jersey and Sydney. And 2023 was the year that Digital Realty took decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet by developing a portfolio of private capital partnerships and vehicles that diversified our capital sources while enabling us to support our customers' fast-growing requirements. And we did all of that while continuing to provide the operational excellence that is expected of a global data center leader and that our customers rightfully demand. On this call a year ago, I outlined a plan to bolster and diversify our capital sources. Our goals were to reduce our leverage towards six times by the end of the year. Increase our liquidity to fund our development program and diversify our capital sources to limit our reliance on the capital markets, increasing our ability to meet the accelerating demand for data center capacity and to enhance our returns on invested capital. We outperformed on each of these goals, sourcing over $12 billion of new capital and commitments for new investment and debt repayment, reducing pro forma leverage to just 5.8 times when adjusted for transactions that have been announced or closed since year-end. We also ended the year with five new JV partners and expanded some of our existing relationships. To round out the year, we announced three significant transactions in the fourth quarter, including two development joint ventures and the successful resolution to our relationship with Cyxtera, we also raised $1.2 billion of equity under our ATM since the end of September. I will quickly run through the highlights of these transactions. In early January, Greg completed his famed Triple Lindy with the Cyxtera transaction by selling $275 million of assets to Brookfield along with the purchase of Cyxtera's leasehold positions in Singapore and Frankfurt for $55 million, yielding net cash of $220 million to Digital Realty. In addition, Brookfield assumed three existing leases and amended three others in our portfolio to accelerate their expiration to the end of September 2024. Finally, Digital Realty obtained and exercised an option to purchase a Cyxtera data center and the Slough Trading Estate adding one of London's highly sought-after submarkets to Platform Digital's connectivity and enterprise colo offering. This transaction remains subject to customer closing conditions and is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter. In November, Realty Income purchased an 80% interest in 400 million data centers that are under development and leased to an investment-grade financial services company. The tenant has the option to expand the facility up to an estimated potential cost of $800 million. We received $200 million upon closing and reduced our funding obligations for the remainder of this project to just 20% of the total capital, enabling us to reinvest the capital in higher-return projects. Finally, the $7 billion development joint venture with Blackstone is our largest and most forward-looking transaction and accelerates the monetization of nearly 20% of our three-plus gigawatt land bank. This JV involves the sale of an 80% interest in nearly 500 megawatts of capacity across four campuses in Paris, Frankfurt and Northern Virginia and enables us to better support our hyperscale customers' needs. Approximately 20% of ventures total potential data center capacity is expected to be delivered through 2025. We will retain a 20% interest in the developments and earn fees for developing, leasing, operating and managing these facilities. All told, in 2023, we announced or completed joint ventures and asset sales driving leverage down roughly 1.3 turns from the first quarter peak accelerating our ability to deliver needed capacity to our customers and enhancing our returns on invested capital. I would also be remiss if I did not mention Digital Core REIT's successful $120 million follow-on equity offering last week which will support the REIT's planned acquisition of an incremental 24.9% interest in our jointly owned asset in Frankfurt for $125 million. Let's shift to a brief recap of our results and offer some insights into the trends we are seeing across our business. I'm pleased with our results for 2023, which helped to lay the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth in earnings and free cash flow that should take shape as we head into 2025. Our fourth quarter results were broadly consistent with the first three quarters of 2023 with continued strength in our operating performance KPIs and an incremental improvement in our financial position as we continue to execute on our value proposition with the goal to support the increased demand for data center capacity. Leasing remained healthy, especially in our targeted 0 to 1 plus interconnection segment with 134 new logos, bringing our total new logos for 2023 to a new annual record of more than 500. Renewal spreads were strong for the fifth consecutive quarter, remaining positive across product types and regions. Same capital cash NOI growth continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business with 9.9% year-over-year growth in the quarter. And churn remained low and well controlled at 1%, while occupancy was impacted by the delivery of significant vacant development capacity. The combination of cloud and AI is driving unprecedented demand for scale and hyperscale capacity alongside the steady enterprise and connectivity-oriented demand we're experiencing within our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Supply constraints driven by limited availability of power and global supply chain delays have continued to drive the pricing pendulum in our favor or our growing value proposition is increasing interest in our existing inventory and the new development that we have underway. Ongoing conversations with customers pretend a significant potential acceleration of leasing and development and we believe we are well positioned. The demand seems to be spilling across most markets, particularly for larger capacity blocks, though there are a few pockets of strength worth noting, including Northern Virginia, Santa Clara, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Singapore and Seoul. Our new capacity is concentrated in core markets aligned with our global meeting place strategy. While the scale of data center infrastructure opportunities has increased alongside AI's arrival, we remain disciplined and thoughtful prioritizing locations that enhance Platform Digital connectivity and our connected campus communities. During the fourth quarter, Digital demonstrated the benefits of collaborating with our partners with the signing of an Oracle Cloud infrastructure dedicated region deployment by a financial services customer, showcasing the potential of the collaboration between Oracle and Digital Realty to fulfill enterprise customers' hybrid cloud requirements. Other customers are recognizing the growing value of Platform Digital's broad and open structure. An AI service provider leveraged Platform Digital's pre-provisioned high-density colo offering to improve their time to market in order to extend our North America and AI cloud offering that provides managed AI as a service for a global manufacturing client. A global service provider and partner targeting enterprises and customers added more connectivity for their hybrid offerings on Platform Digital, enabling them to upgrade their IT environments to a consumption-based IT infrastructure and managed services model. A Global 2000 leader in material sciences for industrial and scientific applications needed a data center provider with global interconnectivity and access to cloud providers in Seoul and shows Platform Digital to enable them to deploy and interconnect a private AI node. A Global 50 financial services company is migrating from an on-prem data center to Platform Digital and utilizing service fabric to improve sustainability, resiliency, scalability, security and carrier diversity. And a leading Global 2000 consumer goods manufacturer grew their presence on Platform Digital by adding two additional metros to support their IT workloads and cloud connectivity. Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. We have over 100 megawatts available for lease today in Loudon County and nearly 200 megawatts of capacity available for lease in Manassas. We are currently in active negotiations with a handful of customers for substantially all of our capacity in Loudon, though in contrast with the rumor mill, nothing has been finalized just yet. Beyond this capacity, we have another 900 megawatts of buildable capacity at DigitalDose, which we are cautiously optimistic will gain access to power in 2026 and beyond. We also expect to benefit from the active and ongoing management of our existing 500-megawatt portfolio in this market over time. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the fourth quarter. We continue to be recognized for our strong ESG performance in the fourth quarter and in 2024. We placed second on Sustainability Magazine's List of top 10 sustainable data center providers. We improved to number eight on the US EPA's Green Power partnership National Top 100 for renewable energy use and we were named as a top rated regional performer in North America by a leading global ESG ratings provider. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn over the call to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $110 million of new leases in the fourth quarter with $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, led by strength in the EMEA region. Interconnection bookings rebounded sequentially to $13.5 million, and we finished the year with 220,000 cross-connects despite continued network grooming. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed by [Technical Difficulty] commenced leases increased to a new record of $495 million at quarter end as new leasing outran $84 million of commencements in the quarter. We expect commencements to pick up as nearly two-thirds of the backlog is scheduled to commence in 2024, with the majority coming in the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter, we signed $210 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 8.2% on a cash basis, setting the high watermark for the year, though this was skewed over 100 basis points by shorter-term renewals in one market. For the full year, cash renewal spreads were up 6.8% and or 5.5% when normalizing for short-term extensions. Re-leasing spreads were positive across product, market and region in 2023, setting the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain firm and renewal spreads to remain positive, principally reflecting the near 80% weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter Core FFO of $1.63 per share and $6.59 for the full year within our guidance range. Earnings reflect the continued strong organic results, together with the impact from capital recycling, deleveraging and increased development spending throughout the year, as discussed on our third quarter call. Total revenue was up 11% year-over-year despite the incremental drag from the stabilized JV contributions and the noncore asset sales that closed in the third quarter. As we also noted last quarter, year-over-year revenue growth continued to be positively impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Energy dynamics proved to be a tailwind for our results in 2023. Assuming more normalized energy prices, we expect the related upside impact will moderate in 2024. Interconnection revenue was $106 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued unit growth and price increases. Moving over to the expense side. Utilities were 5% lower sequentially, reflecting the joint venture contributions over the summer, combined with seasonal impacts. Operating expenses increased due to seasonally elevated maintenance spending in the fourth quarter. Property taxes fell back toward normalized levels, reflecting the onetime property tax reassessment experienced in the third quarter. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the fourth quarter with a year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.9% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, results were also strong with cash NOI growth of 7.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis. Focusing on investment activity, we spent $3 billion on development in 2023, net of the proceeds received from our first development JV closing in November, and we delivered over 230 megawatts of new capacity across the globe. Turning to the balance sheet. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet since the end of the third quarter. With the sale of $1.2 billion of equity through the ATM at an average price of $133 per share, achieving our goal of lowering our leverage towards six times and finishing the year at 6.2 times. After year-end, we made further progress on the balance sheet with the closings of the Cyxtera transactions in the first phase of the Blackstone joint venture. GI Partners also exercised their option and closed on an additional 15% share of the two stabilized assets in our Chicago JV, bringing their stake to 80%. Pro forma for these activities, year-end leverage was 5.8 times. S&P recognized our progress in December and upgraded our outlook. Early in the fourth quarter, we paid off our $100 million Swiss Franc notes and closed the Realty Income joint venture, which generated $200 million of gross proceeds and reduced our CapEx commitments for the remainder of the project's development. We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with over $1.6 billion at year-end as we continue to prioritize liquidity and to support ongoing development spend. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 85% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that, our maturities remained well laddered through 2032. I'll finish with guidance. We are providing an initial Core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75. Reflecting the underlying growth of our business, offset by the impact of the deleveraging activities we completed or announced in 2023. As a reminder, over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects deliver. For 2024, we expect total revenue to grow by 2% and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 4% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. When normalizing this growth for the impact of capital recycling, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA are anticipated to grow by 7% and 10%, respectively, in 2024. We expect both our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads, along with same capital cash NOI growth to remain solidly positive. While occupancy is expected to improve steadily throughout the year as our record backlog commences and available capacity is leased. Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are expected to increase by 4% to 6% in 2024. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow by 2% to 3%, and given the tougher base year comparison versus last year's 7.5% growth and our expectations for FX and energy pricing in our colo segment. Total portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 100 to 200 basis points by the end of 2024 while total occupancy slipped to 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was predominantly driven by the delivery of substantial vacant development capacity that is slated to be occupied as same capital occupancy was stable quarter-over-quarter. We also expect to continue to recycle capital in 2024 with noncore asset sales and stabilized joint ventures raising $1.25 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Nearly one-third of this activity was completed in early January, while the balance should close throughout this year. Along with cash on hand and retained cash flow from operations, this capital is expected to be the primary funding source of our $2 billion to $2.5 billion net development CapEx program for 2024. To be clear, this approximately 25% reduction in development spend year-over-year represents Digital Realty's share of CapEx spend. The total development spend on these projects will be higher when including our partners pro rata share. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, in terms of, you were just describing the shift in same capital cash NOI growth from 7.5% to 2% to 3%. Can you unpack more of what you're seeing in '24 relative to '23? And how pricing kind of comes into the expectation for 2024?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Mike. So we'll try to weave that into one answer, so trying to stick to one question and get through the whole roster and maybe loop back. But I'll turn it to Matt to give you the bridge on a same-store basis.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Mike. So a couple of things that I would call out. First, in terms of, call it, the re-leasing spreads and their influence. First off, I think as we know, not all of our leases roll within the calendar year. So we roll roughly, call it, 20% to 25% of our portfolio in the year. And of that, 80% is in the 0 to 1 megawatt category, which is influenced by inflation or CPI, which we've seen come down over the course of the year, and therefore, part of the mark-to-market pricing within that segment. Then when you flip over the other 20%, which is in the greater than a megawatt category, we're seeing in '24 expiring rents that are higher than what we saw in '23, which creates a tougher comp in terms of the role despite strong market rents and overall growth. So that's on the spread side. The other part that I would call out is in '23, we saw benefits or tailwinds from FX as well as power pricing, which we're not seeing in '24, and lastly, in '24, we are expecting higher property tax expense. So putting all those together kind of is why you're seeing sort of the still positive, but not as positive as '23 results for same-store portfolio in '24.
Operator: The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe first, last night, we heard from one of your peers that the higher power prices in 2023 have created some sort of lagged crowding out effect in terms of budgeting and decision-making. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that, kind of something like maybe you're hearing or seeing some of that in your colo business, but it wasn't crystal. And then just as a follow-up, if I could. Matt, can you break down that $1.25 billion in kind of -- or the rest of the $1.25 billion that's closing this year? What is -- how is it all breakdown and the cadence of that? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Dave. This is Andy. I don't think we're experiencing the same exact dynamics on power as what you heard last night, quite honestly. I think what Matt, you just heard from Matt is the comps on a growth basis in the same-store pool are not as -- we benefited in '23 from power, and we're not going to have that kind of benefit repeat itself in 2024, assume it and I think this all is going to be washed out once we say by the '25, assuming we don't go back into this another, call it, very volatile power environment. So it's almost one-time in nature. I don't I don't believe that is impacted buyer behavior. And I don't believe we're suffering or benefiting depending on the period to the same degree of what was described. Maybe that's due to the market mix, overall business mix in our hedging strategy, which are not identical. I can tell you from a business standpoint, and you can see this in the results, we capped off a very strong year, let's call it, focused on the enterprise colo connectivity segment. Record overall new logos, North of 500. Strong quarters of new signings. You had a very strong interconnection quarter, both in new signings and also a flow through the P&L, which has been accelerating and net absorption certainly in that category that was strong in the fourth quarter and through the year. So I don't see the power flowing through. I know we're trying to get to one question per se and then rotate back well moved there, Greg, why don't you just touch on the components of the $1.25 billion in our guidance for data?
Gregory Wright: Sure. Thanks, Andy. Hey, David. How are you? Look, I think, again, there's two components there. It's really -- it's a stabilized joint ventures, and it's our sort of noncore asset disposition. And when you look at that, call it, $1.250 billion or a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, call it, I think it's important to note that over one-third of that has already been announced and is either closed or is pending close. So obviously we feel good about that number. And it's clearly much less in the context of last year.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Andy, we're in the middle of one of the strongest hyperscale demand environment that we've seen in recent history. I was wondering, can you talk about the go-forward demand pipeline and the relative strength of the pipeline versus last year. And as part of that, can you talk about the opportunity set for the pricing for new leasing, specifically, is -- do you see there being a governor on pricing given the supply-demand backdrop that we're seeing? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So I would say on a year-over-year basis, we are -- the dynamics has changed tremendously on so many fronts. Overall, the pipeline for hyperscale has continued to grow to new heights. I view the AI demand is a new wave of demand, incremental call enterprise, hybrid IT is certainly an incremental to hyperscale cloud compute. And this has all played out in the backdrop of tightening supply-demand dynamics that has called -- as we've described, over several quarters now, moved the pendulum on pricing more and more in the favor of providers like Digital Realty. Is there a ceiling? Listen, I think we've seen rates run tremendously. We just, this quarter, reported in that segment North of a megawatt, call it, our highest GAAP rate ever at $145 million we are continuing to see -- it's almost like some of these customers who are often on calendar fiscal years, just like Digital Realty, wrapped up one budget cycle and got a budget refresh and came back in 2024 with the incremental appetite for demand. These customers are seeking some of the same things. When we intersect with that demand is in our large-scale hyperscale campuses that are in our major markets and especially with larger capacity blocks that have contiguous capacity or the most sought after. And those rates continue to run in terms of what we've signed and where we put up quotes and I think we're very well positioned. If you look at our footprint, you can see a lot of it on development capacity life cycle, which is just a portion of what we activate in Northern Virginia right now, but some of the other major markets as well to capture a good -- more than our fair share of that demand. And lastly, I think there's a -- I think there's a broader acknowledgment whether it is hyperscale compute or AI workloads that these customers our time to market, many of them are trying to land precious GPUs that are just enormous business opportunities for these customers. And our rent even historically, but certainly today, plays a very small economic piece in that equation relative to their ability to launch their services and be first to market many times.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Yeah, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where we might end the year kind of in terms of leverage, where do some of the outcomes there and the role of ATM issuances, equity issuance is as part of that? Thanks.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So look, I think, you've seen the results of the work we've done in '23, where we talked about getting down to the six times area. And the execution that not only Greg's team on did with the transaction that we closed, but also sales on the ATM that we did early in the year and then more recently, getting to that point and actually breaking through that when you look at it on a pro forma basis, we're at 5.8 times. And we -- and so we continue to want to get down towards that 5.5 times area, which is the same messaging we've had since the start of '23, and we've executed on that path. And we think that the plan that we've laid out here in terms of our guidance will enable us to get us there where we're continuing some level of capital recycling given the broad and diverse sources of capital that we've got available to us. And that's the plan we're going to continue to go down in terms of marching towards that 5.5% area, which is a smaller task than what we did in '23.
Operator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. I'll stick to one. Andy, you mentioned demand for large blocks of capacity in several key markets such as Nova and Silicon Valley among some of the other major markets. At an aggregate level, I think, overall supply remains very low in some of these markets. But specifically for you, has lower available capacity been a gating factor for your greater than one megawatt signings performance?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Irvin. We certainly have a really great opportunity to intersect with these large capacity block needs of our customers, be it for AI or hyperscale. It is, I would say, maybe potentially unparalleled in what we can offer in Northern Virginia today in terms of available capacity in a market that's shut down in terms of new power until 2026. But the list goes beyond that, whether it's Dallas, Santa Clara, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Seoul or parts of Japan, not to mention some of our joint ventures in Latin America and South Africa. We've taken our approach quite honestly where many of these capacity blocks for ourselves and many providers were at the early stages of development. They were at land, went pad-ready. Shelves are coming online and just the first suites were coming online. And throughout 2023, we took a more, call it, approach whereby we didn't go run after the first deal out of the gate for some of these customers because we knew we weren't losing a revenue opportunity because the capacity wasn't even being able to be moved into or at least commenced. And in hindsight, that's proven fortuitous because as the year has played out, and certainly as 2024 has gotten off out of those gates, we've continue to see what we're offering is becoming much more and more attractive to an even broader and diverse set of customers. So I don't think we'll be able to be late too long in 2024. We obviously now have some capacity blocks that are actually live and we can commence rent on. So we do have some urgency to get that going. But I think our patients and prudence here and approach allowed us to prove right. sometimes better to be lucky than smart. If I would have known Ashford would have run out of power years ago, I would have -- we wouldn't have sold all that capacity we had to release at the time. But this time, we -- the luck was our side.
Operator: The next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. Hey, Andy, on your comments, at least how I heard on a potentially very high ceiling for rental rates. As I kind of take that into consideration and look across the lease expiration table in the greater than one megawatt category it appears you guys have a pretty favorable mark-to-market rent opportunity over the next few years. Am I fair to make that assumption? Or is there a chance that some of your leases might have clauses that could limit how much you're able to participate in the upside?
Andrew Power: Thanks, David. So the -- I think you heard me loud and clear on where rates have come from and where they've gone and where they're likely to continue to move and some of these markets haven't even hit peak historical rates, if you look at the whole span of data center capacity. So I don't think we're at a rent bubble or near that necessarily and it's been on the back of real constraints and build costs that have inflated and issues. So they are -- I believe these rental moves are justified. I think you will continue to see the cash mark-to-markets flow through in our favor. We did call out in -- throughout last year and in the script for this quarter that we had some episodic short-term renewals inflated our cash mark-to-market, but we think being, call it, 4% to 6% in that category overall is pretty in our favor. And to your question on the bigger deals where you're going to have these potential roll-ups, yes, we do have subsections of our contracts that have clauses that are certainly in the favor of our customer. When the market was quite the opposite of what it was today and it was filling baking capacity, we certainly had to succumb to some of those clauses that our customers. But they all often are very narrowly defined in terms of fixed duration of renewal time period and other bells and whistles. And when a customer, which they often do wants to negotiate outside of that box that opens up the contract renegotiations. And we try to collaborate with our customers to come into a mutually agreeable outcome. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't think we'll be able to roll every one of those, call it, sub 100-plus megawatts directly up to the 140 or 150 or 160 or whatever we're going in the market. But I think we'll -- I do think there is going to be a positive mark-to-market in that category for some years to come.
Operator: The next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thanks. Andy, there's a lot of moving parts that are impacting the 2024 guidance that I think Matt mentioned 10% EBITDA growth normalized for the deleveraging activity I guess as you move past some of the headwinds creating dilution, and as you noted, it seems like pricing and mark-to-market tailwinds should be here for a while. What kind of growth do you think you can deliver beyond 2024 on the bottom line from a longer-term standpoint?
Andrew Power: Matt, do you want to start us off on that one?
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Yes. So a couple of things. So Ari, thanks as we did mention, on a normalized basis in '24 or a lot of -- for the transactional activity that hit in '23 and some -- and what we expect in '24. I do want to reiterate, we're looking at normalized growth at 7% on revenue and 10% on EBITDA as you noted. And so '24 is seeing the impact from the timing of those transactions and close where in '23, there in the second half of the year, and '24, we're expecting them, as Greg noted earlier, where we've already got a decent portion of that under contract, those are closed in the first part of '24. So creating some of that impacting on '24 bottom line. And we did all that at the same time, again, just as a reminder, that we're delevering over a turn. If you look through all that, what we would expect is that we look at it in sort of two buckets in terms of cost of growth algorithm. First one being, we would expect on our stabilized same-store pool to have seen growth in that 3% to 4% area. On top of that, looking at our development pipeline, the favorable pricing, better yields and as those start to deliver in '24 and '25, we would expect to see another 1% to 2% on top of that too. Together, that gets us to kind of the mid- to high single digits that we should expect to see in '25 and beyond.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank, your line is open.
Frank Louthan: Sorry about that. I heard from several of your peers and some equipment companies and so forth about some macro issues that they're seeing with elongated sales cycles and squeezing some IT budgets. You mentioned some cross-connect grooming you've seen. Are you seeing anything like that from your enterprise business or elsewhere from any sort of macro pressures in part of your business?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Frank. I want to have Colin tackle what we're seeing in the, I'll call it, enterprise sales cycle.
Colin McLean: Yes. Thanks, Frank, for the question. Appreciate it. As Andy highlighted, the pipeline across the board is robust and that's both above and below one megawatt. And we certainly see our customers engaging consistently with this related to growing their platform globally. So that $53 million back-to-back strong quarters, I think the testimony to how we're supporting their needs pretty well. In fact, 1,000-plus companies landed with us in Q4, which, again, I think it's a strong growth testimony. In terms of time to close overall, I think we had highlighted previously a couple of hiccups, maybe early in the year, Q1, Q2 in terms of expanded time to close. We haven't really seen that, honestly to date. It's really flattened out. And so I really think it's a by-product of us engaging showing up differently. The new logo engagement, I think, overall has been particularly strong we did 134 new logos last quarter. So on the enterprise side, on the whole, I think we've seen pretty strong interest pipeline and then execution on the whole.
Christopher Sharp: Right. And one thing I'd like to spread a bit more detail on the equipment. With the offering that we launched last year around the high-density colo in anticipation of a lot of private AI type of deployment coming to market. A part of that program is not only that the 32 markets and three regions being able to do 70 kilowatts a rack. What we're really doing is pre-buying a lot of the technology to support that power density to allow our customers to deploy in a very timely fashion, but also expedites a bit of that higher end kind of new AI capability coming to market.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Financial question. So with leverage now back under six turns on a pro forma basis, how do you now think about the dividend and potential forward growth relative to incremental investments in the business and/or potential M&A? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Matt. So multi fast, I'm going to hand to Matt to explain how the dividend call works in terms of taxable income and distribution and why the dividend is set where it is set. Because I think the topic of M&A, I mean, you could look at the linear press releases or just recent events we've done in just the last several months through resolving our relationship to Cyxtera to growing our platform in India with the addition of Reliance Jio. We also just had a big announcement with the leader in the GPU space recently to disposing of some noncore assets, JVs stabilized assets and adding strategically to our landholdings across key markets. So we've been incredibly active on pieces of that. I think the broader context of M&A, I think the most critical puzzle pieces have kind of been picked over. And most of our activity from here are really, call it, extending our strategic advantages and bolt-on in nature to what we have. I don't see any like key gems out there that would be really additive to our global platform at peak. Matt, why don't you hit on the dividend, Matt, if you want that.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. I mean, similar to what we've talked about in '23, I mean, there's two major components in terms of the dividend and related to taxable income. There's our ordinary income that we get from operations, and then there's also the income that's generated from transactions and the related gains that we have from executing those, which we had a sizable amount of the '23. Now we're looking at less transaction size in '24, but as you saw in the guidance, you talked about $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So we expect that there'll still be related income from that, and we still have cash flow even after dividend and we think we'll be able to support where we are. And ultimately, our goal and target is that we grow the dividend as AFFO and as our cash flow grows, which we expect we'll start to see over the long term related to the growth algorithm that I talked about earlier.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Good evening. I wanted to just talk about the mix between the 0 to 1 and the greater than 1 megawatt. It looks like you had almost 50% coming from 0 to 1 plus interconnection. That's been gradually rising over the last few quarters. So how do we think about this going forward? Your focus on -- should that mix trend higher than the 50-50? Or is it going to be jumping around as it has done in the past? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Simon. So one of our top, top, top priorities is to continue to focus on delivering acceleration in that 0 to 1 megawatt interconnection cohort, enterprise connectivity in order to customers, the most granular and the largest volume of over 5,000 customers as well as our new logos. So by and large, the more quarters where that represents a larger and increasing piece of the mix and continues to accelerate like it has done recently, that is filling our existing baking capacity. It's wins at our highest rates, it's multi-market, multi-geo enterprise customers and is the place where we believe we can deliver the greatest value to our customers, most consistently and long-term and durable there will be episodic quarters where that will be a lower percentage. But that's likely enough because we've filtered our execution. That's likely because we also are supporting some of the largest hyperscalers around the world. We're bringing our capacity in over half of our 50-plus metropolitan areas, places where we can really add value to those customers where they've already landed their compute or AZs where they want to grow at our continuous capacity with operational excellence, where we have that long runway of growth that they can get from no one else. And those are we quarters where we saw larger lumpier deals, obviously, into those capacity blocks. So we think both of these are large addressable markets where we have a distinct value proposition and a competitive moat that we'll continue to focus on executing each and every day.
Operator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on AI. It seems most of the demand in the early stages is expected to come from training versus inferencing. But we heard from Microsoft on their earnings call, and they said that most of the AI strength that they were seeing for Azure was, in fact, from inferencing workloads. Are you seeing the same as it relates to sort of the demand patterns from your customers? And then maybe any way to quantify how much AI has contributed or the size of the opportunity. Thanks.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Erik. Let me just touch on this a little bit and then hand it to Chris to walk you through chapter and verse. I look at where our heritage is as a company, this AI opportunity is tremendously in our wheelhouse. We came with this from a hyperscale piece of the business and build the colo connectivity capabilities organically and inorganically. We are often taking larger halls that are at higher power densities and using our engineering prowess to work for enterprise customers and pushing their boundaries on power densities. I can tell you, AI workloads were at digital before I joined over nine years ago. We've done retrofits on existing deployments just to fit up for customers needing AI just this year. At the end of last year, I was to one of our Paris facilities. We're one of our partner customers have fitted out of liquid cooling for a multinational financial services company, live environments which meant that they had to get going on that years ago to be live at the end of last year. So this is right in our wheelhouse, and we've been winning in that category in the last year in the, call it, several hundred kilowatt domain to the 30-plus megawatt piece of this, and you've seen some testimonials on that. Chris, why don't you give a little bit of color as to some of the verticals we've been winning and where do you see this going as well?
Christopher Sharp: Yes. It's a great question and appreciate it, Eric. I think there's a couple of dynamics that you touched on. The training to inference. That's something that we've been watching for some time. And we're selective with some of the training environments just because we're looking for a long-term durable workload being deployed into the asset. And so a lot of the customers we see today are actually doing training or inference inside of their training just because of sheer availability of the GPUs and time to market, but we definitely see the long tail of that value happening in inference and then also kind of another section of private AI and so we're seeing customers come to market with these types of requirements where Andy alluded to this at a high level coming from our heritage of scale and then being able to evolve and support a colo type of capability, if you will, allows us to support a higher power density need with our versatile designs. And so being highly focused on that with a lot of the hyperscale customers and being foundational for their cloud services has been top of mind. And then I think another element that may be overlooked is a lot of this inference is embedded in a lot of our top customers today as capabilities. So when you read about, and I think you referenced Microsoft and the work that they've been doing with CoPilot, a lot of that AI is embedded in enhancing their current product capabilities. And so we're constantly watching how that evolves, but being proximate to the AI being proximate to the existing infrastructure and workload is absolutely something that we're very excited about because that inference benefits from the data oceans that exist within Digital Realty, their current infrastructure and how all that culminates together. So it's something you'll see play out over this year. I think we just had a really good case study with KakaoBank where that's highlighted private AI deployment where they're able to generate and do a little bit of R&D around new product offerings for a financial vertical. So these are the things you're going to see play out in 2024 that we're very excited about.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the assumptions you're making about the broader lease environment and the pricing environment to get to the 4% to 6% range for cash renewal spreads. Are you just basically taking current prices as a given? Or are you kind of assuming further increases or other changes? And can you share anything about how the expected renewal spreads look for zero to one versus greater one categories? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Sure, Matt. Why don't you take that?
Matthew Mercier: Yes. So thanks, Nick. With regard to -- I think I'll go back to some of the comments I had, I think, from one of the first questions. So with regard to 0 to 1 megawatt, that's on both the escalation and renewals tend to be influenced by inflation where CPI is coming in. So that's going to be spread across the leases that are rolling, whether they be in North America versus EMEA. And those have come down since last year and more in that 3% to 4%, 3% to 4% range. And now on the greater than 1 megawatt, as I mentioned, we're assuming, call it, current market pricing and that's more heavily influenced by where the expiring rates are versus that. So that's within the greater than the megawatt segment, which we're assuming still positive and resulting in the 4% to 6% total that we've guided towards.
Operator: The next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Hey, thanks. Just a quick question. I think in the guidance for development capital, this is the first time it's actually been guided to net of capital contributions. Can you maybe talk about what your total capital outlay will look like in '24 versus '23 on a like-for-like basis? Thanks.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Yes. So I mean, obviously, the net is given the development joint ventures that we've established over '23 and that will also close that are under contract in throughout '24 in particular with the one we announced with Blackstone. Phase I is already closed and Phase II is later in the year. And if you're looking at it from a gross basis in comparison, we're expecting in '24 on a gross basis, we'd be spending north of $3.5 billion in terms of total CapEx and it would be -- which would be roughly 15% higher than the amount that we spent in 2023.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Betsy. Digital Realty capped off a transformative 2023 with a strong fourth quarter that was highlighted by three key elements. First, we sourced over $12 billion of new capital and commitments from an array of hyperscale private capital partners, deleveraging our balance sheet and positioning the company for the future. Second, we posted another quarter of improving organic operating results with the best same-capital cash NOI growth in nearly a decade, and we are just on the cusp of the AI wave of demand. Third, we continue to grow our footprint and capacity around the world with record deliveries in 2023 to meet the accelerating needs of our growing customer base. These customers look to us to help enable their IT solutions, whether that is AI, cloud or even enterprises along their digital transformation journeys, our value proposition is resonating, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today with a special thank you to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keeps the digital world turning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And we'll aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. Leasing was strong across both our primary product category with record overall bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, and an acceleration in our greater than megawatt segment. Second, we saw a further continuation of the improvements in our fundamental metrics. Strong demand and tight supply remains supportive of pricing, and this is evident in our results. Same capital cash NOI growth was the best in more than a decade at 9.4%, while cash releasing spreads eclipsed 7% in the quarter, which caused us to raise full year guidance for these metrics for the second consecutive quarter. Third, we continue to diversify and bolster our balance sheet with almost $4 billion of capital raised to date, including two hyperscale core joint ventures announced in July, and another almost $200 million of noncore sales, bringing total dispositions to $2.5 billion year-to-date. The capital that we've raised this year has enabled us to increase our liquidity and delever while expanding our investment in development that we expect to generate double-digit unlevered returns. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The third quarter marks nine months since being appointed to my current role as CEO, and this marks the fourth official earnings call. While there has been about as much volatility in a single year as I can recall from my 20-plus-year career, it has been a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to visit and work with and to watch my Digital Realty colleagues across the globe execute on behalf of our customers and stakeholders during these extraordinary times. At the outset of this year, I highlighted three key priorities for our company. While we've got two months left in the year, I am very excited about our progress to date and look forward to finishing strong. As you recall, our key strategic priorities are: first, to demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition, which means that we are adding connectivity-rich solutions and scale capacity to drive our global meeting place strategy. We are executing this through the addition and launch of new on-ramps, the expansion of our colo capacity end markets and also by providing visibility into longer-term hyperscale capacity in our largest core markets. We are making strides and our customers are recognizing this by landing and expanding their IT infrastructure within our facilities. For example, over the past few months, we've added on ramps from a number of the largest cloud service providers, including AWS and Oracle. Our second priority is to integrate and innovate. For the first time, we created an Americas region and formally organized the company into three regions to improve overall management and accountability. In addition, we moved global operations under an experienced Digital Realty leader, bringing the standardization and consistency across our global platform. We also reorganized all things technology under our CTO organization. Consistent with our aim to bring innovation to our customers end market, in the third quarter, we announced the launch of our first Nvidia DGX H100-Ready data center in Osaka, Japan. We also rolled out our new high-density colo offering across 28 global metros to support high-performance compute infrastructure, addressing data and AI-related growth challenges. We are also partnering with other leaders around the world to enhance our open platform. In this vein, we recently added BT and Lumin to our Service Fabric platform, which connects our data centers globally extending the reach of our customers and partners. And we made some nice progress on the sustainability front in the quarter, which I'll circle back to in a moment. Finally, we set out to bolster and diversify our capital sources. And to date, we've reduced leverage by 0.8 turns of EBITDA from the 1Q peak and increased liquidity to $3-plus billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand. We executed on our funding plan that included the completion of two stabilized hyperscale JVs this quarter, tapping into some of the deepest pools of private capital, and we remain confident in our ability to add to this progress with development JVs in the near future. If we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we expect that this will translate into better long-term sustainable growth for our customers, team members and in turn, our shareholders. Digital Realty continues to make progress in the third quarter with further improvement in our operational results highlighted by 9-plus percent same capital cash NOI growth strong leasing results with record 0 to 1-megawatt signings, the highest greater than megawatt pricing since 2016, record leasing in APAC with broad strength in the Americas, and record interconnection revenue with the strongest growth since 2018. The momentum across the data center infrastructure landscape is strong. Demand for our data center capacity remains broad-based both geographically and by product, as reflected in our leasing results. New supply in our top markets remains constrained and is likely to remain so due to limited availability of power, growing supply chain challenges and tighter financial conditions. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last several years, including cloud, digital transformation and hybrid IT remain largely intact, AI applications have added a meaningful new layer, which is just beginning to materialize in our leasing results this quarter, and we are ready for it. When Chris first started speaking publicly about AI and high-performance compute at our Investor Day in December 2017, we are already in the process of architecting and designing our facilities to support the evolving densities and our most innovative and leading-edge customers. While there are multiple high-density workloads running in our portfolio since at least that time, in the last quarter alone we were able to accommodate a handful of high-density compute deployments from one of our service provider customers in a 10-plus year old data center in one of our smallest markets. And we are currently supporting one of our customers' AI infrastructure deployments that will incorporate 32,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This doesn't mean that Digital Realty will be chasing large AI deployments far and wide, as we will continue to assess the longer-term opportunity set of remotely located single-tenant non-differentiated data centers. But it does mean that there has been an increase in demand for our highly connected campuses in core markets. We're being thoughtful in how we approach these opportunities. As we consider leasing our capacity, I expect that we will seek to support our long-term engaged partners that have become embedded within our meeting place community that value our strategic locations and the connectivity across platform digital. At the same time, in certain markets, we will selectively support customers that have a differentiated product offering as we've always been at the forefront supporting leading technology companies as they push their infrastructure capabilities. Let's move to our third quarter results. This quarter continued to demonstrate the fundamental recovery that we've been highlighting throughout this year. Leasing activity was strong and broad-based across product types and reflected the pricing recovery we have seen throughout our portfolio. While we routinely lead with our headline leasing figures, it is important to point out the record posted in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment in the quarter, which increased by more than 9% sequentially and nearly 28% over the prior year period. Total new leasing during the quarter was $152 million with record 0-1 megawatt signings representing just over one-third of total signings. Greater than a megawatt science moved higher for the second consecutive quarter led by the Americas region, while our team also put up a record quarter in APAC. Pricing remains firm with notable highs achieved across the greater than one megawatt segment with strength in the 0-1 megawatt category. Growing recognition of our value proposition, including our comprehensive product offering, along with strong demand trends and reduced availability are supportive of pricing and are helping to drive better core growth and higher returns on investment. In the third quarter, we saw re-leasing spreads climbed to 7.4% on a cash basis contributing to the strongest same capital cash NOI growth in more than a decade. During the third quarter, churn remained low at 1.1% and we added 117 new customers extending our string of 100-plus new logos per quarter to 3.5 years. Another strong validation of the value that enterprise customers around the world recognize in platform digital. Our focus on deepening the value of our campus has resulted in enhanced cloud access for Digital Realty. Recently, 4 out of 5 top B2B cloud providers complete multisite on-ramp and edge expansions to serve data-intensive workloads on two continents via Platform Digital. In addition, AWS announced a direct connect location in Seoul, the first carrier-neutral facility in the market, while we announced the Oracle FastConnect availability in Madrid to their EU sovereign cloud. Other key wins during the quarter included a speech-to-text AI provider completed their second HD colo deployment in six months on Platform Digital, multiple new logos in the health care vertical in the quarter, two Global 2000 health care companies deployed on Platform Digital, one supportive data-intensive AI workloads and the other implementing a 2-site data compliance solution. An international Tier 1 telco added a multi-metro expansion across two continents of Platform Digital to support their retail enterprise customers. A Global 2000 Bank is implementing multi-site, multi-region network hub deployments now totaling 15 metros and a Global 2000 insurance company is expanding a distributed data hub on Platform Digital to support M&A data compliance. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. More than a year since we learned the power constraints in this market, we have continued to work constructively with the power providers to confirm the commitments that we made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. As discussed on our last earnings call, we identified almost 100 megawatts of development capacity in Loudoun County that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 56 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on another 40 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn-focused capacity, we continue to advance the ball on our 192-megawatt development in site in Manassas, and we are now officially underway and will soon be patent ready to support construction of the first of two buildings on the site in early 2024. We are very excited to be able to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. Digital Realty investment team has already had an extraordinarily productive year, including the $2.3 billion of JVs and noncore asset sales completed in the third quarter. Within the noncore bucket, we sold two facilities during the quarter, including one in the U.K. and the other in Chantilly, Virginia, totaling almost $200 million, including the $150 million noncore disposition in Texas that we completed last quarter, we're tracking well towards our $500 million target for the noncore asset sales in 2023. We closed two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in July with the contribution of two assets in Chicago and three in Northern Virginia, raising $2.1 billion of proceeds. We've also made substantial progress on the third bucket of our funding plan, the development joint ventures, and we expect to have more to say about this in the fourth quarter. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the third quarter. We've continued to make progress on our water conservation initiatives, including a water saving initiative for cooling towers and our SIN10 facility in Singapore. The project won the inaugural Green Innovations, Water Solutions Award at the Singapore Environment Council's Environmental Achievement Awards. The project is expected to save over 1.2 million liters of water each month and improved water usage efficiency by 15%. The solution has now been evaluated for wider rollout across our portfolio. In the third quarter, we also announced that we are ranked in the top 10 on a U.S. EPA's National Top 100 list of the large green power users from the Green Power partnership. The company also ranked seventh on the EPA's list across technology and telecommunication providers. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed a total of $152 million of new leases in the third quarter with broad-based strength across each of our two primary product groups and geographic strength in the Americas and APAC. We leased a record $54 million in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 35% of total bookings. This product segment remains a consistent and steady source of growth as we continue to execute on our global meeting place strategy. Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million as we added another 2,000 cross connects in the quarter, finishing with 218,000 total cross-connects, greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $97 million in the quarter with outsized contributions from Portland and Hong Kong. This was our highest greater than a megawatt signings quarter since we discussed sharpening the lens with regard to capital allocation decisions one year ago. Our greater focus and increased threshold have resulted in higher average returns in the greater than a megawatt category as implied by the growing expected stabilized returns in the Americas that we present on the development life cycle schedule in our supplemental. Pricing continues to improve across most markets globally with outsized pricing power experienced within the greater than the megawatt segment, which saw pricing on signed leases at the highest level since the first half of 2016. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases increased to a new record of $482 million at quarter end. As commencements of $110 million were more than offset by elevated new leasing volume in the quarter. We expect nearly 15% of the backlog to commence in the fourth quarter with a little over 50% commencing throughout 2024. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter ticked up to 12 months, driven by new development and build-outs to support larger scale leases. During the third quarter, we signed $156 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 7.4% on a cash basis, the strongest re-leasing spreads achieved since 2015. While renewal pricing was strong across product segments and across our three regions, the overall result was upwardly skewed by a single transaction within our other category. Excluding this outlier, renewal, releasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 4.5% on a cash basis and 6.4% on a GAAP basis. We feel that this is a more representative picture of the renewal spreads that we are seeing throughout the portfolio, which is consistent with the broad-based improvement we've seen throughout this year. With renewal rates trending higher over the first 9 months of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to reflect the success year-to-date and today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued their steady climb with 4.4% growth on a cash basis in the third quarter on $125 million of volume. Greater than a megawatt renewals continued to post strong results, with cash renewals higher by 5.6%, albeit on lighter volume of $19 million in the third quarter. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.62 per share, broadly consistent with consensus expectations, but down $0.06 per share versus the second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the asset sales and the equity raised in the quarter and the redeployment of capital into accelerated and increased development. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.60 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the third quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially despite the impact of the more than $2 billion of asset sales completed early in the quarter as the benefits of improved pricing are starting to take hold. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth also continues to be impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to customers. Excluding the impact of utility and other reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year. Interconnection revenue of $107 million marked another quarterly record and was 12% higher than the year ago period. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 11% year-over-year, the highest interconnection growth since 2018 and reflects the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Quarter-over-quarter interconnection revenue was up almost 3% and as 2,000 new cross connects were added, increasing the total global installed base to 218,000. Moving over to the expense side, utilities were seasonally high given the warmer summer months and off an already elevated 2023 base. Rental property operating expenses remained essentially flat for the second consecutive quarter, partly reflecting the benefit of the removal of expenses related to the dispositions and joint ventures. However, on the noncontrollable expense front, property taxes spiked higher quarter-over-quarter to $72 million, driven by an elevated reassessment on some of our properties in Chicago. While these expenses will be largely passed on to our underlying customers, it will also be disputed over the coming years. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. One nonrecurring item worth noting in the quarter was the $113 million noncash impairment charge related to the lower value of our holdings in digital core REIT stock. The Singapore REIT IPO-ed in December 2021 at $0.88 per share, but was valued at $0.53 per share at the end of September, driving the noncash adjustment in our carrying value of the investment. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the third quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.4% but moderating by 1.5% sequentially due to the expected increase in utility bleed during the seasonally warmer months. Even on a constant currency basis, year-over-year cash NOI growth was strong at 6.6%. These results demonstrate the strongest period of organic growth in our same capital pool since 2014, and extends the turning fundamentals that we have been highlighting throughout this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet during the third quarter, driven by the success that we've had on our funding plan. This progress continues today, and as a result, we have raised our full year capital raising target for the second consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, we generated over $2.6 billion proceeds from JV closings, noncore asset sales and settlement of the equity forward. Roughly $1 billion was redeployed into our development program and a little over $500 million was used to repay higher cost USD borrowings on our credit facility. The remaining amount was kept in cash, earning interest at a rate in excess of the remaining borrowings under our credit facility. As a result, at quarter end, we had over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage fell to 6.3x net debt to EBITDA, down from 6.8x at the end of the second quarter and we are now within spitting distance of our near 6x leverage goal that we set out to achieve by year-end. Since the end of the quarter, we paid off CHF 100 million notes that matured in October and are confident in our ability to execute on additional asset sales and development joint ventures that are left in our upwardly revised funding plan. Moving to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are tightening our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 by $0.03 at the high and low ends to a new range of $6.58 to $6.62 per share, maintaining the midpoint of $6.60 per share. We are also tightening the range for full year adjusted EBITDA, affirming our full year guidance midpoint of $2.7 billion. Our full year revenue guidance range is being adjusted down by about 1% at the midpoint to a new range of $5.475 billion to $5.525 billion to reflect the impact of lower pass-through oriented tenant utility reimbursements given the moderation in electricity pricing in EMEA. Importantly, you'll recall that last quarter's core FFO per share guidance reflected a $0.05 to $0.07 per share impact from a bankrupt customer, including $0.02 that was realized in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we received all of the rent due from this customer across our portfolio, but we did incur a $0.01 write-off related to unpaid utility expenses and we expect that we could see up to another $0.02 of dilution related to this customer in the fourth quarter. In addition, we could see up to $0.01 of drag related to the carryforward of increased Chicago property tax assessment and $0.01 of drag related to the acceleration and increase of development spend as we capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing in front of us. With the continued improvement in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads of over 5%, up from 4%. Same capital cash NOI growth of 6% to 7%, representing a 200 basis points increase versus prior guidance and a reduction in year-end portfolio occupancy to between 83% and 84%, reflecting the delayed timing of the sale of a vacant nondata center asset in our portfolio. Given the successful leasing executed in the third quarter and the increased level of demand embedded within our pipeline, we are increasing our full year development spend guidance to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for 2023, representing the $400 million increase at the midpoint. Similarly, reflecting the continued execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital to $2.7 million to $3.2 billion, representing a $350 million increase at the midpoint, which is in line with the increase in our expected development spend for this year. While development has been an important driver of our growth for the last decade, in the short term, we are experiencing the headwinds from the sharp regime change in interest rates. This year, we've sold assets at 6 caps, and new borrowings on our liner at similar levels, whereas GAAP requires us to capitalize interest at our weighted average borrowing cost of less than 3%. In other words, increasing our development spend today, to capitalize on the growing opportunities we are seeing is dilutive to near-term earnings. These projects underway are completed at incrementally higher yields and the relatively low rate of capitalized interest burns off, we expect development completions will become increasingly accretive to core FFO per share. The good news is that fundamentals are helping to mitigate a portion of this dilution. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So I was interested in the development JVs that you alluded to. It sounds like there's something relatively imminent or maybe a couple of transactions. Can you point to the leverage reduction benefit that we should expect? And then related to that, give us a sense of the tailwinds and the headwinds that might affect core FFO per share for next year? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks Jon. Why don't you let Greg touch on his activity, it's been the tip of the spear on our development JVs, which unfortunately, we couldn't time not just one but two announcements like last quarter, but we haven't been idle and they're making some great progress. But Greg, why don't you give us a color?
Gregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Jon. Look, I think as Andy mentioned, look, last quarter, which we already announced, we were - we had our two stabilized joint ventures with TPG in Northern Virginia and obviously, GI and Chicago, which generated about $2.2 billion of proceeds. And we -- what we found in that process was demand was very robust to invest in data center assets in the private market, and the same holds true. We're continuing to see even more demand for stabilized assets. And I would go as far as to say it's even greater investor demand, when you look at the development potential development JVs. All I can tell you is we're working hard, and we hope we have something here in relatively short order to report. But right now, no more guidance than that. Other than that, demand remains strong, and we remain encouraged.
Operator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to follow-up a little bit on the second part of Jonathan's question, which was thinking about 2024. When we began 2023, we were looking at same-store cash NOI growth in the mid-3s and now it's pushing towards 7%. We're talking about a decade level improvements in interconnection and sub-megawatt leasing and greater than one megawatt leasing. Andy, you frequently talked over the year about how re-leasing and greater than one megawatt, you couldn't confidently say would be greater than zero and here we are. And then we've lapped the first year of the Teraco acquisition, which was supposed to be dilutive in year one, neutral in year two, accretive in year three. So outside of some accounting issues, it kind of feels like all the needles are pointing up into 2024. And before I get too excited, tell me where I'm wrong?
Andrew Power: Thanks, David. We appreciate the kudos there. Before I hand off to Matt to give you a 2024 guidance on this call, which I can tell you we weren't prepared for. I'll just chime in with just some color. So you're right, with the - the trend has been our friend on multiple fronts. And I think we tried to signal this at the outset of the year, and we were a bit of a show-me story, but we saw our value proposition resonating. We saw the pricing environment firming and continue that momentum, whether it's asking rates, ROIs on our development pipeline at cash mark-to-market in both product sets, and I would say that environment is continuing. But before Matt take the air out of the balloon with no early guidance, I mean there are obviously headwinds that Matt can talk to that we're still working through. But Matt, why don't you give some of your thoughts?
Matthew Mercier: Yes, sure. Thanks, David. I mean I think we - and we kind of talked about this a little bit towards the end of my prepared remarks, but I think, as we've been - one, we've been pretty clear about a desire to deleverage, which we've made substantial progress on. We started the year close to $7 billion, we're at $6.3 billion. We're making progress on that like, I stated at the start of the year. And we're doing that through level of capital recycling asset sales that are going to have an impact not only on this year, but we'll have some follow-through into next year. And we're doing it at a time also where we're looking to take advantage of what we see is a great opportunity in the market, where supply-demand fundamentals are about as strong as they've been. And we see opportunities to deploy capital, but that capital is coming at a higher cost today than it was. And therefore, it's dilutive near term, until that capacity comes online. And we think it's the prudent thing to do, but that's part of the dynamic that we're dealing with.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Right. Thanks for taking my questions. First, could you help us think about the sources of funding? And really what I mean by that is you raised equity at $97 a share, but you didn't raise equity when your stock was at $130. Presumably, the cost of that equity would have been lower than selling assets at, call it, a 9% cap rate. Just wondering how you're thinking about the use of equity as you march towards that, call it, 5.5 times leverage target next year? And then I have a follow-up? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So Jordan's got us playing by new rules to make sure everyone get at least one question on the call. So, we've got one question, but we'll try to get you on the next round for your follow-up. I think our actions are speaking louder than our words hopefully here, whereby we had tremendous success in the first half of the year or dribbling into the month of July on both non-core dispose followed by major hyperscale stabilized assets. And the fact that we haven't moved forward with any additional equity issuance of common stock, I think this speaks to our conviction on the next leg of private capital raisings with the development joint venture or joint ventures being the next leg of the stool. So - and I think those are things that will - are strategic and different for our company in relative to prior experience. Where we're going to share the non-cash flow period of these projects that are large, massive capital-intensive and long-term projects and allow some of these great fundamentals we've seen flow through to the bottom line. That doesn't mean we're 100% averse to ever issuing equity at the right time in the right quorum at the right price. But I think we believe we've got some incremental milestones or wins to put on the board here that are in the not-so-distant future, before we be ready. And this is on the back of tremendous progress. We've taken the balance sheet down, what 0.8 turns of EBITDA, literally in two quarters worth of reporting. So - and so I'm pleased with the progress, and I would say that we have more good news to come. Before - one last thing. I want to hand over to Greg because you made a comment on the non-core dispos, just - I think that we should clarify what that really means to us.
Gregory Wright: Yes. Thanks, Andy. Hi Michael, Look, I don't think it's right to say a 9% - you're selling an asset at a 9% cap rate versus what your implied multiple is on your company. In our minds, from a capital allocation perspective, those are two very different things. One is the assets we sold, they're noncore assets, right? One's in Watford, ones in Chantilly. Anyhow what does that mean to us? I mean these are non-campus assets with limited connectivity, right? And when you look at Chantilly, Wilson Nova, it's neither of the major markets of Loudon and Manassas, right? And so when you look at these assets, they're older, they're stand-alone assets. Now this is a very, very small portion of our business. But we call these assets out. So I don't think we can sit here and assess a cap rate on one or two non-core assets versus selling equity in the business. These are assets that are not part of our core business going forward and non-strategic to us, that's a very different analysis. So, I would just caution folks to say, Hey, here's a couple of assets that were non-core that were signed as a nine, therefore, that's not the right cost of capital play or the right capital allocation, because I think it is.
Operator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Page 9 of your presentation you put out today, it feels like those new leasing bars, they just keep reaching to the sky. You think there's a sustainable pace of activity for Digital Realty and maybe even broadly, is it a sustainable pace for the industry as a whole? Or is there a risk maybe that the dirty word digestion phase starts to come back into our vocabulary again?
Andrew Power: Hi, thanks, David. So I mean, what's great about this quarter is not just the size of that bar, but just what really went into it. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we usually call it historically led off with the top line number, but I think it was even more important to start with a tremendous foundation. Less than a megawatt interconnection signing it was a granular of quantity of customers, broad-based across the regions, including interconnection was at a record. It was up dramatically, not just year-over-year, close to 28%, but 9% quarter-over-quarter and that is that flywheel success that we've been investing in and starting to see more and more harvesting the fruits of our labor. On the bigger portion of that, it was not one single deal, is our largest deal not even a third of the total signings. It was broad-based across the geos as well. And these are playing to a continuation of demand trends that have been here for a little while, but certainly not exhausted. When you look at the pace of how fast the cloud is growing, digital transformation, hybrid IT. You look at our new logo contribution largely enterprise base 117 from around the globe and artificial intelligence, which is something we've had a hand in supporting for many years in high-performance compute power densities. That is just starting to blossom in our numbers. And I think that is just an incremental tailwind of demand where it doesn't feel like the digestion period is anywhere near coming to the amount of capacity demands we're seeing for the industry overall.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for the questions. So I wanted to touch on kind of your outlook for renewal spreads, which have been pretty strong the last couple of quarters. So, if I look at your expiration schedule, it looks like your in-place rents really start to look even more attractive the further out you look. So maybe you can talk about kind of the near-term outlook. Is it going to be a little more subdued as you work through some of these higher in-place rents? And then maybe are there any of your larger footprint contracts that have any contractual terms that may limit your ability to push rents as high as you would like? Thank you.
Matthew Mercier: Sure. Thanks. So I think, first off, I think as a note, we feel pretty confident about the pricing environment right now and - that I think we demonstrated that with the continued increase in releasing spreads that we put into our guidance, where we said greater than 5%. And we've had - we called out some items this year that have been, we'll call it, slight outliers, but we'll - we still see a strong pricing environment that were. And we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter where, we expect positive renewal spreads across all of our product types. I think going into next year, again, not giving guidance, what I would say is come back to the environment that we're in. I mean, there's nothing that suggests that pricing won't continue to be robust and strong across all of our major markets, where things might be different. Again, that you were alluding to is the basis against which those strong pricings are compared against. We are not seeing the same, I still expect that we'll have positive renewal spreads next year, but we'll be able to provide more granularity in terms of the level that, that is once we give guidance next quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So when you guys are having conversations with a customer that's primarily looking at an AI deal when you win an AI deal, what is it that they're coming to you for versus maybe some of the less expensive campuses kind of the middle of nowhere that we've heard about and that sort of thing. So how are you winning in AI? And what is it they're looking to get from digital versus some of your peers or some of the private players?
Andrew Power: Hi, thanks Frank. I'm going to toss just a column in a second. But I just - there's many shapes and forms of AI, and I reiterate, this is still early innings of what's going to be a vast build-out of required infrastructure. So our intersection of supporting AI is called in the single megawatt or two for enterprise adjacent to the existing workloads expansion into multiple - many, many megawatts of contiguous capacity and everything in between. And we're in a world right now where it's about large language model training, obviously, the inference - the dawn of inference and the implications will hopefully point to incremental location latency-sensitive needs. The private consumption of AI or the public consumption - consumer consumption as well outweighing the enterprise, that's going to change. So I think this is - this demand case, I think, is going to grow and change and it feels like come in our favor. But Colin, why don't you speak to some of your experience front line with the customers?
Colin McLean: Sure. Thanks, Andy. Frank. I appreciate the question. I would just amplify what Andy is saying is the demand principles are not monolithic. I mean you're talking about a wide gamut of requirements across the customer platform, which really plays well to our broad-based portfolio. So I think we do as good a job as any to support broad-based requirements and Catechist's capacity. But also having mixed dynamic requirements in terms of densities. And so what we try to do is to map that right customer to right market to right workload. And again, across 300-plus data centers, I think we can serve that pretty well. We also feel pretty strongly that core market orientation, i.e., proximity to eyeballs and GDP is still going to remain a core requirement for much of this AI workload. So, we feel like that maps really well to our course of assets across the globe.
Operator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. So Greg mentioned the strength in demand for both stabilized and development JVs, but in light of a more volatile rate environment, especially in recent weeks, have you sensed any meaningful shifts in the appetite for JVs when you're discussing with potential partners?
Jordan Sadler: Greg, has your phone been ringing any louder?
Gregory Wright: I mean no. Look, it's a good question, but the answer is no. Remember, when investors are out there making investments in different sectors, right? Everything is on a relative basis. And I think when investors look at data centers today, and they look at the quality of the facility, the quality of the customer base, the term of the lease, the strong organic growth in the business today. It's the best place for them to invest. In fact, I would argue that over time, you're going to continue to see data centers becoming more mainstream investing rather than a niche play investing when you look at the level of demand out there, whether it's through pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and the like. So no, I mean, it's also an interesting as there's pockets of capital that are driven - we'll do this unlevered. So they're willing to be patient and wait for leverage and wait for rates to come back down. And I think that also, to your point, Ivan, and I think that's what I mentioned earlier, there's even an outsized demand on the development side. I think the fact that we're in a higher rate environment is driving more demand, if you will, towards development. So - but no, we have not. In fact, I would go the other way. I would say that we've seen an acceleration in the demand for development JVs.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. When you take the demand that you're seeing, the backlog and the target for the development joint ventures, can you give us a bit of a preview on the range of development capital that digital will place on balance sheet in 2024?
Andrew Power: Thanks Michael. So I mean - this isn't new news. And I think I framed this at some of the investor meetings we've had through the fall or even on back to NAREIT. Listen, we are a large - the largest global player in the space here and we are taking a strategic change to how we're funding the business was one of my three top priorities. And what we're not going to do is tie ourselves to a partner for all time and reduce our flexibility. But we're going to be looking at targeted large-scale projects. These are projects that are supporting will support customers, we believe in their growth campuses multiple megawatts. So not non-core at all like things that we would invest 100% if we weren't looking to change our funding strategy to drive more bottom line growth. And I think you can think the concentration of those type of projects to-date are mostly in North America and Europe. Given our business is already in a shared in a venture in Latin America and was a little bit smaller in APAC. And I think it's going to be very targeted trying to find the right capital source that is like-minded in terms of their vision for the asset class and looking for a partner that wants to really invest alongside we think is the best-in-class in this industry.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on cash flow. So the accounts receivable looks like it increased another $167 million sequentially, and it's been a drag of over $400 million year-to-date. Just wondering if there's any color you can share on what's driving this? And then maybe how to think about the prospects for any sort of reversal in upcoming quarters? Thanks.
Matthew Mercier: Yes. Thanks, Matt. This is Matt as well. So yes, we've had what - I think the important points that I'd call out here are two things. One, the majority of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of quarters in our accounts receivable has been tied to actually VAT receivables as a result of the increased construction that we've had, particularly over internationally in EMEA. When you look at our trade payables, which are really only actually roughly half or a little over half of that balance, we have increased trade payables over the period, but it's also been fairly much in line with our increase in revenue as well. And we've actually been able to bring down our amount of trade payables in the last couple of quarters as well. But again, it doesn't appear that way when the total receivables balance has increased. But again, I think the two sailing points are only - roughly only half of our - that balance is tied to what I call trade receivables, which are actual rent and other billings that are sent to customers. A good chunk is related to VAT receivables tied to our construction, which has been the part that's been growing more substantially, which also has, a liability offset as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thanks. Maybe following up on the JV question. Fundamentals are really strong. It feels like you believe there's a lot of runway there. Obviously, there are funding considerations. But have you rethought perhaps pursuing a JV versus going at it on your own and essentially keeping the upside to yourself?
Andrew Power: Hi, thanks Ari. So I don't - I think consistent with what I just shared reiterated on this call, we believe that this opportunity when it comes to our space, digital transformation, cloud computing, hybrid IT and now the advent of artificial intelligence really coming to fruition is so large, long-term, capital-intensive that really tapping into both private and public capital in different measures is the right way to maximize value for our shareholders. And we are certainly experiencing an inflection in our operating fundamentals that has built upon good results throughout the year. We've been doing a tremendous amount of deleveraging this year. We'll be, call it, rounding third base on the deleveraging next year, getting back to the targets Matt's laid out. And we also have headwinds when it comes to, call it, some - a modest amount of debt coming due in terms of refinancing. But we view that the development joint venture remains to be the right move to drive more to the bottom line. And again, as I said in a question or two ago, we are not tying ourselves to this strategy and partner for all time, right? This has allowed us to accelerate those earnings and then have be able to throttle the levers here as to how much we share in terms of development joint ventures with partners down the road.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thanks a lot. Good evening. If I could just check in on the development CapEx point. Again, you raised the guidance $400 million at the midpoint for this year. We've obviously just got a couple of months left here. Could you just go through a little bit what we're seeing that increase being spent on? Is that higher cost per megawatt coming through on some of your existing projects you're pulling stuff forward from - next year, what else might be contributing to the increase? Thanks.
Andrew Power: It's not budget overruns or anything like that, it is called conviction in the demand landscape. And I mean we can - Matt can run through it. But I think the biggest piece is Northern Virginia, which goes back to our success in freeing up, call it, 100-plus megawatts in the Loudoun County pinch point and now activating that. But Matt, anything else I'm missing there?
Matthew Mercier: No. I think, Andy, you hit it. I mean the majority of our development pipeline increased the call roughly 60 megawatts. We had 100 megawatts of new starts vast majority of that was in North America and in Northern Virginia specifically. If you look at our supplemental quarter-over-quarter, our cost per megawatt, I think broadly globally has been roughly flat. So it's just a view of new development starts looking to get those completed as quickly as possible. So, if we can deliver on time for our customers and take advantage of the market that we're in.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Andy, you've talked about being more disciplined about returns and the sort of deals you accept. Do you feel like you're successfully winning your targeted share of higher value or more strategic deals at your desired returns for each product? And kind of along those lines, do you feel like customers' perceptions of what you have to offer and where you add value is consistent with how you're trying to reposition the company's assets?
Andrew Power: Hi. Thanks, Nick. So, I could tell you just yesterday, my team and I were on a called recurring check in with one of our top cloud customers. And that dialogue was multifaceted. It was obviously concentrated on how we can support their growth in their availability zones, how we can commence faster. There's operational elements, it ranges across all the theaters and it also had how we can drive greater consumption to their cloud. And their services from our 5,000 existing customers from the 100 plus we added this quarter and the next quarter, how we're integrating them onto our service fabric natively. And so, I think we are - and I think you're seeing those results paying dividends in that customer appreciation. And you're seeing that in the litany of, call it, magnetic destinations, be it the on-ramps we announced around the world as well as the pickup in the demand that we characterize as less than megawatt interconnection accelerating. So, I do see a connection there. I think we've delivered a tremendous amount of value to our customers, improving their top line and their bottom lines in a safe, secure fashion. And when obviously, I think some of your question was dovetailed also to some of the larger customers, I think that we're just being transparent and honest with these customers that we're really trying to build a durable business to stand the test of time. And that doesn't mean we try to win 100% of a hyperscales market share, but if we're in 50 metropolitan areas, there's probably 25 or 30 where we have something that they really need, and we can really help them like no other. And that's through our supply chain, our large campuses that future-proof their growth, operational excellence and other value adds and just being a one-stop shop for all their needs. So, I think that's a long, long-winded answer to yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just getting back to the development JV. This is obviously the missing piece in the capital recycling efforts. But - and I saw that you raised the disposition guidance for the year. Is $750 still a good range for this? And I guess, from your commentary, it seems like there's more than one deal that this can represent?
Gregory Wright: Hi Eric, this is Greg. The answer is yes, $750 is still a good deal. And yes, we are working on more than one.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. So I wanted to ask about the unlevered return environment, particularly for hyperscale. I think earlier in the call, you mentioned something to the effect of double-digit unlevered yields. When you're thinking about doing some of these larger footprint deals with your top customers, just curious where you're seeing those deals clear? And as part of that, where do you think that this could evolve to over, call it, the next year? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. So I think, I'd point you to our development schedule, which has now been in the double-digits category across the board for the whole portfolio, including an increase in, call it, 65 megawatts quarter-over-quarter. North America, where, I would say, is the current home to the largest deals is in double-digit by itself and has moved up dramatically. I don't - when we look at the risk award, there's obviously episodic scenarios where returns for big deals with hyperscalers couldn't go higher. But I think that the - once you kind of ascend into the double-digits, given the current state of, call it, cost of capital in general, I think you're in the proverbial end zone in terms of creating value on many ways. So I wouldn't bank on incremental stair stiffs of shifts beyond that. But I think, we're in a time in the world where the demand remains robust and diverse, outpacing supply. That dynamic does not feel to be abating. And I think we've got a great hand to support tremendous customers' growth around the globe and create a lot of value for a lot of stakeholders.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong third quarter. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with our customers. We posted another quarter of strengthening organic operating results with record 0-1 megawatt bookings, strong re-leasing spreads and our best same-capital cash and ROI growth in over a decade. During the first nine months of the year, we've raised over $3.5 billion of new capital, enabling us to meaningfully delever while reinvesting to support our customers' growing needs, and we are not done yet. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and express my personal gratitude to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty to keep the digital world spinning. We look forward to updating you on our progress and meeting with many of you at NAREIT in L.A. in a few weeks. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question, plus a follow-up, and we'll aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today’s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. We delivered yet another strong quarter of leasing in our zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment and saw a healthy rebound in greater than a megawatt leasing. And second, this past quarter confirmed the continued inflection of fundamentals we have been speaking about for much of the past year, supported by a strong pricing environment. Releasing spreads were the strongest in three years and stabilized same cash NOI grew by 5.6% marking the second consecutive quarter with positive growth and the best growth in almost nine years. And third, we bolstered our total liquidity, which now stands at more than $4 billion and further diversified our capital sources and reduced our leverage well off of peak levels through more than $2 billion of dispositions and JVs and over $1 billion of equity issued under our ATM. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Against the backdrop of an extraordinarily dynamic first half of the year, we have remained focused on advancing our strategic priorities and delivering on behalf of our 5,000 plus customers. Digital Realty made strong progress in the second quarter with improved operational results, progress on our funding plan and increased liquidity, continued organizational improvements, an increasing recognition of the critical role that data centers will play in support of both digital transformation and artificial intelligence. We posted sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CFFO per share, while improving development returns, bolstering liquidity and delevering the balance sheet. During the quarter, we made progress on each of the three key strategic priorities that I laid out earlier this year. First, we strengthened our customer value proposition by enhancing our communities of interest with more connectivity options, posting record double digit interconnection revenue growth and the second highest quarter of new logo additions in company history. Second, we innovated and integrated, delivering enhancements designed to support high performance compute, including AI by enabling data centers to support liquid cooling solutions, while also broadening our existing partnership with NVIDIA with the certification of our first DGx H100 ready data center and integrating with additional organizational enhancements design, deliver a consistent structure and experience, while leveraging data to improve our effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we access diverse capital sources during the quarter including the sale of a non-core asset in Texas at an attractive 4.4% cap rate and equity raised under our ATM. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we formed a stabilized hyperscale data center joint venture with a new private capital partner that acquired an interest in two facilities in Chicago. And today, we announced a similar joint venture transaction alongside a second new private capital partner for three stabilized hyperscale data centers in Northern Virginia. Just a little more than halfway through the year, we are now well ahead of the midpoint of our original funding plan for 2023 and we remain focused on putting Digital Realty's balance sheet into position to support the growing opportunity that lies ahead. The current state of the data center infrastructure landscape is very healthy. There is widespread demand for our data center capacity across various regions and products. However, there is limited new supply due to decreased power availability and tight financial conditions. The global expansion of Cloud Computing paired with continuous digital transformation of enterprises underscores the escalating importance of both data and AI in shaping demand. Presently, we are collaborating with numerous clients on AI focused requests for proposals and implementations. The initial surge is anticipated in power intensive training applications followed by a rise in inferencing applications including access to private data sets, which are expected to necessitate enhanced performance and reduce latency. Additionally, the integral nature of these models is necessitating larger capacity blocks which align seamlessly with our extensive product suite. As the global meeting place for data exchange and a full spectrum provider of data center solutions, Digital Realty stands at a strategic vantage point. This allows us to cater to the needs of enterprises, facilitating their efficient integration of AI applications within their digital transformation journeys. In the second quarter, we unveiled Data Gravity Index 2.0, which represents our extended commitment to data science. This tool is designed to access the effects of enterprise data generation and consumption in both public clouds and private data centers, offering enterprises a framework to manage and drive insights from their data. Moreover, our innovative approaches in Data Gravity and comprehensive data center architecture were recognized as we secured a patent for these. Our patent further offers enterprises a roadmap to ensure their architectures remain relevant in the future. The evidence is clear, we have shifted from a physical economy to a digital economy, which now is entering a new form, the data economy. Our research shows that the surge in server demand can be attributed to the rising needs of both public and private cloud infrastructure, further augmented by AI training and inference processes. At the same time, demand for storage devices is poised to grow due to data regulation. Let's move to our second quarter results. This quarter continued the inflection in the fundamental recovery we've been highlighting in our core portfolio over the past several quarters. Our pipeline remains strong during the quarter, helping to drive a sequential rebound in leasing volume but also supporting strong pricing with releasing spreads positive again across all product types and in all regions. New leasing during the quarter was $114 million with continued strength in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection leasing, which represented 43% of total signings. Greater than a megawatt increased by over 60% sequentially, led by one of our strongest quarters ever in EMEA. Strong demand trends and reduced availability along with growing recognition of our value proposition continue to be supportive of pricing, and are enhancing our expected returns. In the second quarter, we saw releasing spreads climbed to nearly 7% on a cash basis, helping to drive the best same capital cash NOI growth that we've seen since I joined Digital Realty in 2015. During the second quarter, churn remained low at 1.5% and we added 133 new customers, our second best quarter ever and a nice continuation of the 100 plus new logo streak we have going. This is a strong validation of the stability of enterprise IT spend and digital transformation that we are seeing and of the value that customers recognize in platform digital. Our key wins included an innovative sustainability oriented infrastructure provider that tasked into stranded energy to support module edge compute sites chose Digital Realty for AI applications, utilizing Platform Digital's network control and data hub solutions. Data intensive workloads are being deployed on Platform Digital by a major US federal agency to reduce costs and improve sustainability, while interconnecting with their key ecosystem partners. A leading European bank chose Platform Digital to help simplify and secure their hybrid IT strategy in compliance with data sovereignty regulations, while leveraging the available cloud connectivity. A Fortune 500 quick serve restaurant chain is updating their internal infrastructure on Platform Digital to improve reliability and security, support existing systems and connect with [P Cloud] (ph) to support the strong growth of their e-commerce business. A global 2000 Pharmaceuticals sourcing and distribution services company is expanding to a new [indiscernible] Platform Digital to ensure global data governance compliance. And a global 2000 Auto Manufacture chose Platform Digital to upgrade their network architecture in Central Europe by adding key points of presence for the largest and most important production centers. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. In the years since we learned that the power constraints in this market will continue to work constructively with the power provider to confirm the commitments that we've made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. Over the course of last several months with the support of our local utility partners, we've been able to identify nearly 100 megawatts of incremental billable capacity that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 40 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on almost another 60 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn focus capacity, we've made meaningful progress on our 192 megawatt development site in Manassas which is now nearly in position to begin development. We are optimistic about the near term potential to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. As we outlined in February, 2023 was poised to be an active year for our investments team and some of the fruit of their labor has been harvested since our last call. During the second quarter, we acquired the land and shell associated with the previously leased data center in Amsterdam, where we previously held a lease hold interest for $18 million. In a separate future proofing transaction, we purchased additional land adjacent to our highly connected Schiphol campus in Amsterdam, which could support another 40 megawatts of potential IT load providing ample runway for both enterprise and service provider growth. We also closed on first non-core disposition of the year in mid-May at a 4.4% cap rate resulting in $150 million of net proceeds to Digital Realty. This facility was previously leased as a power to shell and was sold to one of its primary occupants. In July, we saw a significant acceleration in our capital recycling initiatives, closing on two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in Chicago and Ashburn. These deals were executed at just over 6% cash cap rate on average and raised more than $2 billion of net proceeds for Digital Realty. These transactions are an important validation of our current strategy as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value through the development of new data centers at double digit unlevered returns and the monetization of stabilized hyperscale assets at a premium. But equally as important, we've substantially bolstered and diversified our sources of private capital so that we can execute on the opportunity that lies ahead without being overly reliant on any individual avenue of capital while also increasing the efficiency of our balance sheet. While we've had remarkable traction on these transactions and all due credit goes to Greg Wright, his top-notch team and the rest of our platform for executing through a tumultuous capital markets environment, we are not resting on our laurels. We are well ahead of our plan on our stabilized hyper sale joint venture plan, but we see ample demand for the hyperscale development joint venture bucket that we have previously discussed and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Before moving on, I'm also delighted to welcome [indiscernible] Reliance Industries Company as our newest partner to our joint venture in India. The expanded partnership builds on the strong foundation laid by [BAM] (ph) Digital Realty, through the addition of Jio's massive digital connectivity ecosystem and strong enterprise relationships with 80% of large private enterprises in India. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the second quarter, we issued our fifth annual ESG report outlining our initiatives for 2022. The report highlights the progress we have made toward our science-based targets, commitment to reduce our global carbon emission by 68% by 2030. We've enabled our success by contracting for renewable energy wherever possible so that we have 1 gigawatt of solar and wind energy under contract in the US. This has enabled us to match 126 of our data centers with 100% renewable energy. In the second quarter, we also received a certificate of adherence from the climate neutral data center pack. As a founding member of the pack, Digital Realty worked with independent auditors to certify that we are on track to meet the overarching goal of the pack for the industry to become climate neutral by 2030. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second quarter results. We signed $114 million of new leases in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment in each region. We leased approximately $50 million in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 43% of total bookings and becoming a larger part of our overall bookings since last year. . Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million, concluding a record 12-month period. Zero to one megawatt bookings, excluding interconnection, were among our strongest ever at $37 million. Digital Realty has come a long way over the past four years, more than tripling our bookings in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. These results demonstrate that our full spectrum strategy is working. Greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $61 million in the quarter, a meaningful bounce back from last quarter's timing-oriented pause. EMEA was the standout, including strong contributions from Johannesburg, Paris and [indiscernible] while we also saw notable strength in Northern Virginia and Tokyo. We also continue to overindex towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with 35% of the newly signed leases in the quarter contained inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. Pricing has improved in many markets. With our largest market, Northern Virginia, seen nearly a doubling of rates over the past year in response to supply constraints. Illustrating the changing tide in Ashburn, during the quarter, we opportunistically took back 8 megawatts of lease capacity from an existing customer and released it to another customer at a substantial premium. The original lease was signed in the first quarter of last year. Accordingly, our new leasing for the quarter only represents the uplift in rent achieved versus the prior lease rather than the full annualized value of the new lease. While we have previously tempered enthusiasm around the potential mark-to-market opportunity in Northern Virginia, we are encouraged by this recent transaction and our increased development potential and growing colocation and connectivity offering in this market. Aside from the shift seen in Northern Virginia, we have also seen an improvement in rates across the Americas as well as in EMEA and APAC. Looking forward, our demand funnel remains healthy with strength across product types and geographies. We expect ongoing and newly approved development capacity to be an important contributor to our growth through next year. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $437 million at quarter end as commencements were once again well over $100 million, balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $150 million of commencements in the second half of 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted between the third and fourth quarters. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 11 months as certain hyperscale customers await build-out completions. During the second quarter, we signed $211 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 6.9% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing in three years. This strength was shared across both product segments and across our three regions, continuing the broad-based improvement we saw last quarter with renewal rates trending over 5% during the first half combined, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to better reflect the success year-to-date in today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the zero to one megawatt category continued to climb for the sixth consecutive quarter to an increase of 4.8% in the second quarter on $133 million of volume. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were even stronger in the second quarter as cash releasing spreads increased by considerable 8.7% on $73 million of renewals, the largest increase within this category since the third quarter of 2019. Turning to our operating results. Our operating and financial performance in the second quarter was a bit better than our expectations highlighted by many of the same factors we highlighted last quarter. The continued improvement in our core operating performance, another record quarter of interconnection revenue and well-controlled expenses. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.68 per share, 2% better versus the prior quarter and consensus expectations. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.72 we reported in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 20% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by both the inclusion of Teraco this year and the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe over the past 12 months. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Critically, our rental revenues in the second quarter included a $25 million onetime write-off of noncash straight-line rent and the $6 million bad debt reserve related to a tenant that declared bankruptcy during the quarter. We also wrote off $3 million of noncash straight line rent related to the re-leasing opportunity we executed in Northern Virginia. These write-offs of noncash straight-line rent of approximately $28 million combined are excluded from core FFO per share. Interconnection revenue was at a record level in the quarter, increasing by 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 8% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Bookings were higher in all three regions and ServiceFabric activations doubled in the quarter. Other than utility costs, expenses were well contained as rental property operating expenses and insurance were both flat sequentially, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the second quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 5.6% and 1.7% sequentially. This marked the strongest year-over-year growth in our same capital pool since 2014, demonstrating the turn and fundamentals that we have been highlighting. The improvement was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy as commencements outpace churn with upside from rent escalators and stronger-than-expected releasing spreads. While we're very encouraged by the improvement we've seen to date in this metric and the trend does indeed appear to be our friend, our enthusiasm for the second half of 2023 is tempered by the uncertainty related to a recent customer bankruptcy filing. We expect to know more about the potential impact by the time we report third quarter results. Turning to the balance sheet. As Andy outlined in his remarks, as of this week, we are meaningfully ahead of the funding plan that we laid out for you in February. We have already closed an approximately $2.2 billion of asset sales and stabilized joint ventures and expect to make additional progress on development joint ventures in the second half of this year. Specifically, earlier in July, we closed on the sale of a 65% interest in two stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Chicago campus, raising $743 million of gross proceeds. And as announced this afternoon, we sold an 80% interest in three stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Ashburn campus, raising another $1.3 billion of gross proceeds. Including proceeds from the sale of the noncore asset in Texas, we announced last month, we've raised over $2 billion in capital at a blended average cap rate of just over 6% so far this year. In addition to this capital recycling activity, during the second quarter we raised $1.1 billion of proceeds from the sale of 11 million shares of equity under our ATM. Included in this total was approximately 3.5 million shares or $335 million that was structured as forward equity issuance. These shares were settled earlier this week. Our reported leverage ratio at the quarter end was 6.8 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.2 times. Pro forma for the JV transactions and the settlement of the forward equity outstanding at quarter end leverage was 6.3 times, putting us on track toward our near 6 time target by year-end. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly five years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.7%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Approximately 83% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing during the rest of this year and a well-laddered maturity schedule throughout the out years. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are affirming our full year revenue guidance range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion at the midpoint as the recent acceleration in capital recycling has been balanced by better-than-expected releasing spreads and same capital cash NOI. We are, however, adjusting our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 by $0.10 per share to a new range of [6.55 to 6.65] (ph) to reflect the following: $0.03 per share tied to the acceleration of our funding plan, including greater-than-expected stabilized joint venture sales and over $1 billion of equity issuance. $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the write-off of unpaid rent and additional near-term uncertainty related to recent customer bankruptcy and about $0.01 per share of lower noncash straight-line rent tied to the opportunistic termination and releasing in Northern Virginia. Given the continued progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads moving up to greater than 4% and greater than 8%, respectively. An increase in our same capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 4% to 5% despite the potential impact of the customer bankruptcy this quarter, partly balanced by a reduction in our year-end portfolio occupancy assumption to 84% to 85%, largely reflecting the greater than anticipated sales of stabilized hyperscale assets into joint ventures. Given the better-than-expected execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions in JV capital. We now expect total disposition in JV capital raised to fall within the range of our current $2.2 billion, up to $3 billion. We've also reduced the amount of long-term debt financing needed to support our full year funding plan, given the nearly $4 billion of liquidity currently available as a result of asset sales, JVs and ATM equity raised. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Participant: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You have [Alex Waters] (ph) on for Dave. Congrats on the new JV deal. Just wanted to know if you could walk us through kind of what line of sight you have for the development JV pipeline. And then looking into 2024, can you speak to how comfortable you are with the funding pipeline? And then secondly, on the core business, you've had strong releasing spreads on the greater than 1 megawatt side. Just curious on what your expectations are for this bucket heading into the second half of the year and into 2024. Thanks.
Andrew Power: Hey thanks, Alex. Appreciate the kind words. I'm going to turn it to Greg to call speak to where we're going next in terms of capital raising on development JVs, maybe tie in what's happened back half of this year into 2024. And I can pick up on the core portfolio.
Gregory Wright: Sounds good. Thanks, Alex. Look, with respect to the development JV guidance, we're still comfortable with our full year development JV guidance that we provided previously. That's roughly [750] (ph), give or take. And that's obviously the plug, if you will, between the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion last time, which now becomes $2.2 billion to $3 billion. Look, we remain engaged on these transactions over the second half of the year. And what we're seeing out there just as with the stabilized joint ventures, there's strong demand for the development joint ventures, particularly given that these JVs offer the highest returns and they have a lot of moving parts, though. So given the strategic considerations here, these tend to take a little longer. So, I'd say we remain optimistic and on track for those. With that, I'll turn it back over to Matt and Andy.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Alex. I think for your second question was about, call it, the core operating results we saw in the quarter year-to-date and how -- what we see in the back of the year, if I'm correct. We're certainly pleased on multiple fronts on the value proposition and pricing power coming through. We saw that in our new lease signings and ROIs as well as our cash mark-to-market and which flow through to our same-store growth. We had a quite strong quarter on those stats, and you saw that we updated our guidance for the full year. So as of right now, we think that these trends on the cash mark-to-markets and pricing power will continue into the back half of 2023.
Matthew Mercier: Yeah, I might just add that, again this quarter we saw all of our greater than megawatt renewals were in positive territory, and that includes across all regions as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Good job on the execution on the JV deal. I wanted to ask about the 8 megawatts where you had an uplift in rents. I know you talked about it, but I'm sorry, can you maybe break down like what kind of drove your ability to push those rents higher? And if you were to take that out, what were the rents per kilowatt hour in the greater than 1 megawatts in America?
Andrew Power: Thanks, John. So, I'll walk through the dynamics, I'll let Matt quote that -- the actual rate on the new deal to give you a sense of the market. I mean this is obviously a market that is very tight on supply and we we’ve been working with our installed customer base, if anyone had capacity that was idle or they didn't see -- have near-term need for. So hence, we were able to take back capacity from a customer since we let them out of a contract and that contract was signed, call it, a year ago at a much lower rate. And we were able to help a different customer that had immediate needs and we're able to sign that at a much higher rate. But Matt, why don't you walk through the stats?
Matthew Mercier: Yes, sure. So just to be clear, the deal that you're -- that we're talking about here is not included in our renewal stats. What we are doing is showing just the net incremental revenue that we expect to recognize within our signing stats. And you'll see that more clearly when you look at Page 8 of our supplemental, in particular, in North America, the greater than a megawatt, you're going to see a deal -- you're going to see the 300 KW rate, and that's because we're only showing the incremental revenue and not the associated megawatts attached to it. If you put that deal in at, call it, 100%, you got 300 KW that would come down to 148KW. But again, it was a substantial uplift from the in-place lease. It was over 50% higher than what we had currently.
Jon Petersen: I'm sorry, that's 148 KW on the 8-megawatt deal or 148KW excluding the 8-megawatt deal?
Matthew Mercier: Including, that would be our blended rate, if you look at Page 8 in our supplemental versus the 300KW, okay.
Jon Petersen: Okay. Okay. And then just one follow-up, just to stick with NOVA. So, with the power constraints there as long as nothing has changed, it seems like nothing new could really come online until 2026. Are you already seeing leasing demand for people that are wanting to sign leases and commit that far in advance?
Andrew Power: So, John, the NOVA market, the facts, I would say, remain the same in terms of transmission lines and arrival of utility power, which has really created an environment of demand well outpacing supply. We are, I'd say, less right now focused on signings that don't commence until 2026 based on the uncertainty of when in 2026 exactly that power rise. And quite honestly, making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity at hand for us. That market has seen dramatic price improvement. We've signed deals in the larger categories, call it, 140 or north of that per kilowatt. Again, that market was in the 70s, not so long ago. And the good news, as we reported, given our breadth and history in that market, we've been able to work with our utility provider and really cobble together incremental growth capacity for our customers across our campuses. If you add them all up, prior to the 2026 arrival, call it, by 2025, if not sooner, you're approaching, call it, 100 megawatts of growth capacity in Ashburn, which is in addition to our growth capacity that we have in Manassas.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. To start, in recent months we've seen the volume and size of deals increase. And to that point, there are many requirements on the market right now that are over 100 megawatts. As you considered the strategy moving forward, is it your intention to compete for these deals? And if so, are you willing to pursue these deals with or without a development JV lined up with the understanding that these projects will drive long-term shareholder value? And then I have a follow-up.
Andrew Power: So, I can tell you, we didn't sign any 100 megawatt deals in this quarter. We are certainly around some of these opportunities. We're very focused on, call it, maximizing our footprint for its highest and best use in helping our customers the best way we can. Some of those deals obviously have led itself towards the AI domain for trading models, the need that large scales of contiguous capacity. I can tell you look at our footprint. We have extensive locations around the globe that we can help those types of customers. We are -- we've made great progress both in our capital sources, as you saw just in literally the month of July, really got back into firmer footing to support our customers' growth. Adding to that a development partner, I think we'll put even more fuel on fire to support that growth. So, I think when it comes to bigger and bigger deals, we got to make sure that they land in the right locations for Digital Realty and make sure we're maximizing the opportunity in terms of our -- what I call is really precious capacity in our land bank, in our sales and in our inventory runway.
Michael Elias: Great. And then just to piggyback on that point about maximizing the opportunity. If I go back to the third quarter of 2022, you guys were clear that you were sharpening the lens to which you looked at investments with the intention of driving higher risk-adjusted return. As we think about hyperscale deals in which you would lease an entire into a single hyperscaler on a turnkey basis. Could you give us a framework for thinking about what the appropriate spread between your unlevered development yield and your cost of capital should be to make it worth it to lease it to the hyperscaler? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. I think Jordan is -- can see the future because, we thought he was going to ask this question. But honestly, we haven't been thinking about that because we've been raising the bar and demand has been outpacing the supply where anything that even kind of feels skinny or close to not just reaching our cost of capital is not made it on to where we're investing our dollars. And you can see that in our development life cycle where you have the whole schedule of the 377 plus megawatts underway, north of 10% ROI. That includes the Americas region, North America that, call it, 9% and still weighted down by projects that were, call it, open book yield on cost projects, almost legacy in vain that is weighting down those averages. I can tell you these opportunities we're seeing even for larger capacity blocks in these tight markets, be it Northern Virginia, be it Singapore, be it Frankfurt or elsewhere, we're certainly into the double digits unlevered ROIs, which I think that well exceeds the risk-adjusted of deploying capital and it really is coming down more to supply/demand dynamics than just, call it, premiums. And I think if you look at the great work our investments team did on transacting on some of these JVs and the new partners we brought in the fold and called the six-ish cap area I think you're seeing a lot of value creation in our model.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. A couple of questions. I wondered what -- how to kind of think -- you said you're not going to issue any more debt this year. But given some of the other moving parts around possible asset sales and so forth, are there any more of those to come? And how can we think about the leverage trajectory of getting perhaps into the high fives or whatnot? And then secondly, I was curious just about India. Is your partner contributing any assets prospectively going forward? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Matt can speak to the funding in our sources and uses in the guidance and leverage, and then Chris and I can [indiscernible] the India piece?
Matthew Mercier: Yes, so thanks Jon. There's a couple of aspects here, I think, are important. One to reiterate, as of today, we've got $4 billion of liquidity, thanks to the execution of the broader team. If you look at where our funding needs are going forward, this year based on looking at our life cycle, what's remaining to be spent, our guidance in terms of what's left to be spent, we're talking about somewhere in the [1.2 to 1.3] (ph) left to spend this year. So that gives us a pretty significant runway into 2024 to be able to fund the continued growth and opportunities that we see going forward. On top of that, as we also noted, we're not stopping in terms of the execution on asset sales as well as the potential that we're continuing to seek for development joint venture partners that will give us an even broader access to capital and be able to help us to fund not only some of that capital need into 2024, but also potentially this year as well, which rounds out into your question on leverage. We've made considerable progress again on that front as well. As I noted in the prepared remarks, you look at us on a pro forma basis, we're at 6.3% now. So made considerable progress on that. You layer on top of that our expected view of continuing to grow our EBITDA as we've left that guidance line unchanged, again, as well as continue to seek development joint venture partners that will continue to help us on that deleveraging process. So, we feel pretty good about progress to date on both liquidity and leverage. And I'll turn it over to Greg on the India JV topic.
Gregory Wright: Just on India, just -- I mean, I think it’s less about the assets. It's more -- obviously, they're going to be share in development opportunities in a huge market with a lot of growth, but it's really about a great, fantastic new partner to the partnership. And maybe Chris can touch on Jio and what we think they bring to the table here.
Christopher Sharp: Absolutely. I appreciate the conversation, Jon. So, it's a culmination of expertise, right, where Brookfield brings local investing expertise digital really, we bring the data center expertise to that market. But I think what really Jio brings is that local operating expertise and maybe many of you already know, but Jio is one of the largest mobile media platforms throughout India. And I think their extensive reach and ability to interconnect critical enterprises or other destinations is something that's going to allow us not to deliver a like-for-like product. And I think Greg and I have been talking about this for many years and looking at the fact that we wanted to be able to differentiate our ability to be successful within India. And so that partnership with Reliance and Jio has really elevated our ability to service the broader enterprise customer base, which, quite frankly, is unique in the -- it's a lot of our large hyperscale customers as well. So the amalgamation of that trio coming to market is something that we're excited about. We're still in early innings. So, you'll see it evolve over time, but pretty excited about the opportunity in India.
Jonathan Atkin: If I could quickly add on interconnect trends and anything to expect going forward in terms of just the trajectory, any particular reason why it might see pressure because of grooming or acceleration because of new use cases and is AI play a role at all in the interconnect at this point? Thanks.
Andrew Power : Sure. Appreciate it, Jon. Just to further jump into that. Yes, interconnection, I think, is something that's evolving rather quickly. I think artificial intelligence is definitely evolving, and it's in its early stages to date. I think where we've been watching and what I think has shown through and we referenced in the prepared remarks is the fact that it's the highest five year growth, two straight quarters surpassing $100 million. I think that's very unique to us and the platform that we represent in the market. I would also say that some of the activities that we've been doing around ServiceFabric, which quite frankly, is tailored to streamlining the technical kind of barriers that have been placed upon the customers to access all of these destinations where data resides, which at the core of artificial intelligence, where I think your question is at, you have to have access to data. And so, being able to be a part of one of the largest open platforms that quite frankly, allows customers to access these data oceans of both public and private deployments. I think the platform is starting to pay off. And I would say that, again, early innings with AI, but we're very excited about what that demand is going to represent inside of our portfolio. And as we evolved and we're stable stay of what we did in the foundation of cloud, you'll see us be able to be at a steady state with a lot of these customers evolving AI as well.
Operator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. So looking at your development tables, you guys are developing assets at 10% stabilized yields and feels like if that stays, you can sell assets at fixed cap rates. That's a pretty healthy spread on the development profit margin. So, I guess I was just wondering, since you've already hit your initial disposition target that range you set out why do you see the need to do more JV development at this point? Why not just look to sell more stabilized assets?
Gregory Wright: David, it's Greg here. Look, I think when you take a look -- as we laid out, and Andy laid out at the beginning of the year, the reason for finding these development partners is, look, when you look at this opportunity in the hyperscale business today, it goes well beyond our balance sheet even at $55 billion. So when you look at that, what it tells you is you got to have third-party capital to meet the customers' needs within -- throughout the globe for that business. So as we sit here today, even though we have, as you said, we've exceeded our guidance on what we were going to do. [indiscernible] look at this strategically go forward, and we think that's the best way to fund that business to create value for our shareholders. So that's why we're going to continue to fund it through development. And we think that's the most prudent way to move forward with it.
David Guarino: Okay. And then maybe switching topics on the tenant bankruptcy, Matt, you were talking about, which I think is a former public data center company. Can you walk us through what eventually happens to that space? Are you guys just waiting now to renegotiate with the tenants? And I guess, how soon if that's not the case, can you start releasing that space?
Andrew Power: David, just to add on to the last question, and I could [indiscernible] the second part of your question. The -- I think there's been -- our balance sheet today has, call it, north of 3 gigawatts of growth capacity around the world. And we see that expanding and having the balance sheet to be help funded alongside some great partners is another part of becoming more efficient and more quickly driving returns and results to our bottom lines. In a market and an opportunity backdrop that keeps getting bigger, it was large to begin with, cloud computing accelerated that with hyperscale demand. And AI is just an incremental lift to this wave of demand. Hence, we believe the best way to tackle this opportunity and support our customers while driving results to the bottom line is in partnerships on the capital front. When it comes to the customer bankruptcy, obviously, this customer is in the middle of bankruptcies so can't share too much. The typical playbook is the creditors essentially have to run a process for the assets or the business. And as part of that, make decisions on either accepting or rejecting leases. We have not, to date, had any leases rejected so far. While they have rejected other providers or landlord leases, I don't think you can assume that every one of our leases despite that fact will be accepted. But from a strategic lens, this is why years ago we increased our capabilities and be able to expand in the colocation interconnection offering and support end customers. So when -- if and when we sell to customers would have issues, we can essentially step in and support the end customers and have adequate financial outcomes and the [indiscernible] capabilities. So that there's a little bit of wait and see as this customer works its way through bankruptcy, and I think we'll have more to report by the third quarter call.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. So first, as you're looking at the portfolio, what's the value of data center assets that you own that could be considered for future joint ventures? So what's left in terms of opportunity for recycling? And then also, can you just provide us an update on how you're doing and the opportunities to improve, whether it's overall occupancy or same capital occupancy within the portfolio? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Sure. I mean hyperscale is still a large piece of our business in terms of our installed base and certainly a lot of what's going into our current development pipeline as it stands. I think in conjunction with the creation of Digital Core REIT, we came to an estimation of, call it, $15 billion of value as a round ballpark in terms of things that would fit the bill essentially -- similar to the transactions we just announced in the month of July, fully stabilized, hyperscale-oriented long-weighted average lease length. Honestly, core assets parts of our campus, but the slowest organic growers of our portfolio. Less interconnection-rich, less customer rich. I think the more recent portfolios. We've sold, call it, 10 plus or minus customers in them. We're supporting 5,000 customers here in Digital Realty. So we still think that there's an opportunity to continue to build on these partnerships like the great partnerships we just announced. And essentially, be able to maintain 100% ownership of the highest growing pieces of our puzzle. When it comes to the same-store growth, Matt, why don't you pick that up in terms of the levers that we've been pushing hard to drive that?
Matthew Mercier : Yes. So I call out a couple of things. So first, I mean, we have been making what, I would say, is good to great progress so far. If you look at it versus last year, were up 80 basis points on our stabilized pool. We're going to continue, we think, to improve that over the course of this year into next year. And that's going to be a mix of essentially twofold, spaces where we believe that there's opportunity for larger customers. We're going to continue to target that given density requirements and the growing need for capacity across a global portfolio that we have, we're going to find opportunities to fill that in. But I think part of it and part of why it takes -- it's going to take a little bit more time to continue to improve the overall occupancy is that we're also looking where we can convert some of that space that we do have in the productized co-lo lease that over time because we see the growing need for enterprise demand and where we want to be able to capitalize that which is a higher return and a market that we want to be able to penetrate and grow even further from where we are today.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you comment on the situation in Singapore, I guess, with the government allowing a few new players coming in. How do you think that affects the pricing there? And then looking at the capital recycling, kind of where do you go from here? I know you are continuing to look at other diversification strategies. Is this kind of sort of finish this out? Or what are some other areas of capital sources that you can look at to reach that goal? Thanks.
Andrew Power: So on the first one on Singapore, I mean, I think what you're seeing is, supply still to get metered out at very small and rational clips. When after the years of no supply, the big unveiling is literally four different players getting 20-megawatt increments is relatively modest. I mean our latest data center build in that market was, I think, almost double that size of a need. So -- and this is not only happening with Singapore. You're seeing power constraints, be it from transmission or generation, moratoriums, broader [indiscernible], environmental concerns, just ratcheting and making the supply constraints to be more rational. That's why we're quite pleased that we have on our balance sheet, a long runway of growth for our customers with our campuses across 50-plus metros on six continents and the supply chain to support their growth. And this is all against a backdrop where the demand is outpacing the supply. Greg, do you want to reiterate where we go next on the capital recycling?
Gregory Wright: Yes. Thanks. Look, I think as we said, we're going to continue to focus our efforts on the remainder of this year on our development joint ventures we talked about. But to answer your question specifically, you asked about other sources of capital, we're -- how we think about it. Look, I think as a whole, we've done a pretty good job so far. As we said, we have the dedicated core REIT in Singapore. So that's a public vehicle. We've obviously just announced two transactions what we would characterize as distinguished blue chip investment partners in both GI and TPG. And look, we continue to see strong interest across the board, so not just [indiscernible], but we see infrastructure funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So we're seeing a broad-based demand here, looking at transactions, both stabilized core assets and development assets. So look, we're bullish on that. And when we look at that again, we think that's the prudent way to fund our growth going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Andy, I think you've talked about getting down to 5.5 times leverage longer term. So maybe you could just walk through the path to get there beyond this year. And how much incremental capital recycling or JVs or other forms of capital you think you might need if you look past this year? And is the goal here to ultimately becoming more self-funding so that you can share more of the economics yourself instead of using development partners?
Michael Elias : Yes. So this is Matt. I'll take that. I mean we do have -- our longer-term plan is to get down closer to 5.5 times. Again, I think we've done a considerable amount of work. We said this year, we'd look to be closer to that 6 times. You look at us based on what we've achieved and executed so far with the $2 billion from the joint ventures that we've done on stabilized assets, the billion we've raised in equity so far to date, which has come in. We're at pro forma at 6.3%. And we see the path going forward to getting back even further down as we have backlog and continue to execute on leasing that comes online, our EBITDA continues to grow, and we execute on these development joint ventures. We believe those are going to be two of the major components, which are going to help us get down to that 5.5 times target as we start to look through 2024. But we're not in a position at this point in time to give 2024 guidance yet, but I think those are the 2 main levers that we're going to be looking at to continue to drive our -- and improve our balance sheet and our leverage position.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. I think you still had some noncore portfolios out in the market today. And I guess given how successful you've been with capital recycling so far, is that kind of becoming less of a priority as you look forward? Or do you still plan to transact on some of those markets that are out there today?
Gregory Wright: Look, Eric, we -- as you said, we've been fortunate we've had good demand and good execution this year. And look, we're already -- we're 30% of the way through, and we have other transactions we're working on. But as we always said in the past, the good news for us is these noncore assets are all a very, very, very small piece of our portfolio. So we have the benefit of being disciplined and making sure we get, we think is fair value. So we're going to continue with that approach like we have historically and continue to pursue them. But again, we're seeing demand for those assets as well. So we'll continue to work on it, and we'll continue to post you as we have things to talk about.
Operator: The next question comes from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. I have one and a follow-up. So within your improved bookings this quarter, are you able to call out whether there was any sort of contribution from AI or any AI-related deployments from our customers?
Andrew Power: Hi, Irvin, that's a great question. I'm going to turn it over to our CRO, who really grabbed the baton and ran through the finish line strong, Colin McLean, to talk to what we saw on the AI front and maybe just give a little bit more color on the quarter in terms of bookings and new customers.
Colin McLean: Yes. Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question, Irvin. Yes, certainly, AI is becoming a growing part of our conversation in pipeline overall. Just to revert back a bit on the overall pipeline dynamics we're seeing, I would say, describe it overall, the pipeline is strong, healthy and diverse across the board, particularly strong in the zero to one megawatt side and growing part of that AI is definitely a part of not just the hyperscale piece of the business, but also the zero to one megawatt, and we've had some strong contributions on that front. So overall, we really feel like both the results in the pipeline itself, the demand to be a testimony and validation really of our pivot to serving the entirety of the client needs, network, enterprise and hyperscalers. So I would say both on the AI front and frankly, the cloud and hybrid IT, we're seeing some really growing success and growing conversations with clients. So we remain optimistic and serving both the pervasive needs of clients as well as AI. And I think that's going to be a growing part of our portfolio as we move forward.
Irvin Liu: Got it. Thank you for the color there. So my second question is on the strong pricing that you saw over the past two quarters. Can you just share with us how pricing trended quarter-to-quarter and the overall linearity of pricing trends now that we're one month into Q3?
Andrew Power: The -- I would, Irvin [indiscernible] continuation of the commentary that we've been saying now for several quarters and that the pendulum on supply-demand fundamentals has been, call it, winded our back and growing. Our value proposition with our customers has been more and more well received. That's from our installed base who's been growing with us. Majority of our signings were from the existing customer base. That's also from -- I think it was our second highest new logo quarter of 133 new logos or new customers. And that has been broad-based, as Matt mentioned, across regions and product types. In the less than a megawatt category, it's been more steady [indiscernible] but obviously inflecting, call it, like-for-like increases. And on the greater than megawatt, it's been a little bit more volatile but in a positive fashion. As demand has remained intact, if not further increased and precious large capacity blocks have become fewer far between and the future of that supply bottlenecks really changing course does not seem to be near term whatsoever.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong second quarter. Our results demonstrate that our meeting place value proposition is resonating with customers. Just since our last call, we raised over $3 billion of new capital, positioning the company for the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We posted strong organic operating results with the results confirming the continued inflection in our core data center business. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and recognize our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 11:05:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty’s Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today’s call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today’s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition is resonating as we delivered yet another strong quarter of nearly $50 million of leasing in our zero to one plus interconnection segment, including our second strongest quarter of bookings in EMEA and record interconnection bookings, helping to push interconnection revenue over $100 million in the quarter for the first time. Second, the first quarter delivered on the inflection and fundamentals we have guided to for 2023 as demonstrated by 4.5% re-leasing spreads on renewals and a 3.4% increase in stabilized portfolio cash NOI growth. And, third, we remain confident in our funding plan for 2023. We are deeply engaged in the process with multiple institutional buyers, including new and existing partners and we’ll update you on specifics once we finalize the transactions. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andy Power: Thanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty remained focused on our customers and executing our strategic plan while delivering a strong first quarter despite global uncertainty. This included reaching another major milestone with our platform now supporting 5,000 customers worldwide. We posted strong sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and remained focused on disciplined capital allocation, while benefiting from strong secular trends supporting the data center industry. Last quarter, I identified strengthening our customer value proposition as one of our key strategic priorities. Let me expand on this a bit. Digital Realty has been on a journey since 2015 when we acquired Telx to expand our product offering and global footprint in order to provide the full spectrum of data center solutions to our customers. At the time, we said that we were seeking to expand our product mix and presence in the attractive colocation and interconnection space. When we announced that deal, our annual colocation revenues were about $88 million, which is less than the bookings we posted in the last two quarters in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment. Since 2015, we’ve expanded our colocation and connectivity capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, including the [indiscernible] portfolio, Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, Lambda Helix, Medallion and Teraco. Today, our 0-1 megawatt segment revenues are well over $1 billion and represent 35% of total annualized rent, including a few colo and connectivity oriented organic new market additions that are currently underway and other important subsea cable landing station oriented to facilities, we expect to soon have a presence in more than 30 countries across six continents. Importantly, according to Cloudscene’s H2, 2022 Data Center Ecosystem Leaderboard Results, which ranks operators based on their data center footprint and performance with a focus on service providers and cloud owners within their ecosystem, Digital Realty ranked in the top two slots within North America Europe and LATAM are taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region. Meanwhile, we’ve also shed noncore assets, recycled capital out of stabilized core assets and created joint ventures with some of the leading institutions around the world to own, operate and develop data centers. Along the way, we’ve added connectivity-related product capabilities, such as Service Exchange, Cloud Connect, and last summer, ServiceFabric, while targeting to the additions of cloud owners in our data centers around the world. These initiatives have meaningfully improved our customer value propositions and bolstered our results within the colo and connectivity segment. Since the end of 2015, our interconnection revenue has grown nearly 150%, while our colo and connectivity bookings have increased almost 400%. We now have 214,000 cross connects across our portfolio, an increase of over 250% over the same period. But there is more to do. Our vision is to serve our large and growing customer base that is focused on digital transformation and empowering their business through technological advancements at global scale today, tomorrow and for years to come. To do that, we serve as the meeting place offering the full spectrum of data center solutions globally, enabling our customers with a colo capacity and connectivity solutions needed to support their hybrid multi-cloud deployments and also providing line of sight to future availability of scale capacity and infrastructure advancements. Consistent with our strategic priority to strengthen our customer value proposition, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Steve Smith as Managing Director of our Americas region. Steve joins us following nearly eight years at CoreSite, where he most recently served as Chief Revenue Officer. Steve’s experienced expertise within the colo and connectivity segment in the U.S. will be invaluable as we look to accelerate and enhance the offering in our largest market. We welcome Steve and the team, and look forward to an upcoming start in July. Let’s move to our first quarter results. This quarter marks an important inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been anticipating in our core portfolio, as re-leasing spreads were positive across all products and in all regions, and scheduled price escalations translated into a positive inflection in our stabilized same capital portfolio growth year-over-year. New leasing during the quarter was $83 million, led by a strong 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, representing 57% of total signings, helped by the best quarter of interconnection science in company history. We continue to over-index towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with over 40% of the new signed leases in the quarter containing inflation length increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. During the first quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 122 new customers, continuing with the strength of 100 plus new logos that we’ve added each quarter since closing the Interxion transaction. Our key wins included a Global 500 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company, who are exiting their legacy data centers and expanding on platform digital to ensure European data governance and compliance; a Global 2000 insurance provider, doing a campus migration from a competing provider. A key differentiator for this new customer was improved resilience over the incumbent provider, together with robust multi-cloud connectivity and expansion capabilities. One of the largest public power companies in the U.S. and a new logo for Digital Realty is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to modernize its infrastructure with network and control hubs. This company is modernizing its infrastructure to embrace AI, improve analytics, and provide data to its B2B customers. One of the largest financial services firms is building a new trading platform with Digital Realty, driving an entirely new ecosystem to capture global trading as it happens. Their requirements include low latency and high performance. One of the largest global retailers also joined PlatformDIGITAL to support its local business presence, diversified transit nodes and rearchitect their network topology. Moving over to the power transmission issue in our largest market, Northern Virginia. We’ve continued to work constructively with the power divider in this market. And last quarter, we were pleased to be able to confirm the commitments that we have made to our customers. While the overarching conditions in this market have changed, we continue to work in partnership with the local providers to maximize potential availability within our 500-plus megawatt footprint. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we uniquely will be able to provide growth capacity for our customers in this market through new development and select churn opportunities. For now, Ashburn remains highly constrained and pricing is reflecting the decreased availability of data center capacity. Moving on to our investment activity. During the first quarter, we acquired a 3-acre parcel land in Osaka, Japan, through our MC Digital Realty joint venture to support future development. We also monetized the 10% interest in the data center in Ashburn, Virginia, in the quarter alongside our joint venture partner. While the transaction was driven by our partner and is not a meaningful component of our capital recycling plan for 2023, it did indeed demonstrate the appetite for well-located data centers and strong valuations. This asset was sold at a valuation of nearly $17 million per megawatt which represents a substantial premium to our development cost today for new data centers in this market and significant value creation. Given the ongoing process that we are undertaking to bolster our capital sources and increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, we remain confident in the institutional appetite to invest in data centers. Notably, over the course of the last few weeks, we have seen the announcement of the sale of a European hyperscale data center platform to a well-known global institutional investor on multiples that are consistent with where similar platforms have traded over the last few years. And we have witnessed the recapitalization of another data center platform by other institutional investors. We know that investors are eager to hear updates on our progress, and we will provide those once we have a transaction to announce. Since our IPO in 2004, concerns have been periodically raised about various potential risks to data centers, including technology, customers, demand, supply and obsolescence. This is somewhat par for the course for a relatively nascent and growing asset class. Over the last year or so, we have witnessed the latest misinformation campaign cast upon the data center sector by those interested in seeing the price of our stock goes down. I’d like to clarify a few important points. First, we operate a global portfolio of carrier-neutral and cloud-neutral data centers to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data among and between enterprises, service providers and individuals all over the world. While we are focused on building what we call the meeting place for service providers and enterprise customers who are in pursuit of hybrid multi-cloud end-state IT architectures. We are also facilitating the connectivity and communities of interest supporting latency-sensitive applications and platforms. These are things that cannot happen in a stand-alone on-prem data center and aren’t serviceable by a single cloud service provider. Second, in contrast to the narrative that hyperscalers have forced prices lower, after a few years of negative same-store growth, the tide is turned. As the supply of data center capacity in the low-cost abundant capital environment that exists for much [indiscernible] 10 years, has slowed meaningfully now that rates are higher and capital is more precious. With continued robust demand, strong net absorption has driven vacancy lower, which has been supportive of data center rents. Accordingly, our releasing spreads have inflected positively as have our same capital core growth metrics. Our team delivered on our objectives in the first quarter, and we reiterate the recoveries we anticipate for these metrics for 2023. Lastly, despite claims almost a year ago that hyperscalers would soon resource their data center requirements, 2022 was a record leasing year for Digital Realty, partly driven by demand from hyperscale customers. We believe the demand from these and other customers within our pipeline, driven by digital transformation and soon artificial intelligence remains robust. Data center support the growth and evolution of technology that is improving our standard of living, productivity and the overall quality of our lives. We have now witnessed a meaningful and sustained pullback in demand in the nearly 20 years that we’ve been in business, and we are not seeing a pullback today. While an economic recession could slow capital spending, third-party data centers also benefit from the trend towards outsourcing. Customers often make the decision to lease rather than build on the availability of capital titans [ph]. We saw the same thing during the great financial crisis. For many of our customers, data centers can also help drive revenue growth will facilitate lower costs or even enhance overall productivity. We are optimistic that our business will remain resilient in 2023 and for years to come. Before turning it over to Matt, I’d like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the first quarter, a leading ESG ratings provider included Digital Realty in their 2023 top-rated ESG company list, noting that we are in the top 6.5% of companies in the U.S. and Canada region. In addition, Digital Realty continues its efforts to incorporate renewable energy resources. We were named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as one of the EPA’s Top 25 Green Power Partners. We furthered our commitment to sustainability by signing a 10-year power purchase agreement for 116-megawatt share of a new solar project in Germany to increase our total solar and wind power under contract to over 1 gigawatt of renewable capacity. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced additional renewable to support our portfolio in Australia, while our business in Japan also announced renewable procurement for a portion of its portfolio. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a total of $83 million of new leases in the first quarter, highlighted by a second consecutive quarterly record in interconnection signings and continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category, particularly in EMEA, which nearly matched the record level from last quarter. 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for a robust 57% of total bookings. Our greater than a megawatt bookings moderated to $35 million in the quarter. Though this activity was broadly dispersed throughout our global portfolio with leases signed in Toronto, the U.S., Mexico, Europe and South Africa, but nothing in Northern Virginia. These deals can be lumpy and the downtick in the greater than a megawatt leasing follows a record year in 2022, in which we signed more than $370 million and 288 megawatts of new leases. Importantly, our demand funnel remains quite strong as a number of our highly strategic customers remain actively engaged and are seeking to add capacity across our global portfolio. Of course, as we have discussed on the last few calls our largest scale market, Northern Virginia, is experiencing capacity constraints as a result of the power transmission issues that emerged last summer. Over the course of the last three years, including the second half of 2022 we signed approximately $20 million per quarter of new leases in Northern Virginia, versus $2.5 million of new leases signed in this market in 1Q 2023. As I’ll expand on in a moment, we expect the ballast to lower new lease volume to show up in better pricing including renewal spreads. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog signed but not yet commenced leases was $434 million at quarter end, as commencements were once again well over $100 million, partly balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 16 months, principally due to a few larger long-term leases that require buildouts. During the first quarter, we signed $155 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 4.5% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing quarter since the early days of the pandemic. The strength was shared across both products and also across our three regions. So we’re off to a good start relative to our full year 2023 guidance. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued accelerating up 4.6% in the first quarter on $118 million of volume, nearly 400 basis points faster than it was in the final quarter of 2021, but also more than 100 basis points better than full year 2022. Greater than a megawatt renewals were similarly strong in the first quarter, as cash re-leasing spreads increased by 4.4% on $30 million of renewals. We were also pleased to see 100% of the leases signed in the quarter roll up in this category, and we remain optimistic about the potential for the rest of this year. Turning to our operating results. Our performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations, highlighted by the continued improvement in our core operating performance, higher development returns and a record quarter in interconnection revenue. In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 better versus prior quarter and a $0.01 light relative to last year. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As discussed on the last call, this revenue growth is somewhat distorted due to the significant increases in utility costs and reimbursements as the impact of last year’s energy price increases went into full effect in January. As most of you understand, the large majority of energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, while reimbursements remained a relatively consistent percentage of utility expenses at 92%. Due to a decline in spot energy prices between the fourth and first quarters, our top line revenue including utility reimbursements from our customers was more than $40 million below our original forecast, but this was directly mirrored by lower-than-expected utility expenses, since these expenses are directly borne by our customers. Interconnection revenue was up 5% sequentially, reflecting the ongoing improvement in our core operating performance. Other than utilities, expenses were well contained as NOI margins, excluding utilities, remained steady, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On our last two calls, we’ve highlighted the improvement in operating performance that started to emerge with our stabilized same capital portfolio, but was largely masked by FX headwinds. These positive trends strengthened further in the first quarter despite continued year-over-year currency headwinds. Same-capital cash NOI grew 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 1Q 2022, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we have been discussing. The step-up was driven by a 90 basis point improvement in same-store occupancy as commencements outpace churn, upside from annual rent escalators and the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads. Turning to our currency slide, 51% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 25% in euros, 6% in British pounds, 5% in Singapore dollars, 3% in South African rand and 2% in each of the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. The weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter provided a slight sequential tailwind, but the dollar’s strength through much of 2022 resulted in a continued headwind to year-over-year results. As a result, the dollar strength negatively impacted our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by about 300 basis points apiece on a year-over-year basis, whereas core FFO per share saw just under 200 basis points headwind. Turning to the balance sheet. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 7.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.4 times. In January, we completed a $740 million two year term loan with an initial maturity date at March 31, 2025, plus a one year extension option and an effective rate of 5.6%. Leverage remains above our historical average and our long-term target, and we intend to reduce our leverage toward our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our plan hasn’t changed. We are in active discussions on our asset sale and joint venture plans and remain confident in our ability to execute on these plans over the course of the year so that our leverage moves back towards the six times area by year-end. Our weighted average debt maturity is at five years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.8%. Approximately 82% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let’s turn to our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75. And our first quarter results were consistent with this range. We are also affirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion [ph] at the midpoint as the downward adjustment in our overall revenue guidance is purely due to lower utility expenses driven by lower spot electricity rates that are passed on directly to our customers. We are also modestly tweaking our year to U.S. dollar exchange rate expectations for the year to reflect the relative appreciation of the euro year-to-date. We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we remain confident in our funding plan for the year. So we have reiterated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital. We have tweaked our debt financing cost expectation to be consistent with the move in rate seen since the banking sector fall out last month, which will be largely mitigated by the upside we saw versus our core FFO expectation the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. 
Nick Del Deo: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to drill into the greater than 1-megawatt leasing a bit. Obviously, that’s been a bit below history in Q1, and you called out Ashburn as a driver of that. I guess, just thinking about some of the other drivers there, maybe can you expand upon the degree to which that was the result of making conscious decisions to maybe dial back a bit given the change in the cost of capital versus market conditions or other factors?
Andy Power: Hey, thanks Nick. So I’ll kick it off and I’ll hand it to Corey. I would say there’s no conscious decisions in dialing back or waving off business necessarily. You could see from our development life cycle, we’ve continued to raise the bar on our most strategic projects and fine-tuned capital allocations. The – I’d say it was a bit – it was a little bit lower than prior run rates. But if you look at the prior year, which was a record and had a record quarter in there in the third quarter, I wouldn’t say – I think I won’t over-index to anything other than call it the typical lumpiness you may have in that category. It was healthy in terms of pricing. I don’t think we had a single deal pricing below $100 per kilowatt. But Corey, do you want to expand?
Corey Dyer: Yes, I would tell you that – thanks, Nick. Nothing’s fundamentally really changed our relationship or our position with these hyperscalers in the greater than 1 megawatt category. Coming off, as Andy mentioned, I think, Matt, maybe did in the prepared remarks a record year, and so I’d tell you, this is probably just a one-quarter timing issue, our hyperscale demand remains really healthy and varies a little bit by customer, but it’s broad-based across the globe. Keep in mind, we didn’t do Ashburn deals on that this last quarter. And I’d say that they’re going through some digestion of their demand signals and maybe a little bit more scrutiny with the macro environment but really confident in the macro demand, our relationships to execute. And keep in mind; we had our highest and our largest connectivity quarter with the hyperscalers this last quarter. And so I just say that one quarter doesn’t make a trend. I’d suggest you look at the multi-quarter trends as well as they expand in new markets, new products like the advent of AI and their edge nodes that we’re winning and just new deployments across the globe. We’re in a really good position with them from a pipeline perspective and demand. Thanks, Nick.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you guys. And I guess, more generally, obviously, the price environment is pretty favorable for you right now. I guess, I’m interested in your thoughts on how you’re balancing between raising prices on new space and renewal deals where market conditions allow it versus kind of thinking holistically about your relationships with your top 10 or 15 or 20 customers you do business with globally, and trying not to alienate them or put the relationships.
Andy Power: Yes, Nick. So – I mean, we all – we’re always trying to take a holistic approach to these relationships. And as you see from our top customer list, our largest customers can be with 20, 30, 40, 50 different locations. At the same time, the pricing is dynamic to overall supply/demand dynamics. And as inventory in various markets become more and more precious, we’ve seen that pendulum pricing move in our favor. We try to be straight shooters with the customer. We try to bring all the – everything to the table in a holistic fashion. We’ve done this before in terms of bringing renewals and new business, expansions, all-in-one holistic approach. And I think this is not new. These are – these big hyperscale customers are seeing cost of doing business going up. Many of them self build themselves and see inflation in construction costs or labor. So I think the understanding that the pricing dynamic is shifting a little bit towards the providers is playing out in a natural fashion.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So on Corey’s response about kind of the leasing volumes telling us to look at kind of the prior multi-quarter trend, curious about interconnection and the trends going forward given kind of the strength there. And any kind of mix shift that you could kind of point to there may be more how you’re targeting your customers is a lot of that coming from existing logos or deserting your sales format to focus on interconnect-rich opportunities? And then, secondly, I guess, on the competitive front, given so many privately-backed companies that are deploying a lot of capital into the sector. Does that affect your hyperscale sales pipeline at all?
Andy Power: Sure. Thanks, Jon. On the first question, make Sharp and I’ll tag team that. I mean – I think I look at a few things. One, it’s a holistic approach to these customers. There’s a lot of good results in this quarter, whether it’s the new logos, inflecting up 15% quarter-over-quarter, which was a high for several quarters, whether it was the overall interconnection plus less than a megawatt signings, the regional contributions, including a standout interconnection quarter. And I’d also mention that this is a building momentum. It’s been building over time for several quarters now. I think it’s the power of the platform coming together, servicing our customers across 50-plus metros on six continents. It’s the great work Corey team has done with the go-to-market. And I still would say that we got even further progress and even better results to deliver over time. This particular quarter did have I’d say, a lumpier win, let’s call it, put it into the number one category interaction interconnection signings. So I’m not sure that’s necessarily repeatable next quarter with another record. But some of the work that we’re doing with service providers, I think Chris can touch on, I think it’s going to continue to build that momentum. But Chris, pick it up from that, please?
Chris Sharp: Yes. Appreciate it, Andy. And thanks for the question, Jon. A couple of dynamics here where I think we’ve led by our core existing products. And I think your direct question to, is it new logos or its existing, it’s both, right? I really want to emphasize the fact that the physical cross connects reaching 214,000 and growing, it’s something that we constantly have looked at and Andy referenced this earlier, growing the platform, right, investing and making sure that customers know how to access one another to get further value out of the deployment is absolutely important to us. And so just really watching how that evolves over time. And with the advent of the ServiceFabric and bringing that to market and what that’s being able to do for our customers, we’re just starting to see – it’s early innings, but future growth on virtual, right, where it’s going to be married to where now they’re going to be able to access multiple destinations in a more simplistic fashion, because of that product being purpose built in the way that we brought it to market, it really removes a lot of the technical complexity that has precluded other customers from getting the full value out of the deployment. But one of the things I’m just very pleased about is this customer-led and balanced approach that we’ve been doing on even new markets inside of Europe. We’ve talked about in the past where just bringing the value or the pricing closer to parity in some of these markets – we see really strong growth within Germany and France, where making sure that we’re delivering those capabilities to those customers in all these critical markets around the globe. And I would just say lastly, I’m pleased with the fact that Digital has been able to provide one of the greatest quarters of interconnection signings in the company’s history, and that’s just really representative of the value we’re bringing to the customers.
Andy Power: And then, Jon, just around your second question about call it competition from private back, one, that’s not a new phenomenon. We’ve been competing against private players for some time now and the ones that have been taken private they’ve been private for, call it, multiple years for some of them. I think what’s changed is the ability to deliver this business for our customers has just gotten harder and harder, and at a global scale. And whether it’s power, constraints, staffing, supply chains – and certainly, cost and access to capital has certainly not been a friend of some of our competitors. And I think our largest customers in the hyperscale arena turn to us given our permanence in our space. We’re not here, gone tomorrow, we’ve invested for the long run, we’re future-proofing that growth, we’re constantly building for that growth with our suppliers and I think all those things probably make it leave a little bit more advantageous versus some of those private bank names in an environment like today.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen: Great. Thank you. I was hoping if we could talk about the leverage target. You guys reiterated getting down to six times leverage, and I know you’re working through these various transactions. But I guess if you complete the $2 billion of transactions. I, mean, does that get you to six times? Like, can you just give us the moving pieces on getting to that target?
Matt Mercier: Yes, thanks. So I mean, the simple answer is, yes. So our capital plan, I think, as we laid out last quarter, and it really hasn’t changed coming into this quarter, is based on, call it, $2-plus billion of capital recycling from our joint venture opportunities as well as the potential for noncore dispositions. And as that capital comes in as well as our expected growth in EBITDA this year, which is a little shy of 10%, we believe that by the end of the year, largely those two items will get us back towards that six times area this year.
Jon Petersen: Okay, great. And then if I could just ask on development. I’m curious, given the shift in cost of capital, like what’s the minimum development yield? Or maybe you just talk broadly about how much those requirements for you guys have moved in the last year or so? Like, what does it take for you guys to start a development today in terms of return expectations?
Andy Power: Thanks, Jon. I mean, we do an incredibly granular market-by-market assessment here. So, it really depends on the market and the relative risk fee rates and risk premiums. I would just by and large, and this is not something that just showed up in our approach this quarter, three quarters ago almost, we basically took a posture that we need to raise the bar on capital allocation and prioritize our most strategic projects, call it, highest return, not only highest return, but also projects to generate the high long-term growth as well. So I don’t have a single number answer to get – to give you there, but I think you will see that come through our development returns at table as those numbers are inching into higher territory, and I can tell you more strategic long-term growth projects.
Jon Petersen: Great. Thank you.
Andy Power: Okay.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the capital recycling topic. And just when we look at the guidance page, there is a wide range of outcomes. And what would be a good outcome for Digital in terms of the yield? And what would the scenario be in which you may just decide there is alternative forms of capital that are better than recycling? And then just a second topic but related, if I could take a step back. As I think about the comments you’ve made about considering both stabilized assets and development for monetization, just curious if there is a more profound change in the business strategy and financial model that investors should be mindful of in terms of how this business, over the next couple of years, might look different in terms of the quantum of investment in a given year and the level of financial performance that you’re driving off of those investments, just following on the comments you just made. Thanks.
Andy Power: So Mike, a good outcome is we essentially get the, call it, $2 billion of funding completed and the range is wide, but the majority of that capital, the range is not that wide. The wide range is due to some of the noncore asset sales as well as the development, which is, call it, 25% of the $2 billion, right? But if you look at the majority, the 75%, which is stabilized joint ventures or development, development, those were zero yielding projects. On stabilized joint ventures, I think, the cap rates are in the low single-digit type category based on what we’re seeing called six-ish type territory. And I think that’s based on not what we see externally by third-party transactions. What we’ve seen on recent transactions with partners that we can recapitalize with our portfolio and through our progress on these capital recycling and joint venture efforts. Holistically, more longer term here, we are looking to become more balance sheet efficient. What’s not new is, call it, finishing out the noncore dispose, what’s not new is joint venturing majority states in stabilized hyperscale-oriented projects that have lower long-term growth rates due to the credit quality and size of the customers, be it through rent bumps or pricing power. What is new is sharing a piece of both of our North America and EMEA development as it relates to hyperscale projects. And we’re doing that with a view that these projects keep getting larger, and larger and larger. That non-income producing drag it remains a headwind, even though it is a significant long-term value creation. And we believe there is ample partners to work with us on those projects which will ultimately make our balance sheet more efficient and more rapidly accelerate revenue and EBITDA drop into our bottom line.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great, thanks for taking the questions here. I guess first, just to double-click on what you said about balance sheet efficiency. As it relates to the development JV, aside from recouping the previously spent CapEx, is the intention of that JV to structurally reduce the on-balance sheet CapEx for digital? Or is the intention to keep CapEx more or less the same while being able to increase the set of opportunities you can pursue? And then I have a follow-up.
Andy Power: The simple answer, Michael, is we’re looking to partner around large-scale development projects where there will be incremental spend that we and our partner will jointly fund over time. So that it will – we’re looking for – these are large projects, large swaths of acreage, large quantities and megawatts. Hence, the quality of capital or spend is not the entirety or near the entirety of where the project ultimately will be over time. So they would fund alongside us through the coming quarters.
Michael Elias: Okay. Maybe just to shift gears a little bit. Earlier on the call today, you’re really emphasizing the steps you’ve made on the colo/enterprise side. Today, you also announced the appointment of Steve Smith. Clearly a focus on accelerating colo and connectivity, I mean, my question for you would be, as we consider the path ahead, what are the changes that you feel need to be made internally in order for you to really accelerate on that, call it, 0 to 1 megawatt side? Thanks.
Andy Power: So Michael, I mean, again, I think this ties back to the first three strategic priorities I laid out in the prior call about really strengthening – demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. We took advantage of this call to remind folks that this is not something we started with me becoming the CEO four months ago. This is something that’s been in the works for roughly eight years through both inorganic and organic measures, putting together critical puzzle pieces, expanding across the globe in terms of where the customers need our capacity, adding connectivity hubs and innovating and bringing more to our customers, adding – we’ve changed up our go-to-market motion over time. What we go from here is, again, accelerating from that success. A piece of that – delighted to have Steve Smith on board to lead our essentially newly created Americas region. Steve comes with a tremendous background of really driving the – one of the only U.S.-only focused interconnection and colo platforms in a prior – previously a very formidable competitor. And I think he’s going to be very added to that our team, our leadership table. The incremental things that we’re doing in terms of continuing to innovate and bring more value to our customers. Chris touched upon ServiceFabric, which I still would characterize as just out of the bar in terms of where we’re going in terms of bringing more partners onto that platform, and drilling more value to our customers. We are – there’s a whole host of things that I’d say we’re doing behind the scenes to continue to accelerate our growth. And I think the fruits of our labor are continuing to build each and every quarter in terms of success. So I think there’s multiple angles that we are moving towards in that endeavor to be one of a very short list of global interconnection colo providers. And I think the industry demands and the broader competitive backdrop are also our wins at our sales.
Corey Dyer: And then Andy, just one thing to add from a go-to-market perspective. We’ve had a ton of success around the channel. We’re continuing to grow the channel. I think this last quarter, 38% of our new logos were from the channel. Prior years, it was 31%. We’re continuing to build on that success. We see the channel as being a huge advocate and a partner through their lens with all the enterprises. So we’re going to see that continue to build. So we’re doing a lot of functional and strategic operational items that we need to do. We’re also continuing to tweak and evolve our go-to-market, we think it’s going to continue to add value.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. On the re-leasing spreads, thinking about greater than a megawatt in particular, but kind of with all of them, is there anything you see coming up in the year that could possibly push those spreads back negative by any large renegotiations? And then what is sort of the longer-term outlook with the bookings down a little bit, but pricing doing better, what sort of yield are we looking at going forward per se, you’ve got in the last couple of years when the bookings were higher?
Andy Power: I’ll let Matt, take it off in re-leasing spreads and we can tag some longer term outlook pieces.
Matt Mercier: Yes. So thanks, Frank. I think, one, first, I’d reiterate, we’re obviously off to a great start here with positive re-leasing spreads, again, not only across all product types, but across all regions. I will say, we’re – we feel confident that this positive pricing environment that we’re in is sustainable and it’s here to stay. I’m not going to necessarily speak about every single quarter. But again, I’d come back and reiterate that we’re off to a great start. We see – and we see that come for full year that we expect to be positive for the full year, not only in the 0 to 1 megawatt category but also in the greater than a megawatt category, which I think is, again, something we haven’t seen in a few years. And reflects the positive environment and turn in fundamentals that we’re seeing not only from that, but then down into our stabilized portfolio as well.
Andy Power: Frank, do you want – do you mind repeating that second part of your question just to make sure we hear it correctly?
Frank Louthan: Yes. I mean, leasings are down a little bit, obviously better pricing. What does the yield look like now per se, the last couple of years ago when bookings were higher and so forth? And how long do you think this is sustainable? What sort of yields are you seeing coming in now even though the absolute bookings are a little bit lower?
Andy Power: Yes. Frank, I’d direct you to our development table to follow, see the progression of yields. There’s – I would say the yields are improving in our favor. The pricing dynamic is outpacing the inflationary pressures. It’s not an overnight phenomenon, but we are moving into a better territory. I mean, you can look at episodic things like Ashburn, Virginia, where quite frankly, the rates have pretty much doubled in a pretty short time from deals in the, call it, low $70s to now call it, market rates of, call it, $140, and that’s flowing to the bottom line and enhancing those deals dramatically. So I think that table is a work in progress in our sub because it’s got a lot of pre-leasing, some of which was signed prior to some of this price progression. But as we continue to add more projects to that, that they are not pre-leased or we fill out the leasing on the available capacity, I think there’s ability to raise those yields. And I would also say the North America piece of that has a large project in it that is an open book build-to-suit to a very highly rated financial institution on a triple net lease basis. So it’s an apple to the oranges there in a good way. It’s been dramatically derisked in terms of its build and in terms of its ongoing revenue and EBITDA stream at the same time, lowering our Americas yields.
Frank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Andy, in the press release, you were quoted as saying that you’re seeing broad-based demand and reduced data center availability. I was just wondering, why do you think that isn’t translating into outsized growth in rental rates like we’ve seen across other commercial real estate sectors like industrial or self-storage? And it definitely feels like the pendulum has firmly swung back to landlords, but data center rents just aren’t rising like we’ve seen elsewhere.
Andy Power: I would say, I mean, it’s a new phenomenon in terms of recent history of the data centers, which is still, I’d call a nascent asset class, but we are seeing it. If you look at, call it, our less than a megawatt signings, either the Americas region or EMEA region where there’s critical consistent massive new signings, the rates have been up, call it, four quarters in a row. And that example I gave you, in Ashburn, Virginia, from rates going from $70 plus E [ph] to $140 plus E. That is quite a run. And I know I’m picking out one particular market there, an example, but it is the largest and most diverse market out there, our largest market as well. And it’s flanks the East Coast with a power constraint problem, but the West Coast is having the same low with Santa Clara now having power constraints to likely outpace when power comes online in Virginia. And I think this phenomenon is going to continue in other parts of the world, not just the U.S. And I think you’re going to continue to see those rates move more and more favor. David, I know you’re a student of the traditional real estate asset classes. I mean, it was a good 20 years where industrial had no rate growth before it’s had the renaissance that’s been experienced in the last few years. And I’m not saying that that’s going to happen to data centers, but it feels like we’re teeing ourselves up way for a healthier pricing environment for the incumbents.
David Guarino: That’s encouraging to hear. And then maybe kind of sticking with that theme, you said we’ve been hearing some similar chatter also about difficulty securing power in some other markets. I’ve heard Chicago come on the radar and possibly even Hillsboro now. So given just – it feels like these are popping up everywhere across the industry, what do you think that means for your pace of new leasing activity going forward? I mean, are the things we saw in the years past probably unlikely to happen just given the power constraints?
Andy Power: Yes, if you look at our financials, we’ve got a sizable amount of contiguous land capacity and available power that’s committed to us outside of these, call it, zones of disruption. But longer term, eventually we will exhaust that and you could have that phenomenon. At the same time, when you’re doing business at twice the rates, you have to sell half the kilowatts in certain markets. So, I’m not sure that the top-line pacing on our new signings will be all that disrupted near term based on what we have in this table in terms of capabilities and estimated power. But I agree with you this assessment and it’s going to continue. The other thing I’d emphasize is, we’re actively managing our platform and our capabilities, and we’re essentially always looking to reproductize for higher, better use when applicable. So if we have churn, which this is not a totally static business, it provides opportunity to release that capacity at higher rate opportunities and often higher better uses towards some granular enterprise colocation oriented customers. And on a big company like digital, you probably don’t see that. It’s not top of the waves, but that’s happening in terms of how we manage our footprint.
David Guarino: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two, if I could. First, on the capital recycling, not to beat a dead horse, but you did talk about being deeply engaged in the process. I’m just wondering if there’s any more color you can share on the progress made thus far across the different buckets that you’ve laid out? And then maybe switching gears. On AI, I mean, we’ve heard so much about this over the last several months. I’m just wondering how the increased focus on AI impacted your customer leasing plans and your conversations with them as they think about deployment plans over the next year? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, Matt. I’m going to have Greg tackle the first one and then Sharp and I can both tackle the second one.
Greg Wright: Thanks, Matt. Look, I’d say, look, with respect to our capital initiatives, I’d say we’re still on track with the plan we outlined in our earnings call in early February. But you should recall that was the $500 million of the noncore dispositions, call it, roughly $750 million from core JVs and $750 from million development JVs. And I would characterize it without saying too much, is that we’re making good progress in these transactions. And we’ve received significant interest from multiple institutional partners, whether it’s sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure funds, PE, real estate funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So the way I’d characterize it is we’re executing on plan. And we feel good about where we are into these processes.
Andy Power: And turning to your second question – just one quick thing for I turn over to Chris GBT [ph] to give his view on AI. The – I think a misnomer here is that, in my opinion, that everyone thinks every data center is going to turn into one that’s going to be supporting artificial intelligence. The use cases, the applications, the workloads that exist today are still going to be thriving within the global data center footprint and digital. Yes, we have many data centers that lend themselves towards supporting the increasing power densities and cooling environments that will be required, and we’re doing a lot of that as we speak. But I look at more – the bigger picture around AI is that this is an incremental major wave of long-term demand that will certainly need to have proximity to the major data that sits today. And the first two waves of demand of moving from on-prem locations to hybrid locations and the second wave of multi-cloud haven’t even hit the shore yet while this next wave of demand, it is falling behind it. But Chris, why don’t you speak a little your view on AI?
Chris Sharp: Yes. No, absolutely. I appreciate the question. A couple of pieces. Just to reiterate what Andy said, the existing cloud infrastructure we have today, AI is cloud adjacent because of a lot of the applications, it’s empowering and the way the customers are bringing it to market it’s something we’ve been watching for many, many years. And I think one of the pieces I always try to emphasize is that a lot of the R&D from the hyperscalers and from the technological providers has been happening within digital, which has allowed us to evolve our infrastructure with this demand. And I would reiterate also that there are pockets of AI that we’re able to support rather efficiently. And I think this is something that’s unique to Digital’s designs and the R&D work that we’ve been doing with some of the cooling technologies. It’s really important for us to continue to support the broader spectrum of the customer requirements, so not only their traditional type of digital transformation, but we are seeing more and more customers show up with AI specific requirements and association with that digital transformation. And then the last one is, really emphasizing that to the customer base to design early and understand the implications of not only the power, but the interconnectivity. And just to circle back to why we believe the value of from Digital is differentiated is the ability to interconnect in an open fashion with the right partners in a very simplistic manner is what’s making a lot of these AI deployments successful. And so that’s the core of how we continue to focus on AI and bringing that to market in a very repeatable fashion. And so you’ll see some recent sales tools we’ll start talking about publicly to visualize how you tie together this infrastructure on a global basis. So very exciting about this additive demand coming to market, and you’ll see more and more of the use cases and case studies coming out on the success that our customers are having within Platform Digital.
Operator: The last question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hey. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. I wanted to touch base on Ashburn, it sounds like the transmission line has been approved to be in service by late 2025 year at Digital Dallas. So when do you think you might be able to start additional development in that market? And do you think you’re seeing any spillover impacts in terms of other markets or submarkets where you’re seeing additional activity levels because of the tightness in Ashburn? And I guess just related to that on the pricing front, I think you mentioned that you’re seeing rents as high as $140. I think a lot of your rents in Ashburn are rolling at $80 or $90. So just wondering if you have any color on what you’ve seen on the re-leasing spreads across that market and what you expect going forward? Thank you.
Andy Power: Thanks Eric. And we touched a little bit on this in the prepared remarks. The good news is that the powers that be in the region are sorting out ways to bring incremental power to the region by 2026. I think the – from there, I think you’ll see a much more rational providing power to that market. And I do think it’s going to move ourselves to be our history and track record of working in that region is going to keep us top of queue when power becomes more freely. Between now and then we – last quarter, had a good fortune having worked with the local providers to be able to deliver on all of our customer commitments, which is fantastic. We do believe that we will be able to bring on incremental growth capacity in this market between now and 2026 through called some development as well as some churn. We are working through all the resources we have in terms of excess power at sites, customers that may not be using their suites and be able to go to spare some capacity. So I don’t have a fine point of the quantity, but I don’t believe our shelves at Digital will be bearing, and we will be able to support our customers. Certainly our colocation customers and some of our hyperscale customers we’ll be able to grow with Digital in Ashburn in the coming years. And then as we get a finer point on the quantities probably in lockstep with leasing in that capacity, we’ll certainly be happy to share. In terms of spillover effect, the spillover is real. Manassas, I think is front center of a spillover market to the Loudoun County pinch point. I would say that’s – we’ve seen the greatest spillover effect. But there’s always potential some of the non-Northern Virginia markets will continue to but at auction. But I don’t think – I don’t see anyone packing their wagons and leaving Ashburn due to this. I think the momentum has been building for years, and it’s called out escape velocity in terms of its criticality to the data center industry and its customers.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I’d now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.
Andy Power: Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty is off to a strong start to the year. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with customers which was confirmed by our record interconnection signings, continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category and strong new logo additions. We expect that our operating momentum will continue through the year and the steps we are taking will further accelerate our progress. We also remain confident in our funding plan, and I look forward to updating you with further developments on this front at the appropriate time. We are very excited to bring together our customers and partners on May 24th and 25th at our Marketplace Live 2023 event. The theme this year is the crossroads of the digital world, the data meeting place. The entire digital realty community from around the world will come together virtually to network, gain inspiration and bring their digital strategies to life.

I’d like to thank everyone for joining us today and say a special thank you to our hard working and exceptional team and Digital Realty to help keep the digital world running. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now all disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-16 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty’s Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, Andrea and welcome everybody to Digital Realty’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today’s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter. First, the combination of strong demand and tightening levels of supply are translating into broad-based price improvements, which is reflected in the increased re-leasing spread expectations and the positive inflection in stabilized NOI growth that we are forecasting for 2023. Second, we remain focused on achieving the highest potential returns on investment and some progress on this front is evident in the sequential improvement in our development pipeline yields. And third, as most of you already know, we have made some changes to our management team since we last reported. Andy and Matt both have a long history with Digital and as expected, the transition has been seamless. But just as important, they also bring fresh perspective and energy to their new roles and the team remains excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.
Andy Power: Thanks, Jordan and thanks to everyone for joining our call. While my voice is probably pretty familiar to most of you, this is my first earnings call as CEO of Digital Realty. I am honored to lead Digital Realty’s incredible global team and I am optimistic and excited as ever about the opportunity that lies ahead. I want to thank both the Board for their confidence in me and the support that they provide in executing our strategy and thank Bill Stein, who I first met in 2004 as we worked together on Digital’s IPO for his leadership over these many years. Finally, I want to thank the numerous customers, partners, team members and shareholders for the kind words of support and encouragement that I have received over the past 2 months. When I joined Digital in 2015, we are primarily a North American scale data center provider. Since then, we have evolved the company to be a global provider of the full spectrum of scale, co-location and interconnection solutions to better serve the growing needs of our 4,000 plus customers. Today, Digital is the global data center leader with an unmatched footprint of over 300 data centers in over 50 metro areas in 28 countries on 6 continents. Globally, our portfolio comprises of more than 2.3 gigawatts of IT load and we have another 400 plus megawatts under construction. I am extremely proud of the success that we’ve had and the position that we are in. But now is not the time to rest on our laurels as the path that has brought us to where we are today will not get us to where we want to be. In that being, we have swiftly taken action on a few fronts. First, we quickly backfilled the role of CFO with my long-time finance partner, Matt Mercier. Matt has played a leadership role across Digital’s global finance organization for well over a decade, including the successful integration of multiple platform acquisitions and the implementation of systems that will provide the foundation for our operations and evolving strategy. Second, we aligned and combined our strategy of business segments and investments team to assure that we have the right capabilities and are making the right investments in order to deliver the global meeting place for service providers and enterprises. Third, we moved to align all technology under our Chief Technology Officer, including our CISO and our recently appointed Chief Information Officer which will support the acceleration of our journey and identity as both a technology and a real estate company. Recent product launches, including service fabric, demonstrate the potential of bringing together innovation and technology to help drive our customers’ growth. Lastly, we further streamlined our global operations capabilities to maximize the potential of Digital Realty’s 300 plus data centers and our people under the trusted hand of a long-time digital leader with a track record of bringing global teams together. And here is what’s next on the agenda in terms of the top strategic priorities. First, as depicted on Slide 3, we will demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition. Through the continued execution of our meeting place strategy by delivering sustainable connectivity-rich solutions to our enterprise and service provider customers, which will translate into better organic growth over the medium and long-term. Along these lines, yesterday, we announced a new AWS Direct Connect on-ramp at Digital Realty’s Ashburn campus, landing one of the highest consumption markets and adding coast-to-coast U.S. coverage to our robust existing portfolio of AWS Direct Connect locations across EMEA. And earlier this month, we advanced our commitment to sustainability with a new 10-year power purchase agreement for 116 megawatts of renewable energy, supporting the construction of a new solar park in Germany. Second, we are integrating and innovating our capabilities across our entire unmatched global asset portfolio and have topped the largest open network platform in the world. Many of these integration and innovation efforts will benefit both our customers as they seek to deploy new and complex workloads on the leading data center platform and our own internal team, unifying our ability to deliver value to the market. Lastly, many of you are familiar with my many fishing poles in the water mantra. And in this vein, we plan to further diversify and bolster our sources of capital in order to support our customer’s rapidly growing digital infrastructure needs, while improving capital efficiency and returns for Digital Realty investors. The opportunity before us is tremendous. We have all the key ingredients at our fingertips and a long runway for growth. When I assessed the digital infrastructure landscape today, including its fundamental prospects and then how Digital Realty is positioned within this sector, I’d say the following. First, demand for our product remains quite strong and well supported by ongoing digital transformation, migration to the cloud, and the overall evolution towards centralized compute. As it goes, technology begets technology. And the growth in high-performance compute infrastructure has driven innovation that tends to spur the next wave of growth in technology that in many respects, advances productivity and hopefully, over time, driving improvement to the overall quality of our lives. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last decade continue, we may now be on the precipice of the next wave of demand that will drive our sector for the next decade. For years, we have referenced new technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning as potential drivers of demand, but there have been relatively few identifiable workloads over specific infrastructure requirements tied to those specific technologies. The launch of ChatGPT 3.0 is a seemingly important milestone. Microsoft’s incorporation of ChatGPT into Bing last week, Google is coming with the launch of Bard and Baidu’s Ernie Bot all suggest that we are on the forefront of the broader introduction of AI, which could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale. This is our domain expertise. We are in the very early days of this technology and its potential and have yet to see the effects of its introduction in the data center sector, but we are well positioned to support our customers and partners and we are working diligently to understand how their requirements will evolve and making sure to incorporate these into our latest designs. Importantly, as we experience with the cloud, the advent of new technology can play out over a very extended timeframe. We have built Digital Realty with these timeframes in mind and plan to be there to support our existing and growing customer base across the globe in the future. Let’s move to the quarter. Our core FFO landed within the implied guidance range that we provided last quarter as the term that is taking shape in our core portfolio continued to gain momentum. Capping off another record year of bookings, new leases signed moderated from the record we achieved in the prior quarter, but remained quite strong and were highlighted by a nice rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection bookings. Demand was geographically broad-based with strong contributions from APAC, the Americas and EMEA. This demonstrates the breadth and momentum that we are seeing in this business, which is a reflection of our ongoing effort to deliver the meeting place for our service provider and enterprise customers. During the fourth quarter, we added 106 new customers, continuing the streak of 100 plus new logos that we have added each quarter since closing the InterXion transaction nearly 3 years ago. One of our key wins during the fourth quarter was an expansion of our relationship with Avnet, a leading global technology distributor and solution provider and a member of the Fortune 500. Avnet Integrated has standardized on PlatformDIGITAL for an initial three market deployment in Northern Virginia, Dallas and Silicon Valley. This partnership enables high-performance, cost effective computing solutions that can be deployed quickly in Digital Realty facilities globally while mitigating risk and complexity. A major global automotive manufacturer deploying internationally chose PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging Digital Realty’s unrivaled global footprint and ability to manage complex deployments. 4 of the world’s largest financial institutions, including 3 of the 10 largest in Europe selected PlatformDIGITAL seeking network-oriented solutions ranging from hybrid IT, trading and market data support to high-performance computing and more. A leading global asset manager and service provider leveraged Digital Realty’s HPE GreenLake alliance to significantly reduce networking and IT infrastructure complexity. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased yet again in the fourth quarter in each of our business segments, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of price improvements in 2022. We also continue to add more CPI-based escalators with approximately 25% of the newly signed leases in the quarter containing inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. We also saw another quarter of positive leasing spreads on renewals in the fourth quarter, helping to support a positive inflection for the full year 2022. While we acknowledge that the turn was driven by the strength in the 0 to 1 megawatt renewals, we are beyond the point of excuses and call us and prefer to highlight the forest rather than the trees and point to the overall inflection in market rents and re-leasing spreads that took place in 2022 as a whole. We expect market conditions to remain supportive this year and our guidance reflects a further inflection in this positive trend as Matt will lay out in a few minutes. Speaking of better pricing, I’d like to provide an update on our largest market in Northern Virginia. We have continued to work constructively with the power provider in this market and we are now pleased to be in a position to say that we fully expect to be able to deliver on the commitments that we have made to our customers within our development pipeline. So while conditions are far from business as usual in this market, we are encouraged by the progress made over the last 90 days and remain hopeful that we will continue to be able to work with a local utility provider to support the growing needs of our mutual customers. Moving on to our investment activity. During the fourth quarter, we sold a 25% interest in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany to digital core REIT. The facility was valued at nearly $500 million and the transaction generated about $150 million of proceeds for Digital Realty. We also acquired land in 5 different metros for future development, including 2 organic new market entries into Rome and Akra [ph]. Rome is one of the largest cities in Europe by population, but has been essentially ignored by international data center providers. We have acquired a parcel within 15 kilometers off the coast that will make it an ideal interconnection point for future subsea cables that land in Rome, thereby enhancing our position in the Mediterranean while serving as a connectivity hub in the middle of the country. Before turning it over to Matt, I’d like to reiterate my focus on ESG and share some of our recent progress with you. We were recognized by a variety of organizations for our ESG success, including for the sixth consecutive year, Digital was recognized by NAREIT with the Leader in the Light Award for Data Center sustainability. Sustainalytics recently included Digital Realty in the 2023 top-rated ESG company list. Newsweek recently named Digital as one of America’s most responsible companies for 2023 and once again, Digital is one of the JUST Capital’s Most JUST Companies. In addition to these awards, given the importance of energy security, availability and sustainability, Digital remains keenly focused on supporting the development of renewable power projects. During 2022, we contracted for a total of 470 megawatts of renewable energy and in green access to the energy grid and we already added another 160 megawatts of solar power to our portfolio in 2023. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to our new CFO to review our financial results, let me introduce Matt Mercier to those of you who don’t already know him. Matt joined Digital in 2006 and has been my right-hand man, helping me run Digital’s finance team. Matt has been intimately involved in nearly every facet of finance at Digital from capital markets to M&A, FP&A, IR and all things global finance. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to our new CFO, Matt Mercier.
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Andy. I am privileged to succeed Andy as CFO and humbled by the opportunity to lead an incredibly capable team. Over the years, I have had a chance to meet and spend time with many of you and I look forward to catching up with all of you over the course of the next several months at industry conferences and events that we are slated to attend. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $117 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, highlighted by strong rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection signings, which accounted for 40% of total bookings. Demand was geographically diverse, particularly within the greater than a megawatt segment, which saw nearly even contributions across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. 9 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter landed outside of North America, with strong contributions from Japan, South Africa, Latin America and Europe, demonstrating the increasingly global nature of our footprint and customer base. At the other end of the scale, somewhat in contrast to the hesitation we noted on our last call, we saw a nice bounce back within our smallest customer segment under 500 kilowatts, which delivered the second best quarterly leasing volume of 2022 at the highest average rate seen all year. Geographically, our 0 to 1 megawatt deals play to our strengths in EMEA and the Americas with EMEA setting a quarterly record for 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased for the fourth consecutive quarter in each of our 0 to 1 and greater than a megawatt segments, reflecting improving fundamentals and tightening conditions across our regions. In the fourth quarter, we experienced nearly 90% customer retention and a further reduction in churn to just 0.8%, marking the lowest level in nearly 3 years, as our customers’ digital infrastructure requirements continue to increase, but the prospect of future availability is decreasing. Turning to our backlog. On Page 9, the current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases increased to a record $477 million at year end, principally due to the inclusion of Teraco as other signings were largely offset by commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated slightly in the quarter, but remained elevated relative to historical levels at nearly 15 months due to a few larger longer term leases that require build-outs. Approximately, 60% of our record backlog is slated to commence throughout this year, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halves. Moving on to Page 10, we signed $195 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter with pricing increases of 0.8% on a cash basis. For the full year, we renewed nearly $700 million of existing business at a 1.8% increase on a cash basis, a touch better than our upwardly revised guidance of slightly positive for 2022. Renewal rates in the fourth quarter for 0 to 1 megawatt renewals remained strong across each of our three regions and were up 4.1% overall, the strongest quarterly increase since adding interaction. As Andy referenced, we did see a 3.6% decline on renewals in the greater than a megawatt category in the quarter, entirely due to a single lease at a single asset. However, we saw a better-than-anticipated improvement in market rents and an inflection in re-leasing spreads in 2022. More importantly, market conditions improved throughout the last year and our guidance for 2023 reflects this positive trend. Turning to our results. Digital Realty delivered operating and financial performance in the fourth quarter that was largely consistent with our expectations, highlighted by improving core operating performance, progress toward enhancing our returns on investment and increased liquidity. Let’s jump into the metrics on Page 11. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per share of $1.65, consistent with the low end of our implied guidance range for the fourth quarter and down 1% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, given a seasonal acceleration in operating expenses, a significant uptick in interest rates and a full quarter’s dilution associated with the acquisition of Teraco on August 1. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was down 1% sequentially, but was up 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2022, we reported constant currency core FFO per share of $6.91, representing 6% growth over 2021. The improvement in operating performance is best gauged by our stabilized same capital portfolio, which was challenged in the first half of the year, but improved meaningfully in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when stripping out the noise related to FX. Focusing on top line, data center revenue growth on a constant currency basis improved steadily throughout 2022 increasing by 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 1.8% decline in the first quarter, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we flagged last quarter. The sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q was largely driven by an 80 basis point improvement in occupancy as commencements outpace churn as well as the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads and growing interconnection revenues. Turning to our currency slide on Page 12. 56% of our fourth quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 20% in euros, 7% in British pounds, 6% in Singapore dollars and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar reversed course from the strength we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year, removing the headwind on reported sequential growth. Nevertheless, the dollar was meaningfully stronger than it was versus 2021, negatively impacting our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 500 basis points a piece. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 13. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.9x, while fixed charge coverage was at 4.9x. Given the sharp recovery in the euro and the pound in the fourth quarter and the convention of how leverage is calculated with the average exchange rate used for calculated adjusted EBITDA and the spot rate used to mark our debt at year-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was inflated by approximately 0.2 turns using the average exchange rate to mark our debt at year-end. Our leverage would be 6.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Since our last call, we drew the remaining $500 million outstanding from our 2021 forward equity offering and tapped our 5.55% 2028 notes for an additional $350 million to bring the total amount raised on that bond to $900 million. Since year-end, we also closed a $740 million 2-year term loan with a 1-year extension option. It’s also worth mentioning that our investment grade credit ratings were affirmed with stable outlooks by all three rating agencies since our last call. While leverage is above our historical average and our long-term target, we have bolstered our liquidity, and we intend to reduce leverage towards our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.7%. Approximately 86% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let’s turn to our guidance on Page 14. We have provided an initial core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75, reflecting flat growth at the midpoint of the range. as the recovery in our stabilized portfolio is balanced by the impact of higher interest expense and capital recycling. Focusing in on the organic recovery we forecast for 2023, we expect Cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads to improve to greater than 3%, same capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and an 80 basis point uplift in total portfolio occupancy at the midpoint of our expected range by year-end. Importantly, as Andy referenced at the outset, one of our key priorities is to further diversify and bolster our capital sources, which is geared towards increasing our capital efficiency and investment returns while reducing leverage towards our long-term target. As reflected in this guidance, throughout 2023, we expect to recycle capital from a combination of non-core dispositions, joint ventures of core assets and joint ventures of scale development in select core markets. In addition, we expect to benefit from high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, the retention of free cash flow and the moderation of recent currency headwinds. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thanks and congrats, Andy and Matt on the new role. Maybe just starting on the balance sheet, the $2 billion in asset sales and JV is targeted for the year. Can you give us some additional color on the split between the two, the types of assets, the timing and pricing is a pretty wide range? Anything you can add on that front?
Andy Power: Thanks, Ari. This is Andy. Why don’t I kick it off, and then I’ll hand it to Greg on, call it, valuations and we will receive in a broader asset class. So it’s $2 billion at the midpoint as our funding plan. As a reminder, this has been part of our playbook for several years. I think we’ve either sold outright or joint venture close to $4 billion of assets over the last handful of years. The competition is really threefold: one called rounding therapies or completion of our non-core assets, disposition program; selling outright to joint ventures around our stabilized assets; and three, joint ventures around our development program. Rough ballpark on numbers, I would say, the non-core dispositions are probably in the 500-ish area and the other two buckets are taking up the majority of the $2 billion at the midpoint. Greg, do you want to come in on valuations and broader?
Greg Wright: Yes. Thanks, Ari. Look, I think when you look at the – let’s look at first at the stabilized JVs and the development JVs, I mean, clearly, we are seeing strong demand for those assets. The private markets have a strong bid for those assets given the quality of the assets, stability of the income stream, the creditworthiness of the customer base. And the fact, quite frankly, that’s a hard asset class with strong secular demands we’ve seen really a significant rotation in the data center space from private capital over the last couple of years. Not to mention strong improvement in pricing and lower vacancies in all of our major markets have really gotten investors’ attention in terms of growth potential. So on that front we still think pricing has held in there. We’ve seen some transactions in the market recently. There is been some smaller transactions. We’re also aware of three sizable hyperscale platforms where that pricing is staying strong from what I understand. But what it tells us is that the sellers and their equity backers, who we think are sophisticated, are seeing strong value. So simply put money on the sideline is outweighing the investment opportunities. And then in terms of cap rates with respect to the non-core asset sales, I mean, clearly, they are going to be all over the place like we’ve seen in the past. As you recall, over the last few years, we’ve sold roughly $2 billion of these non-core assets. And at some point, we talked about having roughly $1.5 billion left. But look, I think, when you look at this, it’s important to understand that many of these assets are at different stages. So cap rates will end up in a range, and you look at our range right now at 0% to 10%, and it clearly depends on specific conditions. For example, if we sell land, right, that’s a zero cap rate. So there is a wide range and it depends on the asset.
Ari Klein: Got it. And then just maybe a follow-up just on the leverage, if you do all this, where do you think that gets you to exiting 2023? Thanks.
Matt Mercier: Yes. Ari, this is Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think with the way that we’re looking at our plan this year, as Greg and Andy mentioned, in terms of $2 billion at the midpoint for asset sales and joint ventures, really being the bulk of funding for our – the development spend that we have left. And then if you look at – we’re looking at 8% to 9% growth in our adjusted EBITDA, which I think will be a big part of our deleveraging plan also for this year. So without giving a specific number, I would say we’re going to be well on our way to bringing leverage back down closer to 6x by the end of the year.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch base just on the general demand environment. It’s nice to see a pickup in kind of some of the enterprise colo bookings. Maybe you could talk about what you see in the hyperscale funnel. We obviously heard some a couple of hyperscalers talking about a bit of a slowing in revenue growth, but it seems like demand remains pretty robust, and maybe you could kind of touch on that for us?
Andy Power: Corey, do you want to hit on the demand overall first?
Corey Dyer: Yes. I’ll hit the demand overall. Thanks, first of all, for the question, Eric. Look, demand remains as strong as ever, and we’re more than happy with kind of what our pipeline looks like and whether or not we’ve got enough to support our demand on the hyperscale end and actually I should just say thanks for the recognition on the improvement around enterprise and still 1 megawatt. But on the enterprise, we’re still seeing some really strong demand across and across the globe, really the traditional large build, but also some other interconnection needs. These hyperscalers are starting to come up for their connectivity options. It’s really the advantages that our portfolio plays out for them. We’re seeing that continue to grow that demand from them, utilizing our platform as a meeting place as they need to enhance their connectivity requirement. And so you’re seeing that across both places. And I would tell you that you also see the merits of our relationship around the opportunity to build up from the activity perspective for them. When you think through the cost and the difficulty getting power that we have right now, these hyperscalers and our relationship with them continue to evolve. I think improved and the value that we continue to bring to them will continue to drive demand for us and see the pipeline build across all of our regions, so really happy with where we are on that as well as the come back on the enterprise as well. Thanks a lot, Eric.
Eric Luebchow: Great. And just one follow-up, I just wanted to touch base on the renewal spread that you guided to this year. Any kind of color you can provide on how those will shake out versus the greater than 1 megawatt versus the sub 1 megawatt category? And are there any markets I’m big in Northern Virginia where supply is extremely limited, where you’re really starting to see material rental improvements throughout the year? Thanks.
Andy Power: Sure. I mean I think we’ve seen this pendulum on pricing moving our favor now for several quarters. It started to move at the beginning of 2022, gain steam, became more broad-brushed and I think it was a combination of not only supply and demand, but our value proposition really resonating with our customer base. In a backdrop, we’re quite honestly, it’s never probably been harder if you bring on capacity, procure power as well as the asset plan. This is – we ended the year overall in positive territory. The less than 1 megawatt, which is becoming a much larger and larger portion of our revenue base obviously led the way. We had some positive quarters in greater than net. We had some slightly negative quarters. If you look at the greater than 1 megawatt, again, and I know we’re really tied to making excuses. It takes one single deal just to pull it down, just call to 3% in that category when predominant deals are moving in positive territory. This year is the first called overall inflection to positive territory and cash mark-to-markets in several years, where we’re guiding to for 2023 will be literally the best cash mark-to-market inflection in close to 10 years for our business, and it’s obviously it’s increasingly a dramatic amount. And I think all those things I just mentioned in terms of our value proposition as well as supply/demand moving in our favor. Ashburn is – or Northern Virginia, excuse me, is a prime example of it. This quarter, 170 million of gap, 50 almost 60 megawatts had almost nil Ashburn signings in it. And you could say last quarter did not have a super large amount either due to, call it, the tightness of that market, the coming or deliveries or bringing on more capacity. So we don’t have a water statistical set of data to point to. But what we’re seeing on the quotes going out, the interactions with new customers is that these rates are moving swiftly well past the hundreds into the much more firmer territory and still have ways to go in terms of runway.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Thanks. So I was interested in just kind of big picture, your first conference call as CEO, any kind of principles to underscore things to contemplate and things to be putting into action around changes in overall operating practices, changes in product focus strategy. I think you already hit on capital allocation, but just any kind of big picture kind of items to call out? And then secondly, maybe for Matt, but as we look at the FFO per share guidance for the year, what are the sort of operating catalysts that you can identify that might get neutral to the upper end of that range? I think you talked about renewal spreads, but what’s your cover over kind of hitting the midpoint or maybe at the midpoint based when you see your commencement pipeline just the overall pricing comes? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thanks, John. I’ll tackle the first one and then let Matt tell you how we’re going to beat the guidance we just put out an hour ago in real time to that one. So I won’t rehash it what was all throughout the script of what’s taking place for the last 60 days. But I can tell you, in that time had – I was able to see all three of our regions a lot of time with customers, the team made it home for Valentine’s Day preschool and be able to put some preliminary thoughts together on top priorities, which I outlined in the prepared remarks. But just to rehash them in a little bit greater detail. Obviously, first and foremost is demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. That is number one for an important reason. We’ve obviously assembled in a playful collection of digital in assets over the last several years, both inorganically and organically with what we’re doing in the likes of Rome, Barcelona, Israel, across Africa. Mexico City and even so harnessing the power of that platform is sort of the full customer spectrum with this diverse array of capabilities is going to be key. I firmly believe in delivering that to our customers with a global scale and consistency with true local expertise and really become that meeting place for both the enterprise and the service provider customers plus in 50 in growing metros north of 30 countries and 6 continents, all with the vein of accelerating our pricing power, internal and organic growth. Two, integrating and innovating is priority number two. We’ve had years of M&A that is in the rearview mirror. Just quite frankly, I think all the critical puzzle pieces when it comes to what we do have been taken off the board and we got more than our fair share. We need to complete that integration work and complete our own digital transformation, making it easier and for internal and external customers and also continue advancing on our innovation, both on the connectivity as well as the physical infrastructure front. You’ve seen at the likes of service fabric, which is just still in its infancy. And it’s got many great growth states to come. You’ll see that on the space and power front or things like Direct Connect, we landed in such a high consumption market with AWS just announced yesterday, along with pressing our sustainability leadership and making sure that we are lifting the bar for our industry and our asset class and doing what’s right for our customers and the world we live in. All that is about – it’s about elevating a data-driven approach to all facets of our business. Last but not least, again, diversify and bolster our capital sources. It’s about completing the non-core dispose we’ve talked about and then expanding our private capital partnership programs for both stabilized as well as development hyperscale assets with that in mind of enhancing capital efficiency, accelerating growth and returns to our digital shareholders. So that’s the nuts and bolts of the 3-point plan, and I’ll let Matt tackle your second question.
Jon Atkin: Yes. Maybe just quickly just quick, yes, if I could just see in the direction. On the third-party funding of the development pipeline, what are – you have not done that to my recollection recently. And I am just interested, are there particular challenges around governance? Is it the economics? Is it finally the right partner or the right projects? What are some of the kind of factors that I think it’s hard on that which you might need some sort of lower expense from JV through your development pipeline?
Andy Power: I think you had six more questions in there, Jon. But the – as Greg touched on already, there is been a dramatic rotation of capital into digital infrastructure. And there is just not enough places to put it in terms of assets built or coming right now. And we’re a great partner for that. We’ve had a history of partnership. We’ve done versions of this in parts of the world, be it Latin America or Africa and expanding that use of capital to – or call it, with traditional markets to accelerate our capital efficiency and tap into the resources of our platform and monetize these long runways of growth we have for the hyperscalers is really the playbook. So I don’t think there is – we’re all about trying to piece this together any simple fiduciary in mind playbook, limiting confident games. So we’re going to be looking and already have been talking to partners that are like-minded in that approach long-term investors in the space that really appreciate the value we deliver for our customers day in and day out. Maybe Matt, do you want to quickly do Jon’s question because I’m sure we got a few of others as well.
Matt Mercier: Yes. So, Jon, look, I think to be brief, we feel pretty good about the fundamentals of the business. I think that we have talked about, a number of us have talked about, pricing and demand feel good. And therefore, that leads us to have strong conviction on our same capital cash NOI growth and the associated mark-to-markets that are going to help drive that. And then on top of that, in terms of continuing to lease up our development pipeline, that goes back to, again, feeling strong about where we are in the demand cycle and our ability to capture that. So, what that leaves remaining, I would say is timing around when the dispositions and the joint venture capital come to close. And maybe last, I know we talked about FX a lot last year. Right now, we are assuming that FX is neither a headwind nor a tailwind, but that’s also something we can’t control that could have influenced next year based on where we are in the economy.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question for you is, I mean you have talked about establishing this global interconnection platform and you have taken steps to do that with Telx, InterXion and then also Telko [ph]. As we think about the next steps for you guys, what are the most meaningful steps you could take to accelerate your traction on the interconnection front, is it adding more cloud on ramps? Is it building platform capabilities, what is that? And then my second question for you would be, in the past, you talked about doing $1.5 billion of non-core asset dispositions over the coming quarters. And now it sounds like, we are at $500 million. Just wondering what changed in terms of your view on the dispositions, is it just timing, or was the cap rate environment not supportive of you getting the valuations that you want? Thank you.
Andy Power: So, why don’t we take in reverse, so Greg, why don’t you hit on the program versus what gets done in calendar 2023.
Greg Wright: Sure. Thanks Michael. I hope you are well. Look, I want to be clear. First of all, we talked about the $1.5 billion estimate of non-core assets previously. I hope we made it clear that’s what was remaining. So, we sold $2 billion. And we said whether it was a quarter or two quarters ago that we had another $1.5 billion left. We didn’t suggest that we were going to sell that all over the next several quarters, and we wouldn’t suggest that. But instead, we said over time. So, as you look at that $1.5 billion and how it’s going to start to run off, we earmarked roughly $500 million of that for ‘23. And if you look back at our level of activity, whether it was ‘22, ‘21, ‘20, there is obviously different volumes in those years. It’s never perfect. Things roll over from 1 year to the next. Quite frankly, from my perspective, whether it’s May or July, I don’t think it really matters to say whether it’s front half of the year or the back half of the year. But look, that has not changed. And again, just as our cap rate range this year is zero to 10%, it was the same last year, and the volumes haven’t changed. So again, it’s – I would say we are continuing to execute upon that program that we articulated to the market a couple of years ago. Actually, it’s been 3-plus years ago now. And look, I would like to think we have done a pretty good job with it. So, that’s it on that front.
Andy Power: And then, Michael, on your second question, listen, I think I look at it as a coming together of numerous puzzle pieces here. One, we have been adding the critical locations the world that our customers need for a full platform solution, grow to north of 50 metropolitan areas, 30-plus countries across six continents. And really, I would say, demonstrably leading coverage in some of the hardest parts of the world with their irreplaceable platform capabilities. Two, adding to that legacy magnetic destinations or customers and next-generation versions of those magnets. And we have seen many of those press released across multiple categories Others have less no variety, but ensuring the broadest attractiveness for our customer base based on our curation of our meeting player community. Three, has been technology to bear. Internal technology I talked about. We have been eating our own cooking when it comes to digital transformation and tying this together for our internal team members, which ultimately provides better experiences for our customers and remove the friction in their procurement and their business. And lastly, external innovation, which we have been doing with the likes of evolving from Service Exchange to ServiceFabric tying together our connectivity platforms. And then harnessing all that in one platform offering essentially that has the best of both worlds, a global platform, $50-plus billion enterprise serving the largest customers to the most local customers and doing it that scale and expertise combined with true on-the-ground local experience. But Chris can maybe add on some of the technology elements as well.
Chris Sharp: Yes. I appreciate it, Andy. And thank you, Michael, for the question. Yes, ServiceFabric, I mean it’s something that we have talked about for some time now. It’s a purpose-built product that enhances the customer experience. And we have been aligning with our customers to remove that complexity. And quite frankly, it facilitates an easier process of deployment for our customers. And just to underpin Andy’s kind of position around the broader reach, I think one of the things that’s also driving a lot of traction and value to both our enterprise and our hyperscale customers as an open ecosystem that really accelerates the growth of the enterprise and they can solve more use cases and more markets on PlatformDIGITAL. And I think that’s the key element that we are highlighting. And quite frankly, you are starting to see even yesterday with the announcement of the on-ramp coming into Ashburn. That’s one of the largest cloud operators aligning to one of the largest markets for Digital Realty today. And I think just to underpin a couple of metrics. That’s 25 data centers with 500-plus megawatts. So, if you slow down and you think about that, the value that’s going to be created and to be further created in that market is demonstrable. And so the underpinning of why we brought ServiceFabric to market where we have purpose-built software developers, really we are moving that complexity and the last piece is in investing in our customers. We don’t want to compete with them. So, you will see the likes of a further set of press releases coming out with bare metals, security, it’s the full culmination of what enterprises are looking to do on that hybrid IT enablement, which is core to a broad swath of customers that we are servicing today and quite frankly, that we will be servicing in the not-too-distant future.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. I just want to also extend my congratulations to Andy and Matt in the new roles. If I can ask two financial questions. And I am just looking at Slide 14 from the deck. So, the first question is if you look at the midpoint of revenue growth guidance for revenue and EBITDA, can you break out the organic portion of the growth relative on revenue, you will have energy and you will have acquisitions and divestitures kind of a mix of stuff as you have been recycling assets and investing in new ones? And then for EBITDA, just split between the organic and the M&A impact? And then the second question, as you look at the EBITDA growth and you look at the core FFO per share growth, what is holding back the piece parts holding back core FFO per share growth? And what are the opportunities for Digital Realty to unlock that in the future and get back to see a more consistent relationship of the EBITDA growth relative to what that core profit per share growth should do? Thanks.
Matt Mercier: Sure, Mike. So, let’s talk about revenue because I think that’s the one that’s got more – a little bit more to unpack in it for when you are looking year-over-year. So, I think as most of us know, power has been a big topic, and we expect to be – continue to be a topic. We are, like other operators seeing increases in power costs, particularly in EMEA. So, if you look at that growth, it’s around 23% from 22%, the midpoint 23%, roughly 14% of that is tied to utility reimbursements correlated to higher expected power costs. And just a reminder, we expect the majority – I would say the majority of our contracts are full pass-through. And even those contracts that are not full pass-through, we have for the majority of those, we have the ability to pass on price increases, which we either have done or will do soon. So, we are not expecting any or very minimal bottom line impact to our results in ‘23 from higher power costs. So, that also – when you then net that down, you are talking about roughly speaking, 9% growth in our rental and interconnection revenue driven by the business, which also coincides with the growth in adjusted EBITDA that you will see there as you do – as you have done the math as well. In terms of then having that flow down to core FFO, look, I think part of that is what’s in the plan this year is to set us up for being able to do that going forward, being able to continue to leverage the fundamentals that are continuing to improve and accrue to our favor as demonstrated by the growth of the stabilized portfolio, so that when we get our leverage down and balance sheet and a stronger position, we should be able to see that going forward in ‘24.
Michael Rollins: And does that mean that the PowerCo deal, the recycling divestitures that you did, those are kind of a neutral impact on the revenue and EBITDA growth rates for 2023 over 2022?
Matt Mercier: So, the – I guess I will answer that in terms of like we are – obviously, timing is a factor, but our – the disposition, call it, joint venture capital plan that we have laid out, the range takes into consideration those potential dispositions.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Andy and Matt congrats both on your new roles. I had a question about the supply chain. I was just wondering with supply chain constraints loosening, are you seeing maybe some of your larger customers moving slower or less actively engaged in procuring space they need maybe several years out giving shortening lead times. And then if I could just sneak in one more. I wanted to ask about the dividend. We are talking a lot about funding the business through divestitures and whatnot. I am just wondering how maybe Matt or even Andy, you are thinking about dividend per share, optimal payout levels. And is that even a lever you would be willing to consider to pull in order maybe to help fund the business and de-lever faster? Thanks.
Andy Power: Thank you again. So, on supply chain, the – I would say there is a loosening, but I would say we are not back to normal. And the production slots that become available seem to get gobbled up quickly. So – I wouldn’t say that there has been a correlation between customer buying behaviors through to our supply chains. I mean quite frankly, which is a contributor to the pricing revival has been that the demand is remaining quite firm across the board for both enterprise and hyperscale business. And it’s outpacing supply and supply is – I think that disconnect is in many money markets is going to continue for some time. You have got things like power shortages, you have got municipalities, you have got permitting, you got environmental impact. There is a whole host of reasons why it’s a lot harder today to bring on capacity efficiently and effectively. I think we in our platform stand out above many, given our expertise, our time doing in business, our relationships, our consistency. But it’s definitely helping on the overall pricing dynamic. And I don’t think I have seen a correlation to customers feeling the luxury of time when they are buying and especially the larger customers, I wouldn’t say are taking a wait and see due to that whatsoever. Matt, do you want to handle the dividend question?
Matt Mercier: Sure. I mean look, ultimately, the dividend is a Board level decision. I would – what I would add on to that is that it’s – in where we are, we would – our objective is to maximize our free cash flow available to us to fund the business. And then in relation to the dividend, we want to make sure that we are paying out 100% of our taxable income. We want to make sure that we have an appropriate payout ratio. And then on top of that, we need to consider some of the some of our plans, which include potential for dispositions that could generate capital gains that could also be part of that analysis.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. What, if you can – a couple of questions on Ashburn. If you could walk us through sort of the available power and kind of the assurance that you have that those big lots to be there when you need them? And then kind of a follow-up on that, are you seeing any changes in the buying patterns from your customers? Are they re-architecting deployments so that they can push more things outside of Ashburn to kind of avoid some of these issues in the future? Any of that kind of activity would be helpful.
Andy Power: Sure. Thanks Frank. So, I mean Ashburn, I would say overall, the story remains the same of what transpired at the end of last summer. And the power – incremental power deliveries into the largest, most robust in the first market, quite frankly, in the world, is going to be restrained greatly for several years. Last quarter, I basically said I couldn’t guarantee it, but I have confidence that we, working with the power providers will be able to deliver on our customer commitments, which represents the lion’s share of just shy of 80 megawatts we have in our development cycle. Today, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we are good to go. We will be able to deliver for those customers, and there is no concerns about the power being available. What comes next is still to be determined. So IP, and again, similar solid answers I provide, I can’t promise you this, I can’t guarantee it. But I do have a strong amount of confidence that the tools in our tool kit at Digital Realty, given our experience in region, our critical and strategic landholdings, our breadth of infrastructure and our relationships will be able to be creative in terms of bringing on some incremental power deliveries in this bottleneck period. That is on top of what I would say is, obviously, Ashford is our largest market. I just looked at the 2023 expirations, while we are – we certainly have a higher retention, lower churn year expected relative to prior years. A large portion of our expected churn happens to be in Ashburn, which is a blessing given the ability to remarket that space at higher and better uses. So, all of these, but the Ashford story or saga continues, but broadly, it is greatly improving the pricing dynamic to a much more healthier environment for digital and other providers in the market. In terms of buying patterns, just tremendous amount of infrastructure across this part of Northern Virginia is not really shifting large-scale demand to other locations to any great stakes. So, folks are still clamoring for available capacity or staying where they are with us or in market, and we have not seen a title shift on this market and it will take a few years, but the Calgary is supposedly coming with new power brining project in the region from the South and the North.
Frank Louthan: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Andy Power: Thank you, Andrea. So, in my earlier remarks, I did mention something we didn’t talk about on in the Q&A, but I do think this is an incremental tailwind of demand for our industry and Digital Realty as it relates to AI-related applications that we believe is on the precipice of driving an incremental wave of demand. As a result, I just recently asked ChatGPT, how AI would impact demand for data centers. Here is a summary of the response, and I quote, “The impact of artificial intelligence and the demand for data centers is likely to be significant in the coming years. As AI continues to gain traction and more and more businesses adopt AI-powered solutions, the demand for data storage and processing is expected to increase significantly. AI also has the potential to create new data-intensive applications such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and personalized medicine, further driving the demand for data centers. In short, the impact of AI on the demand for data centers is expected to be substantial and companies operating in this space are well positioned to benefit from this trend.” Obviously, self-serving – but when you see some of the innovation that’s playing out here and just the general media in the news, this AI trend has certainly come to fruition. And while this AI is certainly still in its development phase, we at Digital Realty, agree and excited – are excited by the forecast that ChatGPT just provided. In closing, Digital Realty had a strong 2022. We believe we are making the appropriate adjustments here and now in 2023 to position us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity that lies before us. I would like to thank all of our data team and exceptional team members of Digital Realty and everyone on this call for joining us today. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to GAAP net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. One important item to note this quarter, while Teraco's results are consolidated into our financial statements since closing on August 1, we have excluded the platform's contribution from leasing backlog and other portfolio statistics that will be cited on this call and within our third quarter earnings materials. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, we achieved another quarter of record bookings, led by robust demand within the greater than a megawatt segment. Second, the signs of improvement in our core portfolio continued to emerge in the quarter with 120 basis point sequential improvement and base data center revenues on a constant currency basis. Third, with the closing on our investment in Teraco, we cemented our position as a leading provider of colocation and connectivity in South Africa. And lastly, our management team guided by decades of experience remains focused on navigating the current environment and maximizing the opportunity that lies before us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.
Arthur Stein: Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. The world has experienced significant change so far in 2022, and Digital Realty is adapting to that change. Our business continues to be levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data as our record leasing results underscore. We also have an unmatched global operating footprint that is supported by a strong development pipeline that allows us to capture opportunities wherever they may emerge. As you all understand, global capital markets have become extraordinarily volatile and interest rates have risen sharply from historic lows to levels that we have not seen since 2008. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro to levels not seen in nearly 20 years. While you've had to look back over 30 years to find the last time the dollar was this elevated against the pound or the yen. This volatility is being driven by a number of factors from a global economy emerging from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine and of course, the heightened resolve of central bankers to tap down on elevated global inflation. And while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and fortune can indeed favor the brave, experience has taught us that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And we feel that it is most prudent today to adapt to the current environment by: one, prioritizing and sharpening the lens through which we view new investments to ensure that we are focused on the most strategic transactions that offer the highest potential risk-adjusted returns; two, by pressing our newly gained advantage on pricing and improving our internal growth profile and the longer-term durability of our cash flows; and three, by enhancing liquidity to ensure that we have the capital to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers while maintaining a comfortable cushion. With over 300 data centers around the world and a revenue base of over $4.5 billion, Digital Realty remains focused on how to best position ourselves for the long run. Our third quarter results were strong with a record $176 million of new bookings, making the third time in the past 4 quarters that our bookings have exceeded $150 million. Core FFO per share was $1.67 despite stiff FX and interest rate headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we see evidence of the turn that is starting to take shape in our core portfolio.  Digital Realty's global platform enables us to capture demand wherever it emerges. North America was the standout this quarter with our largest deals landing in the region. Multinational companies are using platform digital to enable digital transformation across multiple regions and metros globally. A good example of this is a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit transaction signed with a top 5 financial services company that was inked in the quarter. Looking ahead, sales activity remains healthy as the secular trends driving data center demand remain in place. Enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. But the world is changing. We are seeing sales cycle lengthen and global uncertainty extends decision times. Importantly, we are pushing prices higher to reflect tightening supply and rising costs. Admittedly, some of the deals this quarter have been in process for many months and do not fully reflect today's environment. Today, new leases are being priced to reflect current market conditions. And while this will likely be in an iterative process, we expect the strong secular trends driving demand toward third-party data centers to continue for years to come. Andy will provide further color on our results and our outlook shortly. During the third quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Teraco, a leading carrier and cloud-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa. Teraco is a gem. With 7 data centers across 3 metros and robust interconnectivity including more than 22,000 cross connects, 7 cloud on-ramps and direct access to 7 subsea cables with more on the way. Teraco co has plenty of room to expand and is expected to generate some of the best growth within our portfolio. Teraco uniquely enhances our position in EMEA, complementing our existing operations in Eastern Africa through iColo, Western Africa through Medallion and in Europe and the Mediterranean with Interxion, Altus IT, Lamda Helix and our newest JV with Mine in Israel. These are all highly connected assets that leverage subsea cable landing and brings the world closer together, linking Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Consistent with that strategy, we recently acquired land on the Greek island of Crete to create an interconnection hub in the Eastern Mediterranean to complement our existing hub in Marseille, along with developing hubs in Barcelona and Israel, which will feed additional traffic into Greece, the Balkans, Turkey and Northern Africa. We expect that this highly differentiated project will generate strong double-digit returns while enhancing the value of our existing facilities in the region. Moving to our dispositions in the quarter. We sold a noncore mixed-use data center property in Dallas for $206 million and reached an agreement with digital core REIT to sell a 25% interest in our Frankfurt data center campus for $140 million with an option to acquire up to 90% of the same campus plus a 90% share of 1 of our Dallas data centers in a larger transaction valued at approximately $750 million. Both transactions are subject to unitholder approval with a vote expected for November. Funding organic new market entry through the disposition of stabilized facilities is our preferred source of capital. It enables us to leverage platform digital to capitalize on value creation opportunities and harvest capital once those facilities have stabilized. We also favor joint ventures like the one in Israel, where we leverage the local knowledge and expertise of our partner and pair that with PlatformDIGITAL to expand our global footprint and to better serve our customers. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to update you on our ESG success shown on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We were honored to be recognized by GRESB as the sector leader for technology and science category in the Americas for the second consecutive year, maintaining our 5-star rating from this leading investor-driven ESG benchmarking organization. We are proud of our ESG-related efforts. And while the awards and recognition are nice, we are focused on ESG because our customers demand it, and because quite simply, it is the right thing to do. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Turning to Page 5. As Bill noted, we signed record bookings of $176 million, with a $13 million contribution from interconnection during the third quarter, excluding the results from Teraco. The greater than a megawatt business in the Americas was the big driver of this quarter's record leasing at nearly $100 million signed. Sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 24% of the record quarterly bookings while the shell portion of a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal fell into our other category. Importantly, as we've discussed, we have meaningfully shifted our cadence toward further insulating our portfolio from the effects of inflation through the addition of CPI-based escalators into our new leases. While more than 95% of our portfolio includes rent escalation causes, less than 20% are specifically tied to CPI, while the balance are fixed. And our highest leasing volume quarter ever, we were able to achieve CPI-based escalators on 40% of the leases signed in the quarter, which demonstrates our resolve and our customers' acknowledgment of this important factor. The balance of our leases signed in 3Q include fixed rent escalators. Moving on to markets. In North America, Portland and Dallas were particularly strong with large deals landing in each of those metros, while demand in Northern Virginia also remained high. In EMEA, totals were consistent with expectations with particular strength in Paris. While San Paolo led in LatAm, and Osaka led the APAC region. These deals drove additional starts within our development pipeline, which grew to over 400 megawatts, but is also now more than 60% pre-leased mitigating much of the risk related to this capital spend and providing significant visibility into future revenue. As Bill touched on in his remarks, we signed 4 leases in the quarter with a large multinational financial services customer that has fully embarked upon its digital transformation journey. This large multi-site, multi-market build-to-suit transaction drove the upside in our greater than 1 megawatt North America leasing and also served to increase our development pipeline sequentially while reducing our anticipated yields. Importantly, this deal is structured as a yield on cost development supported by a long-term triple net lease to a strong investment-grade credit with fixed escalators, which serves to insulate Digital Realty from construction costs, and operating expense volatility. Excluding this transaction, our development life cycle average yield will be closer to the yield we presented last quarter. During the third quarter, we added another 103 new customers, continuing the 100-plus new logos we've added each quarter since the closing of the Interxion transaction 2.5 years ago. Key customer wins in the quarter include a Global 2000 luxury goods maker is expanding its capabilities on PlatformDIGITAL to add data exchange with its strategic cloud providers to its existing capabilities. A Global 2000 multinational technology manufacturer is expanding its hybrid IT capability in multiple metros across 2 global regions with PlatformDIGITAL. A Global 2000 retailer is rationalizing its data centers and joining Platform Digital as part of its hybrid IT architecture to have greater proximity to a key cloud service provider while enhancing both performance and ecosystem benefits. A Global 100 top insurance company is rationalizing its data centers and moving to PlatformDIGITAL to gain strong access to 2 leading cloud service providers. Landing with us as a new logo in 4Q '21, a Global 2000 U.S. energy provider expanded into 2 more metros with Digital Realty as it continues to rearchitect its network as part of a long-term hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 aerospace and defense contractor is rationalizing its data center portfolio while supporting the re-architecture of its network and interconnecting with cloud providers on PlatformDIGITAL.  Turning to our backlog on Page 7. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases grew to $466 million by quarter end as our record signings were partially offset by $90 million of commencement. The lag between signings and commencements moved up to 17 months for the leases signed in the third quarter due to the large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal discussed by Bill a moment ago. Excluding this deal, our sign to commence live was under 8 months, consistent with our historical average. Approximately 25% of our record backlog is slated to commence in the fourth quarter. While another 45% will commence in 2023, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halfs of next year. Moving on to Page 8. We signed $154 million of renewal leases during the third quarter that rolled down 0.5% on a cash basis. Renewal rates for 01-megawatt renewals were positive across each region and up 3.1% overall, demonstrating the criticality of these deployments and the differentiation of our facilities. This product segment has historically experienced steadily positive renewal rates and cash renewal rates have steadily increased throughout this year. After two consecutive 3-plus percent bumps in 1Q and 2Q, the cash mark-to-market was weighed down by the greater than 1 megawatt segment in the third quarter. Despite this result, we are confident in a slightly positive cash releasing spread for the full year 2022. Importantly, we are encouraged by the general trajectory of market rents across our product line. We expect that the dislocation and volatility of capital markets coupled with rising costs and the reduced availability of power in several markets, including the world's largest market, Loudon County, Virginia, is constraining the ability to bring on new data center capacity despite the secular demand for data center infrastructure. With regard to power delivery in Northern Virginia, we are continuing to work with the primary power provider to ensure appropriate allocations with an acute focus on capacity needed to support our customers in this market. We have an incredibly unique footprint in Loudon and a set of capabilities that we are working to tap into in order to take advantage of this backdrop of continuing tightening market fundamentals. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 80 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 7.3% in the third quarter, negatively impacted by another 480 basis point FX headwind. This is disappointing on the surface but once the noise is removed, the improving operating picture that we have been painting starts to emerge. On a constant currency basis, data center operating revenue, rental revenue interconnection was actually up 10 basis points year-over-year and improved by 120 basis points sequentially, demonstrating the turn that has started to take hold in our core operations. The sequential step-up was supported by a 50 basis point occupancy improvement over the second quarter, along with the benefits of the positive releasing spreads we've seen year-to-date. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 9. 56% of our third quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 21% in euros, 6% in Singapore dollars, 5% in British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last few months, negatively impacting same capital revenue growth by 530 basis points and NOI growth by 480 basis points year-over-year, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 10. This strong headwind contrasts with typical FX impacts of 50 to 100 basis points in either direction during the periods with more normal FX volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations, investment pipeline and funding in locally-denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. As we discussed on our call last quarter, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with heightened FX volatility, we took a closer look at our hedging strategy during the third quarter and executed additional swaps to mitigate our remaining FX exposure. In August, we executed a U.S. dollar to euro currency swap against an existing $1 billion tranche of 2027 notes outstanding. And in late September, alongside our USD 550 million bond, we swapped those borrowings in the euro and Japanese yen, which also reduced the effective interest rate on those 5-year notes to just 3% versus the 5.55% coupon achieved via the offering. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO per share of $1.67, which is 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% lower sequentially due to the negative impact of FX, higher interest and operating expenses and the initial dilution we incurred from the closure of Teraco, which is consistent with the forecast we provided last quarter. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was 6% higher year-over-year but down $0.01 sequentially. The reported core FFO underperformance versus our prior expectation for the quarter was purely a function of greater-than-expected FX headwinds. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiff FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, though this should be offset by core growth. As you can see from the bridge on Page 11, we expect FFO will remain flat sequentially in the fourth quarter as FX and interest expense headwinds are partly balanced by NOI growth. Accordingly, we've adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions to reflect the continued pressures of FX and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.70 to $6.75, reflecting a $0.075 per share adjustment at the midpoint of the range. Importantly, due to the sharper-than-expected move in interest rates since our last call, we are reducing our constant currency core FFO per share range by $0.025 at the midpoint to a new range of $6.95 to $7 for 2022, which represents approximately 7% growth over 2021. We expect currency headwinds could represent a 400 to 500 basis point drag on full year 2020 revenue and core FFO per share growth. A review of our leverage is on Page 12. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.7x, while fixed charge coverage is at 5.5x. We drew $400 million down from last September's forward equity offering as part of our funding for Teraco. So pro forma for the remaining forward equity and adjusting for our full quarter's contribution from Teraco, our leverage ratio drops to 6.4x while pro forma fixed charge coverage is 5.7x. While leverage is above our historical average, we have bolstered our liquidity to ensure that we have the capital in hand to fund our committed development spend throughout the end of next year and maintain a comfortable cushion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised or received commitments for approximately $2 billion of debt capital at an effective blended average of just over 3%. These include more than $650 million of term loan commitments received subsequent to quarter end. With cash and forward equity outstanding totaling more than $700 million, we have increased our current available liquidity to approximately $3 billion. We expect to see leverage moderate back towards our longer-term target over time through a combination of noncore dispositions, joint ventures of core holdings, lease-up of available capacity and the retention of free cash flow. As Bill discussed, the current capital markets environment and increased cost of capital have led us to sharpen our lens and prioritize new investments to those that are the highest strategic merit and offer the best potential risk-adjusted returns. Our financial strategy includes a diverse menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital and enables us to fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is about 5.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.4%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. More than 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no meaningful near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered debt maturity schedule. We repaid the remainder of our 2022 debt earlier this month and have only a small Swiss bond maturing in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: I wondered if it's possible to kind of frame the magnitude and the timing of the CapEx associated with all the leasing that you did during the quarter. And then maybe to kind of bring it home to the $3 billion in liquidity that you talked about sources of funding that incremental CapEx.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jon. So if you look at our development life cycle, it kind of lays it out region by region, and it has called, let's say, starts with a, call it, just $3.8 billion of, call it, approved projects. And that includes all the leases signed during the last quarter as well as some projects that are not leased because it's only 60% pre-leased, roughly. If you kind of break that down over the next, call it, 5 quarters, you're spending about $2.7 billion of that. Again, that is not all contractual spend. Only a portion of that is tied to customer contracts. So if you exclude the, call it, assumptive or speculative spend, you call it closer to $2 billion. The $3 billion of liquidity I mentioned, that includes, call it, really 2 parts, $1.7 billion of cash and revolver capacity and then $1.2 billion of the undrawn equity forward and new U.S. dollar term loan commitments in hand. So that total just about $3 billion of contractual committed committee liquidity right now. That is everything we have at this minute. We're also continuing with our normal game plan of noncore dispositions, call it $1.5 billion over several quarters as well as joint ventures on core holdings. So we feel pretty good about being able to fund this attractive growth for our customers.
Jonathan Atkin: And then secondly, on the 17 month metric that you mentioned in the earnings release and in the script about kind of essentially book-to-bill. And then putting that in the context of what Bill said about elongated sales cycles, how much of that is due to perhaps the lack of server availability on part of the customers or from your standpoint, delays in power procurement or ability to construct just given supply chain which is facing data center infrastructure?
Andrew Power: I would parse those in 2 topics and, I'd say, coincidentally look like they're connected. What the long -- the extended book-to-bill really was our largest transaction was with a large multinational financial services customer. It's been in the works for -- really since the very beginning of this year. It's across 4 different locations. It's incredible. It's very flatter to be part of their digital transformation, which is really going to cloud in a hybrid IT fashion. And given those projects are literally at land stage, we're designing to their specifications. That is what's extending that out. And if you carve those 4 transactions with that customer out, you really had a normal book-to-bill cycle. I think I'll let Bill comment on what he referenced in terms of, call it, what we're seeing in terms of the business in terms of some elongated sales cycle though.
Arthur Stein: It's a little bit elongated, Jon. But as Andy said, if you were to strip out the 4 build-to-suits that are in this quarter, the effect on the book-to-bill this quarter would be minimal.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.
Frank Louthan: Great. Have you guys increased pricing on cross-connects as well? And if so, what is sort of the -- how much have you raised that? And what percentage are on the new pricing? And then going forward, you're fairly creative as far as the getting the effective rate on your financing down close to 3%. Is that -- what sort of expectation do you have, what sort of financing you can get going forward? Do you think you can keep it around that level?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Frank. Maybe Chris and I M&A cross-connect pricing and pricing dynamic overall. I would remind you, we are essentially have been putting together some critical puzzle pieces through our M&A and have been aligning our cross-connect pricing across various regions, including the latest and greatest addition to PlatformDIGITAL with Teraco, the leading platform across South Africa. So it's not necessarily a uniform step shift, but we have been investing in that platform, bringing more value to our customers and driving commensurate increases in prices. But Chris, anything you want to add on cross-connect prices or data points there?
Christopher Sharp: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Frank. A couple of points, right? We definitely take a customer-led approach on aligning value to the overall reach and overall offering they're able to provide them. I would echo Andy sentiment that like in the Westin Building, I think we've talked about it a couple of quarters ago, where we're driving that consistency of our overall interconnection products and capabilities in that market to really just delivering more value and you're going to start to see more revenue pick up in the next year on being able to uniformly bring that into the overall PlatformDIGITAL delivery capabilities. I'd say this next piece is more probably pointing to your question in EMEA, right, where we've been talking for some time now about increasing those prices and that's been performing great. And I think that's something that you'll continue to see growing, which is represented in the interconnection numbers that we put up this last quarter. So you'll see that performing I think, much better over the course of the next year here.
Andrew Power: And just not to leave you without any numbers in terms of rate or growth increases. I mean the ranges are pretty wide, but it's anywhere from called low mid-single digits to some -- definitely some outliers that are in the teens at the very least. I think the overall pricing environment is probably even more relevant to the heart of your question, though. We are continuing to see improving pricing power across our platform, whether it's in our, let's call it, less than megawatt enterprise colocation footprint. We're, I'd say, call it, 10% to 15% sequential pricing changes in many markets and also seeing similar type of increases in the larger plus than a megawatt as well. In relation to your second question, I mean, big kudos to the Digital Realty Finance Capital Markets team, I mean, really call it staying nimble and acting fast in a volatile environment and really bringing together, call it, what is the $2 billion of capital in, call it, 60 days. We've also been tapping into call it incremental FX hedgings, given the more volatile FX world and a more global business. And we've been able to, call it, get our cost of capital, call it, roughly 3%. Let don't I'm not sure that's a permanent number where we go from here. We've had, call it, the most rapid increase in the U.S. Treasury in 40 years or Fed funds rates in 40 years. But we're definitely using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize those menu of options and drive down the cost of our capital.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Barden of Bank of America.
David Barden: I guess first question would be, Andy, can you walk us through how this bubble of lease renewals in 2023 is going to work out? I guess, on supplement Page 23, 15% of annualized rent is coming due next year. You've had some success with positive lease renewing spreads year-to-date and be helpful to kind of get some comfort level there. And then I guess the follow-up would be, I think we were hoping to get some comfort on what your understanding with Dominion and Northern Virginia energy availability would be in the development pipeline on a go-forward basis? And if you could kind of share what your latest thinking is there.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Dave. Maybe I'll take them in reverse order because I think the second question ties a little bit into your first question. So as a broader reminder, literally, I think it was 90 days ago to the day, we got the, call it, the newer news from Dominion on the pinch point in Eastern Loudon County on power deliveries. I can tell you we're a regular dialogue with the power company on a path forward. But I would say also that the essence of the initial messaging remains intact that there's just going to be significantly less power provided to ongoing development in this region until 2026. The feedback we've received is that 2026, which should be back to more normal practices. So this is not a permanent thing. It's due to transmission not generation, and that's what they've expressed to us. But between now and then, it's going to be less supply in the biggest highest -- consistently high demand market. What that means and what we're seeing, and I alluded to it earlier is that the pricing power pendulum is shifting back towards us. And it's nice to be I believe, the largest incumbent, we call it, 500 megawatts of in-place capacity and just under, I think, 200 call it, coming due contractually expiration wise in the next 3 years. The -- we -- when it comes to available capacity, we're -- we've sold quite well in that market. We probably in hindsight, I wish we didn't do so well, but who knew this was going to come. I don't think any market participants really expected this. We do -- ourselves are not completely bearing and we do have a 200-megawatt parcel in Manassas that is to date in unaffected zone that -- which is really nice to have in times like this. And while I cannot guarantee it right now, I think we're optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of those customers that have signed contracts to grow with us and are sitting in our backlog. Turning to your second question. The pricing power pendulum again, I think, is continuing to move in the favor of the providers given that demand has been robust for so long, and the outlook is looking to be -- continue to be such and the supply has just been absorbed. You pointed out the 15%, which is like less than a megawatt piece of our exploration schedule. I mean that's -- in times like these, when prices are moving your friend, it's nice to have more bites at the apple to continue to ensure commensurate value is generated for our contracts. So I feel that is usually our most network dense sticky portion that consistently on the front end of our exploration schedules. I feel pretty darn good about that in terms of not only retention but price action. And I think even the PC didn't mention in the larger the megawatt, I think that my commentary around Northern Virginia and other tightening markets, I think, will also continue this trend of more positive cash releasing spreads, which were positive in the first 2 quarters this year and remain positive on a full year basis for 2022.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.
Michael Rollins: So with some of the comments on demand but also a lengthening of the sales cycle, should investors look at Slide 5 a little differently in terms of the range of sales outcomes that you achieved over the last 6 to 8 quarters relative to what the next 6 quarters or 4 quarters might look like? And then secondly, just given some of the comments that you provided on currency and on interest rates. If everything stays where it is currently, can you share a sense of what the potential headwinds could be on 2023 financial performance, thinking of revenue and core FFO per share?
Andrew Power: So we'll do a reverse and I'll hit the currency and interest rates and then we can talk to pitch over to Corey about, call it, expectations on signings for, call it, the next several quarters. The -- I mean, based on where we're seeing the currencies, I would say, especially precipitated by, I think, the activity in the sterling -- the British sterling pound over the last several, I still believe currencies will remain somewhat of a headwind in '23 relative to 2022. I don't think that's a permanent fixture. But based on the pace of, call it, governmental base rate increases and the currency differentials. So we haven't put that together nor the interest rate, call it, headwind. The interest rate one is -- excuse me, I should say, FX is going to be less of a headwind than my gut for 2023 than 2022. I mean we're just absorbing, call it, 400 basis points. So I would -- I don't have the exact number, but I don't see it being even half of that in the end of the day in the next year, unless you literally have the euro and the pound literally dropped another 30% over the next 12 months. Interest rates, we have called 80-plus percent of our debt is fixed rate. We obviously saw last quarter looking to access capital across various markets and various currencies that align with our asset and revenue base to essentially buck some of the interest rate trend. But I mean, I think a good proxy is if you look at, call it, the quantity of our floating rate debt and you apply what the expected software increases over the next 12 months, that's probably going to be a ballpark in terms of headwinds on a year-over-year basis, Mike. In terms of -- I'll turn it back to Corey to how we're thinking about the range of outcomes on new signings.
Corey Dyer: Yes. So thanks, Mike, for the question, and Andy for the -- let me go second. The -- first off, I'll tell you that we don't forecast. I'm not going to try to play a game on what it's going to look like. But what I would tell you from a demand and a pipeline perspective, our multi-quarter pipeline is really robust, may not robust. I'll say resilient and very healthy. And that comes off of our quarter that was our top quarter ever. The demand is healthy across all regions. The one softness area would probably be in the small enterprises where they're having a little bit more -- I'd say they're more susceptible to the macro issues to the war in Europe. So all those different items. And so we saw those cycles lengthening, and that moderated some of our results in the somewhat megawatt. But broadly across the globe, we've got really strong hyperscale demand. We've got strong demand and increasing demand from, I'll call it, our large $1 billion-plus multinationals. Our channel business is going really well. We're seeing new logos uptick from that cohort as well as the possible demand from just new signings in that area. So positive from a broad space, it's resilient and really healthy after our best quarter ever.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Great. As we think about your -- the impact of inflation on your development costs next year and beyond, just I believe you have some VMI contracts renewing in early 2023 for your equipment spend. Maybe you could talk about what your expectations are there in terms of cost inflation on development as we enter the new year? And then second, as we think about the better pricing power and perhaps some constraints on new development in markets like Ashburn, are you in a position to perhaps have declining capital intensity in the next few years, which would kind of help reduce your needs for capital? Or how should we think about that dynamic as well?
Andrew Power: Sure. Thanks, Eric. So the -- so we have numerous risk mitigations when it comes to our development and construction, which includes our vendor management inventory program, you mentioned other supplier contracts. At a more local level, bundling our projects with GCs and subcontractors. So when you put that all together in the current backdrop environment and we look at, call it, the next batch, which will be projects probably more back half of '23 into '24. On a fully -- including all baked into the whole basis of the project, we're still estimating that our costs are, call it, in the mid- to high single-digit-ish type of potential increase. Based on current outlook, and you touched a little bit on the supply/demand dynamic, we believe that the rate of rate growth will outpace that or at least hold firm that our yields will hang in there and not be degradated by that inflationary impact. And that's something we're working day in and day out to keep focused on and working with our great vendors around the world on. When it comes to pricing power, when it comes to capital intensity, I would just echo really what Bill said at the outset of this call that in the last several months, the world has become more volatile. The capital markets have become more challenged. The talk of a looming recession, the war in Eastern Europe has continued, and we're raising the bar at Digital when it comes to focus on our strategic priorities. And we obviously have an incredible pipeline of projects. We have probably one of the most distinguished land banks and runways for our customers. But I think there is a scenario very likely where we could spend a little bit less on speculative development. And because we're focused on projects that are delivering on those strategic priorities and delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: Great. Andy, I wonder if you could talk about the M&A market a little bit, both in terms of your ability to sell your assets, given the sort of the derating of the public company multiples. Have you seen any change in the market on the private side and how will that affect your fundraising? And you've obviously bought Teraco. How are you thinking about acquisitions in terms of market expansions or expanding in existing markets over the next year or 2?
Andrew Power: We didn't share much on Teraco and I'll start with that, and then we hand it to Greg to talk about both of your questions. Having spent some time down in region with the Teraco team, I think we're even more pleased with the incredible addition to our global platform, not only in terms of the most highly connected destinations across South Africa but we're a really fantastic team delivering on behalf of their customers, our customers and really growing that platform. I apologize, we did -- we obviously consolidated Teraco into our financials, but we did not roll them out into all the stats given we just closed and call it the middle of August. That's coming in a quarter's time. So please be patient with us on that. But I'll give it to Greg to maybe speak to take your questions.
Gregory Wright: Yes. Thanks for the question, Simon. Look, I would say pricing on recent transactions in the private market have remained firm. We're fortunate to be in a sector that continues to experience growth and secular demand that really isn't common for other sectors, and we happen to have a product that's scarce in the market with growing demand. When you try to put some numbers to that, if you just look at the last 2 quarters in the second and third quarter, it's about $1.7 billion in transactions. And pricing has been very firm in terms of cap rate and per KW basis. So look, to date, look, the private capital, again, is looking to increase their exposure to the space where there's a limited amount of supply. So to date, it's remained firm.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Niknam: Just first on macro, and I think there may have been a question alluding to this before, but I just want to get a better sense whether you're seeing tightening financial conditions maybe starting to have an impact on your customers' propensity or willingness to invest further in Digital's transformation as they think about 2023, and whether it's varied across hyperscale enterprise or whether it's varied by geography? And then I have one housekeeping follow-up on Teraco, maybe, Andy, if you can talk about any incremental color you can give on expected contributions from Teraco perhaps in fourth quarter or maybe on a more annualized basis heading into next year?
Andrew Power: So I'll handle the more mundane question on Teraco, and I'll pass it to Corey a little bit on buyer behavior in the current environment. So Teraco, I believe, did for just about 1.5 months, about $28 million of revenue, $16 million of EBITDA. It -- I would say it's signings, we're call it -- and again, do not include any of our numbers. We call it just don't know the 6 megawatts plus a decent chunk of connectivity. It does have a very sizable backlog. Bit added, I think, a sizable amount to our construction called almost $0.5 billion of construction in progress. And based on what we're seeing, they're working on right now, feeling very good about the growth of that platform. Corey, do you want to handle on, call it, buyer behavior in the current part?
Corey Dyer: Matt, thank you very much for the question. I would tell you that the financial situation changes, pricing rates that we've risen have all affected, as I mentioned earlier, kind of small enterprises the most in first. We haven't seen an effect our larger enterprises, the multinational $1 billion-plus companies or our channel partners that are really our path towards the enterprise more broadly. So I think on that, it's been moderated a little bit in the small enterprise. When you look at the hyperscale, we continue to see strong demand on the hyperscale across all regions. I think we mentioned Portland was our largest this past quarter. Paris, with significant in EMEA. Osaka was significant in AP. And so we're seeing that across the board. We had large scale deals, as mentioned earlier, with an enterprise customer in Texas and Virginia. And so we're seeing larger scale deals. We're seeing it continue. Just a little bit of moderation, I think, in the small enterprises, but our pipeline is strong, resilient across all the different regions as well for you. So I think that hits everything you asked, Matt.
Operator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets.
Aryeh Klein: Bill, you mentioned sharpening the lens for new investments. Can you talk about, practically speaking, what changes there? And then, Andy, just on the minus 8.8% renewal spreads for larger deals. You mentioned that negotiations there began months ago. What would those rates kind of look like if they were done today?
Arthur Stein: So sharpening the lens, I think practically, what you'll see is, over time, higher returns from the deals that we do and lower returning assets or investments dropping out of the mix. That's the practical implication. So obviously, it's more complicated than that because we look at risk-adjusted returns. We look at what return should be in any given market, what type of -- whether it's a build-to-suit or a speculative development, how much preleasing there is, whether there's any magnetic attributes to the customer. But in general, I think you'll see over time, higher yields.
Andrew Power: And then, Aryeh, before I get to your question, I just want to apologize, I misspoke in answering Matt's question, we had 2 months, not 1.5 months of the Teraco. Those numbers I quoted you in our financials. So just want to clean that one up. So as I mentioned before, the cash mark to markets have been moving in our favor for, call it, since we turned into 2022. And I would say, been strengthening along the way, and you saw that in our numbers, and you saw that in our guidance. That being said, as I've said before, we're not going to be universally at this minute without any negative market across any different product in any given quarter. I think the driver of the negative $8.8 million actually was a data center -- a one-off data center we acquired a couple of years back in Chicago. That customer's contract was in place. It was above market at the time. The markets scribed not caught up to when it rolled. I think the more strategic and important story about that asset is that the -- we literally just greenlight the conversion of some of the shelf space into growing our colo footprint in the suburbs of Chicago, which has been a really great success more recently. To go on to your question on, call it, I think it's bigger deals, price action in just the past year, not our biggest deal that I mentioned, which is the called build-to-suit. But I think our second biggest deal, which was a sizable plus megawatt deal. That transaction in North America signed and caught almost 18% net effective rates higher than a similar size transaction did, call it, a year prior. And the remaining space in that actually facility is probably being marketed up another 10%, 15%. Now we have an in that remaining space. So you're seeing a quick reversal in some of these markets where, again, demand is continually is robust and diverse, and the supply is being windled down.
Operator: The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street.
David Guarino: On the inclusion of the CPI linked to rent escalators, is that a trend you're seeing from hyperscale tenants? Or is that more heavily skewed towards the 0 to 1 megawatt bucket? And then the second question is, switching gears, just with the supply and power restrictions and a few of the top markets like Northern Virginia, do you think that's why you saw such strong demand in Dallas and Hillsboro this quarter? And are there any other spillover markets that you're seeing early signs of demand picking up that maybe they could have went to NOVA, if there was capacity there?
Andrew Power: Thanks, David. So first off, CPI was a predominant term, I would say, mostly in our European footprint, even before inflation was such a buzzword. Hence -- and that's the majority of, call it, just under 20% of our in-place contracts that have CPI escalations. We've been, call it, in the face of the current environment, making this a priority in our customer discussions. And it's not -- we're seeking that on larger contracts as well as -- larger contracts as well as smaller contracts. I would tell you, on a smaller contract, that already likely had a shorter duration, i.e., 2 years, 3 years, it's probably a little bit less a priority because you get another bite at the apple depending on the market rates. But we're trying to push it into those contracts. But if you look at our signings, we had a record quarter, 176 and 40% had CPI escalation. Some of them had capped or, call it, 2% or 3% on the floor and call it, 5% or 6% on the cap. But we were able to include in a significant percentage of our greater than 1 megawatt signings this CPI escalation. And those look greater than 1 megawatt science are typically the longest conference call it, 10 years. Hence, where it's the most needed because we won't get another opportunity to reset to the appropriate market rates for a fair bit of time. When it goes to NOVA spillover Dallas, Portland, I don't think -- our activity -- I would not describe our activity as spillover activity. The Dallas activity, a good portion of that was this build-to-suit customer demand. That customer picked -- they wanted multiple cities, so they're always going to pick not just NOVA. And then the Portland demand was very, call it, locational sensitive. I do think you -- and this is a -- I mean you don't typically buy data centers like rushing to the grocery store and grab some of the shelf and run into the checkout. So in the last 90 days, when this NOVA power issues come on the scene, I think the spillover effects are still playing out as we speak. I would say we see more of the early interest of spillover effects to, call it, Atlanta where we have, call it, almost 30-megawatt shell capacity, Northern New Jersey, potentially Chicago. Dallas could be in the mix as well. But -- as well as -- I mean, nearby spillover tech in Manassas, we have 200 megawatts.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Elias of Cowen and Company.
Michael Elias: Congrats on the leasing. Just two questions for me. First is, as you think of Northern Virginia and the power delays, you mentioned how the conversations are evolving with Dominion. But how are the conversations going with the customers themselves who pre-leased capacity. Is there any risk to those leases maybe being canceled or anything like that? And then second, your leverage is now running around 6.7x or 6.4x if we adjust for forward. Based on the conversations you've had with the rating agencies, what's the highest level of leverage that you can hold before you run the risk of maybe being downgraded or losing that investment-grade status?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Michael. I think we saved the best for last. So happy to take through both these. So the -- I think the customers are obviously alarmed, right? Most of these customers probably never experienced anything like this. But at the same time, I think they're incredibly grateful that they're in our hands and not some upstart competitor. And I know I'm biased in saying that, but I really mean it when. We're the largest in the market with a diverse set of campuses, of, call it, 0.5 gig of IT load and a truly experienced team holding their hands through it. And I'll reiterate what I said before, while I cannot guarantee it right now, we are optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of all of these customers. As it relates to your second question, we are -- obviously, the leverage has ticked up a little bit here. We are -- this is not a new normal. This is not where we desire to be. We've had a lot of moving parts in our capital stack with asset sales, joint ventures, acquisition closings with partial periods. We still have, call it, $0.5 billion of equity forward, which we've not drawn down. And we see a path to return to target leverage through leasing up our vacant capacities. We had -- you saw the occupancy, which was a great stack, really moving the needle on a sequential basis. We are seeing a more friendly mark-to-market in our cash flows. And we're going to do what we've been doing for a long time, which is capital recycling and tapping into our private capital sources. We sold billions of dollars of noncore assets and joint ventures. And that's going to continue to be our playbook. And we think there's a great lineup of partners that want to work with us to call it, CR leverage to be a capital partner to Digital Realty. That will bring that leverage back down towards target levels.
Operator: That ends our question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.
Arthur Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter, as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business and drove record quarterly bookings. These additional commitments are reflected in our growing development pipeline and the high level of preleasing. Second, we continue to enhance our global platform with the closing of Teraco, giving Digital Realty the leading position in South Africa and a critical complement to our existing capabilities elsewhere in EMEA. Third, we continue to execute with improving results in our core data center business, though these improvements are masked by foreign exchange headwinds. Finally, the capital markets are very -- were very volatile in the third quarter, and we've taken action by adding significant liquidity to our balance sheet and prioritizing our new investments. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team here at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will remain safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you at Nareit next month in San Francisco. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, the overarching trend of digital transformation remains a secular driver for our business, which was highlighted by yet another quarter of greater than $110 million of bookings and over a 100 new logos added, which was well diversified in terms of product [and GO]. Second, the improved re-leasing spreads we saw last quarter continued in 2Q, and we remain focused on offsetting the impacts of rising costs throughout our pipeline of new opportunity and development; third, our transformation into a leading global data center solution provider remains on track with our investment in Teraco expected to close within the next two weeks; and finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus for the quarter, though we tempered our expectations for the second half and full year 2022, principally due to continued FX headwinds as we reaffirmed our constant currency core FFO per share guidance for 2022. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty is levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data. We have an unmatched global operating footprint along with a strong development pipeline continue to deepen and expand that footprint to meet our customers' growing needs. Those customers are a growing community of more than 4,000 organizations across the globe, including the world's largest cloud service providers, communication providers that enable the global transport of data, Global 2000 enterprises as well as many multinational and industry-leading companies. Our second quarter results were strong with $113 million of new bookings and core FFO per share of $1.72, a 12% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 3% sequential increase, despite stiff FX headwinds. The dialogue with our customers surrounding the evolving supply-demand dynamic and our compelling value proposition has started to translate with price increases driving positive cash renewals, supporting our push for appropriate rent escalators and helping to maintain stable development returns. Despite generally higher prices, demand for data center solutions remains strong around the world with notable productivity in each of our regions. EMEA was a standout this quarter with all 5 of our largest deals landing in the region as the world's leading cloud service providers continued to utilize our platform to expand their infrastructure and support their growing needs. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust as enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture, while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. Andy will provide more color on our results shortly. But first, I want to touch on the recent launch of ServiceFabric Connect, an open interconnection solution and orchestration platform designed to support the wider industry shift to a hybrid data-centric architecture. This product launch empowers our enterprise and service provider customers to connect to anyone, anywhere at any time through an open and neutral digital marketplace. ServiceFabric Connect is the first of several related interconnection-oriented products that we have on our roadmap and was launched with availability in over 30 markets around the world. We are excited to bring this product to life, and we look forward to delivering these enhanced connectivity benefits to our customers. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform through a combination of organic new market entries that enhance our global productivity offerings as well as existing market expansions that are designed to meet our customers' longer-term capacity and connectivity solution requirements. Along these lines, in the second quarter, we acquired land in three European markets for ground-up development to support strong demand. In addition, we announced our entry into Israel with the formation of a joint venture with Mivne, a leading Israeli real estate group. Together, we plan to develop a data center campus in Petah Tikvah, the primary connectivity hub in Israel. Our presence in Israel will complement our facilities across the Mediterranean and will support the emergence of new connectivity routes that subsea cable operators are developing between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Finally, we have received the necessary regulatory approval in South Africa to close on the acquisition of Teraco, a leading colocation and interconnection provider in South Africa. We now expect to close the transaction within the next two weeks. Our active development pipeline remains robust and grew by more than 10% sequentially with 41 projects underway, supporting over 360 megawatts of IT capacity in 18 strategically important metros around the world. More than half of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. Given the dynamism of the current environment, we know how important it is to make sure that we are being appropriately compensated for the elevated risk throughout the capital markets and the broader economy. We have sought to mitigate these risks through our VMI program, appropriate pricing adjustments and CPI-based rent escalators that help insulate us from the impact of higher operating costs throughout the life of our customer contracts. Finally, as we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on opportunistically culling our portfolio. Since the end of 2019, we have monetized over $4 billion of assets through a combination of outright sales, joint ventures, and more recently, through the contributions to our Singaporean Capital Partner Digital Core REIT. We view these sales and contributions as an important source of capital raising as we continue to expand our diverse global portfolio and accelerate our growth. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to highlight an important update to our Board and then discuss the success we’re having with other ESG initiatives shown on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. In June, Mary Hogan Preusse, a 30-year REIT industry veteran was named Chairman of the Board, succeeding Laurence Chapman. Mary has served on our Board since 2017 and has played a critical role in driving Digital Realty's expansion and innovation as we have pursued our transformation to being a global full spectrum data center provider. We are fortunate that Laurence will continue to serve on our Board of Directors to provide his deep well of experience, understanding and leadership. Mary's appointment aligns with Digital Realty's commitment to strong governance, our focus on sustainability and the aim to balance fresh thinking with experience and continuity. I look forward to working with Mary in her new role. We also continue to advance the ball towards our sustainability goals in the second quarter. In addition to publishing our fourth annual ESG report, we became the first data center operator to achieve the milestone of 1 gigawatt of sustainably certified data center capacity. We also further expanded our renewable portfolio in the U.S. by contracting for 158 megawatts of new solar energy before the recent run-up in power prices, supporting our data centers in California and Georgia. Globally, 119 of our data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $113 million with a $12 million contribution from interconnection during the second quarter. New business was healthy across product types as sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 42% of the quarter's bookings, while deals larger than a megawatt accounted for 57% of this quarter's bookings. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. EMEA accounted for well over half of this quarter's new business as Frankfurt continued to set the pace in the region, while Paris was also a meaningful contributor. Leasing was also geographically broad based during the quarter with significant contributions from Northern Virginia, Athens, Zurich, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, Dublin and Amsterdam. Reflecting the strength of demand from our customers, we grew the size of our development pipeline to more than 360 megawatts under construction as we started over 100 megawatts of new projects in EMEA and North America, including 35 megawatts in Frankfurt and 38 megawatts in Paris. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region with most of those exports landing in EMEA, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. During the second quarter, we added another 108 new customers, bringing the total to more than 1,000 new logos since closing the Interxion transaction a little over two years ago. We see a growing trend of multinational companies deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. In terms of specific customer wins during the quarter, a leading IT service provider has experienced the full range of benefits of PlatformDIGITAL from greater performance and scalability to cost savings. These customers expanded their capabilities across three metros in two geographic regions, emphasizing hybrid IT by integrating bare metal and cloud storage. Two leading Global 2000 financial services firms chose PlatformDIGITAL for multi-set deployments in multiple metros across North America and Asia Pacific. One of the world's leading video game developers is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to access our global footprint, scalability and low latency performance. A Global 2000 reinsurer is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL with full-spectrum benefits from the strong community to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. And a life sciences organization is switching to PlatformDIGITAL in two markets across North America to reduce network costs while implementing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases, tapered $393 million by quarter end as record level of commenced leases outpaced new signings. A lag between signings and commencements moved up to 13 months due to one larger signing into a new campus development in Frankfurt. Excluding that lease, the sign of commencement period was more in line with our recent experience of about eight months. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $173 million of renewal leases during the second quarter at a positive 3.4% cash re-leasing spreads compared to 3.3% positive last quarter. Renewal rates were positive in each product segment and also in each of our three regions. The majority of total renewals were sub-1 megawatt deals, reflecting the higher unit price contracts that are characteristic of that segment. These renewals climbed by 3% during the second quarter. Among larger deals, rates increased by 1.1%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory of renewal spreads as well as our constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 60 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements from our record backlog. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base who continue to solve for complex IT infrastructure, connectivity and data integration challenges. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 5.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 400 basis point FX headwind in the last leg of a previously discussed sizable churn event. Most of this space has already been re-leased and will more fully commence over the next several quarters, which should drive an improved trend in revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. 57% of our second quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars with 22% in euros, and 7% in Singapore dollars, 6% British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. We have also actively mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. Turning back to currency. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 400 basis point to 450 basis point drag on year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from a top to the bottom line, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 12. As we've highlighted in the past, currency fluctuations has more typically served as a 50 basis point to 100 basis point headwind or tailwind to earnings in periods of lower volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our $4 billion-plus development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations and our investment pipeline along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. Of course, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with the heightened FX volatility, we will continue to evaluate our hedging strategy on an ongoing basis. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share of $1.72 was 12% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% higher sequentially, despite increased FX headwinds. The outperformance versus our prior expectations for the quarter was principally a function of lower-than-expected OpEx spend and a short delay in the closing of the Teraco transaction. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiffer than expected FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect FFO will dip down a couple of pennies in the third quarter, principally due to FX, but also as a result of the delayed normalization of OpEx spend, near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction and higher interest rates. Accordingly, we have adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions that remain under pressure from foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting a $0.05 per share adjustment at the low and high end of the range. Importantly, we are reaffirming our constant currency core FFO per share range of $6.95 to $7.05 for 2022. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 300 basis point to 400 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Lastly, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. Our reported leverage ticked down to 6.2x as of June 30, while fixed charge coverage increased to 6.0x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the last September's forward equity offering, our pro forma leverage drops to 5.8x, while fixed charge coverage improved to 6.2x. We remain focused on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from the pack and enables us to prudently fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have modest near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered maturity schedule for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet is poised to weather the storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: First of all, just curious on what your pipeline looks like in terms of hyperscale. I know you saw a tremendous amount of absorption in Q1. It was a little bit lighter, especially in the U.S. in Q2. Now any sense at all the large cloud operators are pulling back after a few record leasing quarters? Or is this just the natural ebbs and flows of the market maybe related to a slightly more limited inventory you had in some of your key markets?
Corey Dyer: Yes. So Eric, this is Corey. Just responding to you. Thanks for the question. And I would tell you that our hyperscale demand and our bookings this quarter were really strong, especially across Europe. Really solid bookings across North America as well as Tokyo with hyperscale, and we haven't really seen a slowdown in it. Going forward, from our pipeline, our pipeline broadly is really strong. It's the highest we've ever had across all of our segments, including hyperscale. So we feel really good about where we are. They're continuing just to take advantage of the offering that we offer them. They're across -- they're with us across about 40 different markets, really utilizing us for the connectivity, the enterprise customers that we have and really taking advantage of our platform on an ongoing basis. So no real slowdown that I see so far. Andy?
Andy Power: No...
Corey Dyer : Sorry, Andy.
Andy Power : Sorry, go ahead, please.
Eric Luebchow : I was just going to ask a separate question. So something that we heard about recently were some challenges about power supply for new construction at Ashburn. Some news reports that has been severely restricted by the local utility. So I'm just wondering if that's having any impact at all in your ability to build new capacity, particularly at the Western Lands campus in Ashburn or if you feel relatively insulated based on perhaps precommitments for power generation. And then separately, I think we've heard some comments from Bill that maybe you're working with some hyperscalers at that campus to plan some deals. So perhaps, an update as to what the sales funnel looks like in Northern Virginia specifically.
Andy Power: Sure, Eric. So the only thing I was going to add on, and sorry for interruption. Corey's first piece is that the -- if you look at the plus the megawatt signings were most of the hyperscale larger deals land. We did north of 50 megawatts. I think our largest deal is 10 megawatts. We had two around 5 each. So then you had, call it, 30 megawatts of, call it, 1 to 4 megawatts in size, including new landings and expansions from a diverse group of those hyperscalers. So that was the only data point I was going to add to that first question. On your second question, Eric, I would say, you definitely got the scoop in terms of something that's certainly very recently breaking. So I'll try to provide a little context and as well to answer your question. Dominion Energy, which is the primary power provider in that market, informed its major customers very recently regarding the call a potential pinch point in Eastern Loudoun County that could delay deliveries until 2026. So a little fair bit out there. The cause has been described to me as transmission, not generation, i.e. the pipes or the power line infrastructure, not the actual power. The power company did not give definitive answers to most of the relevant questions we and I would think you and others on this call would probably have, but they have been transparent about the potential issue, and they're working very diligently to finalize their assessment and then ultimately communicate their findings. What this means -- I mean while we're still obviously handicapping the potential outcomes, but net-net, if this is to come to fruition as we recently learned, it will obviously likely be a slowdown in delivery of new supply in what is our largest and the largest and most consistently in demand data center market in the world. So I see two possible outcomes there: one being called just a sense of greater pricing power and higher rates tied to the sharp reduction of near-term availability, which should be favorable to Digital given our standing in market; and then also likely to be potentially some winners and losers as it relates to the various developers, including Digital seeking to bring new inventory online in that market. We have -- you kind of go through the rundown of our footprint, call it, 40 megawatts available. You can see in our 500 megawatts of IT load operational as of 2Q. We also then have, call it, 50 megawatts was our last building on that legacy Loudoun campus. I think it's building all in the alphabet that I would say feels like on the lower risk of having an issue. But again, this is very new and subject to change. We have another 200 megawatts on our Manassas campus, which given its position in that market seems on the lower risk side. And then we do have, call it, based on a substation that's already built about 200 megawatts on that Digital Dallas aka Western Lands, call it 1 plus gigawatt site that is called. We got to figure out how that's going to play out in terms of delivery and time line, but I do like our odds, if any, given that we have a sitting substation already there. The steel has been erected, the capital is deployed. Net-net, given our activity in that market, only 24 megawatts of what I just mentioned other than the 40 available would deliver by the fourth quarter of '23, just normal timeline. So I don't see this as a huge impact to '23. And then last but not least, I mean, given other than the tighter market fundamentals, I mean I do like our odds here relative to the competitive set in North Virginia. I mean we're the largest provider of consistently operating with Dominion. We have substations and power infrastructure already built on our campuses, as I mentioned. And I think we are a very important player in that market to help the power company address this problem given our strategically important land parcels and easement. So sorry for the long-winded response, but I didn't feel that, that top would need some clarity given you've kind of just broke that news just yesterday, the day before.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Niknam : So first on pricing. It sounds like it's been an incrementally positive story just based on some of the recent commentary you've been hearing. So I'm just wondering if maybe you can elaborate on what you're seeing on the pricing front across regions. And then also on demand, I know -- I think Corey referenced very strong demand. I'm just wondering, in light of maybe some elevated concern around a potential macro downturn, any regions, any verticals where you may have seen or started to see any sort of moderation in terms of demand from your customers?
Andy Power: Obviously, those things are linked, Matt. So maybe I'll have Corey speak to demand first, and then I can tackle the pricing topic.
Corey Dyer : Yes, Matt, thanks. As far as demand, I mentioned hyperscaler demand earlier. Our demand across the board is really good. We've got it across all four -- all of our regions. I mentioned -- I think Andy mentioned in the prepared remarks, the demand across EMEA that was our largest landing spot for our business. Our pipeline is the highest pipeline I've ever had, and that's on top of a couple of years of huge growth in pipeline and in the business. So we feel really good about where the demand is and where the pipeline is. Enterprise customers are continuing to take advantage of PlatformDIGITAL, make use of the data gravity opportunity in front of them. And I feel like in a hybrid IT world, we're probably the best position to help them do that. And so we've seen our demand just grow across the board, enterprises across all regions and hyperscaler as well. If you look at the sub 1 megawatt, which is your colocation interconnection, that was our third highest quarter ever, right on the back of 2 of our highest quarters ever. So I feel really good about the demand.
Andy Power: And then, Matt, on your second question as it relates to pricing, I mean I would say, the commentary is fairly consistent with what Bill and I shared at the NAREIT conference, call it, early June. 2022, on the backs of, call it, us executing on the business and strengthening our value proposition with pricing power accrued to for several years, 2022 has started off -- or the first half, it's certainly been a called pendulum shifting dynamic. The demand has remained robust. Our value proposition is certainly resonating with what you've seen in the results and the pace of inventories had a challenge keeping up with it. And -- but what I just relayed on Loudoun County is called just one of the examples, but there's been others throughout the year as well. And that has allowed us to essentially move our list rates up numerous times, starting at the very end of 2021 through 2022, executed at higher rates across both our larger footprint and small footprint. Push rates on our renewal contracts, which last quarter, we had positive cash mark-to-markets certainly inflection on our cash mark-to-markets. We raised our guidance for the full year, and we followed with a second quarter of cash mark-to-markets as well. And I would say, all these things kind of flow through the entire, call it, commercial engagement with the customers to escalators and other provisions. So pricing has been moving in our favor in the first half of 2022.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi.
Michael Bilerman : Andy, I wanted to talk just a little bit about foreign exchange. As a U.S. dividend payer, obviously, you have to be mindful. And when I -- you're talking about obviously not repatriating a lot of income, not foreign income because you're reinvesting it. I guess just stepping back, how do you sort of think about being a U.S. dividend payer and being a global company with global flows? And you talked about other hedging techniques, and I want to know how much of that just simply borrowing more in foreign currency, putting more currency swap hedges in place versus thinking about other potential structures. And I recognize you did the REIT, but you did that with U.S. assets. I don't know if you're thinking about doing more localized. And so maybe if you can just expand a little bit more on that hedging comment.
Andy Power : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So I mean -- and we touched a little bit on this in the script. We've followed this playbook that you've somewhat summarized to your -- I mean often when we go into more volatile parts of the world like Latin America, we do partnerships. So we're not -- our equity is not entirely at risk. We also -- I've put a disproportionate amount of our debt in non-U.S. dollar financings, hitting the Eurobond, Swiss bond, Sterling bond. We have now called close to $4 billion in multicurrency revolver commitments. And so given that -- with that mismatch, you said of having a U.S. stock price in U.S. listed or U.S. currency dividends put more and more, call it, accessing diverse sources of capital and creating natural FX hedges along the way. At the same time, given the rate of return that we're investing relative to at least in more recent history has been very low rates in a lot of these currencies. There has been called cash flow or CFFO leakage. The point I was trying to highlight in the script, and this year, the volatility is just off the charts. I mean the year ago, the parity with the dollar is the highest it's been in several years. And certainly, it's created a headwind to our P&L or core FFO per share. But those same euros that got deflated in our P&L in 2022. We're also going into the ground with Europe being our largest development as part of the portfolio with 221 of our megawatts under construction across the continent or in London. So that is typically in our playbook. We've not followed some others in terms of, call it, just P&L hedging, which is really transacting with foreign currency derivatives to call it take out volatility, and that's been what we've done to date. Now I've also said in the prepared remarks, we're becoming a much more global company. There's no question of that. Call it, 50-plus metros, 27 countries, six continents, and we're in a -- certainly, and not in a long time heightened volatility to currency situation. So I think we're always open to good new ideas and something we'll consider in terms of adding to that FX playbook with various types of derivatives. Am I going to go a lot the euro at this point right now? I'm not sure quite honestly. I mean there could be a chance where some of these non-U.S. currencies or countries start raising their rates, and you have some reversion on some of this at the same time. So -- but that's really been what the past practice is, and we're always looking at trying to figure out new ideas to continue to actively hedge the business and mitigate risk.
Michael Bilerman: And then as a follow-up, as you think about the Singapore entity that you listed, and obviously, you put U.S. assets into a Singapore market, which at least driven that was what the market had sort of wanted. But is there an element that you look at that entity? Obvious, it's well off its IPO price. It has a cost of capital. It would need to transact on your U.S. assets at much higher valuations given how strong the U.S. dollar is. Does that -- so does that vehicle still work for you, number one? And then the second part of it is, would you consider vehicles that are local assets and local markets, which would accomplish -- you do it in private form, would you execute that in any public form as well?
Andy Power: So the -- the DC REIT, Digital Core REIT, started out with the North America portfolio, but does have a global mandate. And really the selection of the initial assets was, we had the most to pick from in North America, given our history track record, stage of development of those assets. But we do very well expect to globalize it and diversify it with other types of assets in different parts of the world. The Singapore dollar is, I don't think it's 100% linked currency to the U.S. dollar, but there is, I believe, monetary policies or there is some governmental linkage where they try to track the U.S. dollar in terms of currency. So it's not usually a wildly divergent to the U.S. dollar type of currency. I mean, we view that vehicle as a, call it, the home for core assets with -- that are stabilized, fully operational, long-waited average lease terms, and again, will be a global basis. We also have ventures like Ascenty in Latin America, which today is held by our partners Brookfield or Mitsubishi or MC Digital Realty in Japan or our partners, Mitsubishi Corporation, that are certainly a private partner today, but those certainly could evolve into forms of public partnerships over time. So we're always looking at different ways to find the most appropriate both debt and equity capital, private and public, for partners to most efficiently and prudently scale and grow the platform.
Operator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.
David Barden : I guess a couple. The first would be, Bill, you've talked about how steady kind of mid-single-digit inflation would be a useful tool for the pricing equation for the data center industry. I think in the script, you talked about resetting pricing on a CPI basis. I'm wondering if this is really -- is it CPI based? Is it supply-demand based? If you could kind of talk a little bit about your pricing strategy big picture there. And then back to the launch of the service platform, I was wondering if you could kind of talk about any expectations that investors should have for that being a contributor to the business or KPIs that we should look for on a go-forward basis?
Bill Stein : Sure. So just to be clear, the CPI-based returns are in the escalators. So we've gone from -- we're going from fixed annual increases to increases that are structured with the minimums with floors and then CPI Index increases above the floor and typically to some cap. So an example would be a 2% floor with a CPI-based increase above that to, say, 6% as a cap, and that's on an annual basis. And so we feel that, that provides some hedge for us for inflation. And then just keep in mind, relative to inflation that over 90% of our power costs are passed through, and that obviously, has been subject to a lot of inflationary pressure. In terms of the base rents, that's more a function of supply and demand in any given market. So -- and with supply chain challenges, I would say, supply is more challenged and demand continues at a very high pace. So that plus the increasing input costs on new builds not us so much because of our VMI program, but certainly, our competitors whether it's materials and/or labor. And our customers that are building their own are certainly experiencing these same pressures, it's pretty easy to justify higher base rates when you're talking to customers. Does that answer your question?
Andy Power: And thanks, David, for the question around the ServiceFabric. Yes. So we're -- I've kind of talked about this before to provide a little bit of color and background. It's a purpose-built product, right? And it really enhances our customer experience where we're removing technical complexity. And so what that's going to translate to and what we're watching is driving more of that sub-1 megawatt deployments where enterprises are looking to leverage and deploy their hybrid IT or multi-cloud deployment into our facility. So you'll see a lot more of that driving into our portfolio. And also, I think we're going to see us continually extend the reach into deeper sets of assets within our facilities, set differently, both colo and scale, will start to get the true benefit of interconnection, which at the end of the day will allow us to drive more value and higher margins outside of that product. And so that's one of the things we've been tracking extensively. And that utilization, which is another key KPI for us is multi-site, right, where we're starting to sell a blended set of capabilities, both scale and colo all heavily interconnected because that's where the market is headed. And that's where we see a lot of these larger enterprises requiring multi-market access with a highly interconnected backbone with true SLAs, and that's what the ServiceFabric was able to deliver to market there.
Operator: The next question comes Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.
Jon Atkin : Maybe just a follow-up to the topic raised two or three questions ago about asset recycling and the SREIT . They have their earnings call, I guess, 12 hours ago and specifically mentioned Chicago, Dallas, Frankfurt. So I wondered if there's anything you wanted to add to those comments around timing, and are we going to see all 3 or a subset of those all three or what's kind of the general cadence to suggest? So that's kind of maybe the follow-up. And then the question I had was about book-to-bill. It seems to have lengthened this quarter. That's kind of a choppy metric because I guess it depends on just the nature of the deals that you haven't designed in any given quarter, but it did lengthen noticeably anything to kind of call out there that might relate to the velocity of repeat demand that you might be seeing from the cloud providers or whether they might go through a digestion period. Appreciate Corey's comments about the pipeline being really strong, but the lengthening book-to-bill, is that something that's going to maybe shorten? Or how you see that trending?
Andy Power: Jon, I'll take them in reverse because second one is pretty clean. The -- so there's one specific transaction that we've signed that into one of our newest Frankfurt campuses that -- I mean that we're just getting off that plot, getting off the ground on. So that was really what lengthened that out. If you exclude that 1 transaction that I think the book-to-bill is, call it, eight months. So called in-line with our prior track record. And then on your -- on the first question, I mean, definitely, very pleased that the Digital Core REIT team down the gates with -- I think its official first earnings call. Not -- I don't think they have a lot -- too much to report other than the biggest news being making progress. We are making progress collectively on not -- really beyond asset selection to diligence to transactional docs and have really circled assets in three markets as prime candidates to act on for its first life of acquisition growth. And as a reminder, that vehicle, we took public last December with a called underlevered balance sheet. So it has embedded debt capacity called approaching $200 million. So it's not reliant on the equity capital markets out of the gates, but we do hope the equity capital markets respond favorably and continue to support that and because we want to see that vehicle grow, we think that's a great partner vehicle for these core parts of our campuses that fit that vehicle's mandate.
Jon Atkin: Slide 13, just looking at the FFO per share ramp and the seasonality through the year. And as we look at kind of -- you didn't put numbers on it, but the 3Q into 4Q ramp seems fairly modest compared to what you saw 1Q to 2Q as well as the NOI growth contribution in 2Q into the current quarter. So I'm just wondering, is there anything going on during the second half of the year that would moderate your sequential growth in the second half, specifically into the fourth quarter? And I read introduction to that slide or is there anything in particular that would cause the ramp to be so much less significant than what you've seen in the last couple of quarters?
Andy Power: Jon, I think it really was just timing. We had a really large commencement quarter in 2Q, and in the back half, you do have a few things, call it, working against us, which are those orange bars. One is, we do -- some of our beat in the second quarter was delayed timing on OpEx spend, which we believe is going to get pushed to the back half of the year, not a new event at Digital. We do see a pickup in interest expense, which everyone can see. And then we are closing Teraco in the coming weeks. And then lastly, call it, 24-ish or 25-ish percent of our core FFO is from like the euro, the sterling, the yen. And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you've seen degradation in those currencies about 5%, which is the FX headwinds. Hence, while we did change our as-reported guidance, we were able to maintain our constant currency guidance, which is about just north of 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Operator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets.
Aryeh Klein : Maybe following up on the power issue out in Ashburn. What does this mean, I guess, for leasing? In that market, does it put it on a pause, I guess, in the near term? And I think Corey mentioned kind of the record pipeline that's out there. What would that look like in Nova? And then just curious, how much you have in the way of expiring leases in that market over the next 12 or 24 months?
Bill Stein: Thanks, Aryeh. So I mean -- and then -- again, it's still subject to change because this is very new or late breaking, but it's going to paint a picture where we believe there's still going to be robust demand in a tightened or slowed supply environment. So -- and those economics mean rates typically rise and economics accrue to the providers. We -- I don't -- first and foremost, I don't see people leaving Ashburn for this delay. This isn't like a permanent feature of Ashburn, this is a, call it, bottleneck of a portion of Ashburn. And you've got an incredible amount of customers, infrastructures, network Ashburn grew to where it is for many reasons. And I don't see demand just running away from in the face of this. I think the available capacity is going to become more precious. Hence, that call it, 40 megawatts of operational that we have today is more precious. And if we're able to proceed and bringing on new capacity that I outlined, that becomes more precious. And if we look at our expirations, we've got about 18 or 17 megawatts respond in the back half of this year. Another 75 in '23. Another 58 in '24. Another 54 in '25, so call it north of 200 over the next through the end of '25, which is a normal amount of role for us, but Ashburn is our largest market. So we have a lot of microwatts rolling over the ensuing years.
Aryeh Klein: Got it. I guess in light of what's happening, those re-leasing spreads or the pricing around that, you would anticipate maybe being higher than you might have thought a couple of weeks ago.
Andy Power: Correct. Yes. I mean, I think asking rates on any available capacity in Ashburn, I mean when we got won of this, we went out to our entire field. The dynamics are shifting in Ashburn, and they could shift quite dramatically. So asking rates as well as negotiations on renewal contracts.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery : Just following up on the comments on the strong cloud demand. Can you just update us on what your cloud customers are saying in terms of their desire to work with you versus building themselves? Is there any change in that one way or the other or from one location to another? And then given some of the issues we're just talking about in Ashburn, obviously, power issues are even greater in Europe, and your -- you've just committed to some major new builds in markets like Paris and Frankfurt. What is on the ground there in terms of ensuring that you're going to have the availability of that power supply over the next several years for these and other expansions?
Bill Stein: Simon, I'll speak to the self-build question. So frankly, we -- the pipe scalers have been building their own for a long time, I'd say, for the last 10 years. And they have pursued what we call a hybrid model. So they have self-build, and they have -- they lease from third parties. That -- how much they do at any given time varies, and they don't all do it at the same time. So party A might be doing 100% third-party leasing and no self-building while party B is relying mostly on self-build. In the next year, they could change it up. But I would say, in the current environment, so in the current environment meaning that an environment that's challenged by supply chain and inflation, I think we're seeing an increased reliance on third-party leasing, right? And that's because we are as good as anybody at managing in what is, I would characterize it as a more challenging environment. And do you want to handle the power question in Europe.
Andy Power: Sure. So we have on-the-ground teams that speak the local language, worked in the municipalities, network to the business leaders. So in each of these jurisdictions that call it, you mentioned our top of list relationships to make sure that we're in constant communication. That doesn't mean something doesn't pop off like we're experiencing Ashburn episodically, but I would say, we have a very good hand on the pulse of what's going on there. I mean this -- we're supporting critical -- mission-critical infrastructure here for a host of applications that I would say, even in a rationing environment, we're very top of list in terms of access to resources, including power. And we're constantly monitoring the power sources or deliveries for new projects and preparing for even more draconian scenarios in terms of backup fuel sources that could play out given the fact that circumstances of what's going on in Eastern Europe. So -- and that's part of our business, and we have very high stakes customers that I view as partners kind of in line what Bill mentioned who are side-by-side with us on these issues, right? They're with us with, expressing the criticality of them getting live on certain dates. So I think that partnership is -- so we would mutually benefit in terms of being able to derisk our execution on their behalf.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.
Frank Louthan : What conversations have you had with folks kind of looking ahead to possibly shrinking economy and so forth? Are you seeing any proactive pull forward of digitization saving costs and so forth? And can you give us a little bit more color on sort of the verticals that you're seeing the strength in the bookings? Any shift there from your usual case characters, any new or different industries that you're seeing coming stronger.
Andy Power: Thanks, Frank. Maybe I'll start it off, and then Corey can -- so we've -- I don't think we've seen to date economic softness in our demand. You heard from Corey's description on the forward pipeline and look at our results in terms of new bookings and new logo additions, and I think that's based into that we are really mission-critical priority. We're not a discretionary spend. We are -- we're facilitating performance enhancement. We're facilitating growth through digital transformation for our customers' businesses as well as efficiencies for our customers. So I think that's -- and we've also been through a few economic cycles as well, and the history would say that our trend is our friend on that topic. If you look at the sectors, I think some of the usual ones, in North America, we saw a good amount of financial services. Cybersecurity, in EMEA, we saw this quarter's media telecommunications, initiative cloud and Asia Pacific, similar to what we saw both America and EMEA. So pretty broad brush as well as call more general corporate enterprise across health care, manufacturing, retail, et cetera. So -- and I think that goes back to -- there's a common theme across almost all these industries about what our services are doing to enable their services.
Corey Dyer: Yes, I would add to it, Frank, that we had 17 subsegments do more than $1 million in bookings this last quarter, which speaks to the breadth of the demand. We haven't seen a pullback. If you think about the secular trends around service providers driving revenue, enterprises saving money, adding features as far as efficiencies, taking advantage of a hybrid IT world that we're really well positioned for. We haven't seen that affect the demand in any way. Maybe pull forward a little bit, but I haven't seen it really affected because I've got a record pipeline in colo, record pipeline in interconnection, record pipeline in enterprise and just a record pipeline overall. So if there is an effect on inflation, then I would tell you that it's not enough that it keeps them from continuing to come to look to us to build out their infrastructure.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson.
Nicholas Del Deo : First, on the -- looking at your expected returns in the development pipeline, pricing is up. It looks like returns are consistent, maybe falling a little bit, particularly in Europe. Is that a function of mix shift with more large deals in the pipeline or other factors at play there?
Andy Power: Thanks, Nick. The -- I think the returns went down 30 basis points to 40 basis points from 10.4 to about 10, which is really a mix shift. We've added to the base some larger-scale projects that already have or will have some anchor leases that are -- we're certainly on the lower end of our return spectrum. But I would say, the pricing is robust, particularly in Europe, which is one of our tightest regions and has got a numerous markets where we're serving both large and small customers. So I would attribute that's pretty much sole that quarter-over-quarter mix shift.
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay. Got it. And then maybe 1 more on the Ashburn power topic. I think you made a case that customers are not going to leave Ashburn because of this. If it does cause any customers to kind of reconsider their concentration in Ashburn and maybe you want to diversify a little bit, say, into adjacent markets like Richmond or Culpeper or Manassas. Do you think you can react quickly to capitalize on any sort of diversification trend?
Bill Stein: So I'm not sure I think diversification trend would likely have been outside of like that Northern Virginia part of the world, quite honestly. And we've got shells in Atlanta, we've got capacity in the call it the suburbs of New York City and Chicago and Dallas. So there's -- I think you could see a spillover effect on a temporary basis to other parts of the United States. But I don't think you're going to see a running to other cities in Virginia, quite honestly. And I don't -- I mean, the -- this is locationally sensitive workloads, right? The infrastructure and networking has been in the ground and been built upon and grown upon for years and years in Ashburn. The clouds have architected their networks with on-ramp locations that are locationally sensitive availability zones that have radius restrictions. And I don't -- the fact that this is a slowing of the Ashburn, not a halting of the Ashburn or a pocket of Ashburn to me says, I don't think that you're going to really be able to move this tremendous center of gravity for the data centers worldwide.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business, which drove another strong quarter of bookings and new business additions to our global platform. The robust demand that we are seeing is reflected in our growing development pipeline. Second, we continue to press our advantage through tactical and organic new market entries as the additions of Israel and Barcelona this quarter will enhance our connectivity offering in the Mediterranean while our investment in a leading colocation and connectivity provider in South Africa is expected to close in short order. Third, we posted stronger-than-expected core FFO per share results, despite stiff FFX headwinds, and we maintained our constant currency core FFO per share forecast for the year, which represents more than 7% growth year-over-year. Last, we are very proud of our team's launch of ServiceFabric, an open and neutral digital marketplace, supporting our customers' digital transformation journey and enabling hybrid multi-cloud requirements. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming events. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, operator and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, we kicked off the year on a high note with record bookings of $167 million, led by strength in the leases greater than 1 megawatt and supported by steady bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection category. Second, we saw a notable and broad-based improvement in our re-leasing spreads in the quarter, reflecting a healthier pricing environment but also the active engagement we are having with customers on the Digital Realty value proposition. Third, we remain poised to continue our expansion in Africa with plans to close our investment in Teraco later this quarter. And finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus' expectations despite FX-related headwinds. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.
Bill Stein: Thanks, Jordan and welcome to the Digital team. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework and we made further progress on each front during the first quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco in early January. We also continue to grow our business organically around the world. We posted another record quarter of global bookings totaling $167 million of annualized rent, including our second highest quarter in each of the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, together with another solid quarter in EMEA. Bookings this quarter were led by strong results in the greater than 1 megawatt category, particularly in the Americas, while sub-1-megawatt bookings remain steady and in line with our 2021 average. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. During the first quarter, Digital Realty was named one of America's Most Just Companies and third overall in the real estate industry by Just Capital and CNBC. We also maintained our status as a member of the FTSE4Good Index which measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices, continuing our record of recognition for our leading sustainability initiatives. During the first quarter of 2022, Digital Realty continued our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through our employee-led DEI council which seeks to promote inclusion and create opportunities for each of our employee communities. Through the DEI council, Digital Realty has expanded its philanthropy and community engagement activities with strategic donations and partnerships with global charitable organizations. Digital Realty has also taken a stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and those impacted by the Russian vision. We do not have any data centers or operations in Russia or Ukraine and our company will abide by sanctions against Russia. Until the peaceful and legal resolution of this conflict, we will not invest in Russia. Furthermore, we are funding philanthropic organizations to support Ukrainian refugees, those displaced within Ukraine and the growing humanitarian crisis. Let's turn our investment activity to Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. We acquired land in 3 markets for organic development, including the first location for our joint venture with Brookfield in India, along with 2 parcels in Europe to support the strong demand in that region. After the quarter, we purchased 3 additional land parcels in Europe, including a beachhead in Barcelona, marking our organic entry into this complementary Mediterranean metro. Our active development pipeline reached an all-time high in the quarter with 44 projects underway supporting over 300 megawatts in of IT capacity in 28 metros around the world. 58% of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. We've expanded our development in the Americas, adding further capacity in New York, Northern Virginia and Toronto. Demand remains very strong in EMEA and we are continuing to invest across this region with active development projects in 17 of our 18 markets. Frankfurt is still the most active development market in EMEA, followed by Paris. We continue to make good progress toward closing the Teraco transaction which we still expect to close in the first half of this year. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. We are also proactively managing risks to help insulate Digital Realty against the impact of the current inflationary and rising interest rate environment. We are well protected against the impact of rising energy costs given the pass-through nature of substantially all of our customer contracts and we are effectively managing against rising input costs through our vendor-managed inventory program and the expansion of our prepurchase equipment pool. We are constructively engaging with new and existing customers on the impact of rising costs which is translating into better pricing. This is partly reflected in the broad-based and improved cash leasing spreads we experienced in the first quarter but is also showing up in new lease transactions across most of our markets. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. Our customers continue to solve the most complex IT infrastructure in activity and data integration challenges. We see a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally. Recently, industry research firm, IDC, updated their global data sphere forecast for 2025, Predicting the annual data creation rate will exceed 180 zettabytes per year or roughly triple the '21 rate. IDC concludes that companies of all sizes will need to prioritize data sharing and security to improve business resiliency and create a differentiated experience for their customers. Earlier this week, we published our inaugural Global Data Insights survey with strategic insights from 7,200 companies across 23 countries and 9 industries about the role of data in their business agenda. According to the survey, 70% of these companies are prioritizing secure data exchange in their current plans. The global data survey will augment our Data Gravity Index to provide telemetry for our customers, partners and their respective industries as they evolve their business platforms to harness the power of data and co-located infrastructure to unlock a new era of growth through connected data communities. In addition, Digital Realty recently joined the iMasons Climate Accord as a founding member. This coalition of leading companies is united in their views on carbon reduction in digital infrastructure. The group will establish an independent governing body to define an open standard that provides transparency, traceability and measurement of progress toward reducing carbon from sourced power and embodied carbon found in materials, products and operations of digital infrastructure. This is another great example of our commitment to the continuous innovation and execution of our platform digital road map to provide a sustainable and differentiated value proposition for our customers, partners and the broader industry. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $167 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarterly record and the seventh time in the last 8 quarters we have delivered bookings over $100 million. While our new business was healthy across product types, larger deals accounted for 70% of the quarter's bookings, while sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 30% of the total. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. Demand was particularly strong in the Americas with Northern Virginia and Toronto leading the way. Fundamentals continue to tighten in both metros, as reflected by the high levels of pre-leasing on our development pipeline. In EMEA, Frankfurt remains the standout, while in APAC, demand remains robust in Singapore and Japan. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region, with most of those exports landing in EMEA followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. We landed 128 new logos during the first quarter, maintaining the momentum we have built over the last several quarters which has been a strong validation of Platform Digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Zenlayer, a global edge cloud provider, is expanding on Platform Digital across 3 continents to improve its geographic coverage, scale and access to customer communities across various industries. A Global 2000 consumer financial services firm continue to expand with Digital Realty, leveraging Platform Digital's full suite of capabilities, including rationalizing data centers, implementing IT controls and interconnecting with key business communities. Box Technologies, a leading innovator of high-performance desktop-as-a-service applications, is deploying on Platform Digital, supporting enterprise data architecture applications, serving the manufacturing, construction and engineering industries. A leading IT company is leveraging our full product spectrum by utilizing our connectivity offerings to support data exchange across 3 metros in North America and Lat Am to improve performance and scalability and reduce costs. Magnite, a global independent advertising platform is expanding our platform digital in multiple metros across EMEA to enable their hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 reinsurer selected Platform Digital for mainframe migration with seamless connectivity to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced grew by 15% and from $378 million to a record $436 million, driven by the strong first quarter signings which outpaced commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated to 7 months with nearly 2/3 of our $436 million backlog scheduled to commence later this year. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $177 million of renewal leases during the first quarter at a positive 3.3% cash re-leasing spread. Renewal rates were positive across the board, were spread in the black across product types in all 3 regions. 2/3 of total renewals were sub-1-megawatt deals, resulting in a smaller sample size for the 1-plus megawatt category in the quarter. Excluding one larger short-term extension, our cash renewal spread would have been positive 2.5%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory on renewal spreads as well as constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy ticked down by 30 basis points sequentially, driven by previously reported churn events, most of which has already been re-leased. Consistent with our full year guidance, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 3.1% in the first quarter, primarily driven by 220 basis points of FX headwinds, the timing of no move-outs and a customer bankruptcy. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months and FX represented a 200 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 11. Our operations, along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. A little less than 60% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, followed by approximately 25% in euros and roughly 5% each in Singapore dollars and British pounds. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in SOFR would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share of $1.67 was flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Despite FX headwinds, a $0.01 impact related to a customer bankruptcy and a difficult comp due to the contribution of assets to digital core REIT. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately $49.51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down a couple of pennies in the second quarter due to normalized OpEx spending and near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction before bouncing back in the second half of the year as leases from a record backlog commenced. Most of the drivers underlying our guidance remain unchanged but given the improving pricing environment, we are bumping up our outlook for cash re-leasing spreads for the full year to slightly positive compared to flat last quarter. We are maintaining our existing core FFO per share range of $6.80 to $6.90 despite the customer bankruptcy and stiffer FX headwinds. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 250 to 300 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. We were active again in the capital markets during the first quarter. We took advantage of favorable OEM market conditions to lock in EUR 750 million at 1.375% for 10.5 years. And later in the quarter, we completed a dual tranche Swiss bond offering, raising a total of CHF 250 million at a blended coupon of approximately 1.25%. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem 450 million of bonds at 4.75%. Reported leverage ratio is 6.3x while fixed charge coverage is 5.5x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the forward equity offering last September, our pro forma leverage ratio drops to 5.9x, while fixed charge coverage improves to 5.7x. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. A little over 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a fixed a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jon Atkin: Two questions. I wanted to find out a little bit about the elevated demand and the record leasing. And I wondered how much of that you might attribute to in the greater than 1 megawatt category, any kind of a shift in the mix between building, self-building and leasing on the part of the hyperscalers. And then the second question around pricing, given higher costs and some of the developments that you mentioned, do you see this as really having the impact of protecting your target development yields given the higher cost or perhaps aiming to enhance your target yields?
Bill Stein: Well, Corey will start off. Jon, thanks for the question on the ad product demand. I'll pick up hyperscale and I think Bill will tackle the second part of your question.
Corey Dyer: Yes. So we'll be pretty comprehensive here with our answer to you, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I would tell you that with regard to the enterprise demand, we've got customers that are just being driven to the business needs and opportunities that are in front of us. Bill mentioned earlier we just published our Global Data Insights survey with data becoming a critical agenda topic for all the businesses and it raised really 5 key things. Data was pervasive, it's the business agenda, it requires aggregation and control and it's localizing and it's a data first strategy's win. And so we're seeing that is really what's driving a lot of the demand across the enterprise. As far as where is it happening from a regional perspective, if you even want to do a baseball analogy, sometimes you guys ask, I'd say North America is probably middle innings with a healthy bullpen that you ought to have in it. And then, I'd tell you that EMEA is probably third inning, maybe anything behind APAC, a little behind that as customers are still really waking to the data opportunity that's right above all of us and it was really highlighted in the index that we just did in that survey. I'd also tell you that we had really strong exports across all regions which was great. And then we're seeing an uptick in all the multi-market and multi-region wins. So really happy with the enterprise. I'll let Andy give you a little bit of perspective on the hyperscalers.
Andy Power: Thanks again, Jon. The -- I mean I think we've now had a several -- I think in the prepared remarks, 7 or 8 quarters north of $100 million of gap which speaks to consistent demand in the hyperscale being a major component of that. You had a record, call it -- in the fourth quarter, you had another record and these records, I'll call it, demonstrably higher than the prior, call it, $100 million averages. If your question about the self-build versus procuring through Digital Realty or other providers, I don't think the pendulum has swung to a point where the cell builds off the table. But I would think in times like today, when there's increased volatility, supply chain issues, a war in Eastern Europe, having a global platform to support hyperscaler growth across now 50 metropolitan areas in 26 countries, it's a tremendous value-add to our hyperscale customers. And I think their demand has been consistent for the last several quarters, with some peaks along the way and we see the forecast remaining quite strong as well.
Bill Stein: Relative to pricing, Jon, pricing dynamics are clearly market specific and will depend on both supply and demand in each market. So when demand exceeds supply, we've been able to raise our prices. And this is reflected in our results. So for example, if you look at our first quarter leasing results in Northern Virginia, our average prices were about 6% higher than just last quarter in the fourth quarter. That market is increasingly tightening. We're also fortunate to be in a position where we're well insulated from the increased costs on our current development pipeline and that's because of our contracts with suppliers and our vendor managed inventory program. So -- and this has obviously helped us not just in terms of cost but to assure that we do have the supply to continue around the world.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, just on the bankruptcy filing from earlier in April that had some implications for digital core REIT and then kind of a letter of guarantee from you. This has been kind of going on for a couple of years but any sort of an update with respect to that customer and your direct exposure? Are they current on payments, what are you sort of anticipating with respect to that tenant?
Andy Power: Sure. we'll give you an extra question here. So that customer from a current -- on receivables, they had a very modest amount of called pre-petition outstanding receivables. They were regularly current paying customer, not a late paying customer and they're fairly pretty well up to date, a couple of million, I would say and really concentrated in the U.K. was outstanding when they entered bankruptcy. Obviously, they're going to go through a process under U.K. administration, in the U.S. and also Canada. That will play out over several months. The -- I think if you take a step back, really what -- I think what's more relevant is that customer obviously got, call it, sideswiped by 2 particular issues. One, obviously, a part of their business what's not common in our customer base was disaster recovery for office which has obviously got impacted by the Zoom-ification during the pandemic; and then secondly, the elevated power prices, especially in Europe at incremental liquidity constraints. I don't see that as a really recurring theme in our customer base, especially the first piece of what I described. And this customer is going to obviously work through with this bankruptcy process. And I think we've been taking active steps not just related to this customer but in general, to continue to streamline and focus our portfolio on core assets that we have -- we see robust and long-term demand, multicustomer facilities, less single stand-alone facilities. And quite frankly, why we entered the colocation interconnection business several years ago was not only was the growth to our business but also to be prepared in the event that some of our colocation resellers ran into financial times and we had to step in and support their end customers only in the event that leases are rejected, obviously.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: So one follow-up and one question. So on the follow-up, when you're talking about leasing, can you unpack the opportunities to lease up the existing inventory? And how much of the bookings you're seeing go towards that and where occupancy on the existing portfolio can get over the next 12 to 24 months? And then just a second question, I think it's Page 20 in the supplemental, the same-store numbers. How does that look if you were to put that on a constant currency basis in terms of the rental performance on the revenue side? And how does that look over the next 12 months as you talked about the pricing opportunities and some of the positive renewals that you're seeing?
Andy Power: Thanks, Michael. So let me try -- there's a couple of numbers questions in there. So let me start and try to get through some of those and then also hand off on the leasing question a little bit to Corey as well. So in reverse, in our earnings deck, we tried to provide both as reported and constant currency. And we also tried to show adjustments for apples and oranges in comparisons on a year-over-year basis. So you could see that the second set of bars on that chart has had our as reported same-store cash NOI down negative 3% which was in line with our guidance. On a constant currency basis, it's down 90 basis points. And the hit I just called out in terms of the bankruptcy customer, call it, $4 million, $5 million or whatever, that was -- I think it's about 60 -- almost 70 basis points of that negative 90. Those are all on an NOI basis. I apologize I don't have the revenue equivalent off the top of my head. That same pool is also getting impacted by a year-over-year elevated property taxes which we previously mentioned. And more importantly, we're re-leasing vacated capacity which I think dovetails with your first question. We've made a concerted effort to focus more and more of our leasing wherever possible and to already build infrastructure given the high flow-through of contribution of that revenue into that capacity and having an installed base that wants to expand with adjacency or grow in our campuses is always a little bit easier than going out and landing a new customer. In terms of the leasing into that capacity, if you basically just take the signed already in this quarter or last quarter or 2 that has not commenced to hit our occupancy and that would bring our same-store occupancy up about 80 basis points by itself, i.e., the leases are signed, they're just literally waiting for the customers to move in throughout the year. That obviously is going to flow through into our '22 results in a partial year period and then a full year period in '23. We are -- as I mentioned, we're very focused on re-leasing that vacant capacity. We're incentivizing wherever possible. And quite honestly, some of the supply-demand dynamics that are playing out industry-wide in addition to execution against our platform are really lending itself to fill that up at a more accelerated pace. I think we did about 20-plus megawatts into that type of vacated capacity, i.e., they weren't the first customer in that suite in the first quarter of this year. And that is a rapidly accelerated pace relative to, call it, prior year velocity.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on some of the strength in hyperscale, I'm just wondering, it's beyond just 1Q. Are you sort of sensing any pull forward of demand from customers given looming concerns around supply chain constraints? Or do you sense that the strength here is more sustainable? And then just to go back to Michael's question also on one of the slides, Slide 11, I think you outlined core FFO per share growth on a normalized sort of constant currency basis this year would be north of 7%. I know, Andy, I think in the past, you've talked about mid- to high single core FFO per share growth on a forward basis. Just wondering, all else equal, as we start thinking about 2023, without giving specific guidance, is that sort of 7-ish percent rate that's on the Slide 22, a good sort of framework or start point to think about as we think beyond this year?
Corey Dyer: Matt, this is Corey. I'll take the first 2 questions, I think, that you had, one being around the supply chain impacts and then also the hyperscale demand. I'll take them in that order, if that helps you out. And as Andy mentioned kind of at the beginning of the commentary, our sales and marketing engine just continues to build up our demand and our pipeline growth, right? And I would tell you that the supply chain, inflation, energy costs has not really been a factor in that. Our customers really are thinking through what they do and how they source those materials so that they're setting up their commencement dates ahead of it with us. So they're just being really thoughtful about it and thinking through these concerns. And what I think it's done is actually had us create better dialogue with our customers to think through how we're going to solve this and create probably a little bit more demand for us as they think through it but it hasn't negatively impacted it at all. As far as the hyperscale demand, we're really still experiencing really strong demand from the hyperscalers across all regions, right? They work with us to help their speed to market. We're with them increasingly around their business impairs around this data opportunity the CSPs are helping all the enterprises with. We're seeing larger deal sizes at CSPs as they work to keep up with demand. So we have a really healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year. And I'd also say there's probably a dozen or so of these CSPs and more of them emerging in Asia and across the board. It's also helping us increase our demand on our pipeline for it. So really happy with both of those and where we're seeing the trajectory.
Andy Power: And then, Matt, on your second question, I mean we just reported the first 1 quarter of 2022. So obviously, not prepared to put 2023 guidance out just yet. But obviously -- but you can see on a constant currency basis, we're now north of 7% on the bottom line core FFO per share that extraordinary FX headwinds this year, if you look back the last several years, you had, call it, currency fluctuations in the, call it, 2 to 5 or so percent. And this year, the year, call it, soon to be like 9% delta. The headwinds -- or could be a tailwind, usually we're in the 50 to 75 basis points range. And now we're, call it, north of 200 basis points of headwinds. I think -- look, the goal from the beginning of the year as well as last year is to continue to accelerate bottom line's earnings growth. Last year, we came out of the gate with guidance of 4%. We ended up with 5%. This year, we came out with guidance of 5% which we are affirming in this call, despite these FX headwinds as well despite a customer bankruptcy. And our goal is to kind of again keep consistently putting up mid- to high single digits bottom line growth.
Operator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: Andy, I wondered if you could just talk about the balance sheet a little bit. You talked about bringing the pro forma leverage down to 5.9x. How are you thinking about, given the sort of interest rate environment, the uncertainty? Where do you want to have that over the next few years? And I think you still have guidance for dispositions during the year. Again, how are you thinking about both the sizing of dispositions and what vehicles you might use for that?
Andy Power: Thanks, Simon. So first and foremost, better to be lucky than smart. We are out of the gates with a sizable EUR 750 million bond literally the first, I think, business day of 2022 and priced 10.5-year paper in the 1-plus percent, call it, category. So pleased with that. Followed that up with even more volatile start of the year, a Swiss bond offering which, again, both of those, I think, diversifying our source of capital, increasing our FX hedge, locking in long-duration debt at attractive cost of capital. We also increased our revolving credit facility by an incremental $750-ish million during the quarter, just a full start of liquidity given the broader uncertainty in backdrop. We still have not drawn down or close to $1 billion equity forward just yet. We look to close on Teraco in the next couple of months or so, or actually probably a month or 2, I guess. And then back half of the year in terms of capital sources on the leverage side to again keep us in line in terms of our targeted net debt to EBITDA. We will obviously evaluate equity as an alternative but right now at these current levels, I think the continued disposition of noncore assets as well as incremental contributions of core assets from our portfolio to digital core REIT in the back half of the year are going to be our primary funding mechanisms. And we made some great progress, obviously getting Digital Realty through its first earnings season and also working on identifying that next leg of assets to continue to grow and diversify and strengthen Digital Realty.
Simon Flannery: Great. And how do you -- how are you seeing these sort of M&A multiples given the interest rate environment? Any change there?
Greg Wright: Yes. Simon, it's Greg. Look, to date, I'd say the private market seems to be lagging the public markets a little bit and I don't think that's uncommon. I think the public markets usually lead. But look, I think if rates stay up over time, you should start to see multiples come down. But right now, we see a lot of stuff out there but it feels as though the private market multiples have been a little sticky high at this point.
Operator: Our next question will come from Eric Rasmussen with Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen: So we've heard some very large deals in the first quarter. What's changed in the market that would lead to these massive deals? And then maybe with that, how do you plan for this?
Andy Power: Eric, I think -- I assume you're seeing large leases, large multiple megawatt leases. I mean -- I think the theme -- the growth in the sizing of customer requirements on the hyperscale front has been building for some time, not necessarily a completely overnight phenomenon. And I think you witnessed in the first quarter this year or the fourth quarter of last year, other quarters of last year and the year prior. I think you guys are seeing this continued cloud adoption broadly, continued opening of new regions, opening an offering of new services. And you're seeing this digital transformation wave in the cloud customers despite the volatility and the uncertainty of an economic backdrop or the war and the like leaning in and securing infrastructure to future-proof their runway for their end customers. So, it doesn't feel like the -- one record quarter after another is a little bit of an unusual outcome. But it doesn't feel like the pace of demand is really slowing on the hyperscale front. And I think what's also helped in that backdrop of this continuing steady demand, it's just become more challenging to be a provider. You have the inflationary pressures, you have supply chain challenges, you have labor challenges and you even have moratoriums in certain parts of the world see some demand. And I think going to the part of how do you get ahead of this is that you'd be in this business for the long run, with Digital Realty been in this business for almost 20 years. You build a scale and capital sources to support our customers through good times and bad. You make sure you have the runway to future-proof their growth. That's the acres and acres of often contiguous expansion capacity. You secure your supply chains so that you're on time and under budget, wherever possible and be that trusted infrastructure partner. I think those are the key ingredients to our recipe.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just my second question. As it relates to the development pipeline which is very active, besides the chip shortages, what's happening on the construction side, whether it's getting the right materials or having the proper staffing, especially considering the demand backdrop and maybe even increased competition in some markets that you might be seeing.
Chris Sharp: Yes. No. Thanks, Eric. This is Chris. Yes, it's something that we've been constantly looking at. And just to echo Andy's comments a little bit earlier, we've always looked at long-term engagements with our construction teams and with our suppliers. And so the continued development pipeline that we've been putting to market, it's really paid off, right, where we keep the same crews on the projects and we roll into new projects and just watching how that grows. I'd also say we have the gold standard in VMI, vendor-managed inventory, for building out a lot of this infrastructure. So even before some of the supply constraints hit us, we started ramping up the budgets for that. And I think one of the other great things with being with digital is we've been able to expand the program to be able to support our customer needs. And so now it's become a differentiator in the market where we're now able to provide customer -- some customer equipment to help them procure their infrastructure. And so it's just something that we've been able to plan ahead of and we're constantly looking at different routes to market with, particularly the chip shortages and things like that, looking at the secondary markets, where leveraging a lot of secondary equipment that's been refurbished and put a warranty against it. It's been able to allow a lot of customers to overcome some of those challenges. But it's something we're constantly watching and looking at and making sure that we have the best capabilities and, quite frankly, equipment infrastructure available to our customers and for our own builds on a global basis. So that's something that we're very proud about.
Operator: Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Curious about your development pipeline. It looks like you're almost 60% pre-leased across the entire globe and over 80% in North America. So are you fairly comfortable with your inventory position today? Or if we do see a continuation of this large hyperscale demand, might you end up toward the higher end or even above the development CapEx guide you laid out?
Andy Power: Thanks, Eric. I mean that is obviously a constantly evolving schedule where we're adding projects in terms of new starts and we're subtracting projects that are delivering and being commissioned for customers and opening at high levels of pre-leasing. It's a combination of offices or colocation product as well as our scale and hyperscale dedicated data halls. We're trying to always stay ahead of the game, focusing on the longest lead time parts of development. Obviously, land procurement, hence the acreage I mentioned previously, followed by shelves. And then Chris just touched on our, call it, overall infrastructure and build-outs. I don't -- I think when you look at the combination of our current stabilized portfolio that has availability that we're actively leasing into our shelves and their delivery schedules and as well as our land, I feel good. There's always a market or 2 that will be a little tighter than I would like but I feel I think probably more in terms of the hyperscale front that these larger deals, you're often engaging in contracting at very early stages of those projects. So you don't need to necessarily have a finished data hall in order to sell that capacity, hence having that land bank and shelves coming online are very good selling tools by themselves.
Eric Luebchow: And just 1 follow-up on the renewal spreads on mark-to-market. Do you think we're at the point now where those should continue to only improve after this year? And how much of that might be due to just improving the broadly improving pricing environment or perhaps a kind of better mix of leases in the next couple of years, either more international, more enterprise and fewer above-market leases?
Andy Power: Yes. So we've obviously been working through this for some time. I would say, over the last several quarters, the -- call it, the mix was certainly helping us as we've kind of chopped through some of our largest customers, major expirations, as we got through more of the North America and more -- onto more international mix, having the less than a megawatt more highly connected destinations, legacy interaction, Westin, Telx, etcetera, being more -- a bigger piece of the puzzle. And last year, we came in a little bit better than we had guidance but albeit negative. This year, we guided to flat which is a year-over-year sequential improvement. And I think what you're seeing in this quarter are a few things. On the one hand, I'm not -- I wouldn't say that I can rule out that we'll never have a negative cash mark-to-market on any given product for the next several quarters. I don't think we're at that level of positive yet. But you saw positive across the board in the plus less than a megawatt categories. It was -- in the less than a megawatt which is the largest piece of it, it was up versus the LTM, about 130 basis points, cut north of 2.5% which is a pretty sizable move. And we've guided now for the full portfolio for 2022, slightly positive. So again, not -- I can't tell you we're fully done with never having a negative cash mark-to-market but the trend is certainly playing out which I would say is a combination of mix and also the broader pricing ratch up where the pendulum of pricing is swinging slightly more and more back to Digital Realty.
Operator: Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Rob [ph] on for Frank. Where did you guys end the quarter on a quote of varying heads? And have you seen any hiring issues in sales or across any other parts of the business to help maintain growth?
Corey Dyer: We've got about 130 quota-bearing head. If you think about all the sellers we really have, there's more than that after you get to it because we've got a whole team of SAs and SEs, all of our management team. I'm here looking at it. So it puts us closer to, I'd say, effectively more like 200 when you get to that point. But yes, we're seeing it do really well and we're excited about the team and how they're performing and how they're engaging with our customers. I'm sorry, was there another follow up?
Andy Power: I think the hiring and ability to hire for that opportunity.
Corey Dyer: Yes. And so we've been able to hire. And we've -- I think when you look at salespeople and they think about where they're going to come and can we hire them, they look at where are you going to have the most prospects going forward. And the differentiated value that we have with our global platform -- and I would tell you that we're really kind of pulling away from the competition. There's probably 2 of us out there. So, if you're in the data center business or if you're in the internet -- networking business and you want to be successful as a salesperson, this is a great place to be, right? Team's making more money. We're being successful. And I think they look forward in that kind of standpoint. Sorry, I didn't understand the rest of the question but that's about where we are on it and really happy with it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Guarino with Green Street.
David Guarino: Bill, maybe going back to that comment you made earlier, it was really helpful on Nova going up 6% on the rental rate. Did you clarify if that was on renewal or new leases? And assuming it is on new leasing, I just wanted to talk on that healthy pricing environment. Do you think it's just a temporary boost for the sector given we've got this lack of leasable capacity? Or would you say we've truly turned a corner and rental rates are going to start trending higher from here on out?
Andy Power: David, maybe help just clarify numbers. That was not a cash mark-to-market. That was the like-for-like new rates. So showing progress in the overall market rates and trying to do it as best we could as apples-to-apples in terms of size of deal, all the nuances that go into the deal. I was little -- just down in the market a week ago. And that market is overall experience incredibly robust and continuous demand. And we've done quite well, I can tell you, more than our fair share in that market not just in the last quarter but over several quarters. And that, combined with just overall constraints on bringing on capacity in that market, running up on ability to get power, permitting and the like, I think it's all going to continue to trend in a more positive territory or in terms of healthier rates in that market. If you look at our just one last data point on that, our operating portfolio in that market is, call it, 91 something in the sub but that's missing some leases that have signed but not commenced. If you include that, we're like 94% leased on the operating portfolio. And then I think I have 16 out of 86 megawatts left in terms of -- that's not leased that's under construction. We're basically down to, I think, 1 or 2 more buildings in the legacy 3 digital DFT and lab campus and are already moving on to our, call it, Western lands or digital Dulles location for our next layer of growth.
David Guarino: That's helpful. And I guess the kind of the gist of the question really is we've had these periods historically in the sector where demand goes lumpy for certain periods. And just kind of curious, if that happens again, if we kind of don't repeat this record new levels of industry-wide leasing activity, do you think we resume to downward pressure on asking rents, I guess? I just want to get your perspective on if this is a temporary phenomenon we're seeing this quarter and last quarter?
Andy Power: It feels to me like the lumpiness has subsided. I mean you looked at our quarterly leasing stats for several quarters. It's just been more diverse and more consistent. And based on the last few quarters of demand kind of combined with the broader supply backdrop dynamic, it doesn't feel like there's a -- I feels like the rates are going to be nowhere near peak rates yet. So we got a long way to run back to peak rates but still, I think marching in a more positive trajectory for some time to come.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Alex [ph] on for Dave. Andy, maybe just my first one here. I think last quarter, you noted the Teraco acquisition was going to give around a partial year contribution of $100 million in revenues and $70 million in EBITDA. Just wanted to double-check to see if there are any updates there and just confirm that that's already baked in the guidance? And then secondly, I know we've kind of touched on global M&A before but just kind of thinking about the state of the market and any specific geographies of interest.
Andy Power: On the Teraco, I don't think there's any updates. We're still in the same vicinity of closing time period and there's been no change to our underwriting numbers since we announced. I don't -- let us follow up online to triple-check confirm those numbers with you with your model just to make sure because I don't recall what I exactly said a call ago on those numbers in terms of a partial calendar year contribution. And then your second question, Alex, was that about leasing or M&A? I just want to make sure -- you said the geos. I just want to make sure...
Unidentified Analyst: M&A.
Greg Wright: Yes. Alex, it's Greg. Look, I think you asked what the state of the M&A, global M&A market is. And like, I would say, it remains robust right now. There's a lot of private capital chasing deals. We've read about them. You see deals still occurring. As I mentioned earlier, multiples are -- have been sticky high on these transactions. But with that said, there is a lot of private capital and I think you're starting to see these private investors, the infrastructure funds and the like and others starting to see the quality of the asset class, whether it's the credit readiness of the customer, the quality of the assets and the growth prospects of the business. It really feels like it's starting to become more of a core investment asset class relative to some others. There's actually been somewhat of a shift there. In terms of our strategy, our strategy, I would say, this quarter is probably best representative of how we're looking at it and where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. You heard Andy and Corey talked about supply proofing but we went into 2 new markets through land purchases, 1 in Chennai, 1 in Barcelona this quarter. And then we backfilled the supply proof markets in Zurich, in Paris, in Frankfurt and in Dublin. And if you look at all that together, you're talking about 385 megawatts of total developable capacity. So when we look at that and look at it on a risk-adjusted basis, we think that's the right place for us. But in terms of geographies, I mean, look, we're still looking to selectively backfill in certain areas of Eastern Europe. As we've said previously, we are still working to expand our footprint in APAC and selectively backfill in the Americas. So that's basically how we're thinking about it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets.
Aryeh Klein: Just going back to the same-store NOI growth, it was down 3% in the quarter end. It sounds like the trends are supportive of improvement. But the full year guidance suggests that it kind of remains in this down 3% range for the remainder of the year. Is that just FX? Or is there something else at play?
Andy Power: Well, obviously the FX has gone against our favor for the year but we've had some success in the first quarter relative to our budget a little bit on the OpEx side but we are absorbing a customer -- a bankruptcy which is going to be in your headwind to that. Hence, we're holding our guidance for same-store cash NOI for the year.
Aryeh Klein: Got it. And maybe I missed it but the bankruptcy, is that in the FFO outlook? And what's the impact from that, if it is?
Andy Power: Bankruptcy, aside from a, call it, noncore straight-line right add back that's not in core FFO, we basically already absorbed about almost $4 million of a hit for the first quarter due to, call it, pre-petition receivables which I mentioned earlier on the call. And then, we've made an assumption as to additional, call it, $6 million of headwind for the remainder of the year because quite honestly, we're kind of just handicapping the outcome of events because the customer is obviously going to go through the court process and either accept or reject leases. The last time this go around, I think almost all of the leases were accepted. I'm not sure or that will be the case this go around. And then there's the scenarios as to if a lease is rejected and their end customers could be essentially absorbed by Digital Realty. So $6 million of incremental and on top of the $4 million, taken in the first quarter is our essentially hit or adjustment due to the bankruptcy for the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI.
Irvin Liu: Just one for me. Maybe Andy can answer this. I wanted to ask about the FX spot rate movement. You mentioned that bonds denominated in local currencies act as a natural profit hedge. And we do see this reflected on Slide 11. There's a 3-point revenue headwind but only a 2.3-point FFO headwind. Historically, is there any way to think about how well local currency denominated bonds offset some of these FX headwinds for FFO? And would you consider any durative instruments looking ahead to help you smooth out some of these headwinds?
Andy Power: Sure. Thanks, Irvin. So I mean -- and I'm sorry to play the record again because I wanted to touch on this and I think I hit it on one of the QA. If you look historically, the last 3 years, our business has been roughly 40% international. And prior to this year, the headwinds or tailwinds, because it doesn't always go against you or, call it, in the 50 to 75 basis points, call it, vicinity with much less volatility than we're seeing this year. Essentially, with these not -- by issuing non-U.S. dollar financings be it euro or Swiss francs or sterlings or our multicurrency revolver are going to natural lending sources, often the long durations and essentially creating asset liabilities through the bonds but also cash flow liabilities to offset the euros we received from revenue or the pounds we received from revenue. Given we invested development returns of 9 to 12 or so percent and the rates are so modest right now, there's a leakage. We've been migrating more and more of our debt to be non-U.S. dollars. I think 75% of it is non-U.S. dollars today because 100% of our equity is U.S. dollars and 100% of our common dividends are in U.S. dollars. So we have that natural match for our U.S. dollar hedge. I've always been a big fan of this approach because it allows to, call it, have multiple benefits to the strategy of tapping diverse capital sources at attractive rates and create a natural FX hedge. It obviously does not provide 100% P&L volatility elimination. We are continuing to become more international. We are continuing to, in smaller amounts, going to a slightly more volatile markets in terms of currencies, be it Latin America or Africa. So I would say we're not -- our ears are always open to good ideas and we'll continue to evolve our thinking if a time comes to look at incremental types of foreign currency derivatives to further eliminate any P&L volatility from the FX.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We posted our second straight record bookings quarter with $167 million of annualized rent while attracting 128 new logos. Our sales momentum is exceedingly strong and the benefits of Platform Digital continue to grow. Digital Realty's operational excellence is second to none and customers are relying on us to solve their needs for data center solutions today while providing a clear path for their expanded needs tomorrow. Our customers trust us with their mission-critical application and digital delivers. We're continuing to extend our global platform. In early January, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco to establish Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Africa by positioning ourselves at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing locations. We are also expanding organically with over 300 megawatts of new capacity under development. We posted strong core FFO per share results exceeding consensus estimates despite foreign exchange and other headwinds against us. We maintained our core FFO per share guidance for the year and our constant currency core FFO per share forecast represents more than 7% year-over-year growth. Last but not least, we remain very adept at sourcing attractive capital, raising over $1 billion of European debt at a blended 1.3% coupon and weighted average term of 9 years while redeeming higher cost U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter. I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning. I hope you all are safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you again in NAREIT and other in-person events. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-17 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up and we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Huseby, Digital Realty’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jim Huseby: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty’s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and they will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today’s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, please see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I’d like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to one megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year. We also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider. Financially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year. And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers. As a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience. And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-one megawatt and greater than one megawatt categories. We also announced two significant global initiatives. First, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a standalone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Digital Realty contributed a 90% interest in a portfolio of 10 core data centers concentrated in top-tier markets across the U.S. and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate. We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT. The offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake. In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty. First, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner. It has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers. Second, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience. Digital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty. We will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development. From a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT. Third, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty. We expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity. Finally, our interests are aligned. As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle. Digital Core REIT is led by two long-time Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with Dan Tith. We are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty. Our second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter-end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa’s leading carrier-neutral colocation provider. This acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria. Teraco complements these investments as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa. From Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent. Teraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables. Teraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA. In addition, more than half of Teraco’s in-service portfolio was developed within the past two years. The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%. And Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers’ growth. Leading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion. Teraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years. Let’s discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit’s Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company’s five-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector. Digital Realty was also named one of America’s most responsible companies by Newsweek and was the number one ranked data center company. We continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders. Let’s turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform. In addition to the Teraco transaction, we’ve grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with two land purchases in Lagos for future development. Over the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa’s rapidly growing Internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth. We also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform. We spent $580 million on growth CapEx in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth CapEx investment to date. We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world. This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end. Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong. In January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country. This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside of the city center. The two facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive colocation customers to huge hyperscale deployments. In North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix as well as geographically with projects underway in seven different markets. We continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States. We are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position. Let’s turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We’re fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platform digital. Our customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. We are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. Industry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies. Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies. These forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed. Our market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure. In addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Digital Realty was recently named Company of the Year by Frost & Sullivan for North American Data Center Best Practices. This award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map. We are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let’s turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter. Volume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business. For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60/40 split between greater than one megawatt and less than one megawatt plus interconnection. The EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types. The fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions. Nearly 30% of our sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform. Not surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC. Both EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region. The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA. We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter’s record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos. We are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements. The initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities. A leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side. A Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros. A leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across four new markets. A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros. An Ivy League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the health care provider community for data exchange. And finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth – record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly four years. Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative re-leasing spreads on greater than one megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-one megawatt renewals. In terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense. As a reminder, the 2021 same-store pool did not include the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece or Altus IT in Croatia. Each of these businesses will be included in the same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and each is expected to contribute to improving same-store growth going forward, partially offset by higher property taxes as well as FX headwinds expected in 2022. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to the currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed with a well-diversified menu of public and private capital sources available to fund the growth of our business. In terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months. For the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year-over-year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December. As a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco as well as 100 basis points to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021. We expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion. Given the tightened supply environment, we expect flat cash renewal rates in 2022, up from slightly negative in 2021. And we expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite the significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year in addition to the embedded lease-up potential within the Teraco portfolio. We are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful €750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1 3/8% [ph] coupon. Finally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let’s turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. As of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times. Pro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7 times, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7 times. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. As Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years and tightening pricing by five basis points. We also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%. A little over three quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we’ll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Thanks. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about supply chain. Last call, you talked about kind of on time and on budget in terms of delivery of turnkey inventory. Any update on that? And did that play a role in the slightly more elongated commencement timeframe associated with your leasing of 14 months compared to what you’ve done in the past?
Bill Stein: Thanks, John. We are seeing some effects on the supply chain. Clearly, most of the equipment is strained in terms of availability, including data center infrastructure, servers and network gear, and shortages in things like chips and fans are impacting many industries, not just ours. Our VMI program, the vendor-managed inventory program, utilizes our knowledge and market way to overcome some of these disruptions. I believe that we’re the gold standard for managing vendors and for forecasting. And this gives us priority for production slots with our suppliers. This program has allowed us to reduce lead times by an average of 70% versus standard. Increased – we increased the VMI pool when COVID hit. So, I think we’re pretty well prepared for the current disruptions. And we’re evaluating the program to expand it even further to better support our programs. Steel, aluminum and copper is also rising, which affects some fit-out by cages and cabinets. This is only – this really only comes into play though, for projects that are scheduled for completion in the next six to 12 months. And in those cases, we’re working closely with our customers to order gear early to lock in the pricing and avoid any shipment delays. Let me hand it over to Andy to address the relationship to delay in construction and anything else that he might want to add.
Andy Power: Sure. I think Bill covered it. But just on the – John, the elongated book-to-bill or time line, which had nothing really do with supply chain. Two factors there: one, you can see in the Americas region, we did a powered base shell deal, obviously, a longer lead time to develop that and bring that online; and then in Europe, where we have the concentration of our large deals obviously, stand out quarter for EMEA across the board. Some of the plus megawatt deals were rather large in size and takedowns. And I think there’s a project or two where we’re literally at land state and the customers are looking to really just book that future runway to growth. So that was kind of what drugged the overall time line out for sign to commence.
Jon Atkin: And then maybe more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe comment on the willingness to flex for – your CapEx budget to a higher level, you accelerated compared to last year. But given all the demand that’s out there and all the aggressive investment by some of your peers in order to maintain your share, what is your thought about flexing the CapEx budget higher? And any kind of updated thoughts on financing mix as to how you might do that? It seems like that would really affect 2022 CapEx. But further out, any kind of broad thoughts on that would be appreciated.
Andy Power: Sure. So, we finished 2021 at south of $2.2 billion of development CapEx or so. Our guidance range is a step-up of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of CapEx. You can just look at our press release throughout the year. We’ve been opening new markets, expanding addressable market, building out the pipeline from land to shells to finish suites to colo and connectivity inventory. I don’t think we’re looking to change our posture. We really go market-by-market supply chain – or excuse me, market-by-market supply-demand view. And we think we’re positioning ahead of our competitors. And I don’t think there’s a really necessary reactionary flex needed into our business. But if the opportunity presents itself, we look at that, and we’ll make those investments. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’ve got a diverse menu of capital sources to fuel our growth.
Jon Atkin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. I was curious, first, if you can unpack the guidance for the same capital cash NOI growth of down 2.5% to 3.5%. Maybe some of the puts and takes in there and how that might play out over the course of the year? I can share the follow-up after this one.
Andy Power: Sure. Thanks, Michael. So just a quick backdrop on same capital. So last year, we guided slightly negative on same capital or – and we came in at 4.4% same-capital cash NOI is negative. This was slightly worse than the year prior. As I mentioned, that was a real subset of the pool that we reported in 2021. You flip to 2022, you call it almost 80% of our company is in that pool with the addition of the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT in Croatia. So you get a much larger sample set and an improving complexion. So from negative 4.4%, we guided to, call it, negative 3% at the midpoint. It’s really being impacted by two elements: one, currency. We hedge to the balance sheet. So all the currency fluctuations are hitting that pool, if you call – look at that on a constant currency, you’re probably closer to negative 1%. And then if you peel back the onion on that, it’s really strong positives – several – like 3% or so in that APAC, close to flat in EMEA due to the utilities being elevated and then the negative contribution largely focused in the Americas region, where we are getting hit by what looks like it would be a property tax increase that’s going to hit us in that year – or excuse me, in 2022, but not continue in 2023 and beyond. And the major driver of still not being more firmly into positive, although improving really is downtime for releasing of some of the larger non-retentions. We’ve been working away at that and making good activity. Actually re-leasing it and then moving those customers into that space. It just takes time, not because of supply chain politics, more of that one 5-megawatt customer leads and a new 5-megawatt customer refills the refurbs, the new PDUs, et cetera, it just takes time. And for those chunky deals, you lose a month or two or rent in a year, that’s just – it won’t flow through until you get into 2023. So net-net, not in positive territory firmly on a reported basis yet, but heading that way.
Michael Rollins: And just to follow up on some comments that you and the team have provided earlier on just pricing. Can you give us an update on the pricing strategy, the opportunities to leverage price, whether it’s because of the inflationary backdrop or some of the other macro factors that you’re dealing with? And then how that would affect the financial performance over time?
Andy Power: Sure. So I mean, pricing from two lenses. Obviously, you saw in the guidance, the – we’re guiding towards flat releasing spreads on our renewals for 2020. So that’s not new news. We’ve been mentioning that we’ve been working our way into that positive territory partly due to mix of expirations, but certainly, I would say, pricing related and then also, call it, pricing on new deals. Holistically, I think our supply chain team has done a really and design [indiscernible] team done a really good job insulating us given our scale, our consistency in market. I don’t think that’s industry-wide. And if you’re a newer, smaller, more fledgling or regional competitor that’s creating disruptions from an inflation standpoint and there’s just overall strains on delivery of capacity, whether it’s moratoriums in certain countries or the ability to deliver power. All of these elements, I’d say, add up together to, I think, be an incremental benefit to our value proposition to our customer of having this incumbent platform of 26 countries, 50 metros with one way for growth that the pricing pendulum feels like it’s continuing to slowly swing more and more in our favor.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk about the strength you had in the less than one megawatt category. Maybe you could break down where you’re seeing the most success, whether it’s traditional enterprise, smaller hyperscale edge nodes? And do you think that study improvement you’ve had is sustainable going forward? And then my second question was on the asset disposition front. Andy, I think in the past, you said you don’t have a lot left to do on noncore. So should we assume that on a heavier weighting towards SREIT contributions throughout the course of the year? And related to that, where do you think your leverage slightly north of six times, should we expect it to remain elevated? Or are you looking to drive that down with the Teraco financing and potentially other asset sales? Thanks.
Andy Power: Well, I’ll have Corey start us off on the enterprise less-than-megawatt interconnection category. And then I can filling any factoids and talked about source and uses on your second question.
Corey Dyer: Yes. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I’ll tell you that we’re really happy and feel good about the healthy demand that we’re getting out of the sub-1 megawatt smart space. It seem to be consistent about kind of where we’re growing that and how it’s been building. We mentioned the enterprise demand and just where it’s coming across. It’s coming across from a lot of our customers trying to take advantage of hybrid IT environments. And so we’re seeing that come across the board. Across the globe, we have really strong demand in pipeline. And the nice thing about it is it’s coming from an enterprise perspective from us, two thirds of that pipeline is coming through as enterprise. And we’re also getting good channel progress from it. So from a sub-1 megawatt perspective, is it sustainable? Is it something that we’re going to continue. I think you’re going to see it continue. And we’re happy with where we’re seeing that demand across all regions and coming through the channel specifically and then also enterprises. So, we’re happy about where that is, and I think it’s going to continue.
Andy Power: Just to add a couple of more reasonable tidbits, Eric. So EMEA was an absolute standout for the less than a megawatt, as you saw in the numbers. Frankfurt, London, Paris, Amsterdam Marseille, big contributors. Over half of our new logos actually came out of that region. In the Americas, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were the top markets and Singapore is obviously the standout in APAC. And do you – Eric, do you mind just repeating the second part of your question about the source use? I know I heard the first part about it is noncore versus contribution actually. What was the second part of your question?
Eric Luebchow: And just how we should think about your leverage throughout the year? You’re a little above six times. I know you have the equity forward, you have the Teraco financing. Just how we should think about the cadence of leverage this year? That would be helpful. Thanks.
Andy Power: Sure. As so you see in the guidance table, we put about $0.5 billion to $1 billion of, call it, capital recycling, which would be both of these categories. We ended the year with really a 60 – a one-off asset for $60 million that will be likely redeveloped into a residential project in San Jose. And there are, call it, a short list of whittling down of incremental noncore dispositions that could happen during the year it would be a piece of that. And then I think looking for incremental contributions to digital core REIT would probably be the larger segment of that source of capital. That’s obviously been a great success. John Stewart, after 32 earnings calls, hung up the HP 12C, now looking to grow that vehicle. In terms of funding for the year, – we finished out the year with about almost $1 billion of proceeds if you include that one-off asset plus digital core REIT in December. That all put the back on 12/31 with $140-ish million of cash, $40 million of – excuse me, $400 million drawn on a $3.3 billion credit facility. We got lucky and beat the rate march with a $850 million euro bond beginning of the year. That’s probably an incremental $500 million proceeds. We still have the $1 billion undrawn forward that will take down. So those combinations of forces and uses will essentially fund the closing of the $1.7 billion purchase of Teraco. And then obviously, those incremental noncore dispose or incremental contributions in the back half of the year will be the, call it, the replenishing of the capital stack, and we’ll look to leverage to, call it, say, to move more in line to our targeted leverage levels below six times for sure, as we move through the year.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good evening. Andy, I just wanted to continue on the Digital Core REIT. How should we think about what to expect there for 2022? Is this going to be something where it will potentially do more deals with you? And how are those? Is it really North America focused today and in the near term? Or could we see assets from Europe or elsewhere go in there? And you mentioned the stock price appreciation. Is there any magic is 35% of magic number in terms of your stake? Or could you get – use that as a source of funding as well to take your stake down in the critical. Thanks.
Andy Power: Yes. So the – this was essentially an evolution of our capital sources here. Date back to probably the origins when Bill created a prudential JV that just actually ran its course, and we recognized a promote in the fall. Perpetual externally managed public vehicle with a global mandate, although albeit originally a North America portfolio. So over time, I would expect it to – through contributions of assets from Digital Realty, and they can also – and can also acquire third-party assets, diversify its portfolio geographically. But really with core assets, data centers that Digital Realty believes in for the long run, that have really long-term weighted average lease terms, high occupancies core to our strategy. We don’t have a set exact dollar amount or time of 2022, where we’re looking to do a contribution, we’ll work collaboratively with John and his team to position that at the right time for Digital Core REIT and its shareholders and Digital Realty’s funding plans. But I would think it will diversify over time and continue to scale, and it’s been well received to date. And I think that we’ll be able to build upon that success.
Simon Flannery: And your 35% stake?
Andy Power: I’m sorry, that – there’s no magic to that. That was really just a product of the size of the initial portfolio, the conservative leverage we’ve put on the vehicle day one in a modest IPO size. We – the underwriters’ lockup tactically expires in the next several months. So not – it’s right around the corner. We have no interest to sell down. We can sell down if we want to. More likely, over time, I could see us being diluted down as digital quarry buys for cash, more assets and Digital Realty makes room for incremental investors both institutional and retail to participate in the growth of the vehicle.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Eric Rasmussen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. New logos were quite strong. I think you highlighted in your record in the quarter. Maybe just talk about what’s behind the success there? And then maybe do you see that momentum sustaining into the New Year?
Corey Dyer: Yes. So, what was our second – so first of all, thanks for the question and also thanks for just the acknowledgment of the success we’re having around new logos. Second highest quarter in new logos yet our highest year in new logos at $480 million. It’s really with customers coming to a hybrid IT and a data-centric kind of mindset around what they’re going to do, that’s what we’re seeing come through on the new logos. We’ve got a lot of customers now picking us consistently in making those decisions on it. Where we’ve seen kind of an outside growth from the new logos is around our channel. We went from channel sales of 15% up to – I’m sorry, from 10% in 2020 to 15% in 2021. But the new logos we’re getting are close to 20% to 25% on a quarterly basis from the channel. So when you ask where it’s coming from, it’s coming across the whole globe. You also think through our exports. We mentioned that 30% of our export business – or 30% of our business is growing export, meaning across regions and landing in EMEA at 60%. So really good progress, across the globe on new logos supported by strong success with the channel. And I think we’re going to see that continue as well. So thanks for the question, Eric.
Eric Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just – my follow-up, obviously, hyperscale was strong. But maybe talk about the types of hyperscalers you’re seeing – is there a shift in the customer makeup? And what’s driving that demand?
Andy Power: So, I would maybe go region by region real quickly. I just saw there wasn’t a lot of activity in APAC this particular quarter, but we had a great 2021 overall in that region across all product types, but certainly including hyperscale and we’re seeing significant demand continue. And really excited with the introduction of Seoul 1, which we just opened up as well as significant activity across the Japanese market. In EMEA, we had four of the five top CSPs, all signed new business with us during the quarter. A lot of activity in Frankfurt, both in the East with the legacy interaction campus in the West with the legacy digital campus, Zurich, Marseille, Madrid and Paris were also contributors as well as Amsterdam. In North America, in the – I would say, the social media category has been a contributor and Ashburn was probably the standout for the quarter where we’ve remained incredibly tight during the recovering market and continue to see strong demand.
Operator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Two, if I could, please. One was, Andy, you talked about co-investment with the Singapore Core REIT. And I’m wondering now, given -- I think we’re looking at about a 3.7% cap rate implied on the market cap now. whether this – how this affects how you guys think about mergers and acquisitions, and we’ve seen a lot of partnership models emerge across all sorts of digital infrastructure asset classes. I’d be interested in kind of hearing a little bit more about what you meant by that. And then Bill, look, I’m a long-time listener, first-time caller. It’s not gone unnoticed that John is taking over as CEO of Singapore Core REIT. Andy has become President, you’ve moved to Austin. I mean, we’re all big fans of what you’ve done, what are we – should we be expecting something? And I’d love to hear your thoughts on the succession right now. Thank you.
Greg Wright: David, it’s Greg Wright. Let me take the first question. Your question with respect to the SREIT and how we think about it in terms of our M&A strategy. I mean, look, I think when you look at the mandate that John and his team have for that vehicle, it’s clearly – it’s a yield-driven vehicle. And obviously, we assess that cost of capital for that vehicle like we do Digital Realty stand-alone. And those assets that are going to go into that, they’re not going to be development, they’re going to be stabilized. You’ve heard John’s pitch in terms of the types of assets they’re looking for that to put it into that vehicle. Well, if we do future M&A or anything like that, and there happens to be those kinds of assets, they will be a natural home for that. Now we obviously have a partner, how to pursue those transactions simultaneously and be able to bifurcate the assets and to get the best cost of capital. So that’s how we think about it from an M&A standpoint. But in terms of cost of capital, we still go back, we do our underwrites we’re going to go out and do DCFs and take a look at the projections and take a look at the risk of the asset and we’re going to price it accordingly. And obviously, having a vehicle that’s got a better cost of capital is helpful. But that’s generally the approach we’ll use for M&A.
Andy Power: The only thing I would add to that question, John – David was – listen, Singapore is opening up its moratorium in a very rational and prudent way. Now with the development of, call it, three new data center locations. I can’t think of a better partner to be one of the three given our experience in this business, 4,000 global customers. Leadership and sustainability, experience in region. And last but not least, having a partner Digital Core REIT listed on the Singapore Exchange that could be an eventual owner of that asset allow all the citizens of Singapore to participate in the digital transformation of that country in the region. So that’s a unique incremental attribute, that could play in the future.
Bill Stein: Relative to the move to Austin, I am not the only person who has moved to Austin. We moved the corporate headquarters to Austin. January of last year. And I’m surrounded by people who have also moved to Austin. On my right is my Chief of Staff, Bill Bradley, on my left is my Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright. I’m looking down the table here at our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Sanchak. So we have quite a few people who have moved. Andy Power is planning to move at the end of the year. So this is the corporate headquarters. We made a conscious decision to leave California for a number of reasons. I think we’ve articulated that. We’re going to be moving our staffs out of California and New York. We’ve announced that. We have downsized in California, our offices there. We moved from [indiscernible] center up the block to space it on California Street, and we’re going to be downsizing in New York as well. So there’s nothing about this move to Austin that is related to succession. Relative to the movement of Andy into the President’s log, I think that’s your question. Our – my goal and the goal of the Board is to try to give our top-performing executives as much experience and different experience as we possibly can. So this gives Andy an opportunity to spend time in operations as well as working with Chris Sharp on the networking side, the product development side, the innovation side. We have a number of very capable executives that work for this company that report to me. And I think many of them are potential candidates to succeed me. My obligation to the Board is to make sure that they have choices. And I’m trying to provide for that. And so when the time is right for me to move into retirement, I’d like our Board to be able to look at a number of potential candidates inside the company and potentially consider at candidates outside the company as well. But I have no plans to step down at any point in the near future. I like what I do. And I think we’re pretty good at it.
Operator: The next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe this one is for Chris. With your growing pool of colo assets, do you have any interest in creating an internal software-defined network? And if so, what would that entail? And what competitive advantages would that provide to you?
Chris Sharp: Yes. Thanks, Brendan. I appreciate the question. Absolutely, right? That’s what the customers are looking for. And I just want to go back a little bit on what Eric had asked Corey on what’s driving that sub-1 megawatt. It’s a sweet spot where customers are starting to outgrow colo. So it’s very beneficial to our asset class to be able to support that growing need and allow them to land and expand even beyond the one megawatt and start to go to more market. But that all requires an SDN, just a software-defined networking, for the broader group, that capability to tie it all together. And so one of the things you’re going to hear about later in the year is, we are absolutely bringing to market one of two platforms in the world that is purpose built for orchestrating at a higher level, that type of capability on our customer behalf, right? And I’ll just impress upon everybody, it’s not improving on a 10-year-old product. It’s definitely purpose-built. And at the core of that is enhancing our customer experience where we’re removing that technical complexity that a lot of customers are impacted by around interconnection and making it easier for them to procure and deploy in all of these locations. And that’s why that new logo growth is starting to grow at record numbers, and you’ll see that continually feed off of itself because they’re getting a big benefit out of the community of interest that’s being created around the globe. But again, at the end of the day, it’s about open access and unfettered customer experience, which allows all of our customers to access the right partners throughout the globe. And this fabric, again, will facilitate the easiest route to all destinations.
Brendan Lynch: Great. And maybe you could give a little color on the type of investment that, that will take?
Chris Sharp: Yes, absolutely, Brendan. And we had referenced a while back. We had acquired a smaller firm that was some of the leading software developers out in the market. And it’s something that Andy and I constantly talk about on the right amount of capital. And so we have a dedicated software team that is purpose built in delivering that capability. And so I wouldn’t say it’s material as of yet, and we’re not disclosing the details around the investment, but the impact that we get with having that team dedicated to building not only an SDN capability, but that broader orchestration is absolutely going to be beneficial, and we already have some great conversations with beta customers that are driving the direction of what those feature functionalities are going to be.
Andy Power: And Brendan, I can confirm that the cost CapEx otherwise is included and not material to the guidance we have on the sub today.
Operator: The next question will come from Matt Nickman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Nickman: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me and I’ll keep this brief. Maybe two for Andy. First off, does the 2022 guide, can you quantify what’s embedded in there from Tareco, just thinking about revenue, EBITDA and core FFO? And then secondly, maybe detailing on that. Typically, you’ll give some directional color on how to think about forward quarter core FFO. I’m just wondering if there are any puts and takes for 1Q core FFO per share that you would flag to be mindful off? Thanks.
Andy Power: Sure. So just working backwards. So – we didn’t – I don’t think we have like our famous bar charts without numbers on them for you in terms of the weighted distribution. We do have a pretty decent moving part here with the timing of Teraco, which I can’t remember Greg mentioned this yet, but I mean we’re working through the closing conditions and really the process for, call it, competition community review. But feels like it’s going to happen in call it the early – very early second quarter to a couple of months in the second quarter time frame. So that does put a little bit of puts and takes from a quarterly blend. It is just to confirm the dilution from Teraco is included in our guidance table in the sub. So at the bottom line, our midpoint is call it growing, call it, 5% which is about 100 basis points increase from our guidance a year ago, which we did beat by 140 bps. We also are absorbing call it, 100 to 200 basis points of FX headwinds. And so if you normalize for those items, you call it close to the 6.5%, call it core FFO per share growth. The components of Teraco, I would call it, ballpark for a rough swag, a partial year contribution to revenue and an EBITDA basis, call it, $100-ish of revenue and 70-ish of EBITDA contribution of rough swags. Just a reminder, a data point, our year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth is deflated when you just look at our reported financials. Remember that we had a PPA in a settlement NH promote in 2021. So that plus – really that plus FX calls it has – what you call it, and 9.3% growth on a revenue basis on a constant currency basis. And then as a reminder, we’re also losing revenue from our contribution to the Singapore REIT, Digital Core REIT. So that puts you up another 100 or 150 basis points higher on the revenue standpoint from a constant currency basis.
Matt Nickman: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I’d now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you. I’d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2021, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We booked over $0.5 billion of new business in 2021, a 15% increase over the prior year. While attracting nearly 500 new logos. Digital Realty’s operational excellence is second to none, whether it be uninterrupted performance during a record Texas ice storm or on-time delivery of new capacity despite a global pandemic and the resulting strain on global supply chains. Our customers trust us with mission-critical applications and digital delivers. We’re expanding our global platform, establishing Digital Realty as the unquestioned leading colocation interconnection provider in Africa and positioning PlatformDIGITAL at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing stations. We announced our expansion into India, together with our partner, Brookfield, and we invested in Atlas Edge gaining exposure to the European edge market all while investing over $2 billion in organic development around the world. We posted solid financial results and core FFO revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our initial guidance. Our 2022 guidance represents mid-single-digit growth in core FFO per share despite absorbing headwinds from FX, Teraco and capital recycling. Constant currency guidance for CFFO, if we were to exclude Teraco, would be in high single digits. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1 billion of proceeds from asset sales all the while positioning ourselves as the leading global provider of the full spectrum of data center solutions. I’d like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. 
John Stewart: Thank you, operator. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. 
 Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. 
 Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers, landing record new logos and delivering our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 million of bookings. We also continued to deliver for our customers around the world despite volatility in the global supply chain, leveraging our scale, diversification and strategic procurement processes to continue to deliver on time and on budget for our customers. 
 We continue to enhance our global platform by expanding into new markets with tremendous growth potential while continuing to expand capacity in existing markets around the world. We delivered solid financial results, with double-digit revenue growth leading to a beat in the current quarter and a raise to the outlook for the balance of the year. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately $600 million of low-coupon Swiss green bonds and over $1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. 
A. William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. We continue to globalize our business with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique full-spectrum global product offering. 
 We also announced our entry into 2 high-potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. 
 Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted 5-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. We also became a UN Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. 
 We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in 4 countries across 3 continents certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. 
 While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices, but given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. 
 Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market with the fifth largest GDP in the world. Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. 
 During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility positioned to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. As the African Internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity, given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy as well as a maturing regulatory environment. Given the connectivity of Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. 
 We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. 
 We're being a bit more selective in North America. We're seeing strong demand in Portland where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York and Toronto. 
 Finally, in Asia Pacific, we continue to pursue strong organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. 
 Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. 
 Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to IDC, the amount of digital data created over the next 5 years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. 
 We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL road map for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. 
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of $113 million, this time with a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Deal mix was consistent with the prior 4-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. 
 The weighted average lease term was a little over 5.5 years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in 4 markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance and driving down cost. 
 A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnered with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and re-architect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. A public university in the eastern U.S. is launching a global research initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across 2 continents and 3 cities to help enable this project. 
 A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance and sustainability. And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. 
 Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $303 million to $330 million, and third quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over 7 months. 
 Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest-ever renewal quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over 3.5 years. Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the quarter that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon-to-be-vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. Excluding this 1 transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. 
 This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. 
 In terms of first quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully-leased assets during the quarter. Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion lease I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. 
 Of the 70 megawatts we've got back on January 1, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool, so these same-capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store NOI growth goes for 2022. 
 Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. 
 In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. 
 In terms of earnings growth, third quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum so we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. 
 Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over $100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona. We also raised approximately $95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as $950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering. Our reported leverage ratio remains at 6x, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6x, while our fixed charge coverage improves to 6x. 
 We continued to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Our 2 capital markets transactions this quarter are examples of our prudent approach to balance sheet management. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
 As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
 Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. 
Jonathan Atkin: I think I'll ask both of mine upfront. I wondered, first of all, if you could talk about the factors that are affecting your CapEx to develop incremental capacity. John Stewart, I guess, in the prepared remarks talked about on time and on budget. But going forward, given what's happening with materials costs, I wondered whether you see an opportunity to adjust your pricing on new leases accordingly. 
 And then the second question is just earlier this month, you acknowledged that you're exploring the potential creation of a Singapore REIT, and I wonder if you can just provide an update on that around the timing and scale and rationale on that project. 
A. William Stein: Thanks, Jon. I'll take your first question and I'll hand it over to Andy to adjust the -- to answer the Singapore REIT. First of all, I think you're right about inflation in terms of the opportunity that it presents. I think there's no doubt that it disproportionately, adversely affects our smaller competitors and widens our competitive moat. Over time, I would expect that rental rate increases will disproportionately accrue to the larger incumbent providers. 
 There are basically 2 pieces to the inflation issue: the first is development, the second is operations. On the development side, we are -- our pipeline is on time and it's on budget, and they're kudos to Erich Sanchack, who leads our operations and procurement team for the vendor management programs that he's put in place, providing us fixed pricing for several years out, for diversifying our vendor mix and for allowing our -- for locking in our general contractors. We have a lot of construction sites around the world, and we're able to move our GCs around and keep them fully occupied. 
 And I think our global scale as well as our maturity as a builder gives us a substantial competitive advantage here. But again, I don't think there's any doubt that market rents will eventually need to move up to maintain risk-adjusted returns. And I think that, that's both because of the increase in construction costs that show up in the denominator. But I think for our private competitors who are operating with more leverage, I think you're going to see that show up in the higher interest rates. So to -- I think they're going to have to raise their costs for that reason as well. 
 And I think the readthrough here is actually really positive for our renewals because as our rates on new product increase, our rates will also, I expect, increase for renewals. So the bottom line there is that modest inflation, we think, is quite healthy for the business. And in terms of our customers, this shouldn't come as a surprise to them because to the extent that they're doing it themselves, they're seeing this development in their own supply chains. 
 Relative to the operations of the P&L, I think as you probably know, our leases provide for significant pass-throughs. So for example, over 90% of our utility costs this last quarter were passed through to customers. We also have rent bumps generally between 2% and 3%. And then we have, I think, the highest operating -- or the best operating leverage of highest margins in the business. So what that means is that labor or labor costs, which I think is what's most susceptible to inflationary pressure, is a relatively low percentage of the revenue component in the income statement. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Andy to talk about the Singapore REIT. 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Bill. So Jon, you picked up obviously in the 8-K we put out there a few weeks ago. We are kind of heading down the path of exploring essentially an IPO of a portfolio on the Singapore market. This is not our APAC business, which has significant amounts of capacity under construction and land and the like. This is essentially being more analogous to almost like a private capital partner to Digital Realty for stabilized, fully well-leased, high-quality core long-term hold data centers to Digital and our strategy. 
 Somewhat analogous to one of our joint ventures that we've done in the past couple of years with that one of which was with a Singapore REIT. We're still working through this. It's a long IPO process. There's no certainty on the outcome or completion. Sizing would be obviously a modest IPO size to begin with. But we do think this option has the merits of being an attractive long-term partner vehicle to Digital Realty. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jordan Sadler: So first, I wanted to follow up, Bill, on sort of the price increase opportunity. I'm interested specifically in the greater 1 megawatt rents achieved in the Americas this quarter. They seem quite the opposite. I wonder at $80 per kW, it seemed like a low point relative to recent prints. I'm wondering what portion of that is a function of geography mix, et cetera. And then any color you could provide around the ability to push rate there. 
A. William Stein: Jordan, it's definitely a function of geographic mix. It's also a function of an extension that we were doing with existing customers that we were providing some rentable concession as well. Andy, you want to add anything to that? 
Andrew Power: Yes. Just maybe just a little more color. I mean the overall sign was a strong quarter, well north of $100 million. In North America, as you pointed out, it was in our prepared remarks, we had a sizable signing where we essentially came to the table with a holistic relationship-oriented solution for our customer, combining a renewal that impacted our mark-to-markets as well as the new signing. 
 On the renewal, if you pulled that out of our mark-to-markets, we're positive 1%, but it was a 30-megawatt signing so it was a large kind of contributor to that. And on the new signing, I think it was into 4 or so different data halls. It was spread across both Ashburn and Chicago. It was 100% into existing vacant or to-be-vacated capacity, so a direct flow through to the bottom line, not, call it, future re-leasing. And so we think it was an attractive combination of helping a customer grow with us on our campus. And this is a customer we see future growth in years to come. So happy to support them. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then coming back to the supply chain, I have a little bit of a two-parter, which is one, how much urgency are you seeing from your larger customers that are looking to procure available inventory and just have line of sight to future product and infrastructure? And then second, how far forward have you pre-bought critical construction materials like generators, PDUs, crack units, UPSs? 
Andrew Power: So maybe I'll -- Jordan, this is Andy again. I'll try to take them in backwards order. So we have, call it, approaching 300, 270-something of megawatts, shovels in ground all the way to opening doors as we speak. And we are insulated in terms of our cost and procurement, whether it's through our VMI programs or through just supplier contracts and other things we do have been focused on building new capacity for so many years consistently. 
 Beyond that, we are not fully insulated but those VMIs I just mentioned do extend. They're primarily focused in North America. They extend until 2023 so we do have a fair bit of insulation. We're not whistling by the graveyard on this topic. Obviously, inflation is here and will impact anyone that's called in the development arena. But we do believe given our size, scale as the largest developer and track record, that we're going to fare better than our competitor set and especially any newer incumbents to development. 
 In terms of urgency, I think our customers are always urgent despite making massive financial decisions. Maybe I'll have Corey jump in a little bit to give you a little bit of flavor on the customer plans. 
Corey Dyer: Yes, sure. I can do that, Jordan. On the questions around this with via demand from the shortages in chips, we haven't seen it negatively affect any of our pipeline across the regions. We've actually seen it grow. And then also, we've got some sophisticated customers that thought forward about what was going to happen with the chip shortages and planned accordingly and therefore, have accelerated some of our opportunities across the globe. 
 So at a net perspective, we kind of see it as a positive and people are thinking through it. Our customers are thinking through it. And on our end, it has really helped us kind of grow our pipeline at this point. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. 
David Barden: I'll ask my 2 upfront, too, if I could. I guess the first one would be, Bill, investors have been waiting a long time to kind of see how the big data center companies evolve their edge strategies. You've obviously struck a partnership a week or 2 ago and it sounds like you're planning on doing some more. Wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit now on what you're looking for and how you settled on this path that you've chosen with Atlas to begin with. 
 And then maybe, Andy, just I want to kind of go back to the power thing. 90% pass-through, that leaves about $20 million on the income statement. A few pennies, still about $15 million of exposure. Is that kind of what you're budgeting to potentially happen in 2022? 
A. William Stein: Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Chris to handle the edge questions since he spends a fair bit of his days on that particular initiative. 
Chris Sharp: No, I appreciate it, Bill, and thanks for the question, David. Yes, we've definitely been watching the edge for some time now. We do see -- it's still in its early stages of being a material opportunity. But one of the things that we've done is partner with AtlasEdge that we think they can provide a significant value in extending our platform deeper into the metro. And so that's something that we're looking at learning and understanding how to gain more intelligence in their new types of infrastructure they're bringing to market. And quite frankly, it expands and enhances our core to edge strategy so that our partners and our customers can get the benefit of extending their existing infrastructure out to the edge when it matures over time. 
 I would also say that a critical piece that I think you picked up on, David, which is great, is that we at Digital, we're open, right? This is one of many partners and relationships that we're going to continue to prosecute because we see that there's many types of avenues out into accessing this edge infrastructure. But you're going to see a lot of partnerships over the course of the next couple of quarters where we'll further invest and refine exactly how we're going to prosecute that edge opportunity. 
A. William Stein: Andy? 
Andrew Power: And then David, on the second question, so just to review a few facts. So 90%, if you look at our just P&L, 90% of the power is reimbursed overall. We do pursue a hedging strategy primarily on our deregulated markets where you see potential greater volatility. We're about 85% hedged with contract durations ranging from 1 to 3 years. We also, as you know, are incredibly focused on sustainability. Green power procurement is a massive part of that playbook, and we pride ourselves in what we've done in that efforts to further green our portfolio, including power purchase agreements. 
 Some of those have a potentially offsetting impact if in the event that power prices are to surge that provides an incremental hedge to power costs. So where we see it in the event that this elevated power scenario plays out for the duration of 2022, we'd look at it as just a couple of cents, which call it, every $0.01 is just almost $3 million. So not -- I wouldn't say a material headwind at this time. 
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. 
Simon Flannery: Andy, I just want to clarify, you made a comment that you're optimistic on 2022 same-store NOI growth. Does that mean you can -- you think it's going to be positive or better than this year? Any clarity you have there? And then just more broadly, Bill, and to maybe just talk about leasing has been consistently strong this year. How does the pipeline look? And how does the competitive environment look going forward? 
A. William Stein: Thanks, Simon. So listen, we are in the middle of budget season, and I got my head of FP&A to my right and he'll step on my foot really painfully if I get out of my skis here. But that being said, listen, we got a same-store pool that's going to materially grow. And I think it's in a positive direction with the addition of Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, our business in Athens. We've acquired higher pricing power components added to the mix. 
 We're also making great progress on re-leasing the capacity that was vacated at the beginning of this year, a huge portion of signings as -- that I mentioned we did this quarter has been falling into vacant or vacated capacity, so a quick resumption of cash flow from that space that sat idle for a portion of 2021. So net-net, I think there's a few things that kind of point to this kind of more positive trajectory in the same-store pool. Hence, my comment about optimistic of where we're going for 2022. 
Unknown Executive: And then Q4 is best situated to address the pipeline. 
Andrew Power: Yes. And then also from a pipeline perspective, Simon, I would just tell you that PlatformDIGITAL and just our thought leadership around data gravity is really taking hold, right? Our enterprise pipeline's growing across all regions, so really happy with that. Gartner was forecasting solid growth in enterprise IT spend. It just feels like we're in kind of the early innings of the IT transformation for the enterprises. 
 As mentioned in the opening remarks, this quarter represented a new high for us, new logos at 140 new logos, so think about that as a proxy for enterprises continuing to decide to buy and partner with us. So we feel good about the demand signals in our pipeline going forward. Hopefully, that answers your question, Simon. 
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. 
Matthew Niknam: Both of these are maybe piggybacking a little bit on the back of Simon's questions, but first, on the competitive landscape. I'm just wondering, you mentioned upfront being a little bit more selective as it relates to investments in the U.S. Just wondering if you can update us the competitive landscape you're seeing from both public and private peers, whether that's changed much at all in the last 3 months. 
 And then secondly, as we think about core FFO or maybe even AFFO per share growth next year, I don't want to jump the gun, I know we may get an outlook in 3 months' time. But Andy, if there's any updates in terms of how you're thinking about that bottom line growth into '22, that would be great. 
Andrew Power: Sure. So Matt, maybe I'll do it in reverse order here for just in order of efficiency here, make sure everyone gets the question. So core FFO, we're not -- we didn't pull forward our 2022 guidance dramatically. But I think we're definitely pleased with how we're putting up results this year that has got, call it, double digits top line, kind of 7% year-over-year performance at the bottom line. We've now raised our guidance, so we're just over the 5%, call it, year-over-year for 2021. And you heard from Corey and Bill and the others we're confident in the pipeline. 
 So we think -- we're looking to kind of grow the bottom line higher next year than this year. So that's a continuation of things I've been saying for pretty much every quarter of '21. But sorry, no sneak preview on '22 guidance just yet. On competitive landscape, I think that refers to leasing competitive landscape, and has there been any changes on the backs of M&A or whatever in our space? I mean, Corey should chime in here, but by and large, I don't think I've seen any dramatic change. 
 I think the trend has been our friend, for now, several quarters of more and more customers attracted to a global platform across 25 countries, 50 metropolitan areas, spanning the full customer spectrum, supporting those -- most of those 4,000 customers in the retail-oriented environments all the way up to the dedicated data halls for hyperscalers who we have in, call it, north of 45 different locations. And I've not seen any dramatic change in that. And I think you can see that now on several quarters of consistent, call it, results. But Corey, I don't know if you have any different observations. 
Corey Dyer: No, I would just add to it that yes, we've had consistent results for a long time. To your point on our scale, we see all the competition out there. Our win rates and our cap rates are improving. So yes, I would just pile on to what you said and the success we're having and what we're seeing in the pipeline, the demand. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. 
Michael Rollins: Two questions, if I could. First, just a little bit more on the edge strategy. Just curious how you're contemplating the edge in the North America market. And is that something that you're looking to create some further progression on in the near term or is that more of a longer-term ambition? 
 And then just going back on some of the portfolio and pricing commentary. Just curious, when you have these large multi-megawatt deals where you're discounting to get new business or you have some repricing risk, is it because some of the needs of the customers are changing? Is it just market rents? Like what are some of the factors that are driving that? And how should investors think about just what might be left in the portfolio to get through on that basis? 
Andrew Power: Thanks, Mike. Maybe I'll take the second question and hand off to Chris to talk about what's next on edge. So I mean, listen, we're always in active relationship-oriented dialogues with our customers but especially our largest customers who we're supporting in so many different markets and really the full suite of products from network-oriented deployments, hybrid IT, all the way out to their true massive cloud compute. 
 And we just want to -- we try to come to the table with holistic solutions. If they have a renewal that's coming in the coming years, we just make sure that's part of the conversation, right? And it often leads to situations like which recently transpired in the last quarter where they may not take some of the new business out to a full search of the market or say, "You know what, I've already deployed on your campus and then growing these adjacent data halls is the right move." So it's really a holistic relationship-oriented approach. 
 As it relates to, I think, the heart of your question, yes, we don't like having any mark-to-market go down at all, so a negative 5% quarter is not great. But in the scheme of things, we're still holding our guidance for the full year. We had a positive 0-point -- a very modest positive last quarter and we're seeing strength in the fourth quarter. And we've been saying for some time, we think the front [ review ] of these expirations are getting better in terms of the mix, more higher pricing power footprints as well as more international footprints where we have greater pricing power on these renewals. And that's putting aside incremental uplift potential from this inflation-related impact that Bill kind of highlighted that should manifest itself over time. Chris, do you want to tackle the edge? 
Chris Sharp: Absolutely. Thanks, Michael, for the question. It gives me an opportunity. I just want to also commend Giuliano as getting the role of CEO over at AtlasEdge. It's a great opportunity for him and we'll continue to work closely with him. So I appreciate the question, Michael. But going one step further, and I think you're spot on in that we often talk about the edge evolving from the core out deeper into the metro. And I think one aspect of that is no 2 markets are equal, so there's definitely varying degrees of capabilities in each of the markets globally. 
 So Europe is one, in a general sense, North America and APAC. We absolutely are pursuing different types of partnerships within all of these markets because, quite frankly, our largest customers are looking for a global solution. And so we're always looking at what is the best path to enable our customers in the most efficient way possible. That's at the core of what is our edge thesis that we continually refine and that's what we referenced even in the prepared remarks, I think, in Bill's section about you'll see other partnerships in different markets just to really helping us prosecute that opportunity when it matures over time. 
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. 
Frank Louthan: What is sort of the development yield that you're targeting on that re-leasing, particularly the new customer that kind of dragged down the greater than 1 megawatt leasing? And then I've got a follow-up. 
Andrew Power: Honestly, Frank, they're backfilling vacant capacity so it wasn't like we were building out a new building. I think a good chunk of that is legacy DFT capacity, which we did a stock-for-stock deal and hence, it was kind of a currency exchange. So I don't think the development -- I don't think the development yield would be the right way to look at it. 
 You can look at the -- given its size, it was the preponderance of the North America signings in the plus megawatt category, which -- listen, we always want rates to be higher, but we -- those are 2 markets where I would say that we -- I think we garnered a fair economic rate for that capacity, and we're refilling something that's already built in our capitalization. We're paying tax -- real estate taxes on it. We're operating the capacity so it's going to flow through to our bottom line. And we've not changed, I would say, our development target returns on the, call it, 270 megawatts that we have under construction. That actually inched up a smidge this last quarter. 
Frank Louthan: All right, great. So the follow-up. Bill, you mentioned that you could see inflation work in your favor in the re-leasing. When should we expect that? Or I guess, it didn't help as much this quarter. Or is that going to help more broadly for colo and smaller deals as opposed to more hyperscale deals? 
A. William Stein: Yes, Frank, I mean, that's -- I don't think that's going to be -- that's not going to show up next quarter or the quarter after, I think. But I do think if you see sustained inflation, it's going to start flowing through to our competitors' construction costs. As I said, I think it will show up in higher interest rates. And I think it will put upward pressure on rents across the board, which will affect not just our new leasing but renewal leasing. But it's hard to put a specific time on it, certainly not going to be in the next quarter or two. 
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. 
Eric Luebchow: Curious on what you see in the enterprise funnel. We heard there are some larger deals coming to the market, particularly in the financial services arena. Have you seen deal requirements across enterprise picking up in size? And do you think an acceleration in deal flow could give you the opportunity to do even better in that arena as we go forward? 
 And then just one more question. You've said in the past capital recycling may start to moderate in the coming years. But given the cap rate on the Prudential joint venture sale sub-5%, are there opportunities to maybe sell more noncore markets or assets in the coming years? 
Andrew Power: Corey, why don't you hit the first one and Greg and I can tag team the second one? 
Corey Dyer: Yes. So Eric, thanks. The question, I think, was on enterprise demand and continuing that as well as possible deals we have for the quarter. I'm not going to talk through specific deals. But we do see an uptick in requirements as well as uptick in the size of the requirements, which is what you were specifically asking when you think through our full spectrum of offerings and opportunity that we have for the enterprises that uniquely positions us around PlatformDIGITAL and how you're going to handle the data gravity and the opportunities around that. 
 So yes, we're seeing some larger footprints go in across, call it, our 300 kW band and 600 kW band that speaks to people thinking through data performance hubs for us and data hubs out there for us to improve in their enterprise solutions. So yes, we're seeing that across the board. Did I get you your answer, Eric? 
Eric Luebchow: Yes. Yes, that's great. 
Gregory Wright: Eric, with respect to capital recycling, I guess what I would say is things are still consistent with what we said a few years ago. And a few years ago, we said we were going to sell a few billion dollars of assets over a few years. And again, the reasons that we were recycling out of those assets and redeploying that capital into more core strategic assets remains. Whether they were assets that weren't core to our business or certain markets that weren't core to our business, that's why we're selling assets. We're not just selling assets because there's strong cap rate activity in the market. 
 Now that obviously helps. But again, if an asset is core to us, we're not going to sell it just because cap rates are getting better. But again, it does put a little wind at our back to the extent we are selling assets now, given the improved pricing we're seeing in the market. And you're right, we saw strong pricing in our portfolio disposition in Europe this past year. And now on the Prudential deal, we saw very strong pricing, as you said, on the stabilized assets. It was mid-4s, of which we were fortunate to recognize almost $20 million of promote out of that transaction as well. 
 So look, your point is right, pricing is strong. We think that bodes well for the sector and for big owners of assets like ourselves. But maybe I'll turn it over to Andy to go ahead and see if he has anything to add. 
Andrew Power: Just one thing, just 2 buckets there, selling outright noncore assets that Greg did a great job of describing, streamlining our portfolio, aligning with growing customers, long-term growth assets. And then I think it was touched on one of the first or second questions on also evolving our capital sources in terms of core assets and raising private capital, all of this with the initiative of trying to accelerate our bottom line growth through capital efficiency. 
Operator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. 
Erik Rasmussen: Just two. First, on the Africa JV. You announced that yesterday with Pembani. Can you just provide any additional color around how big these data centers are, maybe some details around the acquisition? And then as you look -- what sort of investments are you looking to make as you look to expand in that market? 
Gregory Wright: Sure. Erik, it's Greg again. Look, I think when you look at the transactions, right, the transactions we've talked about here are clearly a company called Medallion Communications in Nigeria, and the total consideration for that project was $29 million. We partnered with Pembani on that, so the amount of capital we have is even less. 
 And another transaction we disclosed was the acquisition of a land parcel in Mozambique, again, with Pembani. That was for $3 million. So I mean, look, these are clearly -- what I would say is these are small Cs that we're planning in these highly connected assets because they are, they're highly connected communities of interest. And we're doing it with a smart local partner in Pembani. And when you look at a market like Nigeria, right, it's got the largest GDP and population in Africa. And the size of that investment, as I said, is very small for a company our size. And as I mentioned, Mozambique is even smaller. And we did that one to gain a location that again will play a critical role with the subsea cable activity that will encircle Africa. 
 I think as you think about it, right, you look and see in Europe, right, we have Marseille in Western Europe, right, which is a highly connected hub. Then we've done a transaction with Lamda Hellix in Greece, which we believe is going to become a highly connected hub. And as you look at that, so you have Marseille to the west, you have Greece to the east. And as you move down into Africa, right, you look at Nigeria on the west, you look at Kenya in the east, right, and then you look at Mozambique that goes down to the south, and we really view this as really one large, like, crossroads of connectivity, if you will, that we think are going to bode well long term for the company. 
Erik Rasmussen: Great. Look forward to hearing more about it. And then maybe just on the Q3 leasing. It held steady at $113 million. As the U.S. and, I think, hyperscale ease somewhat, were there any limitations with capacity in certain markets? Or was there anything else that you could really call out as we think about Q3 results? 
Andrew Power: Erik, I don't think there's any limitations. We always have room for more leasing in any given quarter. And I know Corey's also chomping at the bit for more inventory to sell into quickly. But listen, I think it was a pretty very healthy quarter. You look at the geo mix, how well spread across each of the regions. You look at the enterprise mix with less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, call it, 40%; record 140 new logos. That record 140 had a record contribution from -- on quarter lease, [ reckon ] last 6 quarters from North America and I think #2 from an EMEA contribution. 
 You could see from the new logo or some of the logos we called out in my prepared remarks, kind of like more old world enterprise, global power firms and universities to burgeoning technologies like autonomous driving. And I think on the hyperscale side, a little bit similar. Some of the, call it, house names of digital growing with us into existing inventory as well as some, call it, next-generation hyperscalers landing with us in Tokyo, which I think was our second and third largest signing. So broadly pretty healthy and we're not done yet for 2021. 
Operator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. 
Colby Synesael: A few questions. One, on renewals, renewal spread's down negative 5.6%, still guiding to slightly negative for the year. Do you think renewal spreads could be positive in 2022? Second question, just a little bit of clarification. Are you saying that your biggest deal, which I guess was the combination of Chicago and Northern Virginia was for 30 megawatts? Or was that what the megawatts were that were renewed? 
 And then Facebook just put out their earnings last night. They increased their CapEx budget for 2022 by over 50% to somewhere, I think, near $30 billion. Do you think that, that could have positive implications for the data center space? And then forgive me, but you just did an ATM. You have an 18-month draw on that. The ATMs you've done in the past have been 12 months. I'm curious why you pushed it out to 18. 
Andrew Power: So Colby, I think that's 4 questions relative to our 2 limit, but [indiscernible] color to... 
Colby Synesael: Some of them are like 5 seconds. 
Andrew Power: So we're going to get them all rapid-fire here. Listen, I think we've been saying for some time, we think we're moving into a better territory on the cash mark-to-market. And I think the -- what you see in our guidance, including the fourth quarter, relative to what we are trending already reported for the year speaks to that. And I think I've been saying that for some time that I think we're heading to more -- better territories. So again, we're not done with the budget and certainly not our guidance for 2022, but it feels like we're -- based on the mix, both product and geos and composition, we're in a better territory than we were certainly at the beginning of this year on that stat. 
 We did -- across 4 or so suites, so different buildings across roughly half and half Ashburn and Chicago, a total of about 30 megawatts of new signings with the same customer that also did roughly 30 megawatts of renewals in the same quarter. And you could see this was a really super high renewal quarter overall for us. We've usually been doing like 100 megawatts or just shy of that in that plus than [ 1-megawatt ] LTM standpoint on. And so you can see, I think we had 53 or something in that category this quarter. So a high renewal activity quarter. So hopefully, that paints the picture on those two. 
 Undrawn forward equity offering, yes, we -- listen, we -- the equity offering was again opportunistically derisking our development CapEx plan, and we're able to extend the duration of that contract so we have greater flexibility to essentially feather it into our sources or uses over time at the right time for the business, which hopefully better -- is better measured and help contributes to our earnings growth in the ensuing years. 
 Facebook CapEx increasing, I don't think we have got any inside information on that. They're a large customer. We've done -- we did new business with them in the last quarter. But I don't see how it could be a negative necessarily, but I don't want to over-index that is super positive to the industry. 
Operator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. 
Aryeh Klein: Andy, earlier on the call, you kind of mentioned inflation is here. How is that flowing through from a lease pricing standpoint? Are there any terms that are changing tax DLR against inflation, maybe some kind of change in that escalator structure? 
Andrew Power: Yes, Aryeh, so I mean, inflation -- I believe inflation is here. If you filled up your car or purchased milk at the grocery store, I think Bill's comments to one of the questions, it didn't mean like overnight, the data center industry got a rate reset. I think we've seen inflationary pressures prior to this hard cost inflation happen where markets just got tighter as they ran up to the physical boundaries of infrastructure, right? So our Santa Clara and Northern -- Santa Clara's an example of that. I mean our leasing success has been certainly a [ healing ] to the Ashburn market. We saw this in Frankfurt. Singapore saw this in terms of supply limitations, driving up pricing, which we've raised pricing there at least 5 times, I think, in the last 12 months. 
 And I think Bill's commentary is that, listen, as this continues to hit [ car ] costs and delivery or access to the infrastructure is to bring on new supply which is, we believe, is going to be disproportionately impacting smaller subscale newer entrants, that means that our customers have less options in terms of their providers. And I think that as our costs get inflated, we have to examine our rates and on a market-by-market supply and demand and costing basis. 
 And listen, I think we're -- do the -- going to be the best out there in terms of insulating our customers from this. But I know -- I think if this period continues for a long time, we haven't had inflation realistically since, call it, the end of the Carter administration. So we're in new territory for many of us. But I think it's -- I think we're going to fare better at the end of the day. 
 And we are insulated in terms of we have rent escalators, fixed bumps in most of our contracts. And I think our scale and purchasing power on an operating side as well as the build cost side provides insulation in addition to some of the other risk mitigations we mentioned earlier in the call. 
Aryeh Klein: And then just on that large renewal, how did that mark-to-market rate compare to actual market rates? Or was it some percentage above market rates? 
Andrew Power: I would -- I believe it's probably 10-ish percent above new signings in apples-to-apples comparable markets. We typically see renewals have greater pricing power than new deals, just on the customer has a strong preference to not risk infrastructure or workload on a move. 
Aryeh Klein: And is that 10% kind of the normal range that you'd see? 
Andrew Power: It could be higher than that, actually. I would say it's probably that's maybe on the skinnier side. But it all depends on the facts and circumstances of the supply and demand, the utilization of the infrastructure, the customers' growth plans, the workload. Is it B2C? Is it B2B? All these things kind of go into the factors that drive the commercial outcome on those. And it was 30 megawatts all at once, right? So 30 megawatts of new signs for 30 megawatts of renewals, all with a stroke of a pen. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. 
A. William Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of the presentation. One, our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. PlatformDIGITAL attracted a record number of new logos. We had another quarter of strong new bookings and a record level of renewals. Most importantly, customers know that we will do what we say. Even when global supply chains are stressed, Digital Realty delivers. 
 Two, we're continuing to extend our global platform. We are investing organically to enhance our global footprint while expanding our platform into India, along with additional strategic connectivity destinations circling the African continent. 
 Three, we generated double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, once again exceeding consensus expectations. And once again, we raised our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, locking in attractively priced long-term debt and supplementing it with equity capital that will be drawn down over the next 18 months to support our global development program. 
 I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you virtually in a couple of weeks at NAREIT and hopefully in person again sometime soon. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up and we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty’s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today’s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I’d like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We continue to enhance our product mix, with a record contribution from our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection category. We extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We raised revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last but not least, we further strengthen the balance sheet with the redemption of high coupon preferred stock and the issuance of low cost long-term fixed rate debt. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter. Our business continues to globalize, and once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions. Our full spectrum product offering continues to blossom, with record sub-1-megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC. Together with interconnection, the sub-1-megawatt category comprise nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers enthusiastic adoption of PlatformDIGITAL to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives. I’ll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on page three. In June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold Award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year. We remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interests with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings. During the second quarter, we published our third Annual ESG Report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe, as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio, and reaching 50% of our global needs. We also reported progress towards our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives. Our ESG Report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, along with our community involvement. Digital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally. We encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative. We also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report. Events over the past year and a half have demonstrated that now more than ever ESG belongs at the forefront of our business. I’m proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let’s turn to our investment activity on page four. We are continuing to invest in our global platform, with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30th, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months. We’re investing most heavily in EMEA, with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction. Most of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marcé, Paris, and Zurich. Demand remains strong across these metros and each continues to attract service providers, as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly stand up performance by the region during the second quarter in the up to 1-megawatt category. In North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in two hot markets, Portland and Toronto that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros. We’ve had tremendous recent success in these two metros. We have 30-megawatts under construction in Portland or more specifically Hillsborough that are now fully pre-leased. While our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region. We opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction. Demand for this scarce capacity is robust and we have another 18 megawatts largely pre sold and scheduled to open this quarter. Also coming soon in this region, are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan. With the world’s eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that’s poised to win the gold medal. We’re also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul and earlier this morning, we announced that we’ve acquired another land parcel to expand our connected campus, enabling us to accommodate the hyperscale demand that has been clamoring for capacity and our first highly connected facility. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure, given the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership, and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market. Let’s turn to the macro environment on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. The first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 Enterprises. Last year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecast the rolling intensity of enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets. Earlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric of fabrics. With data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration. Third-party research continues to support data gravity’s growing importance. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently conducted its sixth annual survey of Chief Data officers and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives, including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue generating business outcomes. Issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places, together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties. PlatformDIGITAL was designed to solve these problems. Digital transformation is compounding as enterprise data and connectivity problem. Recent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources by exchanging data with 27 external cloud products, Digital Realty’s enterprise and service provider customers are turning to PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros. Our leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers. For the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for Data Center Colocation and Interconnection Services, further acknowledgement of our consistently improving customer capabilities. This recognition reflects our execution against the PlatformDIGITAL roadmap, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose, full spectrum, global capabilities. Earlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of Data Center Ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year. Digital Realty was ranked second in both North America, as well as Latin America, and jumped up three spots to number seven in Asia. Also in July, Kagame [ph] published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities. Digital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across three broad categories. Our capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second among the key criteria comparison. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting customer’s needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let’s turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1-megawatt or less reached an all time high of 41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We landed 109 new logos during the second quarter with a strong showings across all regions. Again, demonstrating the power of a global platform. The geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 20%, the Americas representing nearly 50% and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%. The megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half our total bookings, with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world. We landed a top five cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus. Close on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan’s most popular social media application selected PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus. NAVER, the leading Korea based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data intensive workloads for their high performance computing and I -- AI intensive technology based platform. A European broadcaster is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability and cost savings. A Global 2000 Enterprise Data Platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings and simplicity. In London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top three global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities, without compromising their data intensive interconnection requirements On the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping two independent FinTech customers, improve performance, enhanced -- and enhanced access to their connected data communities. Finally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture enable future growth. Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $303 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter. The live between signings and commencement was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under three years. Again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1-megawatt. We retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash releasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1-megawatt renewals in the total. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points, as we brought additional capacity online across six metros during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, the Western building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. So these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. Let’s turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter, but remained below the prior year average providing a bit of an FX tailwind. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to acts as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, given our strategy and matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt and 100 basis point move in benchmark rates were roughly is 75-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year, but down 8% from last quarter, driven by a $0.12 non-cash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter. Excluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on a topline with a slight assist from FX tailwinds, as well as operating expense savings, partially due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. For the second time this year, we are raising our full year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business. The deferred tax charge does run through a core FFO per share, but as you can see from the press release, we are lowering the midpoint by just $0.05, which all else equal would imply $0.07 raise excluding the deferred tax charge. Since it is non-cash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO. Most of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged. But I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurrent CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, setting the stage for accelerated growth in cash flow. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect our bottomline result to improve sequentially over the balance of the year, as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate. We do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure, with an increase in property level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID along with an uptick in G&A expense, as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule, so your models should reflect these higher costs. Last but certainly not least, let’s turn the balance sheet on page 13. As you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of non-core assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million. As a result, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6 times as the end of the second quarter, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year, through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence. Fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly, also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and closer to all time high at 5.4 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In mid-May, we redeemed 200 million of preferred stock at 0.625%, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25 effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 terms. In mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program raising approximately $77 million. In early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock. We also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over six and a half years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of a global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six and a half years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. Over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we’d be pleased to take your question. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkins: Thanks. I got one question and then a follow up. First on M&A, Interxion is now more than a year under your belt and then you announced kind of the JV expansion into India. I wondered if you could maybe symbolize your strategy for organic growth as it pertains to the potential purchases of existing platforms or assets. Sometimes there can be assets out there with dislocated valuation, so I thought it would be worth asking about that topic and getting a refresh? Thanks.
Bill Stein: Sure. Jon, happy to provide a refresh. First of all, we don’t comment on M&A speculation, particularly as it relates to specific opportunities in the marketplace. But to refresh everyone’s memory, we try to do only strategic deals. And by that, I mean, we’re looking for investments that enhance either our geographic footprint or our product offering, thinking about specific deals. When you look back on Interxion, I think, we were fortunate with there we were able to do both. We were able to enhance our geographic penetration and add significantly to the colocation mix in Europe. We -- as it relates to --and the CyrusOne situation, which I think is what you probably were alluding to. We think that’s a good platform. We have all this respect in the world for both Bruce Duncan and Steve and Dave Ferdman. But its gives us more of what we already have. And so I just don’t think that’s something that would be of interest to us.
Jon Atkins: And then on asset recycling that Andy mentioned towards the end, there was a press item from June about the potential formation of a Singapore REIT. And I wonder if you could give us an update as to what’s happening and kind of the rationale?
Andy Power: Thanks, Jon. So I think there’s two concepts kind of interlinked in your question. So non-core capital recycling, we’ve been doing a fair bit of that, most recently executed on portfolio in EMEA close to $700 million. That was not core or strategically digital. And it’s kind of similar to a transaction we did back in, I think, 2019. So call it, folks in our portfolio, we see the most robust and diverse customer growth. So that’s one leg of the stool that you can see will continue on, we activated this year, again, in terms of funding our business plan by recycling that capital into more strategic projects. We’ve also done what’s I will call it private capital partnerships. So similarly with that same transaction back in 2019 with Mapletree, we raised 80% stake and $1 billion of core assets, assets that we never really want to part with and we maintain operational control of as a minority partner. And so, I think, you’ll see us continue to do both. But there’s a big difference in our minds. Non-core things that we’re willing to call it 100% and we wish the new owners well, and core really keeping those assets as part of our collective platform and just trying to recycle capital of the slower growth assets. Both of which I think at the end of the day, hopefully, accelerates our growth and allows us to redeploy that capital into higher return opportunities.
Jon Atkins: Anything specifically about the price item from I think Bloomberg and data center knowledge about forming a REIT in Singapore?
Bill Stein: I can say that kind of ties to both the questions. Coincidentally, Singapore REITs have been the buyers of our two biggest portfolio sales. They’ve not been the only buyers. We’ve also done other one-off assets sales to other private buyers that were non-core. As relates to any vehicle that we would do like that, we would only think about that in the core contacts, if we’re going to extend our brand and sponsorship to it. So I think -- I can’t comment on what that specific rumor was kind of pointing to, but it kind of is interwoven with both concepts a little bit.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I wanted to follow up a little bit in terms of sort of investment opportunity. Bill, you’ve talked about, strategic, accretive and I think enhancing growth -- growth enhancing for some of the strategic objectives or criteria for acquisitions. If you can check those boxes, it would seem that, an acquisition even something domestic could make sense. The piece that I am struggling with a little bit, it may be like the growth enhancing. Strategic make some sense that even though there’s some overlap accretive, I get -- we can figure that out, growth enhancing, the piece I wanted to ask you about was, does market share help in terms of sort of the growth outlook. In other words, if you’re controlling certain -- a greater extent of the marketplaces and certainly these large hyperscale Tier 1 markets in the U.S. You think that would mitigate some of the downside rent pressure we’ve seen in that vertical?
Bill Stein: Yeah. Jordan, I guess, when I think about -- so what we’re trying to accomplish here and certainly in recent history, I mean, you saw the press release today, right, where we bought a piece of land in Seoul Korea and we already own a carrier-neutral data center in downtown Seoul, and now we’re going to build a campus out in the suburbs. And what we’re trying to do is replicated and so what we’ve created in other markets in the world -- and around the world to the connected campus with a carrier-neutral dense network that you can tether the campus back into. And I think that when you look around the world today, they’re just aren’t that many platforms. I mean, there is not an Interxion in Asia. And I think that would you going to more likely see from us is what you’re seeing in Seoul, we are in fact pursuing similar models in other parts of Asia and in other parts of the world where we’re going into new markets and planting the flag with both network dense facilities and campuses. So just to repeat what our criteria is, yes, it has to be strategically important to us in terms of either geography or product additive to both, it needs to be, we’d like it to be accretive to our near-term earnings idea and certainly accretive to growth, which is what Interxion was and Ascenty. And importantly prudently financed, so a capitalization…
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
Bill Stein: … that is consistent with how we finance the rest of the business here at Digital. And anything you want to add or?
Andy Power: I got two…
Bill Stein: All right.
Andy Power: Yes. I got two out of three right.
Bill Stein: You did. And we -- we’re not the levered up in other words to make…
Andy Power: It was very to higher [inaudible] rate...
Jordan Sadler: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Bill Stein: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. I hope this wasn’t the interview.
Bill Stein: But to put a finer point on it, we’re not going to lever up these assets to make the number works -- numbers work.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Andy, if you have anything else, I will follow up.
Andy Power: I think the second or third part of your question was, can you drive pricing power to market share, which I think episodically there is opportunities to do that. I think if you look back to our DuPont Fabros transaction that was a market share moving transaction where we up-tiered our relationships with many customers to kind of to control near-term supply. And I think that concept maybe works in more overall supply-constrained markets predominantly outside the U.S. or even like a Santa Clara for that example. I do not -- I’m not confident. I think your line of thinking would be other domestically-focused larger footprint players is that, does that M&A create better pricing power and today’s backdrop, I don’t see that same events playing out, but again life such in America.
Jordan Sadler: That’s helpful. And then coming back Bill to sort of been around the world. India, can you guys potentially de-size the India JV opportunity for us? Just sort of initial sizing, I mean, is this -- could we see a platform purchase like Ascenty, like you did with Brookfield then there or is this going to be a de novo opportunity?
Bill Stein: I’m going to hand that one over to Greg.
Greg Wright: Okay. Thanks. Hey, Jordan. Look, I think, describe the India joint venture. Jordan, it’s actually a hybrid. Look, as you know, we’ve had a strong relationship with Brookfield. We’ve had a great experience with the Ascenty, but when we purchase Ascenty, we bought -- we came into that platform together and purchase an existing platform that had 14 assets. Eight of which were under construction, six of which were operational assets and a team in place. This is going to be different from that. But we are, again, going in 50-50 joint partners, joint branding and alike, which you’ve seen in some of our press materials. But here, we’re going to be and we have some folks that are already residing in the JV, but we’re actually going into India here to build a platform, and ultimately, we expect it to be like Ascenty. I mean being a standalone platform with a strong management team that drives the business. And I think when we look at India, we’re not looking to go into India and just do like-for-like product. We’re looking to do differentiated product and we think Brookfield as a partner here and given their presence in the tower space, and given what’s happening in India in the mobile market and alike. We think we have a great opportunity to do that. And so, but the general governance and construct if you will is very similar to Ascenty, but the basic premise of going in. We’re going into build a platform. We’re not buying a platform. So I’d say that’s how I describe it.
Operator: The next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: All right. Thank you. First question I just wanted to just run by you guys is, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on what’s going on releasing spreads? Because in the greater than 1-megawatt releasing spread slide, which is slide 10, there was a meaningful improvement in spreads and I think we were going from down 11% to just down 1%. And I was hoping you just walk us through this. So that’s part one of the question. Part two is, are essentially done with a lot of those high negative renewal spread, I mean, leases that we’ve kind of been discussing on a last couple of quarters. Are you guys in the clear, is this -- are we going to see some lumpiness? Thank you.
Bill Stein: Hey. Thanks, Sami. Let me tackle that. So, like-for-like megawatt -- north of a megawatt quarter-over-quarter certainly saw an improvement from down just close to 11% on the prior quarters, 30-ish megs, the 23.5 megs came -- renew this quarter, came through this quarter, basically flat, negative 90 bps. Overall also improvement basically at 0.1% positive and over 2% positive GAAP. So, definitely move in the right direction. At the same time, I wouldn’t call it be standing on the aircraft carrier with a victory flag just yet. We’re still working through some still certain contracts that are above market. Hence we maintained, I will call it, language around our full year guidance of slightly negative. I did -- since parsing through both categories, in the -- in that category literally 82% of the megawatts that renewed were positive. So close to 2% positive. So really was like one or two negative that drug down the category to be flat. And in the over-to-up to that is greater than [Audio Gap] percent positive cash mark-to-markets in terms of the megawatts renewed. So, I would call, it’s still episodic, moving in a better direction and that’s a thematic things that I don’t think this one quarter was a massive inflection point. We did gradually getting to better territory this year versus last year. And also feel that same trend kind of continuing based on the mix we see in the future. Sami, can you remind me your second question though?
Sami Badri: I think you kind of already hit it, but the second part of the question was just kind of, are you guys essentially going into the clear regarding a lot of the high negative renewal spreads leases that came with the DFT portfolio? You kind of answered it, but that was the second question?
Bill Stein: I don’t think, I won’t kind of go through my victories piece here. I don’t think we’re fully out of the woods, but where the trend is moving in our direction and we benefit from an incredibly diverse platform and as you look at our expirations going into this year, rest of this year or 2022 and beyond. The mix just is improving, right? The bars have gotten shorter. The concentration in the greater than megawatt is become more international, places where we’ve had greater pricing power. So, not fully in the clear, but I feel like we’re inching our way into better territory every day.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Andy, I’ll just follow up on that renewal issue. It does seem like things are going better now. Is it possible that a few years out renewals could actually be a tailwind or are the escalator structured, so that it’s generally neutral at best?
Andy Power: Yes. I think there’s definitely potential for fewer out cash mark-to-markets to be a positive tailwind here. I mean, we -- if you look at our -- the diversity of our product here we are -- it’s a very sticky product. We’re typically doing renewals in many markets better than new rates on new deals given the propensity inertia for our customer to stay. Our interconnection capabilities kind of further that stickiness, these markets where we’re even bringing on new capacity are running up to physical barriers, whether supply of power, access to land, connectivity, government moratoriums are popping up in certain countries. And then the whole concept inflation and its impact to newer incumbents and overall cost structures. All those things point to a world of higher pricing power in this aspect and certainly more so for Digital relative to a new entrance.
Brendan Lynch: Great. That’s helpful. And maybe a question for Chris as well. Chris, maybe you can give us just a little bit of insight on the fabric of fabrics platform and kind of simplify that for us if you can?
Chris Sharp: No. Absolutely. Appreciate it. Yeah. So it’s a continuation. We’ve been investing in PlatformDIGITAL to make it more robust, where we have over 4,000 customers today. And as Andy alluded to earlier on Bill’s comments earlier that we’re adding 100 new customers every quarter. So, what we’ve talked about with the fabric of fabrics and the partnership that we pulled together with Zayo is that these capabilities are proven to be very successful with our enterprise customers. And I think what we’re talking about here today is about expanding those capabilities and those connectivity capabilities to a broader set of customers. And so I think that’s one of the core things that we’re really starting to drive and it’s resonating well with our customers and that a lot of enterprises are out there looking for an open platform to really achieve their goals and remove complexity out of their deployments. And so that’s what the PlatformDIGITAL is and what fabric of fabrics means as we pulled together a carrier-grade partner with Zayo and there the first partner that we’ve executed this with and you will see other partners coming online to expand that value focused on our customers’ success.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Yeah. Thank you for the questions, and good evening, everyone. First was the basic just math question to check my facts. So, I think, in the first quarter you did core FFO of 167 a share. I think you guided same kind of down $0.10 sequentially due to a number of factors. But the $0.12 non-cash charge wasn’t in that guide, right? So, if you strip that out, you actually were really only down about a penny quarter-over-quarter, right, for the core FFO. And if you think about rolling that forward the second half of the year saying you really had an $0.08 core FFO each, why wouldn’t that core FFO per share a be excluding the $0.12. Why wouldn’t that recur in 3Q and 4Q? What’s going to change in those two quarters stripping out that one-time charge?
Bill Stein: So, two data points. One, we are increasing the guidance, net of the $0.12, right? So the $0.12 is a non-cash deferred tax hit. Sensibly, we revaluing a liability that due to the U.K. changing its corporate tax rates by 600 basis points that $35 million or $0.12 flows through one-time and it’s non-cash, does not hit AFFO, which you can see that I think the lowest payout ratio we’ve had in five quarters now. So, by the fact that we’ve increased the guidance notwithstanding that $0.12, it’s essentially would have been a raise. And if you backed out the $0.12 to the midpoint of our new guidance you’re close to, what would be 6% year-over-year growth on the core FFO. The reason it doesn’t all the beat in this quarter to heart of your question like it doesn’t all flow-through some of the beat which is OpEx timing, so timing relative to some of the OpEx spend which got pushed out from 2Q into back half of the year.
Michael Funk: And that was related to some of the deferred OpEx in 2020, is that still what you’re talking about?
Bill Stein: Correct. Correct. I would call COVID-related…
Michael Funk: Okay.
Bill Stein: … catch up a little bit.
Michael Funk: Got it. Understood. And then let me a little bit of commentary on the leasing environment. I know there was a lot of concern about leasing this quarter for the industry, but came in very strong, given the visibility you have into the back half of the year would have it might be. What are you seeing in terms of demand from hyperscalers and/or demand picking back up from enterprise customers?
Bill Stein: I think, Corey, why don’t you pick us up there?
Corey Dyer: Yeah. Sure. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Mike, for the question. With regard to enterprise demand and then I’ll let you handle the hyperscale I think was part of this question as well. But in our opening remarks, we mentioned that over $50 million of our business was from the sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection, which is really approaching about 50% of our bookings. That’s really proxy or our -- for our enterprise business. On top of that our best channel quarter ever, we also saw an increase in multi-site, multi-region customers, which are all indicative of kind of the strength of the enterprise demand where we’re going. So, I would tell you that for the second half we see strong sufficient demand across all the regions, as they take care of and addressed the needs for data gravity and hybrid IT architectures, all of which has been driven by enterprise customers across all the regions. We mentioned the strength in each of the regions both AP and EMEA, as well as North America. So we’re seeing that kind of flow-through. And looking at our funnel, we see strength across all those regions multiple industries and verticals, financial services to cloud and others. So, pretty excited about where we are and confident in demand from the enterprise side and I feel like that’s going to continue. I don’t know if, Andy, want to talk to the hyperscale part of it.
Andy Power: Yeah. I’ll just add on real quick on the larger hyperscale customers, strong Americas quarter, which is really largely, we did have a top five CSP land with us in Sao Paulo, but the lion’s share was Hillsboro in Toronto. So, some great wins from hyperscalers in that market. Top five hyperscale landed both in Paris and Frankfurt, grew with us in Paris and Frankfurt and then over in APAC as mentioned in prepared remarks at the leading Japanese social media platform landed with us in Tokyo in addition to a top five CSP. I think we’ve now set as the anchor to Tokyo -- our Tokyo campus on the prior call. So, I think, dramatically two things are playing out here. One, the hard work in terms of creating this global platform for these hyperscalers across approaching 50 metropolitan areas on six continents and really trying to be their trusted partner of choice around the globe is certainly benefiting our leasing or signing activity. And I would also say, we’re making some great inroads to whether you call it next here or next-gen hyperscalers. We made -- I think couple of quarters ago, we had a hyperscale win with a Singaporean-based technology company. I mentioned the Japanese social media company. We mentioned Korean company NAVER. So, definitely penetrating a broader cast of customers than just top five CSPs that we have done.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. First, if you look at the bookings trajectory and just some of the commentary we just heard, as well as just the backlog position. Should 2022 to be a better year for organic revenue growth and core FFO per share growth relative to 2021. And then, secondly, on a separate topic, just curious as you have a range of assets in your portfolio, some very young, some older, what are you seeing in terms of the maintenance capital and the pricing on facilities that are a bit more tenured relative to maybe similar facilities that are a bit newer in vintage? Thanks.
Bill Stein: Sure. Michael, why don’t I try to tackle those in reverse order? So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older facility, the more you propose end of life on various components. But that’s no different than any piece of infrastructure or real estate. So, we’re placing the roof, placing a chiller, you kind of get to these 20-year, 30-year end of life and one by one. Now, the good thing is, we’ve built this portfolio over many years and essentially keep adding newer product to the mix at the same time. So, we’ve been able to keep our -- recurring CapEx at a pretty modest hit to our AFFO. We actually dialed it back slightly just this for the year our guidance table. So, I wouldn’t say any material upticks and we do a lot of maintenance throughout the year in terms of fixed repair, preventative and to ensure that there is no looming infrastructure headaches call on the horizon. From a pricing standpoint, obviously, there is a smaller nuance, whether it’s PV efficiencies or power densities, which we certainly are innovating and bring to bear a new technologies in terms of legacy facilities. But net-net, the biggest drivers supply and demand in the market, a data center that becomes available for us in Santa Clara or Singapore or Frankfurt or markets that are compelling demand outpacing supply, customers are creating the availability and not looking for the birth date. So, I think that’s more of a driver of the pricing activity. From your first question, I mean, on call it, 2022, I mean, we’re only called halftime here, so not ready to rollout season two or wherever. But I would say, a couple of things that set us up for accelerated growth overall. One, I just talk a little bit to the cash mark-to-market position and it’s been improving this year relative last year and see horizon where it could continue to prove. Two, this year, we took significant -- relative to our certainly -- actually we took back significant amount of capacity that we’re chopping wood on releasing. So that we’re having downtime from that baking capacity in our numbers this year, you can see that our occupancy as well. And you’re going to see that kind of come online as we refill that and have a greater contribution to revenue in 2022 than it does in 2021. So, I think those elements and the fact that I think we’ve now put up I should count this, but I think it’s close to eight pretty darn good quarter of consecutive leasing, right? You obviously have to adjust to our pre-Interaction days relative to our denominator, but the leasing has been pretty darn consistent for some quarters now. So, I think, all those things paint the picture, as well as a pretty attractive development pipeline, which will obviously create as contribution to 2022 to 2021.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Great to see the enterprise coming back this quarter. Do you think we’re pretty much back to normal now in terms of your operations? I know there’s been COVID and picking up again in certain regions. Any comments around supply chain inflationary impacts and how that might be affecting you?
Bill Stein: Let me try to give up that question, because I think there is a couple of great points in here. Maybe, Corey, you want to pick up on enterprise demand? I was really pleased on that front of -- north of $90 million in EMEA, zero to 1 megawatt close 30% of our bookings, before I could speak to that and then maybe Chris and I can handle inflation impacts on our customers and our supply chain.
Simon Flannery: Thanks.
Corey Dyer: Yeah. Thanks. I mean I went through it a little bit with some of the kind of I’ll say proxy items for enterprise success and the fact that we’ve got a strong pipeline. And I call it a strong well-qualified pipeline with quality as well. So really feel good about where the enterprise is and the follow-on. All of the acceleration in the hybrid IT and the move to, I’ll call it, work-from-home, I think, it’s just accelerated the enterprise demand and how we’re set up with our channel initiatives and what we’re doing there are just going to help us continue to build on that. So, rather than repeat what I -- I think I answered with Mike earlier, I would just tell you that the enterprise demand is strong and I think we’re in a good place going forward. It’s been accelerated a little bit by the pandemic in the last couple of years. But in a good place going forward.
Bill Stein: Yeah. No. Thanks, Corey, and I appreciate the question, Simon. I think from a supply chain and what we’ve seen in the industry, we haven’t seen any material impacts or delays at this point in time. We work extensively with our customers to understand their needs and the requirements for the infrastructure in their deployments and so we align their orders to manufacturing dates. There has been some delays, but most of the time we can signal that right in the beginning of the sales cycle to ensure that they can order them and not miss any kind of delivery dates from that perspective. But again it’s something we constantly watch with the different types of manufacturers out there. And I think, Andy, referenced this earlier, our VMI program with the infrastructure that we leverage and delivering our own services. We’re way ahead of that and I think we’ve really differentiate ourselves with the weight in the market that we can execute I think beyond most of the other companies out there. So, it’s something that we watch closely, but no material impacts to-date.
Operator: The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Q2 leasing was somewhat steady in the quarter. I know you called out U.S. and hyperscale came back, and then I think the strength on the less than 1-megawatt category. But were there any limitations with overall capacity in certain markets or is there anything else to sort of call out that could have put a damper on or kept a lid on sort of your leasing in the quarter?
Bill Stein: I mean, in any given mark -- quarter, there is always certain markets that I call it tighter on the inventory standpoint. I mean we spoke about that how we went into that Ashburn, luckily, it was a good time for us to run into that in Ashburn because the market has softened. What comes to mind right now, Erik, are a few markets that are certainly a little bit on the tighter side. We have -- I don’t think we’ve done a much activity in Santa Clara for several quarters now, because that market has been so tight and we are waiting for a new capacity to come online. In Atlanta where we’re really solely focused on colo connectivity of 56 Marietta, which is both highly connected data center in Southeast is 100% full. We’re waiting for an annex building essentially to bring on the call it several megawatts of colo capacity. Outside the states, Frankfurt, has been a bit of a Tetris game in terms of fitting the customers in, in certain markets. And then Singapore, that’s a market where I don’t think we’re fully sold out, but it’s -- we’ve raised our rates, given the supply/demand -- tremendous supply/demand imbalance. We do look at -- any turn will have in that market, where we look to reprioritize for enterprise colocation and connectivity. Those are the ones the main we want to come top of mind. But I mean, across 47 metros and developing a new capacity, at least half of them. I’m sure there’s one or two else that will be similar.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just staying with the leasing, Europe seemed to -- there was some lower leasing on the greater than 1-megawatt category. Has there been any change in sort of the hyperscale side that would suggest that things may be slowing or that we could be getting a little bit of an air pocket there or, I wouldn’t say, air pocket, but just a slowing or is it more of just sort of timing in that market and just the lumpiness nature of overall hyperscale?
Bill Stein: I don’t see anything close to an air pocket in Europe. So, as a reminder, Europe had a pretty phenomenal 4Q and a pretty strong 1Q. So you are coming off two quarters of pretty good leasing and what we’re seeing in the back half of the year. I think that trends going in the north of megawatt territory is going to continue its broad phrase. It’s certainly flat oriented where we’ve talked about Paris and Frankfurt is to extend our markets, but we’re also seeing some great demand outside the flat markets and we now have a European platform that’s across 10, maybe 12 European countries. So we’re servicing the hyperscalers and some larger enterprise requirements in many of them. But I think -- the thing -- what -- I hate, Europe didn’t have a great, what -- north of megawatt quarter because had a really fantastic less than megawatt quarter over $19 million and had numerous markets through major contribution in that less than megawatt interconnection category. So net-net, still really pleased with Europe
Operator: The last question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you very much. On Singapore, what goes up comes down. It’s been a really nice boost this year with kind of their, where they restricted the supply. But at some point, is that -- at some point, it probably resolves itself, what kind of terms are you getting there with the higher prices, signing leases, are customer just taking shorter duration terms given the price hikes. And are we looking at a -- some of this pulling back a little bit in 12 months or 24 months or do you think this is going to be a longer term situation there?
Bill Stein: Yeah. One, I would say, the customers are not seeking shorter contract durations, because we price those at higher rates. And you saw the activity, the Singapore rates are clearly shown through our APAC rates, which you can see our up again quarter-over-quarter. I don’t -- Singapore is one part of the world that I have a high degree of confidence. What goes up may not come back down. I mean, one, it’s an island state. It is incredibly government-controlled. Everyone’s operating under long-term ground leases with the government and they take a very thoughtful and measured approach to supply chain overall, who gets land, who gets to bring data center capacity online and they’re really trying to curate it, so they have the right providers and do so in a more environmentally friendly way. That’s the genesis of this, right? So that’s a market I do not see, in addition to the fact it’s an island. So, you quick -- more quickly rather the natural resources in Singapore.
Frank Louthan: Great. All right. Thank you very much.
Bill Stein: Thanks, Frank.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I’d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter. As outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we continue to enhance our product mix, with record bookings within our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection category demonstrating the progress we’ve made in offering the full product spectrum to our customers globally. We are also committed to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we provided additional transparency with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We’ve also raised full year revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, redeeming high coupon preferred equity and raising very attractively priced long-term fixed rate financing to support customer growth around the world. I’d like to wrap up today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. I hope all of you stay healthy and safe, and enjoy the rest of your summer. We hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to Digital Realty First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty’s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Operator. The speakers on today’s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I’d like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises and corporate governance enhancements. We continue to enhance the value of our global platform, extending connectivity offerings globally, recycling capital and investing to fuel high quality organic growth. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. Finally, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework and our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customer’s digital transformation issues by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let’s turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page three. We were recently honored to be named EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial Corporate Green Bond Award from Climate Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion, and other sustainable business practices. We are committed to minimize our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries, inciting the CEO pledge on CEO action for diversity and inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let’s turn to our investment activity on page four. We continue to invest in our global platform, with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than three 100 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. In EMEA we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt and began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong and our campus with access to over 700 carriers and ISP continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we were adding capacity in Marseille, as well as Paris. Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world’s population. In Paris, we continue to develop Interxion Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach, was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers, as well as enterprises. In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore’s Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. Finally, in mid-March, we closed on a sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities, while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. Let’s turn to the demand drivers on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverage of secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration for our customers, as they tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence from Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business, with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. With this transition to data driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission critical data analytics, sharing and governance. We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data driven businesses. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let’s turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter, including a $13 million contribution from Interxion. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less total $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL, as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over seven years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter, with strong showing across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. The midst of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus Interxion category, with strengthen in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer’s needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in Inzai, where we’ve assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity, as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. In EEMEA an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider spin it on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our Suburban Chicago campus. A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia Metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded a multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. Turning to our backlog on page nine, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reach another all time high of $307 million. The step up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signage and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average adjusted on eight months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than three years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by to customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions are prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we’re competing for new business with a customer, we -- that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business, as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy tick down to 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn, as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by this same Ashburn churn. As a reminder, our recently acquired Western building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter, but still remain somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecasts was driven by a beat on the topline with an assist from an FX tailwind, as well as operating expense savings, primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later the budget of closing on the non-core European portfolio sale. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially all of the beat flows through to the raise and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter, before wrapping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the non-core European portfolio sale, as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged, as the lion’s share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and reap characterize a portion of Interxion’s OpEx spend as overhead. In terms of our financing plans, we’ve already made great strides this year, with a highly successful $1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at 0.625%, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. Last but certainly not least, let’s turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously mentioned, we’ve closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6 times in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all time high of 5.8 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options, while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In early January, we raised $1 billion to 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low coupon for Digital Realty 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023 and we’ve repaid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 0.625% also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, we extended our weighted average debt maturity up to nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of the page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we’d be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkins: Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about, I guess, customer retention, as well as about new logo generation. As we look at your pending lease expirations out through year end 2022, any kind of update you can give us on which markets might have greatest exposure? And is there a way to characterize how much of that you will consider it to be highly likely to renew or extend their commitments? And then on the kind of on the new business that you’re bringing on, if you think about your sub-megawatts or low single-digit -- megawatt colocation win, any way to characterize how much of that has a high kind of connectivity attach rate to it? And more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe just review initiatives you have underway to enhance productivity in your direct and indirect channels and manage those ongoing relationships? Thanks.
Andy Power: Hey. Thanks, Jon. I will -- maybe I’ll try to tackle some of the number of questions on the beginning and I’ll turn it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just a cut them up in a little bit order here. So I would characterize, going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt of colocation is kind of connectivity rich, I would characterize that is a highly connectivity rich piece of our business. In terms of the numbers of our customers of the 4,000 customers that we have a digital, the lion’s share of the customer count falls in that. They sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin building or where we’ve organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America, I think, we have five markets across Asia-Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky high retention, low churn, as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter-after-quarter and you can see that in the retention table at the back of sup. And the definition didn’t change all that much when we migrated from the work colocation to a sizing definition. I think the first part of your question was called, look at the expiration schedule. I thought I heard a post year in 2022. I’m not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision out that far. I would say, dramatically, we’ve been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our expiration and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018, that was in size of the volume of the expirations, that was in the mix of expirations, in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, telco deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals, I think we’ve done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood and the front view mirror on the expiration schedule. What certainly looks better than what we’ve come through and I think you’ve seen that now, in terms of how our mark-to-market has called is being progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of work through some of the lumpier contracts and you’re going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. So feels like we’re heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule and I didn’t touch -- definitely geographically just by the maturity of our business much were non-U.S. are out, call in EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also call up higher barrier to entry, tough -- high pricing power markets. But I will turn to Corey to hit your -- the last part of your question.
Corey Dyer: Yeah. Hey. Thanks, Andy, and Jon, thanks for the question. I think I kind of captured it and you correct me if I missed it. But you asked a question around channels and how we’re doing there. And then a little bit about with the new logo that we’re getting an increase in interconnect I think are the questions, and, Jonathan, if I missed it, then you can always clarify it later. But I will tell you that really happy with the progress we’re making on channels of our, I will call it, enterprise business, non-scale business, the channel is now about a quarter of the business. So we’re pretty happy with the progress there. And then your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it. We’ve seen an increase in that. It really kind of just comes through when you think through PlatformDIGITAL and how we’re getting many, many more multi-use cases deployment, multi-site deployment, most of those look like network connectivity, as well as in control our hub. And so we’re seeing good progress across those and we’re seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing up a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnections in and they were in the past. Hopefully that answers the question.
Jon Atkins: Yeah. I was -- just given the challenge you brought on from Interxion and then a lot of legacy Equinix people such as yourself that are on Board, just interested in any kind of machine learning, AI, predictive analytics, tools…
Corey Dyer: Oh! Okay. Yes.
Jon Atkins: …are continuing. Yeah. Yeah.
Corey Dyer: No. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. That’s good question. Yeah. I’m pretty familiar with that. And I’ll tell you that, you referenced a few places that some of have been, so we are not going to comment on what they’re doing. But I would tell you that, yes, we do use call it AI and I’ll say target based data set for both our prospects, our customers. And I’ll tell you that we use data and that’s really what the essence of the Data Gravity Index was, it was a -- Data Gravity Index published based on data and what we see in the industry. And it really helped us identify the shift in the infrastructure placement and connectivity that’s required across the full spectrum colocation. And so I feel like we’re doing pretty good across both those Jonathan using AI, using data to make our decision to how we target our customers. So, pretty on top of that, oh, yeah.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. I wanted to touch base on sort of the connectivity piece of the business, looked like there were some particular strengths in your connection this quarter sequentially in particular and just kind of curious if the pacing and the growth is something that’s sustainable, that you potentially got some momentum there or if there was anything in particular that drove it?
Andy Power: Hey. Thanks, Jordan. I would say, all -- in total volume connectivity new signs was up. I think in terms of, call, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signs, in North America was some of the usual, New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I didn’t notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus, as well as our Franklin Park Chicago campus. So not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it’s great to see that enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. An answer to -- partly answer to Jon Atkins question we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis. We don’t have this for all of our new logos, because we’re kind of combining businesses over the last year, but I call the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, there -- they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis, so the new logos are growing post-landing with us. So definitely pleased, and I mean, I think, it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the Board in terms of bringing some critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL bringing to the market and many other elements I think are tied together that’s driving that success.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then maybe just honing in on Northern Virginia, you touched on it there in interconnect -- interconnectivity, but what’s your availability looking like in that market and how -- what are you seeing in terms of customer demand there This year?
Andy Power: Yeah. So, Northern Virginia, Jordan, obviously, you’re aware we have pretty incredible 2020 close to 85 megawatts sold overall. We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily a bad thing, given that the Northern Virginia has been kind of working its way out of the woods for some time now. So we ended the year with our development pathway with 100% preleased. We are now under construction and delivering building are in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. I would say the lion’s share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year. So which I mentioned we already released or pre-released on the last call. So really focusing on some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus, but also we did landed anchor deal, a little chunkier enterprise deal and the building are coming on back -- on the back half of the year, then building on as a large shell that will call it deliver 6 megawatts suites in call it every other month type of fashion. So little tight right now, focused on where we’re place -- pushing customers, but a longer, larger runaway we’re building our company on the back end of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. So, first, I am wondering if your posture or your approach to rental rates and renewals has changed at all in the last 12 months, given the tightening in some of the markets.
Andy Power: I mean, I think, we have a pretty responsive pricing dynamic holistically, Mike. So it’s not just on renewals. We have a call it inventory price book for every type of capacity, for every duration of contract, for every market, for every product that is update on a recurring basis in response to what we see in terms of the supply/demand dynamics in the market. We obviously don’t have certain overlays in terms of customer relationships or in the larger growing customers or newer customers that we kind of make sure we’re responsive to at the same time. We’re certainly not sitting by idly when a market is weaker and we need to respond to that with pricing to be more competitive. And on the other flip side of that coin we’ve had experienced like in Singapore or other markets like Santa Clara or Frankfurt, where we raised rates over time and those rates are impacted our renewals and our new pricing in response to, call it, the overall supply/demand dynamic.
Michael Funk: And then one more if I could, Andy, so on the guidance, I saw the non-core expense add back increased for 2021. I didn’t hear you call that out in the prepared remarks. What was the increase in the non-core?
Andy Power: The increase in the non-core, I believe, we got a whole list of items in our FFO reconciliation that kind of hits the non-core that includes our investment in Megaport is good stock price mark-to-market when that flows through, and that obviously, is in the core up or down to our business. I believe there’s a revaluation on our debt at SMP, given it’s a resilient entity and with the U.S. dollar denominated debt to match the currency of the lot lion’s share of our contracts. And we also have, I think, in this particular quarter, a little bit of a benefit from our PPA settlement that we added back, because we didn’t do that as recurring benefits on core FFO.
Operator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you. And maybe I could go back to Corey, can you talk about where we are on sort of return to normal in terms of the sales process in some of the regions? Are you still able to get the virtual tours and get the connections or do you think there’s still more room to come back to normal here? And then any commentary on the supply chain, I think you did talk a little bit in your disclosures about, generally not seeing huge issues, but in terms of building costs or building -- you’re building up inventory there? Thanks.
Corey Dyer: Andy, you want me to take the enterprise demand question and just date of use and you can just follow on the second half?
Andy Power: Please go ahead.
Corey Dyer: Okay. All right. So, yeah, thanks for the question. I would tell you that we’re getting closer to the state of normal, if that’s what you want to call it. Some of the things are opening up. But we’ve got a lot of ability around doing tours virtually, we’ve found a bunch of different ways to augment the need and take our customers during the pandemic. So I feel like we’re getting close to it. We’re not quite there. That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It’s been strong, broad-based success, still on our platform, Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. We’re looking through some of the more macro trends. Gartner’s got IT spending getting at 6% growth, with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that go into public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and the point of presence and the multi-use cases, as well as multi-markets that we’re going after are going to be there and we’re seeing it continue to sustain. Well, I wouldn’t say that it’s a complete back to normal. We haven’t seen, I guess, in enterprise demand and quite frankly, we think we’ve done a pretty good job adjusting through it with all the ops and FCs and SAs we have important to it [ph]. I think that answer the question, I’m not sure if I did it.
Simon Flannery: Yeah. That’s great. Thank you.
Corey Dyer: Okay, Simon. Okay.
Andy Power: Hey. Simon, can you just repeat the second part of the question to make sure we…
Simon Flannery: Yeah. It was really around the supply chain issues and what you’re seeing in terms of the COVID impacts on your ability to bring on data centers on time, on budget, and any cost issues you might be seeing or inventory issues?
Andy Power: Okay. Great. So let me take the, call it, our digital supply chain, I will let Chris touch on the customer supply chain, because I know that’s been a question out there as well. So, I think, really hats off and kudos to our operational design, construction team and supply chain team for always keeping ahead of this consistently. Obviously, we do all have the benefit of our scale, our global nature, our deep operational expertise. But we’ve not in recent quarters had any, call it, disruption to critical equipment, delays, cost impact and so the team really -- has done a really incredible job of navigating through that. I’m not sure that’s the case for all providers in the data center world, especially smaller stature, but they’ve not been disruption today. And I’d say we’ve -- what we’ve looked at our, call it, 300 megawatts of capacity under development is pretty darn insulated to these any potential inflation shocks and we’re also keeping a keen eye on that. But, Chris, why don’t you hit on the chip piece as well.
Chris Sharp: No. Absolutely not. I echo your sentiment, Andy, the vendor management program that we have in place today, I think, is something that has allowed us to overcome some of the shortcomings of some of the infrastructure within the facilities like breakers, optical infrastructure, things like that. But that’s something that operating on a global basis has been a big benefit digital going forward. But we also stay very close to our customers and really watching if they’re having trouble procuring infrastructure to deploy their architectures into our facility. We haven’t seen a material impact on that as well. I know there’s been a lot of concern around chip shortages and things like that, but again, just to reiterate, not all chips are the same and there’s a lot of variability out there and so have not seen any kind of material impact from customers being able to deploy into the facility. And quite frankly, some of our larger hyperscale customers, they build the entire stack themselves, so they have strict control over their supply chain and so they’ve also not experienced any slowdown in being able to deploy the massive amount of infrastructure required for their deployments as well.
Simon Flannery: Thanks. Thank you. Very helpful.
Operator: Our next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good evening. So when I look at the updated guidance, it seems like the only major change there really is the FX assumption around the pound. So is it fair to assume guidance is going up simply because of changes in FX assumptions or is there something also kind of operationally there’s an improvement that that should also be signaled through the guidance increase?
Andy Power: Hey. Thanks, Tayo. The -- I mean the sterling is especially today a much more smaller piece of our business, pro forma for some of our acquisitions over the last year. So while FX did contribute to our outperformance in the first quarter, and obviously, that flows through the guidance, I would not say that was the only thing that drove our increase in guidance. We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was called in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We’ve essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA, the G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you’re mapping from Interxion integrations. And then we also kind of made sure that showed that that flowed through to the bottomline with, call it, an increase at the midpoint of the range, up, I think, $0.075, so 5% year-over-year growth and not all due to FX, it was due to some of the operational outperformance. Not all of our beat flowed through, because some of it was OPEX delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the year, but definitely pleased with the result and which, I would say, gave us the confidence to raise here in the first quarter, which is little, I don’t think I can recall last time we did that in my now six years in Digital, but definitely pleased with the progress.
Omotayo Okusanya: Is that way to separate the effect of those things, the rate some of the carriers do?
Andy Power: Is -- I’m sorry, is there a way to separate those things away from the --
Omotayo Okusanya: The impacts of the two things of actual operational improvement versus FX in the guidance range the way some of your peers do if you can actually tell what’s guiding…
Andy Power: I would…
Omotayo Okusanya: … what?
Andy Power: We used to have a constant currency disclosure at the bottom here. I’m not sure -- I don’t think we have that anymore. I mean I would ballpark the $0.075, maybe $0.03 from FX.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. First, maybe on bookings, can you talk about some of the strengths seen in Asia-Pac and what drove the uptick in bookings during the quarter? And then just on maybe a little bit more of a housekeeping item, margins in the quarter were pretty solid, I think they were the highest since you closed the Interxion deal, but we also saw tenant reimbursements pick up. And so I’m just wondering what was behind the pickup in utilities reimbursements, was that tied to the winter storm in Texas? And then maybe what drove some of the offsetting cost benefits that helped drive EBITDA margins as high as they were? Thanks.
Andy Power: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So maybe I’ll try to take in reverse order and I’m going to, I think, probably bring in Corey here when we circle back to APAC, but just to the housekeeping piece. A little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I’ve guided you to, call it, to our full-year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. I literally kind of personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running and our operations team sprung it in action with like an hour’s notice and kind of really saved that CTO’s day. But -- so on the power front, power did increase unusually given the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement, because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. In terms of APAC, I mean, I’ll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We’re now live with, I believe, five, almost six colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I’m missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one top CSP signed with us both in Osaka and Melbourne. We also had subsequent accord and anchor customers in Inzai in Tokyo. And then Singapore, maybe I’ll let Corey kind of talk to some of the success we saw in Singapore.
Corey Dyer: Yes, Andy. I would just add, you hit most of the data points I was thinking through in the response. Really broad-based success across the portfolio is what I would say. AP was really successful as well. You mentioned it in your prepared remarks, diversified e-commerce customers that’s been doing a lot of business with us and we really are happy with that. But I would also tell you that our new logos coming out of that region has tripled in the last year. We’re really happy with the team. It’s where most of our organic growth as far as the sales team that we’re putting out there in place. So we’re really happy with it. But I wouldn’t get focused just on AP. I think about the broad-based platform success we’re having across all the regions. I think our largest export region this last quarter was EMEA. So we’re really excited about just kind of broad-based successful we are, and we think there’s a ton of opportunity in Asia Pacific, and, yes, in Singapore, we were pretty successful selling through that large building there that we have. Andy, was there any other data point I missed? I think we hit most of them.
Andy Power: No. I think you got it. Thanks.
Corey Dyer: Okay. Thanks.
Matt Niknam: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Looking at your table, it looks like Europe seemed to have sort of taken a breather this quarter with leasing down and especially in the greater than 1 megawatt category. Has anything changed there, I mean, I know you talked about a pretty robust pipeline? But maybe some commentary around that, just to understand where the opportunities are and what drove this decline and if there’s anything else you can comment on?
Andy Power: Thanks, Erik. So, I mean, really, Europe or EMEA just really came off of a blowout the quarter prior. I still think I was pretty pressed with the results and thought a really healthy quarter. On the larger footprint side, we had four different CSPs sign across three different markets, Frankfurt, two in Zurich, one in Amsterdam. So definitely pleased with the diversity of demand and from a customer energy offer standpoint. On the enterprise customer standpoint, within the flap, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, certainly stood out this quarter in terms of new signings. And within the non-flap, Marseille, Stockholm, and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets. So -- I -- and as you can see on our development table, we’ve been continuing to increase our footprint of development and building out larger parcels in EMEA on our highly connected campuses there. So I don’t -- I’m still pretty really positive about the growth in Europe.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just on the releasing spreads, the greater than one megawatt. How does that 11.3% decline on a cash basis? How does that compare on a historical basis? I know this is all dependent on customers and mix and there’s a few other things? But can you talk about that 11.3% in the context of what is -- what you’ve seen in the past?
Andy Power: Yeah. It’s -- that’s just a statistic when you slice it down to a quarterly basis and depending on what mix actually gets renewed in that quarter, because it’s not just what actually expires, customers will renew quarters or even years earlier sometimes. In particular, there was two specific customers, one top-five CSP, another enterprise customer that did, call it, fairly chunky renewals in combination with new signings. The CSP was a multi-market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in one particular North American market. So we thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us. I don’t -- I mean, that bounces around and we’ve had worse than that in a given quarter and we’ve had much better than that in a given quarter, and I still -- as you saw we confirm that guidance on the mark-to-market. So we don’t think that’s a truly bad omen or anything like that. And as I mentioned, I think in response to John Atkins’ question on the front part of the call, definitely feel like we’re moving toward better and better territory and expirations based on the product mix and the geography.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi. Thank you. I want to go back to slide number 10 and also back to the 11.3% that we’re looking at for the greater than one megawatt. Now, I guess, if we go back to about a year ago, you guys are working through a very large vintage of leases and we were kind of -- we were informed that they would be high single-digit or double-digit negative roll down there. But are we pretty much done with the majority of those leases or could we expect a bit more negative rates at least at this magnitude in other quarters in 2021?
Andy Power: Yes. Sam, kind of consistent with my response to Erik’s question, being able to predict with accuracy, the quarterly blend to that precision is pretty challenging, because it’s really out of our control when the customer inks a renewal. But I think I would agree with your outset statement, we started out 2020 with an outlook of net -- call it mid-to-high single-digit negative cash mark-to-markets overall and as we worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year. If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, a cash market across all the products, it’s kind of right in line, even, overall, it’s kind of right in line with the language we’ve described here. So, again, I can’t promise you every single quarter is going to be positive. But I do believe, based on our understanding of the expiration of the contracts and the supply/demand market dynamics that we’re heading into better territory on those mark to markets.
Sami Badri: Got it. The other thing is on the zero to 1 megawatt range for the 1.6%. In that zero to 1 megawatt and in those releasing spreads, could you give us an idea on customer mix in there in terms of how much of that is enterprise versus cloud versus other?
Andy Power: Sure. In that zero to 1 megawatt, some of the chunkier deals were -- and those are kind of no particular order. In the New York Metro area, there was a fiber-oriented customer and also a content-oriented customer. In London, there was a top-five cloud service provider. In Singapore, there was a multinational financial services company. In Northern Virginia, there was an ad marketplace type business.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Brendan Lynch on for Tim. Your slide deck indicates you’ve announced commitments to reduce direct emissions by 68% and indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. Can you -- first I’ve seen those numbers or any specific targets announced, can you provide some color on your execution strategy around that and what it means in practical terms for your operations?
Bill Stein: Sure. This is Bill. We -- as you noted, we’ve established carbon reduction targets in conjunction with the science based targets initiative. And in connection with that, we’ve committed to reducing direct admissions by 68% by 2030 and committed to reducing indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. As you also are probably aware, we lead the data center category and the REIT industry and green bond issuance. We’ve issued $5.6 billion of green bonds since 2015. We also lead the data center industry in green building certifications. We have 796 megawatts of green building certifications. And we also have 556 megawatts of renewable energy that’s contracted, which, of course, contributes to the direct admissions reduction and that includes 154 megawatts in two renewable projects in Texas. For the second year in a row, we’ve been voted the ENERGY STAR partner of the year and for the fourth consecutive year, we’ve been voted NAREIT leader in the Light Award for the data center category and NAREITs only had that leader in the Light Award for data centers for four years. So we’re batting 1,000 right now.
Brendan Lynch: Yeah. That’s great color, and clearly, you’re making some progress there. How does that affect your negotiations to the extent that it does with customers and how are they responding to these initiatives?
Bill Stein: The customers -- many of these customers share the same corporate values that we do with respect to ESG and we’re all about reducing our carbon footprint. So I’d say we’re totally in sync with what our customers’ long-term goals are in this area.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Looking at the rent schedule, it looks like about 35% of the rent comes from 1 megawatt and below business. And I’m just curious, given all the comments that you shared on the call today in terms of the financial performance of these rents. Is it a strategic priority within digital to continue to lift this percentage of mix that comes from the 1 megawatt or below leases?
Andy Power: Thanks, Mike. I mean, maybe Corey and I can tag team this for a second. I mean our strategy is to be the leading global provider dedicated full customer spectrum from the service providers, all of the hyperscalers to the enterprise customer. I think we’ve certainly demonstrated a pretty solid and consistent track record on the first leg of that stool with your, call it, top five CSP having 20, 25, 30 different locations with us on average, depending on the specific name. And that value prop of our land and expand and future proof their runway for growth, that operational expertise to the highest demands. Certainly proud of that, and you’ve seen the success in our results. But I think going after and supporting the enterprise is a place we’ve been investing in just as much over the last several years on a multifaceted front. Certainly in terms of the critical pieces of the business we’ve acquired, putting the puzzle pieces together of the rightmost connectivity rich destinations. But also on many of the things both Chris and Corey have been, call it, driving here for digital for some time. So I’ll let them speak to that a little bit as well.
Corey Dyer: Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Right on to that. You think through just the tools we were talking earlier about how we use data to target. So we’re moving that forward as well down that path, if you’re asking about kind of how we’re going after the market if we’re going after that part of the business. As far as the demand that we have going forward, I’m sorry, if I missed some of the question, but I think that was a sales funnel question as opposed to just how we were targeting it. Did I get it all? I’m hearing background noise, sorry, guys. And Michael, can you repeat the second part of the question, I just want to make sure I’m getting it right.
Michael Rollins: Yeah. So the question is just how much of a strategic priority is it for digital to increase the revenue contribution from the one megawatt and below business?
Corey Dyer: Oh! I’m sorry. I’ve got it. Yeah. I am sorry…
Michael Rollins: Just given the financial nature and performance of this type of business versus the larger scale business that you have.
Corey Dyer: I guess I would tell you that we’re going to try to increase both of them. We’re not going to win every customer without discerning between them. But our plan is to continue to grow the enterprise and drive that. I think that will move that mix a little bit naturally, but it’s not going to be at the expense of the CSPs. We’re going to go continue to partner with CSPs, continue to partner with online customers, anybody that’s in e-commerce, AI some of the high-performance computing. So we’re going to continue to grow it everywhere as long as it adds to the value of PlatformDIGITAL and is helpful for us. So I just don’t want you to think that we’re only trying to raise one without the other. We’re going to try to raise that enterprise business may be faster than others to help us with that mix, but we’re going to win everything. Thanks.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today’s call. I’d like to now turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Matt. I’d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we understand our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we were honored to be named the EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year for the second year in a row. Two, we continue to enhance the value of our global platform, calling non-core assets and extending connectivity solutions. Three, we delivered very solid current period financial results, beating expectations and raising our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising attractively priced long-term debt, recycling capital and using proceeds to hire -- to retire high coupon debt and preferred equity. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. And as we approach a post-pandemic environment here in the United States, I’d like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world running. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-12 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We delivered high-quality quarterly bookings in terms of total volume as well as the product mix, geographic split and the number of new logos landing on PlatformDIGITAL. We extended our global platform entering Greece with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe and securing customer growth in existing markets around the world with key land purchases and new builds. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven by operational outperformance. Finally, we further strengthened the balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high-coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
William Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin Building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA, while trimming non-core assets in North America. We delivered record bookings for the full-year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic. Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings. The first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our Cross Connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL. We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well-positioned to serve as their partner of choice. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030 in line with a 1.5 degree climate change scenario. We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5 degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets. In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year, and are expected to remain carbon-neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In mid-December, we were honored to receive NAREIT’s Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond, extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB’s green bond principles, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion, including that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as one of four company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, NAREIT recently instituted a dividends through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing, along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other under-represented groups and REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry. We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO Pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community, to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics.  Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industries future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings and existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific. In early November, we acquired Lamda Hellix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the regions digital transformation. In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center adjacent to the two existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system. We also broke ground on a new data center in Zürich, where we have seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Zürich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also acquired a land parcel within one kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna and halfway around the globe in Sydney, we are under contract to acquire two parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We build a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. I am proud of what we've accomplished today and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and so the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers, while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets. The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion and investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline, acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth. Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the Data Gravity Index, which measures, quantifies and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data-creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a by-product of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers’ deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of Data Gravity. According to the market intelligence firm IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of IT leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data and global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements.  We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform.  Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator award, recognizing PlatformDIGITAL for providing an innovative global platform enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent modular fashion and addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of one megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience. In New York, the Digital Realty’s teams’ deep understanding of a global retailers growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider as they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace. A rapidly growing gaming platform experienced their hedge to rewire their network and optimized data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. In Singapore, two leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence, while a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region. Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step up from $229 million last quarter, reflect $78 million of commencements during the fourth quarter offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over three years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below one megawatt. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1% and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below one megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases in line with our long-term historical average. In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected. As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term, fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full-year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full-year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation in interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect that EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021. As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction. Although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies. We've already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at five eights in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a nickel in the first quarter, then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options or minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated to 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through the combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020. In mid-October, we redeemed £300 million or 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high-coupon series G preferred at [5.78%]. In early January, we raised a 1 billion of 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low-coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023. And we paid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%, and little over half our debt is euro denominated reflecting the growth of our global platform post-Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities, and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we would be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. So the first question regards - is regarding leasing and you talked about logo capture, but I wondered of your largest kind of multi-megawatt deals, any kind of highlights by geography or type of company? And then the second question kind of gets to M&A and divestitures and new market entry and kind of any – any kind of a highlights to call out in terms of your appetite for any of those types of projects heading into 2021?
Andrew Power: Hey. Thanks, Jon. I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. So I'm very pleased with the results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shine through in both categories, not only the less than a megawatt in interconnection, but also on the scale or hyperscale plus. If you do a quick kind of run through the regions, EMEA, first time more than 50% of the signings, it was very diverse. There were six different markets across the EMEA that did a north of a megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille and two others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsborough, and the cast of characters for all these are the combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, B2C hyperscalers as well. And then last but not least, I'm pleased with the results in both Brazil and we signed our second customer in Santiago, Chile, in the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top three CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros. And I'll turn it over to Greg to pick up on the M&A piece.
Jonathan Atkin: Actually just continuing on that, as you look at the pipeline into 2021, whether you, Andy or Corey would want to comment, but is there any kind of change in procurement activity or just dialogue with your customers that gives you particular confidence around repeating some of this recent momentum?
Andrew Power: I’ll toss that to Corey.
Corey Dyer: Hey, Jonathan, this is Corey. I appreciate it. Just broadly on the sales funnel, I'll just tell you that we're happy with the momentum and the success we had in 2020. We see that continuing. I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it. And then regarding the industries, I think you might ask about those that are work that are taking advantage of the current work from home are doing more and more quickly with us. And so we're happy about that and how we're supporting them. And then also we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic, cloud, digital media, et cetera. And then those that are being kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, standalone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the two groups. So real happy with the funnel. Hand it back to you – over to Greg, sorry. Go ahead, Greg.
Greg Wright: Why don't I take it? Okay. Thanks, Corey. Hey Jon. Hope you're well. Let me – I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, then we can talk about the divestures, which are somewhat related. Like I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, like we remain focused on integrating Interxion, while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions as we would call them like Altus IT in Croatia and Lamda Hellix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capital is coming to the space. But we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell non-core assets and select non-core markets. Today, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality standalone assets. That really just are not part of our Connected Campus strategy. We're about $1.5 billion through the multi-year guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it’s likely that we are going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these assets sales that will recycle their capital will provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focused deals that are strategic, as both Croatia and Greece where there are highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region. And that's really the way we look at it and we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these two to the extent we can.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Yes. Thank you all for the questions. A few, if I could. First, I noticed the GAAP base rent per square foot step down across the regions quarter-over-quarter. Can you comment on that?
Andrew Power: Hey, Michael. So I think there's a few - two items to note in there in particular. And I think you're mostly talking about the greater than megawatt because I thought we had pretty strong pricing power on a less than a megawatt category, more enterprise network workloads landing in those sites. On the greater than a megawatt piece, it's a little bit of apples and oranges in comparing each market quarter-over-quarter. You’re probably better off going back to the second quarter in terms of more of an apples-to-apples comparison volume. And then in the fourth quarter, we had a particular deal structure that make that skew that stat lower in terms of reported results. You may recall a year or two ago in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suite type project, where we built a rather large 36 megawatts Shell for a customer that was paying us for that Shell on a long-term lease. And then we dropped down and built out suites in six megawatt or still increments over time. So as those – as the takedowns of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the Shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. Strategically, I mean, it's great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have, really given a customer the runway that they desire and the timing flexibility and digital with it scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those types of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those types of customers.
Michael Funk: And then Andy, on the FFO growth bridge you provided, maybe how it actually quantify the impact from the potential sales, the $600 million to $1 billion. Can you quantify that for us?
Andrew Power: Yes. So we reiterated really the same quantity of capital cycle for this year as last year. We feel good near-term on the lower end of that range. It's a contributor to the, call it, 4Q to 1Q, bridging the quarterly rhythm of core FFO. Just kind of rough math. If we kind of just hit the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we are using for the last outright sale. We did call it a mid to low-six cap. You call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be as high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use the appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near-term or in lieu of really equity, I would call it a ballpark in 50 to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth that is.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hey guys. Thank you. [Technical Difficulties] but has not happened yet. I just want to clarify. And then secondly, more related to hyperscale in the U.S., if someone could just give an update on the pricing competitive backdrop you're seeing within hyperscale and whether deals are getting any more or less competitive than they've been in the past? Thanks.
Andrew Power: Sure. So two elements. First on your base. We definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational-related just commencing revenue faster, but some of it was out of our control and FX was a tailwind. As you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench into 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples to oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. The answer to your question on the dispositions, other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a – at a low range of $600 million to high range of $1 billion, and we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. Just to remind you Matt and then the broader audience, the dilution or near-term, we think, a) is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling non-core slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximate 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off outperformance at the last and back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out.
Matthew Niknam: Got it. And on the hyperscale?
Andrew Power: Thank you for reminding me the first question. Matt, your question was about hyperscale pricing and the like.
Matthew Niknam: Yes. Pricing and competitive nature because we've heard maybe some anecdote thing, it was maybe on the margin. Things were beginning to get a little bit better. But I'm just curious to get your take in terms of what you've seen.
Andrew Power: Yes. I think the – a couple of data points that I would say point to our continued confidence in the opportunity set and really differentiated offering that I think allows us to outshine our competitors, especially any fledging, we're newer competitors. One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now, 49 metros, six continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter, now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent pre-leased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. I'm not saying or blushing off that there is – some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to – even in a challenged market like Ashburn do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers in particular. And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and interconnection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition. Certainly tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfort, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Good afternoon. Andy could you just elaborate on the downtime on vacancy a little bit that sort of baked into the sequential nickel decline you're pointing to on Page 13. I'm not sure if that factored into the 1.3% churn you saw in the fourth quarter, or if that's sort of hitting elsewhere?
Andrew Power: Yes. I would say that the fourth quarter actually – and then I'll get to the first part of your question, Jordan. The fourth quarter actually was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention and potentially called in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than a megawatt. The impact that we see hitting 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021 really goes back to what I mentioned in our call a quarter ago. We ended the year with our largest amount of non-retained capacity in any given market, just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the first of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to – we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already released to a new customer. They haven't commenced yet, but they've signed for it, 2.3 megawatts, we're likely to take another 2.3 megawatts suite and convert that to productized colocation given the success of our offering in the market. And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy. And it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had such success in Ashburn. Despite the broader market challenges is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the July 1. So really it's that downtime until we get the new customers and new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter.
Jordan Sadler: And what's the biggest chunk of the 17-meg. You mentioned 2.3 is already been re-leased. They're not contiguous, but biggest contiguous chunk. And then just back to the $0.05. Is that – the bulk of that coming from this departure? And how will this hit 1Q, maybe you talk about 1Q and 2021 churn guidance overall?
Andrew Power: So let me try to unpack a few there. So the biggest hall is the 2.3 megawatts, but there's numerous contiguous halls. So if we wanted to – if a customer wanted to have numerous contiguous halls, which certain customers value that. I think we can string six or so of those together. I'm sorry that can't be right. I'm looking at the wrong schedule here. We're going to – we can string, I think, three of those together of contiguous data halls, but each POD is roughly a 2.3 POD. That is the largest driver to the $0.05, in terms of quarter-over-quarter step down. And then Jordan could you just remind me the second part or the third part of your question there.
Jordan Sadler: Just churn. So what do you think if churn was 1.3 in 4Q, what would it be in 1Q and then just maybe full-year expectation while we're at it?
Andrew Power: So that's a greater than a megawatt capacity churn, or less than a megawatt capacity churn looks like it's going to be basically in line. And I don't have the implied first quarter churn. I think the 80s steps down on a full-year basis to call it like 69% for the full portfolio in the greater than a megawatt territory. But you can use 17 megawatts as a proxy, and you can see our quantities of expirations. I don't have all the ingredients to give you the exact math on the first quarter measurement right here.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Petersen: Great, thanks. Just a couple from me. So the recurring CapEx and the fourth quarter looks a little elevated. I wonder if there's just anything that we should be thinking about there and how it will trend in the next year on a quarterly basis.
Andrew Power: Yes. Not just for recurring CapEx, but I would say some of the OpEx as well. You're seeing some of the COVID fluctuations. If you look at the – I think it's scheduled $28 million recurring CapEx step down to – as low as $34 million in the first quarter of 2020, $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, then $53 million and $83 million. So we did have a little bit of a catch-up period in terms of call it timing. As you can see, Jon, our guidance for the current CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same numbers as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we have a little bit of fourth quarter catch-up in there. Just the only major items we had – we had some refresh capital and some second generation space and I think we’re converting to colocation, when a [PEB or TKM] customer had exited. So that kind of hits – that's not first-generation so it hits through the recurring CapEx. I think that's a product of, call it, maturation of our portfolio and customer to new types of customers in different shapes and forms. But I wouldn't – you can't just analyze that as next year. You've got look to our guidance table for more appropriate view for the full-year 2021.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay. All right. And then I kind of ask about market rents. I mean, do you guys have a sense maybe if we just think about your greater than one megawatt tenant. Do you have a sense of where the mark-to-market is on in place rents versus market rents? And then, I know you talked about your leasing spreads being relatively flat this year. But I mean, based off the market dynamics that you're seeing, what are your expectations for rent growth over this year and over the next few years? Are we to a point where we can start to see rents start to grow again?
Andrew Power: I think, there's a couple relevant data points to look at that. Obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity both in the fourth quarter as a trajectory throughout the year. And we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus one megawatt cash renewal spreads in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and shining through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. We have not – our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark-to-markets, but, I know we used the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place both in volume mix and mark-to-market relative to leasing history. You called out particularly the greater the megawatt category, which is called 7.5-ish percent of our expirations down from a high, call it over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizeable part component from not only Santa Clara, our titers U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contracts. And then last but not least just looking at the new signings because more of a forward indicator of what to come, by and large in the greater than megawatt category I saw – we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And I would – as I say strengths in Americas were, call it New York, Chicago, excuse me, I’m looking at the wrong schedule. In the greater than a megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland. Again, it goes back to that structure I mentioned previously where the customers taking down shells at pre-committed rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and a desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater than megawatt plus category for Zurich, and Marseille were particular standout markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star. And I think you're going to see that continue into 2021. And that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizeable amount of megawatt plus activity as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Curious, probably two things if I could. The first is if we turn to Page 25 of the supplemental, you provide the development yield by region that you're expecting. And just curious for your take on the movement over the last few quarters where it seems like North America has moved up a little bit. EMEA is down a little bit. Asia-Pac near the level on this page. And where do you see that going over the next couple of years based on the activity and the demand in the pipeline? And just separately, curious to go back to one of the comments, I think Bill made it at the beginning of the call, describing that some of the larger customers are choosing a select number of global data center partners. And curious just on that theme, are you seeing a greater percentage of your large customers embraced multiple providers? Or are you seeing more of a winner-take-all evolution where one data center provider could take the disproportionate share of business from some of these customers? Thanks.
Andrew Power: I’m going to give Bill the honors to answer the second part of the question first, and then I'll come back and do the numbers questions on development cycle on Page 26.
William Stein: Yes. Thanks for the question. We're definitely seeing a shrinking of the number of participants in the business. I think that clearly plays to our strengths, but I think that COVID in particular has demonstrated the importance of having a very credible counterparty on the other end of these partnerships and we’ve received excellent feedback from our partners, particularly among the hyperscalers about our procedures around not just COVID, but some of the other social unrest that has occurred in the last several quarters.
Andrew Power: And then Michael on your second question, I mean, I think there's a few observations and some of this is repetitive. The development pipeline, one, you're missing it from here because it's a unconsolidated self-managed joint venture is not on the schedule. But we've seen tremendous activity in Latin America, including a continued growth in Brazil. Not only our first, but second customer in San Diego, Chile and probably expect us to experience the same in terms of our second customers landing into New Mexico City. On this schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The pre-leasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. If you go market-by-market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity. That was 100% pre-leased in Ashburn and the shell which will show up with megawatts on the schedule. I think in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here, but I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattle off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently was across six different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online. And I think the same phenomenon is going to happen. Ours continue to happen in the APAC region as well.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. The first question is on interconnection. You reported the interconnection and the backlog. But can you just give us some color in terms of how that backlog is mapping the respective region? That's the first one. And then the second one is, may Bill, Andy, anyone can really address this. Has digital adopted maybe a different philosophy on speculative construction versus only building with pre-leases in hand? Has kind of the playbook changed a little bit just given the very rapid and high volume leasing that tends to come pretty big cycles that we've seen as the strategy kind of changed a little bit? And I'll leave it at that.
Andrew Power: Bill, do you want to – again, we'll try to do the same format. You take the second question first on strategy and then I can go back to the interconnection details.
William Stein: Sure. So I would say that the strategy today is we don't really go into any of these new markets without a pre-lease in hand, without an anchor. So that's what we've done in Chile. That's what we've done in Mexico. Now we did buy existing businesses, obviously in Croatia and Greece, so that's different. But in general, I think we're looking for one of our good customers that it may – and probably more than one to tell, so they really want us to, to go into that market, and then [indiscernible] an anchor lease with us. As far as existing markets are concerned, those are used. Those are almost always expansions with existing customers. And that business to be quite Candace is a fast and furious. In some instances I would say the challenge is just keeping up with the demand in existing markets with particularly the hyperscalers.
Andrew Power: And then Sami on your question on interconnection. So quite pleased with the interconnection signing contribution. Yes, it's stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter and 3Q was quite outsized winter in terms of interconnection signings. The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we experienced in the past. Regionally some of the start, I would say the EMEA region, it was definitely a standout in this category not just in the fourth quarter, but on the full-year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was called up into the double-digits type growth trajectory. I also – I know you quite asked this question, I also really look at these things part and parcel with the less than a megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers, day one and certainly post-landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category of a really strong 3Q. We put a record [indiscernible] the interconnection and less than a megawatt or colocation type signings category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka and Singapore and Hong Kong and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well regionally. So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than a megawatt category.
Sami Badri: All right. Thank you, Bill and Andy. And actually just one quick follow-up and this is pertaining mainly to Europe. And since you guys have now kind of integrated Interxion and you've looked at some of the pricing in each of the respective market. Do you expect the cadence or at least the stabilization of pricing or I mean, maybe that's the wrong way to phrase it? The right way to phrase it is marking it up slightly, right, to reflect pricing that looks more comparable to U.S. market. You guys see – the rate at which you guys are increasing, is that starting to moderate or is pricing relatively flat and consistent and not really changing or evolving much in Europe? I just want to understand kind of like what's going on from a local type of pricing perspective. And I think I'm mainly referring to the zero to one megawatt type leases specifically.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Sami. That was a very elegant way of asking, if you're going to increase cross-sell prices in Europe, I think. But I'm going to pass this over to Chris in a second. But I think we're very focused on delivering as much value to our customers in terms of increased performance, increased security, increased efficiency, and do that in a global platform offering here in PlatformDIGITAL. So it's not a episodic one market, has to match another market. We're very attuned to the customer needs and also supply demand nature in each market. But maybe Chris, do you want to talk to – touch a little bit about our product roadmap and how pricing relates to that?
Christopher Sharp: Absolutely. I appreciate it, Sami. Definitely we look at driving value to our customers through our global interconnected platform, which Bill stated in his prepared remarks, but double our Cross Connect count in 2020 is pretty impressive. And particularly to EMEA, we’re constantly watching exactly how our communities of interest have really grown there with network dense highly connected assets as a part of PlatformDIGITAL, but we absolutely align our Cross Connect pricing based on the market dynamics within EMEA. And we'll continually evolve our platform to ensure that pricing is aligned with the value that we see these communities of interest continually getting out of the platform. But one of the things that we're very happy about is we continually see the attach rate within each of these markets continually increasing and it's core to our platform going forward, that we removed complexity from the customers so they can get access to that value in a more simplistic fashion. So you'll see that play out over the coming year and exactly how we achieved that. But it's something that we're constantly watching and making sure that the customers are getting the true value that they need in a very simplistic fashion.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.
William Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the fourth quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we've further strengthened our connections with our customers, meeting more of their needs beyond the U.S. and reaching a much broader set of enterprise customers with our enhanced colocation and interconnection product offerings. We delivered extremely solid current period financial results, delivering full-year FFO per share that was nearly 4% above our initial guidance. We extended our global platform, providing customers with a gateway into Southeastern Europe and runway for growth around the world with strategic land purchases and new development starts. And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, extending our average duration while further ratcheting down our average cost of debt by locking in attractive pricing on long-term capital and retiring high-coupon debt and preferred equity. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility rules who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty’s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today’s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. We built upon the recent momentum in our business, landing a record number of new logos across broad and robust bookings that were well diversified by customer type and geographic region. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share $0.05 ahead of consensus and we raised our outlook for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share for the second time this year. We extended our global platform, entering Croatia with the acquisition of Altus IT and securing customer growth in existing markets across EMEA, with key land purchases and new builds. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet, raising over $2 billion of long-term capital and retiring nearly $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. And despite the pandemic, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with nearly 60% of third quarter bookings outside North America and we landed a record 130 new logos from around the world. Bookings were also well diversified by customer type, with enterprise co-location and interconnection accounting for nearly half the total. This robust and diverse business mix demonstrates the power of our global platform and further validates our strategic vision of being the only global provider dedicated to the full customer spectrum. Let’s turn to our health and safety measures on Page 3. We remain focused on keeping our employees, customers and partners safe during this pandemic. We remained fully operational across our 284 data centers and we continue to support our customers’ growth by bringing additional capacity online, while expanding our global platform. We have implemented enhanced safety protocols, such as requiring mass, social distancing, engaging specialty cleaning services, and maintaining rotational 24/7 staff coverage by leaning on local personnel. As the pandemic continues, we are seeing signs of permanent adjustments that are likely to be long-term tailwinds for our business. More enterprises are embracing a distributed workforce with our growing work-from-home component, while our recent Gartner survey of nearly 2,000 CIOs around the world found that accelerating digital innovation and leveraging emerging technologies are key priorities during the pandemic. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles who continue to come into work everyday at our facilities around the world. They make possible the service and support we provide our customers. Thank you to the terrific onsite Digital Realty team. Let’s turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 4. In April, we reached a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In late August, we further expanded our renewable energy capacity in Texas by sourcing approximately 65 megawatts of solar power. Once the solar project is fully operational by mid-2021, our entire Dallas portfolio will be powered by 70% renewable energy. We completed our first wind power transaction in 2016. And we have since gone on to contract 240 megawatts of wind and solar energy in Texas. We remain committed to manage our environmental impact, optimizing our use of energy and natural resources, serving a social purpose and delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let’s turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continued to expand our global platform with a small, but highly strategic acquisition in Southeastern Europe, along with land purchases and groundbreakings in existing markets across the continent. In early September, we announced that we had acquired Altus IT, the leading carrier-neutral data center provider in Croatia, expanding our connectivity footprint into the Balkans and Eastern Europe and establishing a gateway to Southeastern Europe, through access to one of the most interconnected data centers in the region. This transaction was also a prime example of how seamlessly the classic Interxion and classic Digital Realty teams are working together. In Zurich, we are breaking ground on a new data center, two of our five biggest deals during the third quarter landed in Zurich and the expansion of our campus will provide runway for customer growth as the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also recently acquired land parcels within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna as well as Madrid. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. In early July, we announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, our data center in Marseille. Interxion’s Marseille campus is one of the world’s leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille, including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments, along with local as well as global enterprises. Finally, in mid-July, we announced that we acquired the freehold to the land under Interxion’s 10-hour Landstraße campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of Interxion’s existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. Let’s turn to Page 6 for an update on the Interxion integration. As you have heard me say before, integration is our top priority for 2020 and we continue to make solid progress despite the pandemic. Both teams have risen to the occasion and have come together to continue to serve our customers’ needs throughout this crisis. It is great to see this collaboration. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but both sales engines are working well together and we have begun to realize some of the cross-selling opportunities we envisioned when contemplating this transaction. We remain on track to meet our synergy targets and underwriting budgets. Title retention is also running ahead of plan at over 95% with no loss of key personnel. Along those lines, as we announced when we first broke the news of our combination with Interxion 1 year ago today. Early next year, David Ruberg will be transitioning within Digital Realty from his day-to-day responsibilities as Chief Executive EMEA and will be moving into a global strategic advisor role. In this capacity, David will be responsible for the development and oversight of our corporate strategy, including the company’s effort to organize and execute a program to identify and develop High Value Communities ventures across our global platform. David plans to remain on the Board of Directors of our Dutch holding company and he will continue to play a leadership role on certain of our key global customer accounts, bringing to bear his longstanding relationships and thought leadership in addition to supporting our team on new market and product development, as recently demonstrated in Eastern Europe. Upon David’s transition, legacy Digital MD, EMEA, Jeff Tapley and legacy Interxion MD, [indiscernible], will continue to oversee the company’s EMEA business. I would like to thank David for his tremendous contributions and his successful efforts to integrate our businesses. We look forward to benefiting from his strategic insights for years to come. Let’s turn to demand drivers on Page 7. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As a leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. Our customers are solving some of the most complex infrastructure connectivity and workload use cases across network peering hyperscale, low latency, high-performance computing, big data and artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen a growing trend of leading multinational enterprises deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints across multiple global sites. We have conducted research, build a global database and devise a method to measure, quantify and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on IT infrastructure. We have recently published our findings as the Data Gravity Index, a report designed to assist both enterprise and service provider customers as they shift their infrastructure strategies to address challenges presented by Data Gravity. Our global data center platform is uniquely positioned to help customers address the Data Gravity challenges. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let’s pick up here on Page 9. As Bill mentioned in his comments, the Interxion integration is coming along on schedule and we are seeing the power of the combined organization with more than 280 data centers in 48 metros across 23 countries on six continents. The power of the global platform is on full display for our installed base of 4,000 global customers and growing. Let’s turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed total bookings of $89 million, including a $14 million contribution from interconnection, which along with the $29 million of network and enterprise-oriented deals of a megawatt or less accounted for a record contribution of nearly half our total bookings. The weighted average lease term was over 6 years. We landed a record 130 new logos during the third quarter, including 40 sourced by Interxion, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. Activity was well balanced across all three regions, with the Americas and EMEA each contributing about 40% of total bookings, while Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly 20%. Singapore was the star in Asia-Pacific, while Zurich, Frankfurt and Marseille were staying out today in EMEA. In the Americas, we again experienced strength in the New York metro area as well as Chicago and Toronto. In Northern Virginia, where we have leased more than 90 megawatts of the previous 9 months, we signed just over 2 million GAAP during the third quarter. As our active development pipeline remains 100% pre-leased while our in-service portfolio remains the only 94% leased. We do expect to get back to 17 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in Ashburn at the end of this year. And together with the existing vacancy within our in-service portfolio, this will give us a total of 40 megawatts of available inventory to meet demand and support customer growth for the next several quarters until we are able to bring additional capacity online around the middle of next year. Although we aren’t entirely out of the competitive woods just yet, we remain very well-positioned to continue to hit above our weight given the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected Ashburn campuses, and finally, our ability to future proof our customers’ growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. In terms of specific lengths during the quarter and around the world, in Marseille, we won a significant connectivity deal with PCCW to land the PC subsea cable at our MRS2 data center. This is a higher strategic deal as it enables our customers to directly access this 12,000 kilometer high capacity cable that will provide the shortest and most direct subsea data route from North Asia to Europe. In Hong Kong, we are excited to support a Fortune 500 multinational professional services firm, with the implementation of a data hub deployment on Platform Digital. In London, the classic Digital Realty and classic Interxion teams work closely together to add Canonical, a leading UK based software and IP service provider and the publisher of Ubuntu, a leading Linux distribution. Boosteroid, a cloud gaming platform expanded their platform across Western Europe in the third quarter with a deal that involved 4 metros, Paris, Marseille, Madrid and London. G-Core, a gaming CDN expanded their use of Platform Digital in four locations across North America and Europe for their growing infrastructure demands and new AI platform. Staying with the gaming theme in the Bay Area, we have the Blade Group a cloud-based gaming company enabled daily intensive gaming. While in Ashburn, Capital Online selected Platform Digital to support their cloud development platform for gaming, e-commerce, education and big data. Finally, in Brussels, we are helping Ahold Delhaize, a leading global grocery retailer migrate from their legacy on-prem facility to Platform Digital for multi-cloud access and flexibility for future expansion. Turning to our backlog on Page 12, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $229 million. The step down from the $251 million last quarter will fetch record commencers in nearly $100 million during the third quarter offset by the $75 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at roughly 6.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13, we signed $160 million of renewals during the third quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter, was a little less than 2 years, reflecting a mix of activities skewed heavily towards the deployments, smaller than 1 megawatts. Cash rents on renewals were essentially flat, down just 20 basis points across all categories and cash rents on renewals above and below 1 megawatt were both essentially unchanged, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 78% of expiring leases, essentially in line with our long-term trend, but dragged down a bit by network customer who churned out of powered Shell capacity at our downtown Los Angeles interconnection hub. Similar to our strategy we have successfully executed with recaptured self space in Chicago, we expect to redevelop this scarce inventory within a highly desirable interconnection hub into significantly higher yielding co-location capacity. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 20 basis points driven by fully leased development projects placed in service, primarily in Chicago and Hillsborough. Same capital occupancy was unchanged for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was in line with expectations at negative 1.9%. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 14, the U.S. dollar softened over the summer before steadying at those lower levels, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the third quarter relative to prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 8% year-over-year, but $0.05 ahead of consensus, driven by a beat on the top line as well as lower property taxes and a lower share count due to the late September settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering offset by higher than expected corporate taxes due to the higher statutory rates in the UK. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share again this quarter, reflecting the third quarter outperformance. We now expect to be at or above the high end of our original ranges for all three measures. In terms of the quarterly run-rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 15, we expect to be flat to down $0.01 in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the higher weighted average share count, as the additional shares from the forward equity offering will be outstanding for the entire fourth quarter compared to just 6 days in the third quarter. As you update your earnings models and begin to roll forward to next year, please keep in mind our 2021 results will entail a couple of partial periods complications. For starters, we all of course report a full year contribution from Interxion next year compared to just three quarters this year, which we expect will help drive double-digit revenue growth. On the other hand, the sooner we return to a more normalized operating environment next year, the tougher the comps as current period results are benefiting from the deferral of some overhead and OpEx as well as maintenance CapEx. Finally, the additional shares from settlement of the forward equity offering and mid-year ATM issuance will be outstanding for the full year in 2021 compared to a partial period in 2020. As a result, although we expect to rollout the formal guidance early next year, we are currently targeting mid single-digit growth in both earnings and cash flow per share. Last, but certainly not least, let’s turn to the balance sheet on Page 16. As expected, the third quarter activity on the ATM and settlement of the forward equity offering brought leverage back down in line with our target range. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA stepped down to 5.6x, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4x. We also capitalized on favorable conditions in the debt capital markets and executed several proactive liability management trades during the third quarter. In mid-September, we raised $750 million of long 11-year green Euro bonds at 1% and $300 million of 2-year floating rate notes at an initial coupon of 0%, achieving all-time low coupons for Digital Realty. We also retired $1.2 billion of bonds due in 2022 and 2023 and a blended coupon of 4.1% as well as $500 million of preferred equity, and a blended coupon of 6.1%. We had $970 million of cash on the balance sheet at September 30 although one of the preferred redemptions and one of the bottom redemptions straddled quarter end and approximately $650 million of that cash was used to fund those redemptions in mid-October. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 16, we have extended our weighted average debt maturity out to 6.5 years and ratcheted our weighted average coupon down to 2.5%, a little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 16, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about pro forma revenue growth in a couple of contexts. First, if you are to look at the third quarter, what would be the year-over-year constant currency growth by region, whether you are looking at Europe, U.S., Asia, just to get a sense of where each of these businesses are growing, as if you owned all of these assets a year ago in terms of what you acquired or what you have divested? And then secondly, as you look at the guidance or the indications or the aspirations you just described for 2021, can you further unpack with that double-digit revenue growth, what would be the organic part of that versus the benefit of the acquisition and maybe walk through a little bit more detail of the pluses and minuses that are affecting the core FFO per share? Thanks.
Andy Power: Hey, thanks Michael. So, this is Andy. Let me maybe try to take that in reverse order. And I will see if I can get all the details by region. So, I think the second part of your question was speaking to what next year’s growth looks like and we shared a little bit of preview although obviously our guidance will come out till early next year. Really there is no we were speaking to the bottom line or core FFO per share growth so there is no apples and oranges, benefits, because the cost of our Interxion acquisition is kind of baked in, the share count, and obviously, the debt. So it’s not like there is inorganic growth, supplementing those numbers. If you kind of deconstruct it, from the top line, I mean, I think you can look at our, our signings volume, probably the last two quarters is the best trend given those are two quarters, where we reported Digital plus Interxion together for 100% of the quarters. In terms of P&L contribution and signings this quarter is obviously a strong $89 million, the prior quarter was the record $144 million the two of them kind of averaged out to low 100 to 115 or so. And coincidentally our revenue in the in the quarter is now ready to billion dollars. So that makes the math easy for what kind of revenue growth would be kind of going forward called in the low teens, obviously have to net our any churn. But I still think you arrive at a high single digits revenue number at the top line for the aggregate business. And that obviously nets down to that mid single digit square foot per share growth model. I think that headwind or to obviously think about is we are having the less spend this year, well, obvious things less T&E, delay in maintenance of OpEx, right that was going kind of just critical staffing. And assuming we are all fortunate to be in a better place versus this virus next year, we would assume a lot of those costs involve them in some capacity return. Breaking that going back to your first part of the question and looking at the revenue contributions was I don’t I apologize, I don’t have a segment by segment P&L in front of me. But I think I can get to the crux of it, we just look at our development schedule, which is just under 200 megawatts of capacity under constructions 56% pre leased, was returns, it creped up a little bit in our favor, this quarter relative to last quarter. And you can see, relative to our existing mix of business, a disproportionate share of our new capacity coming online is outside the U.S. relative to our installed base. And was not on that schedule given unconsolidated joint ventures Latin America further amplify that math based on the activity we are doing with Ascenty. So, obviously, our growth relative to the install base is much larger in India, in Latin America, and Asia Pacific, given the amount of new capacity that we signed, or bringing online in those markets relative to those bases. Relative and makes sense. Obviously the North American market is by far the most mature and is our largest portion of the pie.
Michael Rollins: Thanks, Andy.
Andy Power: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkins: Thanks. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question about energy and sustainability and then a question about lease expirations. So wondered if you could maybe dive down a little bit into future initiatives around sustainability In any kind of future milestones that you are working towards, and then the in the supplemental looks like the lease expirations next year, you know, increase and a lot of that is in kind of the sub 1 megawatt range, although it does tend to there is a bump up in expirations in the annual rent across all categories. And I wondered as we think about 2021, how do we kind of frame that from the standpoint of lease roll downs or increases in rent or churn or whatnot? Thank you.
Andy Power: Bill, do you want to take the first part and I can take the second part on expirations?
Bill Stein: Yes, sure. Hey, thanks, Jon. Okay, here at Digital we are committed to going well above and beyond minimum renewable standards. We think that the consistent renewable sourcing efforts allow us to decouple the growth of our portfolio from the growth in our carbon footprint. Our approach prioritizes cost competitive net new renewable energy sourced within the same grid regions where our data centers are located. We work with electric utilities to support them in bringing new renewables on the grid and our customers strongly prefer local net new renewables and our approach reflects that. We do not use unbundled commodity renewable energy credits. These are called RECs to meet our long-term objectives. We price what’s called additionality in our approach. That’s a concept where more renewables are brought online because of our actions. And also when we sign on to a project early on in its development cycle, it’s important to recognize that as an investment grade counterparty, this enables that project to both be financed and built. Andy, you want to handle the renewals question?
Andy Power: Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, John, obviously, we are still in 2021 budget season, but I don’t – I do look at kind of what’s ahead in 2021 in terms of expirations as being very favorable in terms of volume mix, mark-to-market relative to our history, which I have shared for some time in some of our investment polls you have obviously hosted. If you kind of go to our expiration table and our supp, I look at them really two discreet buckets, the first one being call it that 01 megawatt category, with about 17% of our expirations in 2021, which is concentrated in our most highly connected, highest pricing power sticky albeit shorter term co-location contract bucket, pro forma for our combination about half of that, contracts coming due in that from legacy Interxion in the Western portfolio. So, we do expect to continue to see very strong pricing power there and the other half is really from our legacy North America co-lo portfolio. Overall, the markets are call it major metros, the London and New York cities, Frankfurt, San Francisco, Paris’ in terms of the top markets coming due in that bucket. If you do look at what I think maybe was the emphasis of your question was kind of looking at the greater than a megawatt bucket that category is a little bit less than 8% as you can see on the supp and it has stepped down about 300 basis points from I think the peak was the third quarter of 18%, about over – just over 11%. Other than Ashburn in that category of expirations north of megawatt, no market other than Ashburn is greater than 1%. So, it’s pretty diverse. And when you – I mean, I know it’s a little bit of tough comparison, because we broaden our definition or change our definition slightly when we changed our disclosures a couple of quarters ago, but if you look at the rates per kilowatts, we look at our rates on expiring contracts having come down call it $15 or so per kilowatt in that time period from that prior peak, so setting us up for more favorable comparison. And then last but not least, as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, really the most concentrated expiration is just under 17 megawatts. Fortunately, it is in the Ashburn market, obviously our largest market and probably going to come at a better time given how well our team has done in leasing that market, 90 megawatts of the last 9 months really [indiscernible] organization on that. So I know I am certainly aware of customers right now that are anxiously, awaiting for that adjacent hall in their buildings and one of our connected campuses to become available. So, I think we will be able to weather our way through that. After that concentration, the next largest call it chunk would be less than 4.5 megawatts from any single customer and half of that expiration in Santa Clara, which is a really tight market for us. So, hopefully, I will provide a little bit more color and a little bit more about the [indiscernible] index as what we see ahead in the expirations.
Jon Atkins: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Good afternoon. So, I wanted to start with sort of capital, it would be hard not to notice the move in the stock year-to-date in the extraordinarily low cost of debt, which you guys have availed yourself of Digital has historically been pretty active on the M&A and investment front. So maybe you could tell us what you are seeing in the market today and the opportunity set for inorganic growth as you see it?
Bill Stein: Maybe I will hand it off to Greg to speak to cover the broader M&A landscape. I think you are on mute Greg?
Greg Wright: Sorry can you hear me now? Sorry about that, Jordan, okay sorry about that. Look I think the current market we are seeing today, which I don’t think will surprise you seeing demand for the data center assets is really strong. This was previously really a niche asset class that I would say is going mainstream, or has gone mainstream, we are seeing more core like capital come into the sector, given the strong supply and demand fundamentals, and how well, the sector has performed during the pandemic. And both of those things, I think, combined with the credit worthiness of the customer base, all of those underlying elements drive for more core like capital. So look, we think you are going to continue to see a focus on data center and asset class this capital is capital that was previously invested in areas like offices or strip malls, and they started to migrate towards our space, I would say the environment is increasingly strong right now. So I mean, again, I think we will continue to see strong demand for the sector for quite some time, Jordan, on the M&A front. I think we have seen, we have seen some of these private portfolios trade, and they continue to trade at, decent levels, for example, I mean, you saw the asset that we sold last quarter in the Netherlands, we sold that and it was a non core asset. And we sold it for roughly a 6.7 cap rate. So, look, I think when you look at the overall environment right now, I would say there is a lot of interest and a lot of demand, which should bode well for the sector.
Jordan Sadler: And just maybe as a follow-up along the same lines in terms of let us say, the net dollar of investment, where would you be focused in from an M&A front? Is it increased market share in a mature market like North America or is it adding new markets?
Greg Wright: Look I think there is yes, when you look at our global strategy, I think it’s different for each market. Jordan, I think, look clearly in Asia right now, the way we have been growing is organic growth in our existing markets through land acquisition and development of near term in our existing land bank, right. I mean, we have rolled out products across seven of the APAC markets for example, we created the first network mutual data center in South Korea, we build out a campus of 100 plus Meg’s in Tokyo. I think it was 5 or 10. Meg’s in Osaka, we powered on a 50 megawatt building in Singapore, which is our third asset there. And that you also saw us announce our second site in Hong Kong. So clearly, when we look at, we look at Asia right now. it’s a harder market to grow in, right because it’s much more fragmented. But we like it. I think in terms of Europe and EMEA, I think you got to look at first thing you have look at is really our under construction pipeline, which we had in legacy Digital as well as the legacy Interxion but you look at markets like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Zurich, Marseille Stockholm, we have assets in each of those markets under construction and really being driven by customer demand, as well as in those in that same European markets, organic growth, again, in existing markets through the land acquisition, or development of our existing land pipeline things places like Madrid, Frankfurt, Vienna in Paris, clearly in that market to, as you saw in this press release, we will have select dispositions in capital recycling. and you will see some redevelopment, right on our head, our campus that Bill mentioned, one of the beauties of that transaction is we get a, we are going to have redevelopment opportunity for several buildings that we did not previously own. I think when you keep going back then across the globe, and you look at South America, Andy mentioned in organics really been organic growth through land acquisitions and development in South America. Again, like all markets, that’s really a customer driven approach. So you talk about incremental dollars, a lot of times where we go is dictated on where our customers want to be right. And I was – there are no two places that are better examples of that in both Chile and Mexico. Obviously, Brazil was the same. And then when you come back to the U.S., which is a more developed market, again, you will see development in select markets. But I think you will see continue to see acquisition of highly connected assets with what we would call established communities and interest in buildings such as the Westin. And again, there just like in Europe, you will see select capital recycling. So, when I say when you talk about incremental dollars, there is just a quick snapshot of how we are thinking about things across the globe.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, my questions are on the hyperscale. So one of your peers this morning was talking about getting more aggressive lowering the yields they are targeting for hyperscale deals down to the 8% to 10% range. So I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the pricing and competitive backdrop you are seeing in the hyperscale arena and whether things are getting more competitive relative to what they have been like in the past? And then just a quick follow-up on enterprise, you talks about record new logo growth and heightened deal velocity at a time when a lot of your peers are actually talking about more growth coming from the embedded base. So, I am just wondering what’s enabling you to win you share, where are these new customers coming from? Thanks.
Andy Power: Hey, thanks, Matt. Maybe I will start off on hyperscale and I will toss it to Corey to speak to what I really thought was a really fantastic quarter when it came to enterprise, in particular. The – I mean, I think the hyperscale arena is something that we have excelled it for several quarters on and year. And I think I got a hunch, the competitor that you were referring to and I think I know it’s a new leadership regime, but I would say that’s, they have been a pretty fierce competitor for some time and aggressive, I have not seen a change in the posture from our day-to-day activities. I think it goes back to Digital, our platform has been able to win more than its fair share by coming to table with many ways to support these global hyperscalers whether it is being across numerous countries and markets, where they want us to grow or they are entering new markets, as Greg mentioned, side by side with them, where there is no truly established player to deliver to our capabilities, whether it is owning the adjacent land holdings that really allows us to future proof that growth and other things like making sure we are delivering the health and safety standards they require and making sure we are operating these facilities to the level that they require as if it was their own building and they have high expectations, I think Digital strives to exceed across the board. And I think you see that paying dividends in our results this last quarter, as I mentioned a second ago, our returns on our development, which are obviously weighted very much to our success within the hyperscale arena, actually went up across a couple of markets. And I think our success in the Ashburn market over the last few quarters, which is a hotly contested market, we have been able to be 100% pre-leased and rather full speaks to our success within that category for sure. So, I think that’s kind of capsulated, I don’t think there is no real dynamic shift in the competitive landscape. I would even say, the customers continue to mature and want to fin down their buying groups with more global partners, trusted infrastructure partners, like the Digital. But Corey maybe you could pick it up and really speak to what you – what we have been doing on the enterprise front.
Corey Dyer: Yes, thanks, Matt, for the question and Andy for transitioning to me. On the enterprise front, Matt, I think you asked a little bit about where the new logos are coming from and just where the enterprise wins are coming from and I would tell you, Andy referenced earlier record number of new logos. And then we are just excited about the quality of the new logos and what the growth and the future that they can drive as you think through it. Some of the notable wins we talked about were global markets company, there was one of the largest financial derivative exchanges we have signed and convinced during the quarter. We also had a mobile marketing platform that fuels many of the popular mobile gaming that are with [indiscernible] marketing technology and a major participant in the investment industry. So, we just had a really broad base of wins in the enterprise lately. As you think through it, we also kind of keep track of service exchange support. So that went up for us. And then interesting this quarter, more than 50% of our new bookings this quarter, as Andy mentioned, were from deals less than 1 megawatt, which is generally assigned to the enterprises coming to you. And then if you think longer term Matt about where we are going, there is a lot of studies out there that show 80%, 85% of the enterprise, we are thinking about going hybrid cloud strategy. And so as you think about that migrating to hybrid clouds implies that they are going to put some of them in the public cloud, but a majority of it is in their kind of co-location facilities like us. So we don’t see that we see that as an another advantage and something is going to continue to drive more enterprise growth for us. And then there is probably a little bit of COVID, of expediting kind of a transition to a distributed architecture for the enterprises, which again, we are really well positioned to take advantage of. So above and beyond that we are doing a lot with our go to market that we are changing that we did in the last couple of years, that had huge success for us. And then the channel that we have built here in the last couple years has been amazing for us to already normal than 20% of business out of the channel. So feel like we are really just kind of hitting on all cylinders when it comes to the enterprise right now. And I feel really, really happy with what we are doing and where we are progressing the business. Hope that helps, Matt.
Matt Niknam: Yes that’s great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen: Okay, thanks. So on Europe, I am wondering if you could break out the how much of the leasing was legacy Interxion versus legacy Digital, so we can get an idea of like apples-to-apples versus prior years, if that is possible. I know it gets more difficult every quarter we get away from that merger? And then also, I didn’t go back to look at all your supplements. I think this is only the second time that wholesale leasing in Europe was greater than North America Just curious how long you think this trend of kind of strong wholesale/hyperscale demand in Europe will last and when we start to see, if we start to see a shift back to Americas in the coming quarters?
Bill Stein: Hey, thanks, Jon. So to answer both of those questions, the lion’s share of the activity landed within legacy Interxion sites within EMEA. We did have a very strong contribution from the legacy Digital co-lo sites, but overall GAAP wise, it was call it less than 10% of the EMEA contribution. So, as and which should be expected, obviously, the legacy footprints are weighted, their legacy footprint in the EMEA was a fair bit larger than our legacy footprint in EMEA. And then on your question in North America versus EMEA, I mean, I think this kind of goes back to the first question Michael Rollins today asked about, we are certainly seeing outsized growth relative to our installed base in these non-U.S. markets, although I do at the same time, you have to put it in the context. We are coming off a quarter in North America where we absorbed a tremendous amount of capacity in North America, including Ashburn. So, I am not sure I had pointed in the direction that EMEA overall was going to be larger, especially in the plus megawatt category for some extended duration. But we are definitely pleased with the success of our combined EMEA platform. And I think for what I am seeing, we are not done for the year in that category yet as well. I know, another way we are differentiating ourselves with some of these hyperscalars is kind of continue to support them in more and more EMEA markets, not just the traditional flat markets, so some growth leading the flaps has been a great place to where we have had success in EMEA as well.
Jon Petersen: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you for the question. I just wanted to touch up a little bit on Slide #13 regarding the releasing spreads and this clearly shows a material improvement versus the last couple of quarters. And I just wanted to round out to see if this is essentially, your cleared runway, out of all the releasing spreads at least the majority of the vintages that you guys are trying to process through last couple quarters from prior acquisitions is it safe to say now that this is kind of the new range in this, plus 1%, plus or minus 1% range on releasing spreads for rental changes on a cash basis?
Bill Stein: Thanks, Sami. So, congratulations as yours are in order and some of the IR rankings, so good work there and we are glad to see that recognized. But to answer your question obviously, that those data points are pointing in our favor a bit in terms of our cash mark-to-markets. You saw that in the quarter basically flat to low 20 basis points negative in the less than megawatt category, but basically flat across both and flat overall and what we have put up in terms of renewals in the third quarter. We also improved our characterization of our mark-to-market in our guidance from a beginning we are down low single-digits in terms of our expectations for our cash mark-to-markets. And now we have, in the words of John Stewart, are slightly negative. So, moving in the right direction for sure there, I would put an asterisk or caveat just to be more transparent that you can see in the document here, the readings this particular quarter were overall much more in the call it most highly connected, network oriented megawatt or less type category. So that obviously blends in our favor. Those are locations, both legacy Digital and legacy Interxion with some of our strongest pricing power. And the overall sample set in the greater than megawatt category was certainly on the smaller side. So, I don’t think we are ready to put the victory flag up behind us on this topic, but I do – I am taking some conviction that we are moving in a better direction here, which is the product in some regards of not only the market fundamentals, but also the REIT characterization or complexion of our portfolio that is much more diversified across both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, more connected and highly connected and now we are going into destinations. So, I do think those things, in addition to the market fundamentals, are helping us on the cash mark-to-markets.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you and thanks for the note. Just one other follow-up regarding channel that came up earlier, I think if someone said at 20% of bookings are coming from the channel, and I just wanted to check on one additional detail there. Has this percentage of contribution from the channel gone up with Interxion or was it always essentially in the 20% range every quarter and with Interxion under the hood? Does that mean that this mix could potentially increase over time?
Bill Stein: Corey, you want to pick on that – pick up on that and I can fill on with some details as well.
Corey Dyer: Yes, so, Sam thanks for the question. What I would tell you is that our percentage of our sales from a legacy Digital perspective has continued to grow are well over 20%. With the Interxion that might moderate it a little bit, but I think it gives to your point, a huge opportunity for us as we build out the channel globally and we continue to take the same learnings we have had across North America throughout the globe. So, I think there is a huge opportunity for us. I think that was your question. Sorry, if I didn’t answer it.
Sami Badri: Thank you.
Bill Stein: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have seen a number of press releases recently, where you are referencing your Data Gravity Index. I am wondering how this has changed your communication with clients, does it lead to them or is it something that they already understand and does it lead to any different type of deployments than the clients otherwise would have?
Bill Stein: Chris, why don’t you share a little bit about what we are doing around Data Gravity and what that means for customers and also Corey, please chime in as well.
Chris Sharp: Absolutely. Thanks, Brendan for the question. No, it’s a very unique formula that’s been evolving over 10 years. And what it really does is it identifies key challenges facing enterprises today around the power requirements and the growth of data, so that we can design solutions to alleviate it. And so I think it’s something that’s unique to – Digital has unique assets to really solve for this kind of ever evolving problem that’s being generated around the massive amounts of data being created. And so what’s unique in the fact that Digital can allow customers to be in proximity to these data ocean that already exists within Digital Realty. And so they have the efficiencies of proximity to those data oceans and then we also provide, most recently, we just did a press release with path AI, where they can now be placed in a space where they can do analytics against that. And so the artificial intelligence trend that’s happening in the industry is another underpinning element of what the Data Gravity Index represents is how customers can get in proximity to existing data, and then also do analytics through AI, with our unique asset class and product portfolio. And so, it’s, a bit of a educational basis, that we really just want customers to be aware of the buyers dynamic and helps them solve for the burgeoning underpinning of data and the amount of data that’s being grown. And I think, there is some great statistics out there where enterprises are going to be creating more and more of their own data in a very distributed manner. And so that is where, you see us being able to solve for not only in our traditional types of offering for these data, gravity problems and the burgeoning sets of data, but also some of the emerging edge workloads as well. And being able to tie all that together in our comprehensive set of product offerings and interconnection capabilities that is really what is underpinning that data, gravity kind of formulas, and just educating our customers of that, and I don’t know Corey if you had anything else you wanted to touch upon?
Corey Dyer: No, Chris, you did a great job on framing up what it is, what I would also add to that maybe is, it really helps us have a point of view, and, some perspective for customers, as they think through the changing architecture what they are going to need is to go through COVID and get going into much more distributed world. And so you are going to have to start thinking about how you handle data, not just interconnection, alright, and the data that is going to matter to all of us. It’s what really drives all of our businesses. So if you have got some customers that are curious about it we have got a whole bunch of people and team members here that are more than happy to get engaged with to talk about how you can make take advantage of it.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.
Corey Dyer: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Just wanted to get an update on the European assets sales that you guys have talked about from a timing and size perspective I have seen some reports where that might be moving forward? And then secondly I appreciate the color you gave on 2021 core assets per share growth of mid single digits I was wondering if you can give us a little more color in terms of what is assumed in there as relates acuity needs leverage CapEx those types of things that obviously have a pretty big impact as well? Thank you.
Bill Stein: Greg, why don’t you start with the overall dispositions of philosophy there and then I will pick up on the second question?
Greg Wright: Hey Colby. How are you?
Colby Synesael: I am doing good, Greg.
Greg Wright: Good. Well, I am not sure we have ever talked about a specific when we have we know we sold our one asset here in Europe here as we mentioned in the quarter in the Netherlands and we thought it was attractive capital for the asset so look I think when you think about our philosophy or approach when it comes to portfolio optimization I mean look we have talked and we remained focused on capital recycling and portfolio optimization, as I mentioned earlier we think it’s a strong market right now to sell assets and once we sell those assets out of what for us again there are still good assets, these are just not core to Digital, our ability to then turn around and recycle those proceeds and deploy capital and other assets that further align with our strategy. Again, we want to do smart deals that maximize shareholder value. And that is where we are focused. So look, I think, over time, the guidance we gave, I guess it’s been, it was an official guidance. But when we talked in the market, I guess it’s been close to two years ago we said a few billion over a few years. We are about halfway through that now. And, but we have been pleased with the results so far. But again, the good news is, we do that we don’t have to do this, we only do this when we think we are going to get fair pricing, and it makes strategic sense for us. Luckily, Andy and John in the team have the balance sheet with a change so that we are never forced to have to do asset sales, but we do them again, when it’s a fair price and make strategic sense to Digital.
Colby Synesael: Thanks. I have just one quick follow-up to that, which is your own valuation has gone up since the last asset sale you did with Maple – with the Mapletree. And I am just wondering if that factors into your decision-making when you think about the accretion dilution aspect to these potential sales in the cap rates you can get?
Greg Wright: It does 100%. I mean, we look at – we look and see what we are trading, a lot of times for these assets will run marketed processes. So, we get a true market check, but yes, it definitely factors into our thinking, where our stock is trading and what our redeployment strategy will be. Yes, you can be best believed it factors into our thought and approach.
Bill Stein: And then Colby, just real quick on your second question, obviously, we are not pulling forward on call with our guidance for next year, call it 180 days or whatever it is. But I think the point – that point most relevant to the heart of your question was funding sources and thoughts. Greg touched it little bit, but I think I would kind of capsulate in the following snapshot, obviously, where it stand today at our targeted leverage levels and that’s with a substantial backlog of non-income producing assets that are going to be coming online and producing the EBITDA here shortly to kind of grow our EBITDA without much capital requirements to finish those projects. Two, as you saw, we have got about little more about – little over $300 million of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which is just the net of the capital raise relative to the data preferred redeemed. So, there is kind of cash sitting there, not earning anything as we speak, but obviously we will go towards our funding sources for the next 12 plus months. We have redeemed about $500 million of professional preferred in the last 2 months. So, we do have professional referred capacity and those coupons we have been quoted are close to 4%. Greg touched on potential dispositions in the call it – if we get to the high end of our guidance, let’s call it another $500ish million of size. So also those are un-levered, also contributing equity sources. And then longer term, I think we are going back to that question you just had raised of always continuing to expand our capital partners with sources of private capital where we can put in fully valued, maximized, fully leased long-term assets and retained management control. And we have also not been shy of prudently using the ATM on the margins here. So I think we have got a lot of arrows in our quiver here in terms of capital sources to fund some pretty attractive opportunities we see in the front view mirror here. Thanks, Colby.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Andrew. I would like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers, landing a record number of new logos in the quarter with a book of new business remarkably well balanced across customer type and geographic region. We also delivered solid current period financial results, feeding consensus and raising guidance for the second time this year. We further extended our global platform, providing customers a gateway into Southeastern Europe and our runway for growth across the continent, with strategic land acquisitions and new development starts. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, with exceptional execution on $2.5 billion of long-term capital raises and we use the proceeds to retire $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. I would like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We delivered record bookings, more than 50% higher than our previous all-time high. We beat consensus by $0.07 driven by operational outperformance and the beat flowed through to upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Third, we extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our second annual ESG report and official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet with the issuance of $645 million of common equity and €500 million of 10.5 year bonds at 1.25%. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. 
Bill Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. Even though we haven't been physically sitting together for the past several months, we've made significant progress, strengthening each of these pillars. As John just mentioned, our second quarter bookings were more than 50% better than our previous all-time high but we're also more than double our previous trailing four-quarter average. We've now seen improvement for six consecutive quarters so we've clearly seen an acceleration in leasing velocity. We are admittedly a bigger organization today and the bar should be higher, following our combination with Interxion and as well Ascenty. But our second quarter results would have been a record for stand-alone digital realty as well. A world of remote everything has accelerated digital transformation initiatives and data center demand has benefited. But I believe these results also reflect the past several years of hard work, putting together a highly, attractive diversified global platform stability and capable leadership within our broader organization, coupled with solid execution. In particular, I would like to congratulate Corey Dyer and his entire sales team on their exceptional performance. We do expect the second quarter may be the high watermark for the full year and we don't necessarily expect to maintain this velocity every quarter but 2020 is clearly shaping up to be a banner year and we continue to capitalize on the acceleration of digital transformation strategies to build business resilience, which should continue to drive strong demand going forward. Our confidence in the forward outlook is reflected in the upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Let's turn to the current environment on Page 3. The COVID-19 global pandemic has changed all our lives. Our hearts go out to the global communities we serve especially those that have been most impacted. We stand in solidarity with them. And our focus remains unchanged, keeping our employees, customers and partners safe. We are fortunate to have been as well prepared as we possibly could have been for this pandemic. Our 280 data centers in 45 metropolitan areas across 21 countries on six continents remain fully operational. We are grateful to be in a position where we can help industries communities and families around the globe continue to conduct business and stay in contact with each other during these uncertain times. We also want to again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles, who continue to come into work every day at our data centers around the world. They make possible the service and support that we provide our customers. Stepping back, our approach to managing and leading through the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by our ESG strategy depicted on page 4. We strive to lead the global data center industry in sustainable environmental performance. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. We take this work seriously because it matters to our customers and because, we think it's the right thing to do. Environmental stewardship is incorporated into almost every aspect of our business. Sustainability is a top priority for us year round. The industry, governmental, organizations and the press are all taking note. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. In late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In early June, Interxion announced that it reduced its cooling system energy consumption by 20%, during the first year of an ongoing project with EkkoSense a data center optimization specialists. In mid-June, we were recognized as a green lease leader by the U.S. Department of Energy's better Buildings Alliance. We also published our second annual ESG report in mid-June, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2019, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, community engagement and philanthropic commitments, diversity and inclusion efforts and other sustainable business practices. In terms of our social efforts, since April, we have committed more than $1 million to partnering with charitable organizations globally combating the COVID-19 pandemic as well as efforts to fight racial injustice. We've also begun a doubling down on our employee matching gift program raising an additional $100,000 on top of our corporate efforts. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities that we serve around the world. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continue to expand our global platform with groundbreaking announcements in multiple metros across APAC, the Americas and EMEA. In early July, we announced that we would be building our second data center in Hong Kong, allowing us to cater to diverse multi-site workloads. The facilities is expected to be built out and ready for global and regional customers by mid-2021. In mid-June, we broke ground on the first carrier-neutral facility in Korea with the Sangam Digital Media City in Northwest Seoul. We've seen significant pent-up customer demand for carrier-neutral offering in South Korea and we expect to be open for business in the fourth quarter of 2021. In early June, we announced that Ascenty our Latin American platform and joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure was entering Mexico with two diverse locations, anchored by long-term U.S. dollar-denominated multi megawatt agreements to support the growth of a leading global cloud provider. In April, Interxion broke ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a market expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's eighth in Paris and the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. In early July, Interxion announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, its third data center in Marseille. Interxion's Marseille campus is one of the world's leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments along with local as well as global enterprises. Last but not least, in mid-July, we announced that we had acquired the freehold to the land under Hanauer Landstraße campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of our existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. We also made two significant announcements advancing our collaboration with NVIDIA. In early May we announced the platform digital data Hub featuring NVIDIA DGX A100, POD infrastructure, a joint engineered solution that brings the world's first five Petaflops AI compute system to the enterprise to tackle high-performance computing challenges. Most recently in late July, we announced the joint development of an AI platform as a service offering on platform digital combining core scientific plexus AI workflow orchestrator with the NVIDIA data hub solution to address enterprise data lake performance constraints. These announcements validate our strategy of building a portfolio of engineered partner solutions to help enterprises accelerate digital transformation and remove data gravity barriers. Let's turn to Interxion on page 6. Integration is our top priority for 2020. And despite having to do the hard work of integration virtually during the pandemic, both teams have risen to the occasion. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but we are already seeing the benefits of the significant cross-selling opportunities. We said last quarter, that we believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. And in the interim we've received meaningful third-party validation of our view. In mid-July Cloudscene gave us the top billing in EMEA on their H1, 2020 data center ecosystem leader board, which ranks data center operators based on the composition of their facilities, service providers, network fabrics and cloud on ramps. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking co-location, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. We've made steady progress on our corporate integration efforts. And by putting customers first, we've been able to seamlessly come together as one company. There will be more work to do over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to-date. Let's turn to the macro environment. As we are all aware the pandemic has pumped the brakes on the global economy. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth. And we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The current environment is accelerating enterprise's digital transformation strategies and data gravity is shaping the way enterprises will deploy, host and connect their infrastructure globally. According to IDC by 2025, enterprises will need to manage the integration of 175 zettabytes of data between their private infrastructure and public clouds. 451 Research conducted a global IT leader survey finding 87% of IT leaders need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. We see indicators of enterprises solving data gravity globally across our platform in the volume of new logos as well as expansion bookings within our enterprise vertical. Digital Realty was recently named the global leader in GigaOm's market radar for edge co-location, ranking our strategy as the only outperformer in the platform strategy sub segment a strong validation of our vision. The roadmap for platform digital is positioned to capture the enterprise opportunity. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, stakeholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 9. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, we have included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental this quarter. The highlights here on page 9 of the deck, give you a sense for the power of the combined platform. We also implemented the changes to our disclosure package we've telegraphed for the past several quarters. As we've said, we see the lines blurring between product types. And we believe the traditional distinctions have become less meaningful. The changes we've made to attempt to more closely align our disclosure with our customers' buying behavior. And the way we manage the business. We hope these disclosure enhancements are helpful. We aim to continuously improve the utility and transparency of our financial disclosures. And as always, we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed total bookings of $144 million, including an $18 million contribution from Interxion. The second quarter also included a $12 million contribution from Interxion. And along with the $22 million of network and enterprise oriented deals of a megawatt or less, accounted for nearly 25% of total bookings. The weighted average lease term was nearly 11 years. We landed a total of 124 new logos during the second quarter, including 38 sourced by Interxion again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, demand was particularly robust in Northern Virginia, the New York Metro area, the Pacific Northwest and Mexico City in the Americas, as well as Frankfurt, Paris, London and Marseille, in EMEA. We leased 48 megawatts in Ashburn during the second the quarter, bringing our trailing four-quarter total to north of 100 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development, as well as existing inventory. We generated another 70 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the second quarter, up from 90% occupied at year-end to 93.8% as of June 30. And our Northern Virginia active development pipeline is now 100% pre-leased. Despite a somewhat crowded playing field in this market, we believe we certainly hit above our weight due to the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected campuses. And finally, our ability to future-proof our customers' growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. While we have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, the available inventory has been rapidly absorbed and the pendulum is starting to swing back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, the New York metro area was a standout not only is the top destination for network and enterprise oriented deployments during the second quarter, but also with the groundbreaking of our newest connected campus in Northern New Jersey where we will be developing a highly strategic, purpose-built, new infrastructure solution to help a leading data analytics provider optimize data exchange for their employees, customers and partners. In Phoenix, a leading top 12 [ph] university is leveraging our network-dense interconnection hub to optimize their hybrid IT controls. As we announced in mid-May, the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit security organization working to make the internet secure for everyone is streamlining its data center network with Digital Realty in the Bay Area. Our Paris team persuaded EcoTel [ph], a French global IT service provider to migrate its infrastructure onto our platform by offering flexible commercials and demonstrating their value as a trusted partner. In London, we added Elite, a local fiber and managed service provider to our carrier community, which will attract other enterprises particularly in digital media who will use Elite for their services. In the Netherlands, DigiTen [ph] a fast-growing software company targeting the online gaming community chose our Skiple Right [ph] campus in Amsterdam at its worldwide hub due to low latency connections to the rest of Europe and beyond. A leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturing company deployed across multiple metros is demonstrating the diverse product solutions available on platform digital, leveraging fit-for-purpose interconnection and infrastructure capabilities across three unique sites on our Dallas-connected campus as well as the Amsterdam Business Park. Finally, Hash Power, a leading global content delivery company headquartered in Portugal harness the power of our combination with Interxion to rewire their network in Madrid and San Francisco. Turning to our backlog on page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at a record high $251 million. The step-up from $122 million last quarter, reflects the $44 million backlog inherited from Interxion, as well as the $132 million of combined space and power leases signed offset by $47 million of combined commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our historical average at a little less than seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 13. We signed $169 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. We retained 88% of expiring leases above our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was as a little less than six years, while cash rental renewals rolled down 2.8% in line with expectations. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions in metro areas we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals. The lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see tightening fundamentals and barriers to entry emerging in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued, gradual improvement on cash releasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was down 150 basis points to 85.7% entirely due to consolidation of the embedded upside within the Interxion portfolio in our reported statistics for the first time. Same capital occupancy ticked up 20 basis points for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was better-than-expected at negative 1.2% including a 60 basis point FX headwind.  As we indicated last quarter barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the same-store low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool. But we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward.  Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 14. The U.S. dollar began to weaken in late May, but remained elevated relative to prior year average exchange rates for the full quarter. And FX represented roughly an 80 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line.  We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 3% of total revenue.  In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a roughly 30 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded.  In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 6% year-over-year, but $0.07 ahead of consensus as well as our internal forecast driven by a beat on the top line as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But the operational outperformance is obviously encouraging.  In terms of the quarterly run rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 15, we still expect to dip back down by $0.05 to $0.10 in the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond.  In early July, we announced that we intend to redeem $800 million of senior notes due in 2022. We expect to fund the redemption by settling the $1 billion forward equity offering in the third quarter and the higher share count along with the expected catch up and deferred OpEx are primarily responsible for the step back down in the third quarter.  As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range for revenue EBITDA and core FFO per share guidance reflecting the second quarter outperformance as well as the strength of our bookings and backlog. We don't typically provide explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the magnitude of the beat we wanted to offer some additional context.  As you may have seen from the earnings release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for non-cash rent adjustments of $20 million to $30 million as well as our recurring CapEx guidance of $220 million to $230 million, although we are admittedly trending towards the low end of the range. The implication here is that we do expect straight-line rental revenue will continue to moderate over the course of the year narrowing the delta between cash and GAAP and enhancing the quality of earnings. But we still expect to spend nearly the same recurring CapEx budget for the full year despite the lower spend year-to-date.  The bottom line on the AFFO per share outlook is similar to core FFO per share. The second quarter beat does flow through the full year forecast, but similar to the OpEx running through the P&L a portion of the recurring CapEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. And we expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half. Last, but certainly not least. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 16. The fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7 times as of the end of the second quarter. Pro forma for the settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over 5 times while fixed charge coverage is just under 5 times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management prior to the redemption of our bonds due in 2022, we have over $4 billion of liquidity to fund our capital spending including over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30th, another $1 billion of equity coming in upon settlement of the forward equity offering and $2.5 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities.  The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.  As you can see from the chart, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. A little over 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 95% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, provide the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 17, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Andrea would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Yes, good afternoon. My first question is on kind of leasing. I wondered given the strong performance if there's any kind of credence to the notion that this is sort of a pull forward and kind of your views on that topic and what we might kind of think about in terms of timing first half versus second half on demand. And related to that you did indicate Bill a little bit about pricing but I wondered are you within kind of the midpoint, low point, high point of your targeted yield range on the larger deals that you signed in Northern Virginia and other markets? And then I've got a follow-up. 
Andy Power: Hey thanks Jon, this is Andy. Maybe I'll start this one off and then hand it over to Corey to talk about 2Q and also kind of more forward-looking in the back half of the year. I can tell you we're always trying to pull forward deals as fast as possible at the end of every month and every quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about this quarter's results which we're certainly quite pleased with. I'd characterize it broadly back to something Bill kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks really we worked pretty hard for several years now putting together a highly attractive, highly connected diverse and truly global portfolio and platform. And that along with consistent, stable, and productive broad organizational talents and leadership and just solid execution is really kind of what contributed to numerous wins across the board whether it's the vault leasing signings, volume and well -- as well as mix. But I'll let Corey speak to a little bit more of what he saw in the quarter and then we can come back and talk about returns on the larger deals.
Corey Dyer: Yes. Thanks Andy. And yes, I would say that it really was not a pull forward on COVID. I would tell you that we really had a great quarter that we've been building it Andy you mentioned it five or six consecutive quarters of growth. A lot of work that the team has been doing to build our platform, position us the correct way and really build trust with all of our customers. So, I wouldn't view this as a pull forward even though we pull deals forward all the time. This is really just the fruits of our labor playing out for us. But when you think about the segments that we actually had a ton of success with. So really good success across the hyperscalers. Again they value our global platform the geography all of the work that we've done for them with our trusted set of hands and our ops team that continues to provide support for them. And then really just a heritage of success and relationships that we've got going with them. From an enterprise and a network perspective, investing in the team, our sales team, our go-to-market, our global capabilities and then we improved our messaging and our positioning around the value. When we launched PlatformDIGITAL back in November, I think you're starting to see the fruits of that; customers media analysts really just a broad base of people that picked up on that. And then we've had a lot more success with our reps quarter-over-quarter. So, a lot more contribution from the reps. And then finally, I would just say that as we look ahead we think that we're going to really focus on the makeup of our quarter. How do we continue to grow new logos, enterprise wins, or communities of interest interconnection, colocation. And then finally, I think you're also going to see that some of the messaging we brought out has been really picked up and some of the trends that we're driving are starting to drive the industry and how they're thinking and the thinking in the industry around the importance of centers of data and around the importance of data gravity which requires some architecture reconsiderations. So, we expect to see more and more of the industry following our lead in these areas as well. I think I hit most of it Andy but go ahead if there's something else. 
Andy Power: Jon anything else or should we hit?
Jon Atkin: Yes. Yes, that's good. And then maybe the follow-up on Interxion and maybe the two of you again on the -- kind of on the integration side whether it's systems or IT integration, Andy, if there's any kind of future milestones to call out? And then for Corey as you have worked for global organizations in the past and picking up a very valuable kind of European operation anything you see going forward in ways that you can maybe optimize one obvious example is cross-connect pricing, which has seen some nice lift over the last couple of years on the part of one of your major peers?
Andy Power: Maybe, Bill can start off on the integration front.
Bill Stein: Yeah, sure. Happy to take the -- take part of that, and I'll hand off to Andy. First of all, as you know, we closed the transaction on March 12. So just about the end of the last quarter, and I've said it on several occasions, but the integration of Interxion is our top priority for 2020. And I will tell you that, we are absolutely pleased with the progress made to date. Particularly given the impediments created by the pandemic. And I think we've done a good job of identifying synergies, expense synergies, and we're seeing potential revenue synergies as well, which is what we'd hoped, but didn't underwrite. As I mentioned last quarter, I'm very, very happy with the collaboration that's occurred within the two firms. David Ruberg and I speak several times a week. I had the utmost respect for what he brings to the data center business. And I do believe that, providing essential services during a global health crisis has had a unifying effect on the -- on both teams. Andy, I'll turn it over to you.
Andy Power: Just to add a little bit more and then make sure we get to the heart -- the last part of your question about cross connects. Obviously, we're continuing to progress it despite the technology or not being able to do it in person hit some key milestones in the last several months of organizational announcements, and certainly, tiebacks to our global organization now working on some specific work streams, such as our technology and, how we bring together our IT systems and business processes, and in addition to kind of just the people front. So a lot of great wins there in terms of customer referrals. Cross-selling, multisite bidding and great progress, I think the piece you mentioned on the cross-connect Jon, obviously the commercial model for cross-connect has been different in Europe overall. Interxion over the last several years moved to a model where there is better commercialization of the cross-connect opportunity. That being said, I look at the combined global portfolio and call it roughly half of our cross-connects sit in EMEA yet, probably only closer to 20% of our interconnection revenue originates from that part of the world, which I think speaks to opportunity to really make sure our customers are getting value from our services overall, and there's an equitable commercial relationship for that value we deliver. Corey, I'll hand it over to you to wrap-up Jon's point, if you have anything else to add? 
Corey Dyer: No, I think you guys covered it well across the board unless there's something that Jonathan that you'd like.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks and good afternoon. So first, I just wanted to speak to pricing a little bit. It seems this volume pretty significant. I noticed sequentially domestically or at least in the Americas pricing seems somewhat stable maybe even better despite the increased volume. But in Europe, it looks like pricing came down quite a bit. I know, maybe not a perfect comp, but I'm curious to what degree the success achieved in the quarter, a function of maybe more aggressive pricing, and maybe in that context, can you talk about what you're doing in terms of thinking in terms of returns and underwriting fee base?
Bill Stein: Sure, Jordan. So by and large, I would say we did not see much of a change in the pricing dynamic during the second quarter. And I think, what's evident of that is you can look at our returns on our development table, which I think barely moved in North America. I think a little -- it's a little bit tough quarter-to-quarter comparisons overall region-by-region, because the mix within a region can certainly sway that outcome. But when we stack it up internally and go market by market, deal size by deal size, we did not see a degradation in pricing. I think further evidence of that dynamic that, you may have seen in Ashburn, we're essentially added another 70 bps of net absorption after close to 300 prior quarter. And our development pipeline is 100% pre-leased for north of 50 megawatts in Ashburn. So when you have a dynamic when you're literally selling the last kilowatt or megawatt, or a project underway, you're certainly not trading price and you're certainly not doing it in a quarter that had this robustness of overall volume. In Europe, I think really just a mix. The prior quarter that we reported signings was just legacy digital. It didn't have a of larger scale deals this quarter. We had the contribution of Interxion, which had two good components. It had consistent more enterprise or network oriented smaller deals call it $10-plus million of that. And then it had some of the cloud computing nodes in a few markets, which are obviously multiple megawatt deals that if you compare EMEA quarter-over-quarter, you would just see a mix shift that would have changed the pricing. So, net-net still see pretty good stability in the pricing for what we saw in 2Q.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then sticking with pricing, the releasing spreads, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you could see some gradual improvements in cash releasing spreads in the second half of 2020 and that dynamic seems to be tightening, but no change in the guidance. And along the same lines, you had a lot of success on the leasing front this quarter. And I would think that that might translate into increased capital spend or development spend and that also kind of remained the same. Any sort of commentary on those pieces?
Andy Power: Sure. So, a few things. Maybe I'll take these in reverse order. The capital spend, just to remind everyone, we put out our guidance with the first quarter call. So that number really wasn't stale all the way back to the beginning of the year or the end of last year. So, I'd say our progress was somewhat anticipated, and quite frankly, it's the range of that number is in the hundreds of million dollars type of range. So, it's relatively bigger dollars. With regard to releasing, I would say in a broader sense, as a reminder, four of the past five prior years, we've had positive cash releasing spreads. This year, we guided to slightly negative. And we saw that in the second quarter. I would say the preponderance of the actual releasing was in the positive territory. But there was always an exception or two. The two exceptions here, which had good customer and commercial reasoning. One, we did a multi-site multi-geo network node for one of our large global account platform customers are very strategic to being part of our community type customer at an advantageous rate, given the attractiveness of that customer that you see kind of muting what typically is, call it, 2-plus percent increase on those zero to one megawatt-type deployments. And then on a little bit larger, I think just over a megawatt, we had an enterprise customer who did a simultaneous new signing with us in Europe in addition to a renewal with us in our Southeast region. So, when you parse those stats, you obviously see the negative on one piece, but it contributes to the positive elsewhere. We still think it's a strategic advantage to come to the table with that relationship and those incremental arrows in our quiver. But those were some things that contributed to it. And I don't think -- we didn't change the guidance on that quite, frankly, because it's probably one of the toughest to predict, because it depends when the customer wants to in the renewal of its contract, which can be early or can be very much down to the wire. So, it's -- you're handicapping not only the outcome or what period actually happens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just one and one follow-up. First on enterprise, if you could share any sort of updates on your discussions with enterprises how demand is trending? And I guess the ability of PlatformDIGITAL to sustain this type of new logo growth? I think it's been about 120-plus new logos in the last two quarters. And then secondly follow-up, maybe for Andy. I think you've got about $3.07 a share in core FFO, first half of the year. I think the midpoint is about $6.05. And so, I'm just wondering can you talk about the puts and takes around incremental headwinds embedded in the outlook? And I guess more specifically the COVID-19 deferred OpEx that's driving about half of that drop you expect in 3Q? Thanks.
Bill Stein: Hey, Corey, maybe you could hit the first question, and then turn it back over to Andy.
Corey Dyer: Yeah, sure. I'll take the first question on enterprise demand and what we're seeing and really what's driving it. And I would tell you that, -- Matt, thanks for the question. There's really been no silver bullet to it. We've had a great team supporting customers selling the platform and really building out our platform for us. And so, I would tell you it's a confluence of all these things coming together. We also had a great message that we -- I mentioned earlier, with platform digital and how that's being taken up by the industry and by customers. Our enhanced go-to-market approach has helped us. So, it's a lot of things we did, but we're also encouraged by our rep tenure. We've got better relationships. We've got customers having better relationships with our employees at longer. We've increased the number of reps making quota. We've got a ton more sites that are happening multi-site deals, multi-national deals, average deal size is up. So, from a demand perspective on enterprises, I really believe that the work we've been doing for the last five years and longer as well as the improved messaging and go to market puts us in a position where we're sustained for it. And then you add on to that the Interxion adjustment for us and what we've got from an interconnection and a networking capability and platform, that really puts us in a really, really well positioned spot to go and help enterprises as they navigate hybrid IT and then navigate through COVID and really feel like the breadth of customers, the breadth of our geography. There's going to be some customers in the enterprise world right now that are going to maybe slow down and I've heard that other places. I think because of how many we're helping and the solutions we're bringing to them to help them take advantage of hybrid IT or manage through COVID has really helped us kind of be a little bit insulated from that. Hope that helps Andy if you've got something else to add.
Andy Power: No I think you nailed it on, but going to your second question Matt and welcome back. It's great to have you back cover digital. The question on the 307, why can't you just time that by 2, I don't know if you're colluding with our CEO, because he asked me that same question as well. I did have to remind him two things one of which you highlighted. One we are -- we have been doing some strategic capital management matching our sources and uses. And we are redeeming some notes, but all along to fund our capital spend we were planning to draw down on that $1 billion equity forward. So those shares from the equity forward are not in our share count for the first half of the year, they're going to come into the second half of the year, as we close out that in the third quarter. The other piece COVID-19, maybe I'll take a quick second to really give another tremendous thank you to our operations team globally, who have just gone above and beyond. We obviously with this crisis stayed fully operational, but we did scale down our staffing to make sure we put the safety of our customers, employees and partners first and foremost. So we delayed any type of maintenance spend or repairs and maintenance that could be delayed. And that spend we don't think it's going to be delayed forever. We're working in a safe manner to continue to maintain the equipment. And we expect some of that spend that was thought to be planned and happening in the first half of the year to resume in the second half of the year. 
Matt Niknam: Got it. Thanks Andy. And it’s good to be back.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. My question is mainly to do with the re-leasing spreads on page 13 of your slide deck. And I know you've touched on elements of this already over the call. But I was just looking at the releasing spreads for leases size between zero and one megawatts. And I saw that the re-leasing spread is a little bit negative. And just given the dynamics we're seeing with such a big surge in demand coming specifically from enterprises and really the whole spectrum of constituents within the data center ecosystem as far as customers. I guess the perception would be that that would be a little bit more positive than it would be negative. And is the reason why it's negative potentially, because it may be a very large customer that's distributed into multiple locations? And in aggregate they got a discount for releasing. Or maybe you could just give us the puts and takes for customers in that specific size band what exactly is the case?
Andy Power: Sure. Thanks Sami. You are correct. I mean, if you look historically that category would be closer to two-plus percent positive and if you look through what's happening in there there's numerous renewals happening in there on a very granular basis. The reponderence of those renewals are in the positive territory and you hit the nail on the head with -- there was a specific customer that renewed across three or four sites globally with network deployments so small deployments that add up to a larger sizable deployment. And that customer is not only incredibly important to our platform based on its size and scale, but also the value it brings to the other community participants and customers here at digital. So we wanted to make sure that we found the most fair potential outcome for that renewal to secure their future here with digital. It was a little bit on the longer side for that size of deployment in terms of renewal, it's always the rates a little bit longer -- lower rates or longer, but really more of a strategic renewal within that category that brought that into the slightly negative cash mark-to-market.
Sami Badri: Great. Thank you for that color. My other question has to do with the interconnection commentary that you gave earlier with EMEA representing about 50% of the portfolio's cross-connects, but only making up about 20% of revenues, I was hoping if you could give us maybe like a time frame or a trajectory some kind of like time-lapse on when you think you would be able to get that 20% of revenue mix maybe even closer to the 50% of revenues reflecting 50% of cross-connects in Europe just so we can understand like the pace or the cadence of transition you're having with your customers in EMEA?
Bill Stein: Sami, I'm going to hand this over to Chris to give you a little bit more color on the history and the trajectory of what we're doing. I'm not going to -- unfortunately, I won't sign up for a raising of the cross-connect prices time line on this call. I don't think David Ruberg would be too pleased with me if I did that. But I can tell you we're all about bringing value to our global customers now that total 4,000 customers, and making sure that we are commercially treated in a fair actable way for that value. But Chris maybe you can chime in a little bit about on the cross tech pricing and trajectory. 
Chris Sharp: Absolutely, happy to do it Andy, thank you. And thanks for the question Sami. So you're absolutely correct. And I'll echo the sentiments throughout the call is that, we're very happy with the addition of Interxion into our broader portfolio. And I think what that represents to our customer base is, these are major epicenters of value for kind of current and future customers. And so really what's represented within that is, these communities of interest and the amount of interconnection that's been generated over the years that exists and that continues to grow. And I think one of the things that's very important to us and it's just shared vision within the Interxion team as well is that, there has to be a very balanced approach where we want to ensure that we don't cycle our customers' ability to grow and to continue to derive unique value out of this overall platform digital. And so I do think that you'll see a lot of our other existing customer base coming into Europe. So that platform effect will start to build that up. So I think over a period of time you'll definitely see that grow. But we're really conscientious of taking a balanced approach and having a very open platform so that we can allow customers to grow and continually expand. And I think a critical element of a lot of this is, not only the interconnection element but the multi-market and the unique advantage of our fit-for-purpose product where you can do both smaller colo and larger scale deployments. So the value of all of that coming together is the unique position that PlatformDIGITAL equips our customers with. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to get some high level thoughts. We've obviously had a very strong first half of the year. We saw data before the quarter results started to come out for yourself and peers that Northern Virginia was -- and some of the U.S. markets had a pretty good absorption number so far. We're now seeing it with you guys as well, but what are your thoughts about -- what sort of could be creeping in, in that digestion and maybe us having sort of a repeat performance of what we saw in 2018 and maybe what's different this time around based on what you see today?
Andy Power: Thanks Eric. So maybe I'll start off and hand it to Corey to kind of take more forward looking here. So I think a few things to your question. I think we had a really strong quarter in Ashburn, but I think we also had a really strong quarter in North America as well. Just a quick highlights New York City, metro area, top enterprise, network oriented smaller footprint deployments and connectivity, as well as a very strategic build-to-suit project on our Jersey connected campus. Out in the Pacific Northwest continued support of a hyperscaler on a highly strategic project in the Hillsboro market. Continued great wins in Chicago both on the connectivity side within the financial services vertical, as well as a different hyperscaler growing on one of our campuses in the Chicago area. So -- and I think that theme speaks to a little bit about your question. If you do rewind the clock back for a second with the digestion of the last go around I think our business did quite well which I think goes back to serving our customers across six continents, 20-plus countries, 44-plus metropolitan areas and having that globally diverse 4000-plus customer base, has allowed us to not be wed to a specific market or the ups and downs of one specific customer. And last I would say, I don't think each of these customers are on the exact same pacing. They're all at different places in their race or different points of their build-outs of their infrastructure which allows us to kind of help them when one customer is maybe taking a pause or looking to grow in different markets. But Corey please share your thoughts as well. 
Corey Dyer: Yes. I'll add to it Andy from an enterprise demand perspective. And I feel like you touched on a good bit of it. If you think about the power of our comprehensive global platform and where we're across a 4,000 global customers, 20 countries, 33 markets, 44 metros. And then you think through the new ideas and solutions we're bringing to our customers, at the same time with this combined Interxion and digital merger that we've done here. It puts us in a really good place to be able to address customers that need and want to continue buying those services. And it really moderates us from any kind of an exposure on an individual or an industry or a geo that's a little bit different. So we're pretty excited about where we are. I also feel like we've got the right kind of funnel and demand going. So we're going to be fine with growing to the cloud and continue to drive the demand that we're seeing and making investments in the data centers right? And so I think that it might be possible that some people see some new logo, sites or maybe a little slowdown there because you're trying to get into new sites that you're not familiar with. But like I said I think we've got enough customers. We've got enough breadth of our platform and our geography that I think we're insulated from it a good bit. And then when I just look at our pipeline going forward, it definitely supports the numbers that Andy has put forward to everybody. So I think we're into place. Hope that helps?
Bill Stein: Since 2018 we've added the Ascenty platform in Latin America. We've expanded materially in Europe with the acquisition of Interxion. We've added new markets in Asia specifically new development sites in Tokyo and so. And I would expect that in the second half of the year you're going to see additional contributions out of LatAm EMEA and Asia Pac. 
Corey Dyer: Yes, really good point. Thanks, Bill. 
Erik Rasmussen: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just my follow-up. You'd mentioned in I think in the press release there was some marginal construction delays. What sort of, impacts it has had on the business? And maybe can you comment on which regions that might stand out for that? And how are you going to resolve those? Thank you. 
Andy Power: Sure, Erik. So also another big thank you in kudos to our global construction team working day and night and weekends for sure in really crazy times. We -- well, I can't say we're able to make up time we've had from some delays from specific jurisdictions like a Toronto or Hillsboro from pulling labor off sites. I can say globally, we are in a really great spot going forward in terms of getting our teams back to work and delivering on our delivery times. The one -- the exception, I'd say -- not exceptional potential spot that we're keeping an eye on and we're not at full staffing in Singapore. Given the labor situation in that country we are not at 100% capacity, but we are continuing to make progress. That being said. So I think we're in a much better place today than we were when we reported on that topic a few months ago. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Eric Luebchow: Thanks very much for squeezing me in. So I know Bill you kind of said that any meaningful M&A is likely kind of off the table for the remainder of the year. But I just wanted to confirm kind of the plan is obviously integrating Interxion and kind of no near-term plans for any additional acquisitions. And to that degree if any opportunities did arise? Are there any kind of geographic reasons -- that would get into? 
Andy Power: Yes, Eric. No, I'll reiterate and reaffirm that Interxion remains our highest priority -- the integration of Interxion. We certainly are acquiring land parcels around the world for development. There may be very, very small tuck-in acquisitions but that's really for the purposes of new market expansion and/or maybe product enhancement or growing markets. Greg you might want to add to that? 
Greg Wright: No, Bill look I think, you've covered it. As Bill said we're going to -- we understand that integration is our top priority and we really have become more risk-averse in this environment. But as Bill said, we're procuring land where our customers need to be. And with facilities that really adhere to our PlatformDIGITAL and community of interest strategy. And as Bill said, we're selectively monitoring opportunities in the market where if an asset is strategic it will be smaller and we can create value and get the right return we'd probably do it. I think a lot of people are speculating in terms of acquisitions in this environment where we are with respect to distressed opportunities. And quite frankly, we haven't seen any distressed opportunities in this market yet, but we're actively monitoring things. Now longer term we may see some distressed opportunities for smaller more thinly capitalized companies that may have debt coming due. But a couple of things. Look we originally thought that as assets outside of the data spend and center space got hit harder than data centers and became relatively less expensive that we'd see private capital migrate towards those opportunities and decrease competition for data centers. However, what we're starting to see is that the private investment community have come to appreciate really the strong underlying secular trends in our space as well as the creditworthiness of our customers and the growth potential of the sector and they're becoming more educated and looking to invest. So look as Bill said, we have we're going to continue with that strategy and that's where we're focused right now. 
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our final question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. 
Colby Synesael: Great. Thanks for getting me in. Two questions if I may. Maybe Greg just to stick with you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on potential asset sales if that's something that has been put more on the back burner because of COVID-19, if you're still moving forward and if there's still a possibility we could see something maybe this year? And then secondly with the U.S. government threatening to close down specific Chinese social media applications and websites, I believe that they've been a big purchaser of data center services over the last few quarters. I'm just curious how you guys get comfortable underwriting the risk of taking on a customer like that in light of all the geopolitical uncertainty that could be impacting them? Thank you. 
Bill Stein: Greg, do you want to hit the first one and I can hit the second. 
Greg Wright: Yes, sure. Hi, Colby. How are you? 
Colby Synesael: Good. Thank you. 
Greg Wright: Look I think with respect to asset sales, I think, it's fair to say that the level of chatter and activity has picked up quite a bit. But what the exact impact will be on pricing for larger deals is still hard to say. It's important to again note everything we were saying about investors, how they're viewing the sector in terms of the secular trends, the credit worthiness in the growth potential which clearly I think you're starting to see the data center space migrate to more of a core asset class that investors particularly through this pandemic are starting to appreciate. As you know we just sold the asset in the middle of the pandemic in Europe and we got the pricing we expected. We continue to believe that our multiyear guidance of a few billion dollars over the few years of noncore assets or noncore markets. We still think that's the right guidance. We've already done about $1.4 billion of that. It's important to note that we're fully funded and we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically, when it makes sense and the price is right. But it's always good to be in a position where you have no sense of urgency, if you can't get fair value. And I think you probably also noted we gave guidance of $600 million to $1 billion earlier in the year. And with the Mapletree transaction itself, we've already achieved the bottom end of that range. Again, so why we're not expecting -- we weren't expecting COVID-19, but we are comfortable and confident where we are with respect to our capital recycling activity. So -- but look it's going to continue to change daily and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel like we're in a good position. 
Bill Stein: And then Colby on your second one, obviously, doesn't have to be specific to a headline in the news, we obviously look at various risks and that's part of our job and our business evaluating risk and return. When it comes to Asia Pacific in general, I mean, I think when we go back to is one we're a global company across 20-plus countries, six continents in numerous markets. And we have a global customer base 4,000-plus customers and rapidly expanding that 124 outages this quarter. I think the diversity of our offering and the diversity of our revenue streams give us a lot of comfort in evaluating risk. If you look at our top customer list, our top 20 customers totaled just under 48% of our annualized recurring revenue. And if you go down that list you got to go past number 19 to find a non-U.S. company just given the size and scale of some of the top cloud service providers and hyperscalers that we're doing business with. Or the number of locations we're doing business with some of the network providers. So you kind of get to like the 1% or less territory when you might run into a customer. So that's a long-winded way of saying we want to welcome all the right customers into our fold. And I think we do the right things in evaluating the right risk, but I think the diversity is what insulates us or protects us to any type of exogenous shots.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you, and congrats on the strong result.
Bill Stein: Thank you.
Andy Power: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels and reaching record highs in our bookings and backlog. Two, we delivered solid current period financial results beating consensus, beating our internal forecast and raising guidance. Third, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our second annual ESG report and our official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR partner of the year. And last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with excellent execution on the raising of $1.2 billion of long-term capital. I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy. We hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Shawn. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The last 90 days have been unlike anything that we've experienced in our lifetime, and our hearts go out to all those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 especially those who've lost loved ones. No one has been immune to this crisis, but the data center industry has been fortunate to remain open for business while huge portions of the global economy have been put on hold. As you probably know, data centers have been classified as critical infrastructure and essential businesses by government agencies around the world. Our top priority is, of course, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. The entire data center industry has delivered a strong track record of operational excellence and uptime throughout this crisis. Digital Realty has made 100% uptime. And while we have deferred preventative maintenance and have asked customers to limit site visits to critical activities, our doors have remained open and our data centers continue to provide the trusted foundation for the digital economy. Business continuity is our core competency. We have a full-fledged pandemic playbook to ensure that we maintain service levels while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. We have received very high marks from our customers for our professional protocol and proactive communications throughout the crisis. For this, we owe a debt of gratitude to our operations team and particularly our frontline employees in critical data center roles. Despite the challenging environment, they have continued coming to work so that industries, governments and families can continue to connect, keep in touch and keep commerce and information flowing. We are deeply appreciative of their efforts. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page four. In early January, we issued €1.4 billion of green euro bonds. This was our third green bond issuance, and we are now the largest U.S. REIT green bond issuer. Our green bond framework is aligned with the ICMA green bond principles with a second-party opinion provided by Sustainalytics. In mid-January, we announced that we had achieved EPA ENERGY STAR Certification for an industry-leading 29 data centers last year. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. Finally, in late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. On the social front, we are fortunate to be in a position to give back in the midst of this crisis. We have undertaken a comprehensive, philanthropic initiative consisting of corporate contributions, employee-matching gifts and community outreach initiatives to help support organizations combating COVID-19 around the world. We are also waiving fees for expanded service exchange connectivity for the next six months to help customers in the government, medical, emergency services and educational verticals keep critical services running. On the governance front, Jean Mandeville has joined the Board of Directors, bolstering the additions of Alexis B. Bjorlin and Dash Jamieson in January. Jean was previously Chairman of the Board at Interxion. And he has extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors, having previously served as the CFO of Global Crossing and Singapore Technologies Telemedia as well as President of APAC for British Telecom. We are pleased to welcome Jean to the Board, and we look forward to benefiting from his leadership and expertise. On a more bittersweet note, we also have a departure to announce. Former Chairman, Dennis Singleton, has reached mandatory retirement age and will not be standing for reelection at our annual meeting. Dennis had a distinguished career prior to joining our Board, most notably as a founding partner of Spieker Properties. He has served as a Digital Realty director since our IPO in 2004, and he served as Chairman of the Board from 2012 to 2017. The company has grown nearly 50-fold since Dennis joined the Board, and he has provided sound counsel and steady leadership through the most critical junctures in the company's history, including the strategic investments that have built the business as well as leadership changes at the Board and the C-suite. He is a true gentleman and his sage counsel and collegial bearing will be sorely missed. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I would like to thank Dennis for his more than 15 years of service to Digital Realty, and we wish him the very, very best. Let's turn to page five, our first quarter investment activity showcased the breadth of our global platform and crystallized the transformation of our business. The highlight of the quarter was, of course, our combination with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction, creating a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions. We also closed the acquisition of a 49% interest in the Westin Building Exchange in Seattle. The Westin Building is one of the most densely interconnected facilities in North America and is home to leading global cloud, content and interconnection providers with over 150 carriers and more than 10,000 cross connects. We closed on the sale of a portfolio of 10 North American data centers to Mapletree in January, generating approximately $550 million of proceeds. We also launched our colocation product offering in Osaka, building upon the success of our hyperscale business in Japan. We opened a new data center in Dublin, the new Clonshaugh facility supports the growth of Dublin's technology sector, which is projected to boom over the next decade. We acquired a small land parcel in Frankfurt, adjacent to our existing Sossenheim campus to accelerate time to market and supply-constrained metro. Separately, Interxion has line of sight on a sizable land parcel expected to represent a strategic extension of its existing Frankfurt campus that would support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity, providing runway to support customer growth in key European metro for years to come. We announced that we turned the power on at SIN12, a 50-megawatt new development in Singapore, partially pre-leased to a major Singaporean bank and a leading global cloud provider. Finally, in April, Interxion announced it has broken ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a major expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's 8th in Paris. And the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. Let's turn to integration on page six. We believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking colocation, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global, long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. Integration is our top priority for 2020. The combined company offers a comprehensive global platform for our customers and gives us a runway for significant growth. We have obviously had to adapt to the current environment. The transaction closed on March 13, and we began sheltering in place the following week. Many of the initial meetings between teams that would have taken place in person have been virtual instead, and that has obviously created some challenges. But both teams have risen to the challenge. During that first week, we had to implement policies, procedures and customer communications for operating in the midst of a global pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, I'm deeply grateful for the way both teams have come together to continue to serve our customers' needs throughout this crisis. Based on our work prior to closing and within just the past few weeks, we've made progress on our corporate integration efforts, including finalizing our integration governance and combined EMEA leadership structure, which we will be rolling out in the coming weeks. There will be more to come over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. As we are all aware, the global economy has ground to a halt. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth, and we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to draw your attention to page eight. McKinsey recently conducted a global survey of 3,600 B2B decision-makers on their business outlook and priorities. The surveyed executives stated they value digital interactions with customers as two to three times more important than traditional interactions, reflecting continued need for digital infrastructure and capacity demand for data centers. According to the market intelligence firm Intricately, on average, enterprises utilize 27 cloud products, deployed and consumed across eight points of presence globally. We are seeing indicators of this demand globally across our platform in the volume of new logos led by our enterprise vertical, as these firms shift their strategy to enable digital interactions for their customers. Digital Realty was recently named a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape Colocation and Interconnection Services Provider Assessment report, noting PlatformDIGITAL provides a global scale platform to enable digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our unique positioning to capture the global data center demand opportunity. Given the resiliency of demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meet these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 10. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, given the compressed time frame post-closing and the complexity of reconciling different reporting practices with both teams working remotely, we've included the partial period contribution from Interxion in our financial statements, but we have not included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental until next quarter. We've also tabled most of the changes to our disclosure package we discussed last quarter. We continue to see the lines blurring between product types, and we believe the distinction is becoming less meaningful. As a result, we still expect to evolve our disclosure in the coming quarters to more closely align with our customers' buying behavior and the way we manage the business. We also expect to fully reflect the Interxion portfolio statistics within our disclosure next quarter as well. Nonetheless, we provided a few pro forma data points in summary form here on page 10 to help frame the power of the combined business. I would like to point out that we slightly tweaked our definition of adjusted EBITDA this quarter to include our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture taxes and interest expense. We use net debt to adjusted EBITDA as our primary leverage governor, and we calculate leverage on a look-through basis. In other words, we include our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV debt in the numerator. And we believe that including our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV, joint venture, EBITDA in the denominator is the intellectually honest approach. Our pro rata share of joint venture interest expense and taxes has historically been negligible, but it's becoming more meaningful as we expand our strategic private capital initiative through ventures like Ascenty in Latin America and MC Digital Realty in Japan. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 11. We delivered solid leasing volume with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $75 million, our second highest quarter on record. This does not include any contribution from Interxion, which separately signed another $10 million during the first quarter. Interxion's first quarter bookings were entirely colocation and connectivity business, with no single deal larger than 180 kilowatts. Standalone Digital Realty's first quarter bookings included a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $66 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly seven years, including a $7.5 million colocation contribution. Standalone Digital Realty added 54 new logos during the first quarter on a consolidated basis. In addition, Ascenty landed 20 new logos and Interxion added another 45 for a grand total of 119, underscoring the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, standalone Digital Realty's results showed particular strength in the Americas as well as APAC, notably in Northern Virginia here in the U.S. as well as Singapore in APAC. We leased 25 megawatts in Ashburn during the first quarter, bringing our total over the past three quarters to 57 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development as well as existing inventory, and we generated nearly 300 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the first quarter, from 90% occupied at year-end to 93% as of March 31. We have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, but the available inventory is being rapidly absorbed, and the pendulum appears to be swinging back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we've landed a leading global video streaming platform for their launch across much of Europe, which was a resounding success. Interxion, a Digital Realty company, supports this on-demand, ad-free streaming service by providing their data center infrastructure across five locations in Europe. With the growing demands for OTT video services, this is a sector that relies on highly connected data centers to deliver a superior customer experience, and we are honored to have partnered with its leading provider to help them bring their world-class content to European consumers. We helped a leading European digital service provider stand up a bare-metal cloud offering adjacent to cloud on-ramps in São Paulo to support a major cloud provider's hybrid services in South America on our Ascenty platform. A global financial services firm using NVIDIA GPUs in their high-density compute cabinets chose Digital Realty because we met their high-performance computing requirements, including proximity to their legacy compute environment to ensure ultra-low latency and security. PlatformDIGITAL has been gaining significant momentum since its launch late last year. And customer-spanning industries, geographies and business objectives are making the migration. SEMrush, a SaaS provider offering online visibility and marketing analytics software subscriptions, had a requirement for a data hub with proximity to multiple leading global cloud providers and a global expansion under an aggressive timeline. We were able to solve their needs with a new deployment in Ashburn, including connectivity via our service exchange. Similarly, BIGO, a Singapore-based technology company specializing in AI-enabled video platforms needed a critical infrastructure provider to help them expand into EMEA. BIGO landed on legacy Digital Realty's Frankfurt campus. Interxion's capabilities across the region further solidifies the selection of their ideal partner. We were also able to support the 5G aspirations of a global Fortune 100 service provider by meeting their financial growth and power density requirements. We are continuing to build on our global momentum in the second quarter, and we look forward to helping customers achieve their goals during these uncertain times. Turning to our backlog on page 13. Standalone Digital Realty's curve backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stepped up from $116 million at year-end to $122 million at the end of the first quarter. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit better than our long-term historical average at four and a half months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 14, which again excludes Interxion, we signed $92 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. Activity was heavily skewed to our colocation business, and the weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little over three years. While the positive mark-to-market on colocation renewals largely offset turnkey and PBB roll downs for an average cash re-leasing spread across the product types of negative 1.5%. As you may have seen, our guidance calls for cash re-leasing spreads to be down low single digits. Please keep in mind that our 2020 guidance does include Interxion, whereas we have not reflected Interxion results in our first quarter leasing statistics. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions and metro areas, we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals, the lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerge in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points to 87.2%, largely due to positive absorption in Northern Virginia and Dallas. Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7% due to downtime related to record expirations in 2019 and reflecting a 40 basis point FX headwind. Our full year guidance implies improvement going forward. And barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to economic risk mitigation strategies on page 15. The U.S. dollar continued to decline relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results, from the top to the bottom-line. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses that have been most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our April rent collections are in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 2% of total revenue. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 11.6% year-over-year. As you may recall, there were several onetime items in 1Q 2019 affecting the year-over-year comparison, including a $0.065 U.K. tax benefit, another $0.065 of interest income on the Brookfield bridge loan and a full quarter contribution from consolidating Ascenty prior to closing the joint venture with Brookfield on the last day of the year ago quarter, whereas we had nearly a full quarter of dilution from the Mapletree asset sales in 1Q 2020. Excluding these non-comparable items, the year-over-year growth would have been up 1.2%. Core FFO per share missed consensus by $0.03 but was $0.03 ahead of our internal forecast, driven by strong leasing performance and operating expense savings. By our estimation, the first quarter miss relative to consensus was entirely due to the share count. Its actual results were 5% to 6% ahead of consensus on the top line and EBITDA. And most street models did not reflect the 54 million additional shares outstanding for 18 days upon closing of the Interxion combination in mid-March. As you may have seen from the press release, we opportunistically issued a little over $650 million of equity on our ATM in late March and early April. In addition, we now expect to draw down our forward equity offering sooner rather than later this year. Our 2020 guidance includes just over $0.25, or 4% headwind comprised of three items; the opportunistic equity issuance and accelerated drawdown of our equity forward; FX and COVID-19 impact, including modest drag from development delivery delays in select markets; and finally, the earlier-than-expected closing of our combination with Interxion, along with additional investments in the Interxion business to fund future growth. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 16, we expect the quarterly run rate to dip down by $0.06 in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our recent investment activity, including Ascenty in Latin America and Interxion in EMEA, along with our capital recycling initiative and balance sheet management, have lowered the per share bar in 2020. But we believe each of these initiatives will create long-term value and set us up for accelerating growth and a greater share of global customer wallet going forward, while still providing for a well-covered dividend, which the Board raised for the 15th consecutive year in February. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. Fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.8 times, while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 6.6 times as of the end of the first quarter, primarily due to showing 100% of Interxion's debt on our balance sheet as of March 31, whereas it contributed just 18 days of EBITDA in the first quarter. Pro forma for a full quarter contribution from Interxion and the Westin Building, the equity issuance activity on the ATM after quarter end and settlement of the $1.1 billion forward equity offering, net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over five times, while fixed charge coverage is just under five times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management, we have ample liquidity to fund our capital spending with nearly $250 million of cash on the balance sheet as of March 31, another $1.7 billion of equity coming in post quarter end and $2 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities. The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 18, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 18, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Shawn, would you please begin the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking the question. This is Bora Lee [ph] on for Jon. I guess first of all, given the widespread pause in place in Singapore for new permitting and moratorium on permitting in place in Amsterdam, are there any other markets where this is happening? And do you have any update on when these restrictions might be lifted? 
Andrew Power: Thanks for the question. This is Andy speaking. I think given the Digital team on the call is in different locations right now to social distancing, Bill asked that I quarterback handing off the questions. I think I actually can start the first one and let that team chime in. So, Singapore, obviously, is a country that was early out of the woods and now kind of back in lockdown, so -- and having some impact to our delivery time there. And Amsterdam, a different story, not really COVID-related. It's more of the government's restrictions on certain locations. I would say, in Amsterdam, we've done a very nice job about being ahead of the game there with planning for an existing now multiple campuses with our combination with Interxion, in addition to tying up some lands that are outside the restricted area. I don't -- I'm not aware of restrictions that are akin to the Amsterdam scenario really elsewhere in the portfolio. There's obviously markets where we're running up to supply constraints. I think that Amsterdam scenario is -- lends itself to the incumbent players, like Digital, and keep some of the new entrants out for sure. We are seeing more COVID-related impacts that have government intertwined. Toronto is a market where we have our campus is under construction, building out future capacity, and that the government kind of leaned in and put a halt for some time before reopening, in particular, Hillsboro, Oregon, where we're building out a campus that's significantly pre-leased. That less government restrictions, I'd say, some -- we saw a significant amount of absenteeism that caused some delay in the labor side. But again, this is just a handful of select markets where we saw some potential disruptions to our deliveries that will impact our 2020, which we try to lay out in the script. I wouldn't say it's a widespread phenomenon within our portfolio at Digital.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And for my follow-up question, a few days ago, you announced the launch of Digital Realty Data Hub featuring NVIDIA for the rapid deployment of AI and machine learning workloads. Could you provide further color on this announcement? Are there similar ones yet to come? And what are some illustrative customer use cases that DLR is seeing or expects to see?
Andrew Power: Thank you. I'll toss that to Bill, start there.
Bill Stein: Thanks, Andy. So, we're absolutely delighted to partner with NVIDIA to extend machine and deep learning to data center to accelerate artificial intelligence. Digital is an early stage partner with NVIDIA. And together, we've pre-certified 24 locations around the world. Our Data Hub solution featuring NVIDIA DGX PODs provides buyers with a validated reference architecture and solution starter kit for rapid AI deployments on PlatformDIGITAL around the world. The combination of NVIDIA DGX and PlatformDIGITAL enables a secure and performance data center architecture for enterprises at any scale. We do have a pipeline of similar ones. In addition to NVIDIA, we've released solution offers with Cisco, IBM and Vapor IO. This is part of the PlatformDIGITAL road map that we published last November when we launched the platform. We're seeing multiple customer use cases across many industries. We've captured multiple customer wins across financial services, transportation and logistics and IT service industries. All of these customers are looking to unbound data processing and exchange limitations to enable intelligent insights for their business. Initial use cases include complex trade analytics and risk, AI-based cybersecurity and route optimization for connected vehicles. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. First question, I guess I'm interested in what you've seen in terms of demand, the pipeline and the funnel as a result directly or amidst COVID, first and foremost. So, I know the first quarter, there wasn't much going on in terms of time, which we had coronavirus, although globally, certainly, there might have been. It happened a little bit earlier in the quarter. But I'm speaking more specifically to what's gone on in -- took place in March, the end of March and then into April and sort of the velocity you've seen and maybe you could parse that across your customer base a little bit. Thank you.
Bill Stein: Hey thanks, Jordan. I hope you and your family are healthy and safe as well. I'm going to toss it over to Corey to talk pipeline in response to your question there.
Corey Dyer: Hey Jordan, thanks a lot and I appreciate the sentiment on -- for everybody and how COVID is affecting everyone across the globe. I'll probably answer kind of in two parts, a little bit about just what our pipeline looks like and then separately, I'll try to give you a sense of what the COVID impact of that was, if that makes sense for you, Jordan. But I would tell you that from a demand perspective overall, it's really been a strong demand. It's really picked up and continued through when we did our launch of PlatformDIGITAL in Q4. Q1 has kind of continued on that momentum. It was really well received by customers, partners in the industry. You guys -- we just mentioned the NVIDIA sign off, which is just another example of customers and partners adhering to our platform and some of the unique values that we have. Bill, in his opening remarks, mentioned that IDC MarketScape ranked us as a leader in the data center space. And then we saw the same follow-through on our enterprise new logos. So, the new logos, we had -- 75% of them were enterprise. Still staying on kind of that demand aspect and looking forward to Q2, really strong pipeline that we have, continuing that momentum around PlatformDIGITAL that we just started on. And so when we look at it kind of late-stage pipeline, quarter-on-quarter, it's up over 50%, 100% year-on-year. We go and look at new logo pipeline, it's similar kind of robust metrics. And then looked at the enterprise to see if we had anything there thinking who would maybe be the most impacted, Jordan. And a really strong pipeline on our enterprise side. So, happy with it across the board. The concern we have is just as you would expect. We've got some enterprises that are being impacted by it. And those that you would expect where we saw some slowdowns there. But on a net, it was taken up by new enterprise opportunities, CSPs, content network and really interconnection growth across the board. So, I would tell you that the industry, you would expect to get affected work. But on net for us, we still have plenty of demand and a strong pipeline going forward. Jordan, I hope that helps.
Jordan Sadler: That's helpful. And then maybe one for you, Andy, on the guide. I think pretty disappointing relative to where The Street is and where expectations were. And I know you had to layer in quite a bit between Interxion and COVID, and I appreciate the $0.25 headwinds. But even relative to the $1.57 you printed in 1Q, just annualizing the $0.25 of headwinds, it seems to point to very limited growth from new business and I know we're already in the year. But I guess it just seems a bit light. And I guess the other sort of comment would be around the re-leasing spreads. The Digital portfolio is a much larger portfolio than Interxion's. I know we've previously talked about maybe being shrewd the most difficult times, and I feel like fundamentals are only have only gotten better, increased demand, less ability to supply. What sort of -- what am I missing?
Andrew Power: So, thanks, Jordan. Let me try and tackle this. So -- and one quick clarification. The first quarter came in above our internal expectations at $1.53. I think you might have said $1.57. So close enough for what -- where you're getting at here. So -- and we certainly had a complicated quarter for our friends on -- in the research community to follow us. I think when we're tracking the 23 or so analysts that cover us, I think we -- we only got to around seven that we're able to get all the moving parts, including interaction closing orderly into the numbers. So where we saw consensus, if you did the math, including the interaction in the share count and the like, was closer to 630-ish. And relative to beginning of the year and today, I think the things that changed that we try to highlight in our prepared remarks are -- roughly total a little over $0.25 of impact. Three buckets, the first two buckets being the major components. First one is we took this time in the context of certainly uncertain times, probably more so outside of our industry, but broader capital markets disruption and the like to do some balance sheet management. We opportunistically issued $650 million under our ATM, and we plan to bring our equity forward down sooner. That, I would say is, call it, $0.08 or so of the $0.25, and that was intentional. And that was intentional in the broader backdrop that was intentional because we also see investment opportunities to fund future growth. Hence, we've kind of took a more conservative balance sheet posture. The second major component, what I'd call on the FX and COVID impact maybe, call it, $0.13 or so in total. And I'd say it's roughly 50/50 between those two buckets. COVID has some smaller items like some -- a more conservative posture on our estimations of bad debt expense. But the major COVID item, I would say, is really going back to my response to the first question, was we are seeing certain jurisdictions in select markets putting restrictions on our ability to bring labor to the sites. So, a fantastic -- it's fantastic to have our global platform across 20 countries in 44 markets. But when you have a country like Singapore that was originally out of woods in terms of its exposure and then kind of goes back into lockdown, our 50-megawatt shell or, call it, 11 or 12-megawatt pre-leasing already, is going to certainly get delayed a couple of months. And that episodic thing in a handful of markets, which I highlighted, is certainly going to put a little dent into our revenue that is going to come across the P&L in 2020. But again, temporary impact and really goes back to the fluid dynamics around the COVID situation. And then last but not least, I would say, call it, the small minority, let's say, is Interxion related. I don't think when we stood at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd have the good fortune of navigating numerous European government jurisdictions and multiple shareholder votes and closed the transaction at the middle of March like we did. We initially estimated 1% to 2% dilution on that transaction, but the pull forward in earlier timing. And I would say a little bit, we're seeing some investment opportunities in our combined EMEA business, which will be $0.01 or so till 2020. That kind of rounds up the minority of the $0.25. Net-net, this is obviously -- we are always looking to grow our earnings as fast as possible. At the same time, I would look at our combination with Interxion, our balance sheet management, be it our cap or recycling or even the more smaller opportunistic things like further equitizing the balance sheet to fund future growth opportunities are really setting us up for more accelerating growth. And also at the same time, I don't think doing anything that's reckless in terms of our dividend coverage and the like. And then turning briefly to the re-leasing spreads. Taking a step back for half a second. Four of the five of the last years four of the last five years, we've actually had positive re-leasing spreads, if you go back to our supplemental to each of those years. This year, we're obviously guiding to down slightly. This is a stat where we usually overestimate the negative impact and outperform relative to guidance, as you saw just last year. In any given quarter, they could have an episodic customer that is renewing with an above-market lease. Usually, those transactions, be it any form of renewal, is something that's additive to our commercial negotiations where we can help these customers across multiple products, multiple geos, new business and renewals in a kind of comprehensive fashion. So, I don't think we're out of the woods on every single one of our contracts being below market whatsoever. And I think the trend is moving in the right direction in the stat. And we're certainly looking forward to getting to -- in the green territory on that stat moving forward and overall driving higher organic growth. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Hi, good afternoon. Since this might be one of the last quarters that your reporting metrics for the heritage DLR business, back when you filed the S-4 for the transaction with Interxion, it was inferred from there that organic growth for the -- just heritage Digital business would be about 5%. Can you frame what that growth rate looks like that's embedded in the guidance for 2020 in terms of the expectation for heritage Digital revenue growth?
Bill Stein: I think -- honestly, if you look at the results so far, Interxion really only contributed, call it, two weeks or so of contribution. So, the first quarter results is primarily Digital. And just to reiterate, we did really do the facts and circumstances of moving to a work-from-home environment literally the day we closed Interxion. Put all of our statistics in here, excluding Interxion's, you could see the entire legacy or classic Digital business fundamentals. And in terms of contribution to guidance, I was not on the fourth quarter call, but Matt Mercier stepped in and did a very nice job, I thought, in laying out some kind of guide rails for legacy Digital, including on a standalone basis, what our top line would be and adjusting for the ins and outs of our dispositions and capital recycling, what we've called organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digits in 2020, which I would affirm is still accurate. And I would also -- we also stated that we had industry-leading EBITDA margins, which I would also affirm is still accurate. And I think that -- I'd say that's accurate, even pro forma for our Interxion combination, which obviously is a lower EBITDA margin business. So, just the comments were made back in February in terms of our organic growth profile, I would say, flow through into the guidance. And I would say the organic growth of the Digital business was a major driver of the outperformance from our internal perspective in the first quarter, which was a largely Digital-only quarter.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: And now our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Thank you. Maybe just with the Q1 and sort of breaking things down with the -- your Q1 results, the $823 million. Can you just maybe break that down in terms of the organic DLR versus what Interxion's contribution? Obviously, we go back into the math, but just wanted to get a sense of what those numbers were. And was -- were there anything else? And then with that, I thought you were going to be consolidating the Westin Exchange. What's -- what was the can you just maybe comment on what that was in the quarter?
Bill Stein: Sure. Thanks, Erik. So, just to be clear, you're asking kind of to unpackage the $823 million of revenue in the quarter in terms of contribution from each of the major transactions. The -- is -- that was your question, correct?
Erik Rasmussen: Yes. Thank you.
Bill Stein: So, of the $823 million, and I'm kind of bridging you between the quarter's changes, I would say, Interxion was probably like a $40 million -- almost $47-ish million contribution and the rest was really the ins and outs of Digital. And I think we put a cap rate and a return on the Westin purchase, about a 5.8% return so that you can kind of back into flipping that from an unconsolidated joint venture to a consolidated joint venture investment. And Erik, we're also more than happy to follow up post the call or work through any of the granularity. We understand when you joint venture and recycle $1.4 billion of capital in the last 90-plus days, buy out a partner on a $700 million asset and close a $8.5 billion strategic combination in Europe, it's not a simple quarter from anyone's modeling perspective.
Erik Rasmussen: No, definitely. I appreciate that. And I will do that. And then maybe just my follow-up on Northern Virginia, it seems to be recovering and we're hearing of improved demand. How are you seeing this market and your opportunities? And can you comment on other markets where you're seeing an improvement versus what you thought just 90 days ago? And that's maybe just not here in the U.S., but obviously, now with Interxion, you have a lot more visibility into that European base as well.
Bill Stein: Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with like a little kind of market tour, and I'll ask Corey to chime in a little bit on what he's seeing on the customer standpoint. Northern Virginia was a very strong quarter. It was, I believe, our top quarter top market in terms of overall signings. It was strong on the colocation or connection front. Some great startings at pretty attractive pricings into our colo suites on that campus. We also were very successful in backfilling into that market, numerous recently vacated suites. So, that's kind of high flow-through leasing activity because the suite is already built and constructed. And lastly, it was the home of our largest transaction for the quarter where we imported from out of region, a fairly sizable transaction all on the hyperscale front. So all around, pretty strong. I would say it's not a market that is completely out of the woods. I would attribute our success there due to a few things. One, our offering is really an entire platform offering, numerous of our sales into any market are going to include numerous products and numerous geos at the same time. Two, we have a very large installed and growing customer base that wants to grow with adjacency; and then three, in Northern Virginia, we have, I believe, the longest runway of future-proofing our customers' growth in terms of capacity, potential build-out. And I would say, while more commodity-like providers on the periphery in North Virginia are certainly cutting rates, that kind of almost internal competitive [Indiscernible] for our customers to get specific suites on various products within the various campuses in Ashburn certainly accrued itself to our platform and generate better economics. If you can turn to kind of quickly the rest of North America, brighter spots, I would say, is Toronto. It has been a very attractive location where we're quickly going through capacity there, and we're about to launch our colocation suite, which will be a great new entrance to that market. Northern -- New York City Metro, both in the city and also in New Jersey has been seeing a rebound. That's been on the colocation connectivity side as well as, I'd say, call it, half a megawatt to two megawatt-type scale as enterprise-type demand, financial service in particular. Santa Clara remains very tight. Other markets of robustness outside of North America, Asia-Pacific had a very strong quarter. Early signs in the smaller dollars or kilowatts from our Osaka launch of colocation interconnection, we're off to a great start there. And our SIN12 building, I think I mentioned, has had wins with a major enterprise, a leading Asia-Pacific bank as well as a major CSP. Swinging down to Latin America, São Paulo had success where we export demand from a European-based customer on the enterprise side into the colo connectivity suites in our Ascenty platform. And then last but not least, in Europe, we -- in our prepared remarks, we mentioned the strength of selling some Asia customers into our legacy Digital colo facility in Frankfurt. The London Cloud House is off to a good start. And then last but not least, Interxion, which we didn't kind of put on the page in our results, I would reiterate, did a very healthy $10 million of signings. It was a very attractive book of business with no major signing above 180 kilowatts. I believe the connectivity signings were close to 35-plus percent of the signings. So, also a very successful quarter in terms of the Interxion activity. Corey, anything to add on that? 
Corey Dyer: You gave him pretty much a rock star world tour of what we've got going on, so I was trying to think of what to add. I guess I would say, Andy, is the only thing to add is that we're really happy with what we've seen in Ashburn, if that's the base question here. We've had deals each of the last couple of quarters that have helped us. And we're continuing to see demand in that area that we're going to continue to source and take care of. It puts us in a position to think about expanding and growing more there. And then as you said, if you looked across our regions, each of our regions was really successful this year or in this last quarter, as well as AP just going gangbusters for us. So, I think you did a great job summarizing it. But we're happy with how PlatformDIGITAL has been received by customers. We're seeing a lot more multi-metro deals come through and a big pickup on the enterprise wins with new logos. So, I appreciate it, Andy.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi. I just wanted to ask about the base business. And given that there's so many puts and takes on the financial side, just to focus on what's going on with the underlying business. It seems like $70 million in signings has been pretty steady over the past four quarters. Is that the new normal? And is it fair to say, even though Northern Virginia contributed, it doesn't seem like you had a kind of out of trend win there. And later on, that could boost that overall signings number from $70 million to a much bigger number.
Andrew Power: Thanks Richard. So, I would say -- I mean we've showed a pretty consistent stair step up over now several quarters. And each and every quarter has gotten a little bit better in terms of its volume and composition on multiple fronts. So, we're at just under 75, excluding anything for Interxion and it was very diverse. As we mentioned, APAC was a big contributor. It was -- Northern Virginia was a solid contributor, but I wouldn't say it took -- stole the entire show. And I think that if you got to really to peel the onion, going back to some of Corey's and Bill's comments, either in our prepared remarks, very healthy new logos. When you add up -- our new logos up, we're up to 120 new logos. So I don't -- usually don't like to annualize that, but on a 4% -- 4,000 customers, we're talking like almost 12% new logo generation growth from the combined platform. So, very pleased on numerous other key performance indicators and I think you heard a little bit about Corey's outlook on the pipeline, moving it into 2Q. 
Richard Choe: And as a follow-up, the interaction of 10 million signings; is that kind of the normal level? Or was that kind of them having a very good quarter? And how should we think about that going forward?
Andrew Power: I'm pretty sure -- I don't believe David's ever given a signings pipeline or even a signings number. So, I'm not going to be the first one to unpack that on public air here. But I'm sure some transactions probably didn't get done during the quarter. I would say Europe, in particular, was in the middle of the COVID crisis a lot sooner than the United States. But I was pretty pleased when I saw close to 10 million of signings with that healthy consistency, numerous -- across numerous markets and so connectivity rich.
Richard Choe: It's a nice contribution. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just you guys have talked about in the past a goal of getting to maybe 5%, 7% core FFO per share. When you think about 2021 and getting past some of the things that you've talked about that are impacting you specifically in 2020, is that still a fair approximation for where you would aspire to see growth going, particularly with the leasing numbers that have been so strong? And then secondly, well, I appreciate you don't guide to AFFO, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color on some of the metrics that go into it, such as straight-line and market rent amortization. I mean some of us do focus a little bit more on that metric as well. Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks Colby. So, I think our growth objectives for the business remain consistent. The only ounce of caution I put then is we're obviously in a whole brand-new world here that could have interim drag or longer-term acceleration, overall digital transformation that could further emphasize the growth of our business. But I think that mid to high single-digits kind of growth in our recurring cash flows or FFO, AFFO per share is still the bogey to -- or hurdle to shoot for and overcome. Going to the adjustments to FFO and to AFFO, really straight-line rents is just a GAAP phenomenon where we essentially kind of include the rental escalations or bumps. And depending on where the customers' contracts are in their life cycle, it can have a positive or negative impact. And depending on what type of -- whether customers ramping into our space or not can obviously have an impact. And the above and below market amortization is also a non-cash impact as well. So, I'm happy to -- with 4,000 customers in the breadth of our business, there's a lot of ins and outs that go into that number. If you want to ask another -- I'm not sure -- maybe I'm not hitting the heart of what you're seeking to understand there in terms of the impact.
Colby Synesael: Sure. Well, just given the interaction and how that's a slightly different business than what you guys had what your business predominantly is, I was just wondering if there's any color you can give. But maybe more simply, would you expect AFFO to be notably below, above, similar to your core FFO? Maybe that's an easier way of asking it. And then, I guess, since if you're not able to answer that question, just curious, just in terms of COVID-19, if you're seeing, as a result of that, some of the larger hyperscalers are shifting more to an outsourced model opposed to a self-build model, given perhaps their own desires to reduce their own CapEx expense in this environment?
Andrew Power: Yes, I think the more elegant answer to your first question is what's a combination of consolidating our highly connected colocation facility, the Westin Building and our combination with Interxion. Our mix of business is certainly moving much more towards a more granular customer base, more network-oriented customers. We're obviously going after the enterprise customer in hybrid multi-cloud environments. And that customer mix is going to have less -- much, much less of, call it, 15-year steady Eddie bump contracts, which is going to be at the end of the day, narrow, I believe, the gap between our FFO and AFFO per share over time versus if -- going back to our legacy, much more legacy business even -- kind of tell us kind of five years back. And then going to your second question on -- maybe I'll turn this over to Corey or Chris to answer about the second question, about customer behaviors or the buying patterns of the hyperscalers. 
Chris Sharp: Yes, I can help out with this one, Andy. And I think on the hyperscalers, Colby, there are requirements. They've got them all across the globe. So we're well positioned to help out where they need to look at it. And they generally handle that demand with a combination of like their self-build and their -- and then outsourcing to groups like us. Many of the hyperscaler requirements also involve compute nodes combined with connectivity. And I think we're really well positioned just to take care of them from a full spectrum of data center solutions, both highly connected and wholesale. And I think, while you might hear that some of them want to in-source for whatever different reasons or build their own, we haven't seen that come through in the pipeline yet, and we haven't seen that come through in any kind of change in our customer conversations and our engagements with them, is what I'd I tell you, Colby. Thanks.
Colby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for any closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Stein: Thanks Shawn. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we enhanced the value of our platform, successfully closing on our highly strategic combination with Interxion as well as the acquisition of the Westin Building in Seattle and the Mapletree portfolio sale. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with community outreach initiatives, a renewable wind energy contract and new additions to our Board. Third, we maintain steadfast support for our customers, prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the opportunistic issuance of $650 million of equity capital. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope you all stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Sean. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and SVP Finance, Matt Mercier; CIO, Greg Wright; CTO, Chris Sharp; and Corey Dyer, EVP Sales and Marketing, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Investors are encouraged to read the proxy statement and prospectus with respect to the proposed transaction between Digital Realty and interaction and other relevant documents filed with the SEC because they contain important information. You may obtain a free copy of these documents from the SEC's website at sec.gov or from the websites, our Investor Relations department of either Digital Realty or Interxion. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein. I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We extended our global footprint, reaching agreements to a combine with Interxion and to enter India. We enhanced our portfolio quality, recycling capital from fully stabilized assets into network dense interconnection hubs. We launched platform digital, a unique global data center platform designed to enable customers to scale digital business. We advanced our sustainability initiatives with incremental renewable energy agreements and several industry awards. Last but not least, we've further strengthened the balance sheet, locking in long-term debt and preferred equity capital at record low coupons. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. We advanced each of these three pillars in 2019, culminating with the addition of a new member to the Digital family, and we'd like to congratulate our friend and partner Andy Power along with his wife Sarah on the arrival of their baby girl Power Madison Elizabeth earlier this week. We continued to expand our global footprint. The highlight was, of course, our entry into a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction that will create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions. We also executed a memorandum of understanding with the Adani Group to pursue a joint venture in India and we are actively exploring opportunities to plant our first flag in this vast untapped market with tremendous growth potential. Yesterday we announced an agreement with Clise Properties to acquire a 49% ownership interest in the Westin Building Exchange in Seattle shown here on Page 3. The Westin Building is one of the most densely interconnected facilities in North America. It is home to leading global cloud content and interconnection providers with over 150 carriers and more than 10,000 cross-connects. As you are probably aware, we've closed $1.4 billion of asset sales over the past three months. Pro forma for the asset sales of Westin Building and the combination with Interxion, network dense performance sensitive assets will make up nearly half our portfolio, up from a little over one-fourth as of September 30th. Taken together, you can see the strategic direction uniting each of these individual pieces. We are deliberately recycling capital from stabilized assets and reinvesting in higher growth opportunities sacrificing near-term earnings growth for long-term value creation. We've also made significant strides extending our sustainability leadership as outlined here on Page 4. In October, we announced renewable energy agreements in Northern Virginia and Oregon. In November, we were honored to receive NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the third consecutive year. In January, we earned EPA ENERGY STAR Certification for exemplary energy performance in 29 data centers. The second year in a row we are in the most ENERGY STAR Certifications in the sector. Also in January, we issued €1.4 billion of green euro bonds. This was our third green bond issuance, and we are now the largest U.S. REIT green bond issuer. Our green bond framework is aligned with ICMA Green Bond Principles, with a second party opinion provided by Sustainalytics. Also in January, and away from Digital, some of our largest customers and investors unveiled sweeping sustainability commitments with a particular emphasis on improved disclosure for shareholders. We have included SASB-aligned disclosures in our 10-K for the past two years and our ESG Report includes extensive additional information about our approach to managing the impact of climate change. Our ESG Report also addresses relevant themes of the TCFD framework. We are committed to managing our environmental impact and then optimizing our use of energy and natural resources, because we believe it's the right thing to do, and because it matters to our customers, our investors and our employees. We are committed to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and serving a social purpose. In January, we announced the appointment of two new directors, expanding the size of our Board from nine to 11. The governance principle behind our Board refreshment philosophy is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. The average tenure on our Board is less than six years, whereas, our Chairman and former Chairman have both served on the Board since our IPO. We are particularly excited about the new perspectives and expertise our two new Directors will bring to the Board. Specifically, Alexis Black Bjorlin brings unique connectivity and customer perspective from her experience at leading global providers across the cloud and communications value chain. While Lieutenant General Dash Jamieson brings in valuable cyber security expertise from her tenure as former Director of U.S. Air Force Intelligence Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Cyber Effects Operations. We are delighted to welcome them both to our Board and we look forward to benefiting from their leadership and expertise for years to come. Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on Interxion. In early January, we raised €1.7 billion of euro bonds with a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 1%. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from these bonds to refinance Interxion 's outstanding debt. The bond offering is not contingent upon completion of the combination with Interxion, but if the combination is not consummated before the end of next January, then we will be required to redeem €1.4 billion of the euro bonds at 101% of par. In late January, the SEC declared our S-4 registration statement effective and we launched the exchange offer for shares of Interxion. Purely after our registration statement went effective, Interxion filed its Schedule 14D-9, which included the background on the transaction from their perspective, fairness opinions from their advisers and their Board's unanimous recommendation in support of the exchange offer. Once the Schedule 14D-9 was filed, both companies began mailing proxy materials for our respective shareholder meetings, which are scheduled for February 27. In terms of the regulatory process, we've received clearance from the antitrust authorities in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands and we are now just waiting for decisions on our foreign investment filings in France, and Germany where we currently own and operate data centers. In terms of integration, planning activities are underway, but until the transaction closes, it remains business as usual and we continue to operate as two independent companies. In terms of timing, we remain on-track and subject to regulatory clearance and other closing conditions, we expect to close sometime in the second quarter. Let's turn to Page 6. During the fourth quarter, we launched PlatformDIGITAL, a continuation of our focus on the customer in an evolution of our Connected Campus strategy as we also unveiled our platform roadmap to underpin the next wave of digital transformation in response to market demand. Enterprise customers are demanding a global fit for purpose data center platform experience to rapidly deploy, connect and host distributed IT infrastructure to scale their digital business. To address this demand, we introduced four solution offers productizing specific combinations of space, power, cross-connect and management controls. These solutions enable enterprise deployments of network, security and data infrastructure at global points of business presence. The launch of PlatformDIGITAL has been well-received by industry, including customers, partners and industry analysts. At MarketplaceLIVE in November, Cisco, IBM and Vapor launched partner validated versions of PlatformDIGITAL solutions and numerous industry analysts published highlight reports. We are excited about the PlatformDIGITAL launch as it positions us to capture the significant incremental addressable market by serving the global needs of the enterprise. Let's turn to the favorable secular demand drivers underlying our business along with industry analysts recognition of the leadership role Digital Realty has to play here on Page 7. According to the IDC CEO Survey, digital transformation is expected to enable over $18 trillion of economic value add over the next three years. Gartner recently paid enterprise global IT spending at almost $4 trillion, reflecting rapidly growing investment to build distributed IT and data center infrastructure. During the fourth quarter Digital Realty was named as a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape Colocation and Interconnection Services Vendor Assessment Report, noting that PlatformDIGITAL provides a global scale platform to enable digital transformation in a consistent modular basis. We are honored by the strong confirmation of Digital Realty's unique positioning to capture the global data center demand opportunity. We continue to see early indicators of digital transformation demand on our platform, we captured a record number of new logos last year led by our enterprise vertical, as these customers begin to deploy and connect components of their digital infrastructure globally. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs, we believe, we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results.
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. We delivered another solid quarter of leasing activity with particular strength in APAC and the Americas, we signed total bookings of $69 million, just shy of our all-time second best, fourth quarter bookings included a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $62 million, with a weighted average lease term of a little over six years, including an $8 million colocation contribution. I would like to point out that we see the lines blurring between product types and the distinction is becoming less meaningful. As a result, we expect to evolve our disclosure in the coming quarters to more closely align with our customers' buying behavior and the way we manage the business. We aim to consistently improve the transparency of our financial disclosures and as always, we welcome additional input from analysts and investors in the process. During the fourth quarter, we added 51 new logos. This was our third highest new logo quarter and our two best came in 3Q '19 and 2Q '19. For the full year, we added 250 new logos. Nearly, 40% better than the prior year, underscoring the traction we're gaining within our enterprise segment. In APAC, we saw strength in Sydney, Singapore and Osaka. In the Americas, we quietly leased another 18 megawatts and Ashburn during the fourth quarter and similar to the previous quarter our biggest deal in this market was just 6 megawatts, demonstrating broad-based strengths of demand. As Andy predicted last quarter, the Ashburn pendulum has swung back a bit quicker than just about anyone expected a year ago. In the tremendous scale and the connectivity of our Ashburn Connected Campus outperformed in a crowded, competitive backdrop. On the heels of additional activities since year-end our Northern Virginia active development pipeline is now 100% pre-leased. We've not yet begun to see upward pressure on pricing given competitive supply elsewhere in the market, but rental rates have stabilized. We are beginning to field mutually exclusive requirements for the remaining capacity and available blocks of contiguous inventory are becoming scarce. Needless to say, while the Ashburn market is not entirely out of the supply and demand woods just yet, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for communications, infrastructure in the Commonwealth, as well as our position in the market, given the diversity of our large and growing installed base of customers seeking additional footprint on the campus, as well as the value of our strategic land holdings, which provide the longest run rate for their growth. Several specific fourth quarter wins speak directly to our ability to address customer needs with our global platform and full product spectrum offering. PathAI is the world's leading provider of AI-powered technology for advancing pathology research, using machine learning and deep learning techniques to drive towards faster, more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer. The Boston based startup partners with some of the world's largest life science companies, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, LabCorp and Gilead Sciences. As a company that was born in and until now operated exclusively in the cloud, this is PathAI's first deployment of physical infrastructure. Given the GPU intensive nature of their IT environment and the rapid growth, PathAI was struggling to control their monthly cloud spend. Their deployment into Digital Realty move-in ready capacity will enable them to pull over 80% of their GPU workload out of the cloud to better manage and predict the cost associated with their high performance computing environment. Our PlatformDIGITAL solution address multiple needs for a global social media provider, including the need for network point of presence with the ability to connect directly to our communities of interest locally and globally, as well as a testing environment for their larger deployment in the same location. This customer was able to leverage our Connected Campus and Internet Gateway, which is really the power of PlatformDIGITAL. The ability to connect to the subsea cable that provide substantial bandwidth for traffic to markets across Asia Pacific was another key driver. They trusted the Digital Realty team and we're confident, we can move quickly, think creatively and most importantly, execute. We enjoyed notable success, re-leasing previously occupied or move-in ready inventory with the U.S. based designer, developer, manufacturer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The Digital Realty team closed a multi-site, multi-country deal with this customer that included a combination of move-in ready locations whilst a large colocation deployment. Digital Realty was awarded the business due to our ability to quickly negotiate terms while remaining flexible in scope to be into market and expansion options. This win was a prime example of our global multi-product platform meeting our customers' digital transformation need. Last but not least, just to give you an example of the breadth of companies using PlatformDIGITAL to enable and help scale their business, we landed a deal this quarter with an advertising company that creates patented, world-class ad tech that delivers viewable high impact ad formats for brands, agencies and publishers looking to maximize ROI. They serve their global client base through an unmissable digital ad formats using patented ad serving technology. They selected Digital Realty because we offer a flexible solution they could customize as they grew, as well as connectivity to global Internet providers. Turning to our backlog on Page 11. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped up from $99 million as of September 30th, to a $116 million at year-end. The lag between signings and commencements during the fourth quarter was a bit better than our long-term historical average at four months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 12. We signed a $117 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. As you may recall, 2019 was our all-time high in terms of lease expirations and we signed over $500 million of renewal leasing in 2019, more than 50% higher than our previous record year with a weighted average lease term of nearly nine years. For the full year, we retained a little over 80% of expiring leases right in line with our long-term average while cash rents rolled down 1.3%, much better than our initial expectation of down high single-digits. As you may recall, we successfully executed both legacy deal our long-term top customer renewals, as well as the long-awaited legacy DFT customer renewal in 2019. As you can see from the lease expirations schedule on Page 13, less than 16% of the portfolio expires in any given year compared to the 23% we faced at the beginning of last year, which should set the stage for a low churn hurdle going forward. Aside from a few select supply constrained regions in metro areas, we have yet to see broad based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals, a lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rates and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerge in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of fourth quarter operating performance. Overall portfolio occupancy slipped 60 basis points to 86.8%, due to a handful of move-outs across the portfolio. After successfully navigating the record expiration year in 2019, we expect to generate positive net absorption in 2020 with improving portfolio occupancy on the heels of significant progress back filling this recently available capacity. For the full year, same capital cash NOI was down 4%, at the low end of our guidance and reflecting an 80 basis point FX headwind, continued pressure on property taxes as well as the record high lease expirations in 2019. Although, we still face some same-store headwinds from higher property taxes and downtime from refurbishing and re-leasing available capacity. We do expect to see improvement going forward. The U.S. dollar continued to climb relative to prior year exchange rates and FX represented roughly a 70 basis point headwind for the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 14. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with long-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 20 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth core FFO per share was down 3.6% year-over-year. Primarily due to two months of dilution from the Mapletree joint venture, while we are not providing formal guidance for 2020 at this time given the number of moving parts related to our pending strategic combination with Interxion, as well as the acquisition of our partners interest in the Westin Building. We do want to share a few forward-looking data points. On a standalone basis, we expect reported top line revenue growth for Digital Realty to be roughly flat year-over-year. Reflecting the full year impact of $1.4 billion of asset sales as well as a one quarter consolidated revenue contribution from Ascenty in 2019. Prior to closing the joint venture with Brookfield on the last day of 1Q '19. Adjusting for the revenue related to these private capital efforts and excluding any potential contribution from the Westin Building acquisition, we expect to generate organic revenue growth in the mid single-digits in 2020. We expect to maintain industry leading EBITDA margins in line with the prior year. In terms of financing, we have positioned the balance sheet with outsized liquidity in anticipation of closing the combination with Interxion. In January, we closed on the $557 million Mapletree portfolio sale at a 6.6% cap rate. We also successfully raised €1.7 billion of Euro bonds at a blended coupon of 1%. As you may recall, €1.4 billion of these Euro bonds will initially be used to refinance Interxion 's outstanding debt. These bonds included a special mandatory redemption provision and will be retired at 101% of par if the Interxion transaction does not close. Last but not least, we expect to settle our $1.1 billion equity forward in the third quarter. Hopefully, this high level color provides some context for our 2020 outlook and we expect to provide formal guidance, along with the underlying assumptions on the heels of closing the combination with Interxion. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 15. Net debt-to-EBITDA dropped by four-tenths of a turn to 5.7 times at year end. As proceeds from Mapletree joint venture were used to pay down debt. While fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.1 times. Pro forma for the Mapletree portfolio sale and settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt to EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at approximately 5 times. While fixed charge coverage is approximately 4.6 times. In terms of capital raising activity, in early October, we raised $345 million of perpetual preferred equity at 5.2%, an all-time low preferred equity coupon for Digital Realty. The next day we opportunistically tapped the euro bond market, raising approximately €550 million of 8.5 year paper at 1 and 8. Finally, in early January, we came back to the euro bond market and raised the €1.7 billion of euro bonds to refinance Interxion 's outstanding debt. Bill mentioned the weighted average maturity was approximately seven years and the weighted average coupon was approximately 1%. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 16, our weighted average debt maturities over six years, and including the January bond issuance, we whittled our weighted average coupon down another 25 basis points this quarter to 2. 9%, a little less than half our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 16, we have a clear run rate with virtually no near-term debt maturities and a no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also position the dual growth opportunities for our customers around the globe. Consistent with our long term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Sean, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: So my first question is around the transaction with Interxion and wondering, if you have any sort of thoughts about the anticipated timing around the foreign investment filings in France and Germany that you alluded to? And then as you proceed with planning, I know you're understandably limited to a degree, prior to the close. But what steps are you able to take over in Europe, prior to the transaction close to facilitate the integration once the deal is concluded?
Greg Wright: Jon, it's Greg Wright, let me take your question. The first one, with respect to where we are in the Interxion transaction, again, specifically, let's just go through a couple of things. We have received antitrust clearance as Bill said, in all three jurisdictions where we need approval in terms of Austria, Germany and The Netherlands. And that's on the antitrust clearance side. We're still awaiting decisions for the foreign investment filings in both France and Germany and look, we're - we think - one thing that's encouraging is we're already in both of those markets. And then trying to handicap, when that comes back, it's hard to do. But we will say, so far, we feel like we're making progress where we should be. And that's really all we have at this point, but we'll continue to announce to the market as we get additional findings there. That was your first question. On the second question, with respect to the steps to integration, we're currently planning for integration, as you could imagine. So far though, the primary focus has been on regulatory approvals going effective with the SEC and launching our exchange offshore. And now we have started to ramp up the integration effort with our colleagues, Interxion. We've gotten to the point where we're identifying people and teams to lead the integration. We've identified and we're working with integration consultants. And we were at a point where we're allowed to have certain people on both sides connect with each other. And clearly, we're making sure that we always consult with the lawyers to make sure we do the right things where we can and can't. So that's where we are with respect to that.
Jon Atkin: And then maybe just a follow-up more on the operational side, but PlatformDIGITAL, curious which metros you've been seeing the most commercial progress towards driving more connectivity driven and retail business. Any color around sales cycles and is there any kind of lengthening or shortening that you're seeing as well as kind of book-to-bill trends you talked about that, I think maybe in reference to wholesale, but anything sort of commercially as it relates to connectivity and then retail and PlatformDIGITAL would be interesting to hear.
Corey Dyer: Jonathan, this is Corey Dyer. Just going to help out with the PlatformDIGITAL question you had. And you asked a little bit about where we see it happening and where we see it taking route to begin. And I would tell you that, that platform digital really is about the enterprise and selling globally. So it's not really a situation where we're going to look at specific markets for it. But, that said, we launched it in November in MarketplaceLIVE, our new event that we put out or resurrected, really good feedback from all the media analysts, the analysts themselves. If you look the IDC report that we referenced earlier, it has just up in the leader segment for that along with one of their group. So really happy with how it's been rolled out and what we're seeing from traction with customers. So it's been great there, across the entire globe for us. We referenced earlier at couple of different wins. We had one of the largest investment banks, deployed six different network hubs with us to help out with their architecture, as well as servicing their customers and their employees. We also have a large agricultural firm do the same kind of deployment across multiple regions with us. So we've seen it pickup really well for us. And then, I think your questions around commencement date with the follow-on question I think Jordan. And what we think we're going to see is a little bit shortening of that. To your point around wholesale, we tend to see that commence a little bit later. These are going to drive a little bit more co-location for us, a lot more enterprise wins and you'll see a much quicker or shorter time between booking and commencement. I think that answered all the questions. Greg, do you have anything else?
Greg Wright: No, I think you've covered it. Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Market. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: So just wanted to circle up to the Seattle acquisition that you announced and discussed on the call here. The thought process on this transaction and the return profile relative to sort of legacy digital and perhaps as well as the growth profile versus Digital. And then, maybe thinking how this sort of corresponds or relate to sort of what you're doing over in Europe if at all.
Greg Wright: Jordan, this is Greg. Let me take that question. And like with respect to the Westin transaction, look, I think Bill had gone through really the merits of the transaction, whether it's boosting connectivity and network density. As he mentioned, this is the sixth most interconnected building in North America, you have 250 plus networks and over 10,000 cross connects. It really is the Internet gateway to the Pacific Northwest. And when you look at it in terms of connectivity. First of all, the way the process start is our partner has been a terrific partner, the Colony's family and their company. We've had a longstanding relationship with them. And they decided they wanted to sell. So for us, given how much and we've always said, our strategy has been that we want to increase our ownership to Internet Gateway and highly connected assets. And you really when you and that's your mandate, you can't get any better than the Westin building. So that was really the rationale behind it. In terms of returns, look, I would say I sort of a mid to high 5% cap rate, call that little less than 18 times on an EBITDA multiple basis. And in terms of growth projections, I mean. clearly, with any of these highly connected Internet Gateway buildings, we expect greater growth one than our portfolio average, just because these buildings as we know from Saramacca, 60 Hudson and the like. Those buildings are very special. And so you really do get outsize growth with them. So that was really the strategic rationale. In response to your question with respect to Europe, It's a very similar strategy when you really think about it, right? In terms of the Interaction transaction, I mean, we've said for quite some time now. We've had several objectives. One was we did want to expand our footprint in Europe. Secondly, we wanted to increase our ownership again of Internet Gateway and highly connected assets. We really were striving for a leading European platform and the team. And with all that, we were looking for a significant development platform. And needless to say, with Interaction, we get all of that. And so one of the real benefits to digital there. And then, we're going to get a broader footprint and product offering to serve our customers, which is most important. In Europe and beyond, we're going to be able to do a lot of what they do best and overlay that onto our portfolio. That too is going to result. just as we talked about the Westin building and accelerated growth. And ultimately, with the combination of all of that, it's going to result in increased value creation in our minds. So, I think I've covered your questions Jordan. If I missed, please let me know.
Jordan Sadler: No, I think you nailed it. I assume we're going to close in the next couple of months or so. But as it relates to, I'll move on to Ashburn, I wanted to come back. It sounded like, yes, you are quietly signing some significant leases here 18 meg. Can you maybe provide sort of the - were there any new logos in that market signed in the quarter? And then, anything else you can sort of, any other insight you can offer in terms of availability within your portfolio. You said you're, I thought you said part of, I think you said you were largely leased on your development there. But it sounds like you're sorting out some or scoping out some availability as well.
Matt Mercier: Yes, Jordan. This is Matt. So I think we've had a lot of success in Northern Virginia both this quarter and last quarter. This quarter Northern Virginia was our number one market for leasing. And overall, I think as we've said in the prepared commentary the market really come - really come back in the second half of the year, although absorption was down, down a bit from 2018 was actually higher than 2017 overall. I think to your question, specific question subsequent to end of the quarter, we leased another 20 megawatt in that market, 12 megawatt of those were in the - our development portfolio, which now brings add up to a 100% lease and another 8 megawatt was within our operating portfolio, which was already I think slightly over 90% leased, so, improves the occupancy in that market as well, so we're excited about the Northern Virginia market and we're continuing to see robust demand there.
Greg Wright: Yes. Thanks, Jordan. I'd also like to add a little bit of - just overall work that we've done in that market with our master plans and our land banking. It really allows us to be very prudent on how we can bring infrastructure to our customers in a very balanced manner. And I think new logos is one way to look at it, but it's also new types of infrastructure coming to market. So as you see AI and machine learning becoming more prevalent with all of these major providers, they want to be in proximity to their existing infrastructure. So the work that we've done in that market to master plan the right of ways, and really start to think through how we can future prove to their existing assets and provide a path for them to grow and launch all these new services. It's something that's very unique in that market and we continue to look at the future growth there. It'd be differentiated than what we can provide through a lot of those customers,
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: A couple if I could. I am just going to following on onto last question, it's probably pretty wide range a commentary, about kind of the funnel hyperscale demand in general. Maybe just tie that back to your commentary about Ashburn, what you're seeing there and this funnel in general. And then one of the interactions, if I could maybe remind me about the tax ability for that deal for Interaction Investor were seeing the other details behind that.
Corey Dyer: So Michael, this is Cory, I'll take the first part of the question around just the Ashburn competition, because I think that's what you're driving and we'll figure out somebody else for the other questions around the taxes. First off, yes, we've been successful in Ashburn, really about the value of our platform and really the diverse offering that we have. You think about what we've got with customers that are already there and how they're going to build onto it. So, we've got some customers that are already installed there and they're looking for adjacency in the campus, adjacency sometimes in the same building. So that helps us a lot. The same customers are often the scaling customers that we're working with globally and having the relationships from the contracts and everything we do to take care of them on a regular basis, helps us continue to win those deals and those opportunities. And then finally, yes, we're working through the Tetris game of how we accommodate the demand that's continue to come for us and make sure that we're there to take care of them and continuing to build on our success in Ashburn. So we're excited about it. And I think you also asked about our plat our qualified pipeline and we're feeling very strong about that. So we're well positioned for this year with a good start.
Michael Funk: And then just a follow-on.
Greg Wright: Mike. Let me...
Michael Funk: Sorry, go ahead
Greg Wright: Sorry, go ahead.
Michael Funk: I've got a follow-on, I think you clarified so, I mean are you saying that kind of diversity of the customer base is I guess 80 new Westin bookings that you're seeing more diverse customer base, whether it's industry wide or geographically. Is that part we're seeing here?
Matt Mercier: Yes. Let me, this is Matt. Let me take. I mean, we saw in Northern Virginia, we had pretty widespread activity across multiple customers within cloud, content and gaming, we're really leading the way within that market. And also, a number of international clients coming into Northern Virginia. So we had major signs of also APAC-based technology companies within that market as well in the quarter and we expect to continue that going forward.
Greg Wright: Yes. Hey, Michael, it's Greg. Sorry to interrupt you there before. And look, with respect to your second question on taxation of the Interxion transaction, you're right. Look something as we had outlined in the S-4, and I had actually mentioned on the original call. The deal is taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for U.S. holders of the Interxion shares. I think there's a couple of things to consider. Look, there were numerous tax considerations when we structured this deal. Their side was well represented and as was ours. We worked and ultimately, we're trying to find as what's the most efficient structure? Quite frankly that allow us to pay the price that we paid. And so, there's a couple of points in the structure we ultimately came up with was that structure, but a couple of points to highlight. One is not all shareholders pay U.S. tax some are exempt. And secondly, not all shareholders have the same basis, right. If somebody bought yesterday, they may have a very minimal gain than they sold today. Third, and I think most bankers will tell you, when you look at it. Taxable transactions are more common when the market value of what's being paid is significantly greater than the tax basis. And the reason for that obviously, is if you get the stepped-up basis, you get tax shelter going forward, which allows us to retain significantly more capital in the company to grow the business. Hence, the ability to pay. And then finally, I think it's important to note, that the way we've structured the transaction, that all tendering shareholders, it's structured to such that they will be able to avoid the 15% Dutch withholding tax as long as they tender. So I hope that answers your question with respect to the tax impact?
Michael Funk: No, that's great detail. Thank you very much, guys
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: I had two questions on some of the metrics. So, first, in terms of the commentary on cash releasing spreads, can you unpack a little bit more on what happened in the quarter and the experience that you're seeing between the retail and colo side of the business? And maybe some of the larger deployments from your customers? And then, there was a comment about expecting the same store NOI to be better? And I was wondering, if that meant for 2020 less of a decline or actually net positive growth? And just how to think about what's happening in the mix of all of that? Thanks.
Greg Wright: Yes, so let me take the - your second question, then we can circle back on your first one. So within the quarter, yes, we came in at in terms of stabilized NOI growth at the lower end. I think as we said in the commentary, we had about a 1% negative impact from FX rates. We also had another 1% coming in from higher, what I call uncontrollable cost largely around property taxes. And then I'd say, the remaining was tie to what we also discussed with - which was our record expiration year in 2019, despite also having roughly 80% retention, which is a pretty good metric. What I'd say though there is where we see the green shoots is in the fourth quarter, we're at least 15 megawatts into available inventory, which during that - during the quarter was about 40% of our total sign. And seeing in our backlog today, we have about 100 basis points of improved occupancy. In the vast majority of our available inventory right now, I think, is in high demand core markets that we feel pretty positive about the progress within our organic growth going forward. And I think that kind of - that tells also into releasing spreads. We had - within the - more within the year we release over like we said a record year we released over $500 million, slightly down but also did better than we expected. Next year we have a step down in volume of expirations in 2021. So we feel pretty positive about our mark-to-market experience going forward on that front.
Operator: Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thank you. Circling back on the deal you announced yesterday with the 49% - additional 49% the Westin property. What's the ability to sort of expand internally or is there any sort of adjacent land that you could potentially develop on that you can - capture additional opportunities?
Chris Sharp: Yes. Thanks, Erik, this is Chris. So, definitely we're very excited about the Westin Building. There is some ability to expand there and with some of the new offerings that Bill and Matt talked about in the script earlier around, some of the new offerings that we're bringing to market and how they are leveraging a lot more interconnection, we'll be able to provide more value to the existing customer base in there. And there is some more power that we can bring through there. and I think ownership really gives us that ability to really control exactly how we evolve that infrastructure and really make sure that we get the maximum return for our customers. And I'll turn the second part of your question over to Craig, and let him talk about adjacent lands.
Greg Wright: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Erik. Look, in terms of adjacent land. I think one thing, it's important, we do own the building next door with our partners at Clise that's important to remember. But I think, one thing about Westin, that it's not just the land next door. I think when you look at the connectivity into Canada and to Asia Pacific, even in to our Hillsboro project. When you look at all that, it is going to give us connectivity across the board and all the connection points. So that's one of the things that's great value with the project like the Westin, if it goes beyond just immediately adjacent - adjacency next door. But instead it goes much broader given the connectivity subsea cables and other things that provide us with that connectivity. So that would be my answer with that. But we - but if there is building, if there is land next door and if I know about it, please let us know because we liked the site. Thank you.
Erik Rasmussen: And then maybe just my follow-up. Any sort of update on Brazil and what sort of happening with the Ascenty, how much did they contribute to the America this quarter? And you're seen things start to what's your assessment of that market right now?
Greg Wright: Erik, it's Greg. Let me, why don't I answer the first question and then let - Let me, I'll start with second question and let Matt answer the first question. Look, I think when we look at Ascenty and you take a look at 2019 versus budget, we're on top of our writing for 2019. And I think a couple of important takeaways in that market, we saw a lot of the - large U.S, cloud service providers, take a lot of space over the last 24 months. With that said, I want to make sure we're clear on that. If you guys remember when we did that transaction there were 14 assets, there were eight existing assets and six under construction. Those 14 assets right now are 99% leased. So I think that's important. We look at underlying demand and the Ascenty platform remains in our opinion, the dominant platform in the region. So we think we're going to continue to see significant follow-on growth opportunities in additional markets like Chile. And we think, what you'll see is, again, I think there was a slight pause in this last quarter, but we'll see that like we see elsewhere, you'll see the, the demand starts to come back from the customers at that point. Once they absorb and we think you're going to see demand pick-up and we think Chris and his team have done a terrific job and they have an attractive pipeline for 2020. But in terms of how much it contributed Matt would be in better position to answer that.
Matt Mercier: Yes. I mean, I think. I think it was the contribution to the quarter was minimal. But what we're seeing right now in the first quarter is an acceleration. They've already signed in the first quarter, more than they did in the fourth quarter. So the positive momentum there in the South American portfolio, similar to what we're seeing in our overall portfolio as the cloud providers continue to ramp up, what we see as their demand overall.
Erik Rasmussen: All right, Matt. Thanks.
Chris Sharp: There is a little bit of - this is Chris, just on the PlatformDIGITALTM element that we talked about in the script. I think you're seeing early days of a lot of customers going into that market. And so we really see that ecosystem starting to really build out there, and it's a critical element that I think it's important to highlight the fact that it's a customer-led expansion down there. And so, it's still early days like Matt was referencing.
Operator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Interesting to get the commentary on Ashburn, that's encouraging. Can you just talk about to what extent there is sort of changes in the competitive dynamic there? Are you seeing any change in the kind of positioning of the private players in terms of committing capital or delaying builds any supply side changes? And then it's good to see the lease renewals being spread out from here, but are there any particular churn events we should be aware of or should -do you expect churn to be fairly linear through the year? Thanks.
Chris Sharp: No. I think, Simon, this is Chris, definitely Ashburn is a phenomenal market. It's very unique in the industry as we all know. But definitely from the private competitors, I think one of the things that's often overlooked is the fact that platforms matter in their increasing importance to our customers where they have access to broader revenue in every major market around the globe. And I think also the fact that you can land and expand with us and the work that we've done to build out land banks and beyond what some of these smaller private companies were able to achieve. So that's really a big differentiator for us. And then the overall supply like we had referenced earlier the fact that we've worked with our VMI, or vendor managed piece and a lot of our build outs there, we're very prudent in the way that we can accelerate and build capacity in a very flexible manner to meet that customer requirement and I kind of hand Greg off for the second part of your question there.
Greg Wright: Yes. Thanks, Chris. And Simon, I would say echo obviously everything Chris said, and the other important factor here is, look I think by definition when you look and see at the supply and demand situation, it's still exist in Northern Virginia that we'd be very surprised if you see any private new capital coming in deployed a development property in that market. Now what we have seen is some of that space, to Chris's point, where they may not be leased, that's where you see some of the concessions and a like occurring, but we're keeping our eye on that as well. Going back to Bill Stein's routes to be opportunistic and that's one of the reason Bill and Andy are always preaching that and Matt that we always keep the balance sheet pristine and be ready. So look, I think that's how, as Chris said, he talked about the advantages we're having in the market. We're having success. But we think that's because of our platform. And so look, we'll look to take advantage, otherwise, to the extent we can.
Chris Sharp: Yes. And...
Simon Flannery: And I think on churn...
Chris Sharp: At all. Yes, I'll hit on the churn. I mean I think as you kind of saw in our slides in our remarks, we had an elevated overall exploration pool this year, but our churn was relatively in line with our historical average around 80%. We've got a pretty material step down in our exploration pool for next year and we're actually expecting our churn to be even, well, I'm sorry, our retention to be even better in 2020 than what we experienced in 2019. So we're pretty positive about our overall portfolio and the management of the lease it's coming back at us in 2020.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ari Klein with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: On the M&A front, clearly a lot on the plate with Interxion on Westin in the works. But Equinix recently announced the acquisition of Packet. I was interested in your views on whether Digital could pursue similar types of deals as you build out the interconnection platform and are those things customers are asking for?
Chris Sharp: No. Thanks, Ari. This is Chris. I'm happy to talk through that. So it was definitely something that was expected in the market. I think the way that we look at this is we have a philosophical difference there, where we really look at our platform is being open. And one of the core things that we value is not competing with our customers and partners, and one of the things that we often look at is how can we invest in them is rather than compete with them. And so some of the work that we've done building out one of the largest SDN fabrics of the world with our service exchange which is powered by Megaport is something critical to us. But one of the other key elements inside of this is, it doesn't change our focus, right. We're building the only global fit for purpose data center platform and it's underpinned by an open ecosystem approach which we want to allow our partners to provide those higher value - higher value, higher up the stack services like Packet is providing. And so we see our approach in being a foundational element to a lot of our partners and customers, being able to service that bare metal opportunity that Packet has looked at, because there is a lot of customers have out there who have already solved that. And so we'd rather focus on solving for more of the data gravity issues and building out a fit for purpose capability for global reach or partnering with the capability if you will. So that's kind of how we view that transaction happening in the market, but we still see ourselves is aligning with our partners and customers and empowering their solutions in a unique way to solve for this enterprise need on a global basis.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Palmisano with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Robert Palmisano: I made a play that we make the call. So I want to follow up on that on the Packet thing that and possibly adding some additional tools. I mean, I understand the industry not wanting to compete with the customer is now consistently heard that. But do you think maybe there is a point where the industry is a little too religious on that and there could be some more commoditized thing the network being used by some other elements where you could be leaving some money on the table and wouldn't necessarily you take the customers are you getting more direct feedback from them? And then secondly, the follow up, what are you seeing as far as our potential rent roll downs and do you think there is a risk of any of higher churn this year for many customers that might walk rather than move right now? Thanks.
Bill Stein: No, actually, I'll take the first part of that question. So we - one of the things that I think is great about Digital and we spend a tremendous amount of time is we're customer-led, right. And our extreme customer focus is we listen to what their needs are, and one of the elements is you do well right and just continue to do that. And one of the things that we have done very well, which is centered around PlatformDIGITAL is again that global reach and that repetitive nature of a fit for purpose product right. That's very unique in the industry that allows customers to do tab, cage or megawatt. But one of the things that we've looked at is in these higher up the stack services, it's not in our remit. And so when we see a lot of these things happen in other industries, either the service fails or that the service becomes pretty complacent rather quickly, so because it's an ever evolving landscape, particularly around bare metal and there's a lot of customers out there - are companies out there that are creating these bare metal solutions. What we see is happening in the market, as you have a purpose-built infrastructure for certain types of workloads right, and so a tuck-in acquisition like this will only give you so much benefit for so long and us being able to align with some of the bellwether powerhouses in the industry would be a better solution for our enterprises to really get the full benefit out of the deployment with Digital. And the second part of the question, I'll hand it over to Matt.
Matt Mercier: Yes. I think your question again was kind of centered on churn and mark-to-market. And again, I kind of reiterate some of the comments. So we work through a 25% almost of our portfolio this year. We have a material step down. The amount is of our leases and contracts expiring next year. We feel bullish both on our ability to retain above average within that full expiring in this through this year down 2020, as well as our ability to maintain rates and be positive on that front.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for any closing remarks.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Shaun. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our 2019 highlights as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we strategically expanded our global platform, entering Chile with an anchor lease with a leading global cloud provider, acquiring a key land parcel in South Korea and reaching agreements to explore joint venture in India with the Adani Group, and to combined with Interxion to create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions with an enhanced presence in Europe. Two, we successfully executed on our private capital initiative, closing $1.4 billion of asset sales over the last three months and redeploying those proceeds into highly strategic investments. Three, we launched PlatformDIGITAL, a unique global data center platform designed to enable customers to scale digital business and we landed a record number of new logos in 2019. Last but not least, we further strengthen our balance sheet, raising $3.4 billion of long-term debt and preferred equity at a weighted average coupon of 3.1%. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and we hope to see many of you on the Spring Conference Survey.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Stewart, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Sean. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; CFO, Andy Power; and Interxion CEO, David Ruberg. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Investors are encouraged to read the joint proxy statement and prospectus with respect to the proposed transaction between Digital Realty and Interxion and other relevant documents to be filed with the SEC because they will contain important information. You may obtain a free copy of these documents when available from the SEC's website at sec.gov or from the websites or Investor Relations' departments of either Digital Realty or Interxion. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our 3Q results. In July, we announced we were reentering Paris, expanding in Frankfurt, entering Seoul, and opening four new facilities in Brazil. In September, we announced we are acquiring land in Tokyo and we also announced a $1.4 billion private capital initiative with Mapletree, bringing our year-to-date private capital raising to over $2 billion, including the joint venture with Brookfield we closed in the first quarter. In October, we raised $900 million of long-term capital at all-time low coupons and reached renewable energy agreements in Northern Virginia and Oregon, where we signed an anchor lease to break ground on land inherited through the DFT acquisition. Earlier this morning, the Adani Group announced that we have exceeded a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in India. And last, but certainly not least, this afternoon, we made the very exciting announcement that we have entered into a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. 15 years ago to the day, Digital listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We are thrilled to be celebrating our 15-year anniversary as a public company with a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction that will create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions with an enhanced presence in high-growth major European metro areas. As you can see on Page 2 of our presentation, we believe the best way to serve our customer needs is by offering a comprehensive set of data center solutions and covering the full product spectrum, from small footprint cage and cabinet environments, all the way up to multi-megawatt dedicated hyperscale facilities on a truly global basis from Sydney to Singapore to Santiago to Santa Clara. Customers form the bedrock of our strategy. And in order to meet their needs around the world, we have invested and partnered with a series of leading local brands. In the Americas, we have partnered with Brookfield to serve our customers through Ascenty, the leading data center provider in Brazil with a community of platform compute and network notes that mock connected via a proprietary fiber network. In APAC, we teamed up with Mitsubishi Corporation to launch MC Digital Realty in Japan, where we have recent announced a pair of land parcel purchases in Tokyo to support growing customer demand. And, of course, earlier this afternoon, we reached a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion, a leading provider of carrier and cloud natural colocation data center services in EMEA. We believe the combination will deliver compelling benefits for customers, shareholders, and employees. I'm pleased to welcome Interxion CEO, David Ruberg and I'd like to turn the call over to him to share his perspective and discuss the strategic merits of the transaction.
David Ruberg: Thank you, Bill. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the opportunity to join forces with Digital. Please turn to slide 3. As Bill mentioned, we strongly believe that this combination is highly strategic as well as complementary. Like everything we do, the strategic rationale starts with our customers. For many years, Interxion has been creating communities of interest in our data centers that offer carriers, Digital platform providers and enterprises access to high levels of connectivity and performance with participation in communities that can enhance the value proposition to their customers. This approach has been very successful across EMEA, and we see tremendous opportunity to replicate and extend this model across Digital's current and growing footprint. Interxion's connectivity capabilities are a primary source of our competitive advantage, highly connected locations on a logical destinations for content providers and cloud platform providers, who are seeking to provide services to these content providers. Not only do cloud platforms deploy network nodes in these locations, but there is a growing awareness on their part of the value of deploying compute, especially in close proximity to these network nodes. Workload placement close to the end user is equally critical for data intensive, next-generation cloud native applications that are focused on real-time data analytics, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The combination of Interxion's connectivity capabilities with Digital's hyperscale and enterprise expertise put the combined company in a unique position to take advantage and capitalize on the emerging global digitalization trends and to offer our customers an efficient and cost-effective way to address their requirements. I'd like to spend a moment on this structure and the leadership of the combined organization. This transaction is being structured as a stock-for-stock combination, and Interxion shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7067 Digital share per Interxion share. Interxion shareholders will own approximately 20% of the combined company, and Digital shareholders will own the remaining approximately 80%. Both boards have unanimously approved this transaction, and I have irrevocably agreed to tender my shares. Bill Stein will be the CEO of the combined organization, and I will be the CEO of our combined EMEA businesses, which upon closing would be branded Interxion, a Digital company. I will work with Bill and our teams to integrate the two businesses. And over the next year or so, I plan to transition from the day-to-day management of the EMEA business to focusing on the combined company's development of communities of interest across our global footprint and working with some of our core global accounts. While the rationale for this transaction is about customers, the execution will be about employees. The success of the combined organization will depend upon our employees, and I intend to spend a lot of time working to ensure that our employees understand and contribute to our efforts to build these leading global platforms. And I want to assure our teams the process of transitioning from two separate entities into a combined global organization will be fair, consistent, transparent, recognizing the importance of preserving the rich culture and country diversity within the combined businesses. We also expect the combination will produce enhanced career opportunities for employees as the combined companies' growth accelerates. I also note that both companies have sizable development pipelines, which represent significant embedded growth potential and provide considerable runway to support our customers' growth, given our strategic land holdings along with Digital's hyperscale development expertise and highly efficient funding model. Finally, we believe our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders will benefit from Digital's investment grade balance sheet and lower cost of capital. In closing, I am personally very excited about the opportunity this represents for all of our stakeholders. I'm convinced that combined, Digital and Interxion will be able to build the leading global platform that can help shape and deliver what our growing universe of customers require. I look forward to working closely with Bill and the entire Digital team to complete the transaction, integrate the businesses and to build the world's premier data center provider. And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thank you, David. Let's pick back up on the transaction structure here on Page 4. As David indicated, the transaction is structured as a stock-for-stock combination, and Interxion shareholders would receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7067 Digital Realty shares per Interxion share, which represents roughly a 20% premium to the unaffected share price as of October 9. The transaction is subject to approval by both sets of shareholders, and we expect to close the transaction sometime next year. The breakup fee represents 1% of Interxion's market cap, and the agreement is subject to a 7% overbid color with matching rights. As David alluded to, we are very cognizant of the value of the Interxion platform, and this deal is not about expense synergies. Nonetheless, we do see some opportunity for cost savings, primarily redundant public company costs and interest savings on refinancing Interxion's higher cost debt at Digital Realty's lower borrowing cost in the European debt capital markets. We expect to achieve up to $20 million of annualized synergies, and we expect to realize roughly three quarters of our target in 2021 with the full run rate realized in 2022. Assuming a second quarter close, given the time line for realizing synergies, we expect the transaction will be approximately 1% to 2% dilutive in 2020 and a bit better than breakeven in 2021 and significantly accretive to the combined companies' long-term growth profile. Let's set the stage by framing the opportunity in Europe on Page 5. While GDP levels in Europe and North America are about the same and the population of Europe is significantly larger, the total outsourced data center capacity in Europe today is much smaller. The rapid expansion of cloud and content platforms is driving significant data center demand across Europe. However, within the platform segment, there are significant differences in terms of maturity of adoption across Europe. Even the most technology-centric European countries are 18 to 24 months behind the U.S., followed by a varying degree of maturity across the European continent. This concept is visually depicted on the right-hand side of the slide, which describes directionally how we see the rollout unfolding without intending to provide accurate predictions on the relative size or timing of each opportunity. The cumulative effect of this gradual rollout portrays the significant opportunity ahead of us here in Europe. Let's turn to the standalone Interxion profile on Page 6. As you may know, Interxion's business consist of 53 high-quality carrier and cloud neutral colocation facilities in 13 high-growth metros across 11 countries in Europe and an investment in Africa. They have over 200 megawatts of equipped capacity serving more than 2,000 customers with platforms representing approximately 40% of recurring revenue and the balance put evenly between connectivity and enterprise. Flipping over to Page 7. You will see that our combined EMEA business will service an expanded customer base for more than 90 facilities in 15 metros across 11 countries in Europe. As you can see from the pie charts, the bottom of the slide, not only does the combination create a broader network for landing and expanding customers, but our businesses are highly complementary. Digital's position in London and Dublin dovetails nicely with Interxion's presence in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris and across the rest of Europe. The pro forma business mix covers the continent and is well balanced between the major European metros. Turning now to Page 8. Interxion has successfully executed a strategy in creating and enabling valuable communities of interest in Europe, and an internet gateway in Marseille serves as the digital media hub to 4.5 billion eyeballs across EMEA, as a prime example. We see significant opportunities to extend Interxion's capabilities to identify and develop high-value communities of interest across the combined company's global footprint. As shown on page 9, our customer accounts are similar despite the difference in the size of our businesses, which gives you some appreciation for the density of the communities of interest the Interxion team has successfully created. These communities match up well with the hyperscale compute engine's Digital Realty as successfully landed across our global platform. The combination of our respective strengths should enhance our ability to solve the public and hybrid cloud architectural acquirements of our global customer base. Interxion's developing pipeline represents a source of significant potential embedded growth as shown on page 10. In addition to the 53 facilities currently in service, Interxion also has 500 constructions. These projects are significantly preleased and represent a substantial expansion of the installed base, including land owned or controlled Interxion has the potential to double the size of its existing business. The transaction will also create significant financial benefits as shown on page 11. The combined company will have a global presence in 44 metros across 20 countries on 6 continents with an enterprise value of approximately $50 billion, nearly five times the size of the next largest competitor. We expect the combined organization will have the most efficient cost structure and the highest EBITDA margin in the data center sector. Finally, let's talk about capital structure on page 12. The combined company will have an equity market cap of over $35 billion and a total enterprise value of more than $50 billion. The balance sheet's impact will be leveraged neutral, but one of the key benefits of the transaction is the opportunity for Interxion stakeholders to benefit from Digital Realty's lower borrowing costs and improved ability to fund the growth of the business as well as the continued growth of the per share dividend, which we have raised each and every year since our IPO in 2004. In summary, this combination is highly strategic and complementary. It is prudently financed with a stock-for-stock structure and is expected to be accretive to the long-term growth trajectory of the combined organization. We are excited to deliver this compelling opportunity that we believe will significantly enhance our ability to create long-term value for customers, shareholders and employees of both companies. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andy Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 14. We delivered solid leasing volume with balance performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $69 million, just shy of our all-time second best. Third quarter bookings included an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $51 million with a weighted average lease term of a little over 7 years, including a $7.4 million co-location contribution. We added another all-time high 64 new logos during the third quarter, led by global strength in our enterprise segment. We quietly leased 14 megawatts in Ashburn during the third quarter, and our biggest deal in this market was just 6 megawatts. Although Northern Virginia has been notoriously competitive this year, we view the current supply/demand dislocation as a temporary phenomenon. Particularly in light of Amazon's selection of Crystal City for its H Q2 and Microsoft's selection for the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI contract, we are bullish on the long-term prospects for communications infrastructure in the Commonwealth as well as our position in the market given the value of our strategic land holdings, our ability to support our customer needs today and to provide the longest runway for their growth. In terms of specific wins during the quarter, we partnered with AT&T to devise a solution for a global biotech firm to service their edge network and data center partner for global edge deployments across multiple North America locations, London and Frankfurt, placing the customer in close proximity to their end user customers, improving application performance and consolidating and reducing their network costs. The customer selected AT&T and Digital Realty to deploy their next-generation IT hubs based upon our collective global footprints, proximity to their locations, access to a wide array of network providers, and the ability to interconnect to multiple public clouds, leveraging digital service exchange fabric. One of the nation's most comprehensive integrated academic healthcare delivery systems expanded their commitment to our global platform this quarter. This new expansion has a dual purpose that will serve to consolidate a number of their smaller data centers and serve our closets from their metro regional units, including on-premise facilities. In addition, the lack of a disaster recovery and business continuity site for their production data center puts Digital Realty in another location. We provide a solution with service exchange, which help them access Azure and our SD-WAN platform and dark fiber network between our campuses, enabling them to execute a key part of their hybrid IT strategy. We are also seeing traction in EMEA and APAC based customers joining our global platform. One example this quarter is a European big data and analytics company wanting to expand its operations to North America. Our global platform capabilities were uniquely suited to meet their high performance computing and rapid expansion requirements. Turning to our backlog on page 16. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced, stepped down from $127 million as of June 30th to $98 million at the end of the third quarter due to several large commencements in Northern Virginia, Toronto and Silicon Valley. During the third quarter, the lag between signings and commencement was slightly below our long-term historical average in a little less than five months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 17. We signed $152 million of renewals during the third quarter, in addition to new leases signed. As you may recall, 2019 was our all-time high in terms of lease expirations, and our four highest renewal quarters have all come within the last 12 months, including a new all-time high for quarterly renewal leasing volume this quarter. Year-to-date, we retained almost 85% of expiring leases, a bit better than our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter was nearly nine years, while cash rents on renewals rose up 7.2%. In addition to the legacy DLR long-term top customer renewals we secured earlier this year, we finally executed the long-awaited legacy DFT customer renewal during the third quarter, and we did better than expected rate but shorter on term. As you may have seen, we raised our guidance for cash re-leasing spreads again from down mid-single digits to slightly negative, reflecting the better than expected outcome. Aside from a few select supply constrained regions and metro areas, we've yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress sliding through peak vintage renewals. The lion share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents, and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerged in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 40 basis points to 87.4%, entirely due to reclassification of the fully leased Mapletree facilities as held for sale at quarter end. Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7%, in line with our guidance and reflected a 70 basis point FX headwind, higher property tax accruals and the restructuring of the private colocation reseller customer earlier this year. The U.S. dollar continue to climb relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 75 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 18. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 19. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 2.4% year-over-year or 3.3% on a constant currency basis. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 20, we do expect the quarterly run rate to get dip down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the Mapletree joint venture transaction, which we expect to close in early November. As a result, we are revising our 2019 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the dilution from the joint venture transaction as well as the two opportunistic long-term capital raises in October that were not previously contemplated in our guidance. As you begin to roll your model forward to the fourth quarter and beyond to next year, there are several puts and takes to keep in mind. We expect to close the Mapletree joint venture transaction in early November and the Mapletree portfolio sale in early January. Consequently, we expect a partial period of dilution in the fourth quarter and a full year in 2020. The interest income on the Ascenty bridge loan and the U.K. income tax benefit in 1Q '19 were both onetime benefits in the current year and are not expected to recur in 2020. We've extended the duration of the forward equity settlement which does provide a current year benefit to per share earnings and cash flow but do expect to eventually settle the forward equity offering early next year, which will likewise represent a drag to year-over-year growth in per share earnings and cash flow in 2020. Conversely, knock on wood; we are not currently anticipating any changes in accounting policy in 2020 unlike the impact on the reported results from the change in lease accounting in 2019 and revenue recognition in 2018. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 21. Net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 6.1 times as of the end of the third quarter, while fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.3 time for the Mapletree transaction and settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt-to-EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at approximately five times while fixed charge coverage is just under 4.5 times. In terms of capital-raising activity, in mid-September, we announced a $1.4 billion portfolio sale and joint venture transaction with Mapletree, a leading Singaporean real estate investment firm. These transactions represent an important step towards our goal of self-funding our growth and diversifying our sources of equity capital and setting the stage for accelerating growth as the proceeds are redeployed into accretive investment opportunities. We expect to close the joint venture in early November and the portfolio sale in early January. Likewise, in mid-September, we extended duration of our forward equity offering by 12 months to most efficiently match the timing of our sources and uses given the $1.4 billion of pending proceeds from the Mapletree transactions. In early October, we raised $345 million of perpetual preferred equity and 5.2% in all-time low preferred equity coupon for Digital Realty. The very next day, we opportunistically tapped that Eurobond market, raising approximately $550 million of 8.5-year paper and one in an eighth like wise an all-time low coupon. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital; sets us apart from our peers; and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 22, our weighted average debt maturities is over six years, and we weighted our weighted average coupon down another 10 basis points this quarter to 3.2%. Half of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investment outside the U.S. Over 80% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 22, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Sean, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the transaction. My first question is regarding the initial dilution and the ultimate accretion surrounding the transaction. Is the assumption for 2020 that initial dilution factoring in the transaction on a leverage neutral basis or as is? And then, maybe you can speak to beyond the immediate term dilution, ultimately, how we should sort of quantify what you think the accretion will look like on a growth perspective to the overall platform.
Andy Power: Thanks, Jordan. This is Andy. So we will maybe go to your question on the balance sheet first. This is 100% stock-for-stock transaction. And when you look at the capital structure slide on our investor deck, you can see its leverage neutral, including the friction from any transaction cost. So in a pro forma for our Mapletree and equity forward, we'll rate it right, our 5 times net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio and still have the proceed from those capital to kind of fund the combined companies' growth, which we're really excited about. 2020 is obviously a little bit tough to handicap here, as we're kind of thing at the very end of 2019. We both have to go get shareholder approval for this transaction and also get any regulatory approval. So depending on where you handicap on closing, anywhere, call it, at the end of 1Q or the end of 2Q or so, you have a fraction of the year. We also really do not assume any synergies pull through with combined business in 2020. Maybe that's a tad bit conservative. So happier or less, just a little over half here combined, no synergies. That's kind of how we get to that roughly 1% to 2% dilution per share in 2020. But in 2021, when you look at the combined company, we described this as a bit better than breakeven, so we did describe it as accretive. Obviously, a combination of the relative valuation from the exchange of our shares. We do have a pickup from refinancing their non-investor grade debt with our investor grade euro bonds to pick a couple hundred basis points of savings there. And then, we do see some of the synergy starting flow through in 2021 to just get a little over breakeven. And then, we see pretty solid accretion from 2022 there on out. And, I guess, to reiterate what you said, we also see accretion to the growth profile of the combined company. As you can see, we have a very complementary long term under construction and landholdings in the European market to continue to fuel that growth.
Jordan Sadler: Is there a way to quantify that growth profile accretion? You said significantly accretive to the combined company's gross profile, I believe, in the prepared remarks. I'm just, is it 100 basis points better growth in the three to five year period? 200 basis points?
Andy Power: I think on a per share basis, when we kind of flip into 2022 and beyond, I think you reverse the dilution estimate we estimated in 2020. So call it 1% to 2% accretive to our FFO or FFO per share.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. I had a couple of questions about the deal and then a follow-up about just kind of market trends. But as you look at regulatory approval in Europe, CyrusOne and Zenium took a couple of quarters longer than initially anticipated. And then Equinix, Telecity, of course, ended up acquiring divestitures. So I'm interested in kind of your expectations around time line and your thoughts about what some of the aspects to consider would be around the country level and EU approval on the deal. And then just as a footnote, maybe to Jordan's question, I just wanted to be sure, but the $20 million of synergy that you identified, is that entirely OpEx or not? I just missed that. And then I guess, just the second question would be around market review, which metros – Andy talked about this in the script a little bit, but just interested in which metros currently in North America, Europe and APAC are showing the most kind of hyperscale demand? Thank you.
Greg Wright: Hey, Jonathan, it's Greg Wright. Let me take the first question, with respect to antitrust. Look, I think in working with both lawyers on each side of the transaction, we take a look at their geographic overlap and the like. I think we feel good about our outcome on any anti-trust issues. In terms of time, it's always hard to say timing. But I think factoring in that, that's why Andy gave you a range from end of first quarter to end of second quarter that would be the long-term debt if you will, for any timing differences. So I would say that's factored into the guidance that Andy just gave. But again, when we look at it, again, both sets of lawyers and other professionals on the antitrust front, we feel good.
Andy Power: Hey, Jon, just to add on to perspective then I'll try to round out your other questions. This is Andy. Obviously, I think what you got to hear is a tremendous value proposition for customers, when were bringing together a European portfolio that was very strong in the United Kingdom, in London, and the InterXion team having done fantastic job on Mainland Europe. So, complementary in terms of product and footprint. So I think that will also help sort of our cards when going through regulatory process. On the expenses synergies, I just – I would characterize expense energies, not OpEx overheads specific type of expense synergies. There is obviously some public – redundant public company cost here, including our Board of Directors, that are – it's kind of easier low-hanging fruit to go out first. I do think there's also going to be revenue synergies here that we don't really have factored into our numbers or, our combined customer base are now going to be able to that were able to be the trusted global partner for this combined customer base around the globe across six continents and 20 countries. So do invest in another key element of this transaction. And then last but not least, I think your assessment overall kind of how the quarter went in terms of markets demand. I'll try to go real quickly on that. On the digital side starting with Europe, we had the, I guess, the topping off, or like the – we have the last kilowatts into our Frankfurt 27-megawatt campus with a top cloud service provider. We had a smaller win with an enterprise customer into the London market. I think those were the highlights there. Over in Asia Pacific, we had another top CSP land in our soccer campus with a fairly large signing down South America. And Brazil, we had continued growth from a top 5 CSP. And North America had a little bit of the same as early in the year, a little bit of different. We had continued success in Toronto with two different top CSPs with strength in the financial services sector in our Northern New Jersey, New York metro area growth from existing customer on our Dallas campus. And in Northern Virginia Ashburn in fact, actually did come back. We had some great wins there, some of which we highlighted in the script: two international wins, one coming out of issue Pacific, one coming out of Europe that landed in Nova, and then also a large legacy digital customer taking down several megawatts as well. So, I would say those are kind of tops the waves in terms of demand for the quarter on our side.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. If I could just follow-up briefly the leverage neutral – the all-stock deal and the implications for leverage. It sounds like it gives you some dry powder for further expansion. You announced Korea earlier this year, and then India in the last 24 hours. But how do we think about your expansion pipeline in some of these Asian markets versus elsewhere. And for David perhaps, what led you from the InterXion side to kind of favor the all-stock structure versus maybe a mix of cash and stock?
Bill Stein: Hey, Jon, this is a Bill. In terms of the Asian market expansion, you mentioned India in particular. India, at this point, is exploratory. It's a 6-month MOU as we’re exclusive to each other, but we have made no commitments in terms of capital. So it's really tough to bracket the amount of capital that's going to be required for that venture. Other than that, I would expect that our capital program will continue as it has been, its a billion dollars plus a year. And we have broke through all-equity nature of this transaction as well as additional asset sales that are contemplated. I would expect that we are self-funded easily through next year on development.
Andy Power: And John – John Stewarts' waving at me, I think we have given you 4 or 5 questions, so we have to get you back in the queue to round out that last question.
A – Bill Stein: But let's ask David to answer that question on all equity.
David Ruberg: John is in Europe. If you don't mind, I think the real question I'd like to address is, why did we do this and why did we do this now? And the form of the transaction is less important. The real answer is, the infrastructure requirements of our customers are evolving. And as they've evolved, they have created a greater opportunity for us to do business with them. And we thought that as this has evolved and these 2 companies have evolved, the combination is far greater positioned to take advantage of these opportunities than we were individually. We believe in them, they believe in us. The form of the transaction of the compensation was secondary.
Operator: Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks and congrats on the deal announcement. It's obviously on the M&A front, it kind of checks the boxes that you've talked about as strategic and complementary, accretive to -- I will say, the long-term growth on an AFFO basis and you mentioned, prudently financed. But where do you see sort of the pitfalls of you getting to some of the metrics you've outlined? I know you talked about it previously, the 1% to 2% dilutive and then slightly breakeven and then, we'll call it low single or a reverse of that dilution. Where is some of the pitfalls? And where do you see some of the opportunities for that to even be stronger than you expected?
Andy Power: Thanks, Eric. So I think obviously, the greatest potential risk is obviously this is all about the customers and the people and employees that are making this come together for the customers. So that's why I think we're going to make sure, we'll go through this in a prudent fashion and bring together 2 great teams in support of these customers and real execution on building out capacity for our customers and being their trusted partner, especially in Europe, but also on a global basis. So that's certainly something where we're keeping an eye on the ball. There's other things that I would say are secondary in our mind, whether it's achievement on the expense synergies, which I would say are relatively modest in numbers. And obviously, execution and ability to tap the financing markets to lock in financing synergies. But I really think, it's a continuation at the topline and focus on the customers in order to deliver that EBITDA in 2021, which is going to be the twin spinning for that near-term financial success.
Erik Rasmussen: Okay. Maybe just -- my follow-up, you've mentioned Northern Virginia coming back with a couple of nice deals there. But maybe if it would just talk about the pricing dynamic in that market and in hyperscale deals in general that were signed in the quarter.
Andy Power: Sure. So in Northern Virginia, really, the success there was selling our platform and our value proposition to our customers, which was about a global organization supporting these customers across numerous countries and continents, the full product spectrum and working to land them in Northern Virginia, which is obviously very competitive. But on -- what we think is the best campus, where many of these customers have an installed footprint and want to grow its adjacency. And many of these customers value the longest runway for growth in that market that we provide. So I think those key elements were really what allowed us to win the day for some of these key signings during the quarter and not have to just compete on rate like some of our private competitors may have had to go. Obviously, the rates are down there on a year-over-year basis. But I would say, I was quite pleased with the volume and the rate activity. It was a big piece of our North America signings that you can see flowing through our TKF line and our total signings that rated down a little bit quarter-over-quarter but not astronomically. So I think we are really adding value to our customers. They're appreciating that value, and that's why they are picking us. And its not just all about based on bottom rate discussion.
Operator: Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: This is Michael on for Colby. Two questions if I may. First, I guess, this goes to David. Did Interxion run a full process before agreeing to a deal? Along those lines, is there a formal go-shop period? And secondly, how much leasing came from Ascenty? And what was the Americas pricing for kW, excluding Ascenty, for the quarter? Thank you.
Andy Power: Michael, this is Andy. I'll take the easy one. Ascenty was very small contribution this quarter. They've done a great job the last three consecutive quarters, outperforming our underwriting. But this quarter, I think it was like $1.5 million of GAAP or so. So very small contribution. And that's not to say I'm not -- I'm still optimistic. We just, we're meeting with the Ascenty team and Chris have a pretty good pipeline for the fourth quarter. But what actually we reported on our signings was very relatively small of our Americas signings number. With that, I'll hand it back over to David.
David Ruberg: Contrary to what was in the press, we did not run a process. What we have basically done is for the last couple of years, we've been approached by a lot of people. We were focused on what we thought it would take to be successful. We were focused on what we thought a good partner would look like. And Bill and I have been talking about this for quite some time, and it was just the appropriate thing to do. And that's how we got here. In terms of what happens from now, you can expect that there is a standard terms and conditions. But this deal to me makes a lot of sense. And again, that's why we've had this conversation for quite some time. So we'll see what happens, but I'm focused on making this the best opportunity that we can. We spent enough time getting to know each other. I think we know what we're doing.
Operator: Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Rob on for Frank, actually. Post the deal, what do you believe will be your approximate percentage of revenue from Northern Virginia?
Andy Power: Hey, Rob, this is Andy. That's a very good question. We have -- let me see if I can handicap this. There's a slide on our deck that shows a pro forma -- Slide 11 shows the pro forma geographic concentration. That doesn't have -- it shows pods but doesn't have numbers. But the pods are -- just over 60% are from the Americas; about 30, a little over 30% or 33, I believe, percent from EMEA; and about 6% from APAC. If you look in one of the pages in our south, Northern Virginia, it's still our top market. But I would kind of hit a cap in the 10% to 15% of the total pro forma combined company.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen: Thank you. So maybe one question on the quarter and then one question on the deal. So the same capital NOI, I noticed, was down 2.6% -- or sorry, 3.7% on a cash basis year-over-year, 2.5% sequentially. And it looks like occupancy dropped 100 basis points. Maybe if you could just give us a more color on what's going on there?
Andy Power: Thanks, Jon. So same capital pool, really, it's about the company's obviously largest expiration year. We've done a quite a good job, renewing a lot of contracts, pushing out for staggered various terms. There are -- and even though our retention's a little bit above historical average, we've taken back a fair bit of space to tip that pull. So we do have some downtime for releasing. And I would say we saved a significant chunk of our new signings in this quarter and last quarter was little bit more into new space that's going to be the delivering. So, little bit of interim cash flow hit. I do think it is a temporary phenomenon. Some of this capacity, I think, Dublin is a good example. We're taking back and we're going to convert TKF suite into a colocation interconnection product offering. So, we think that does provide longer term up sign, although you do have the near-term cash flow hit. So, I think there a lot of other good things about the quarter, which thinking a lot of question so far in addition to this quarter, I think a third-highest almost just sniffing our second-highest from last year, it was pretty multi-geographic, multiproduct. Interconnection was up there in terms of number two or three, I think, in terms of signings in the last handful of years and a record 64 new logos. I believe the new logos we signed in the first three quarters this year are more than new logos we signed in the prior two years, so pretty happy about that. But we are having some -- taking back some non-retaining capacity and we're certainly focusing our salesforce on selling to that move-in ready space, tour the day move-in tomorrow type capacity that does certainly help us in certain markets.
Jon Petersen: Okay. Thanks. And then just curious, the Interxion business, will that be good REIT income that will require a dividend payout? And if not, how does that change your thoughts on growing the dividend going forward?
Andy Power: Based on our -- other than maybe a relatively short time period at the initial close, depending on the tender of the shares where we would have to hold the business in our TRS temporary, we would qualify this as good REIT income based on everything we've seen to-date. So, I don't see this as a drag on our TRS capacity or incremental corporate tax friction. And so based on what we see, this looks very similar in terms of readability to our core business.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. First question, just strategically, you guys have been extraordinarily active at building out the global platform. And different from your original M&A deals early on, the last few have been dilutive in the near-term, part driven by development, part driven by deleveraging and asset sales, but they'll eventually be accretive. But it just feels as though whether it was Ascenty, the Macquarie deal, this Interxion deal, you sort of pushed the growth to eventually coming. What gives investors confidence that you won't do another a deal next year that then impacts 2021 growth and we're just on the sort of flat cycle until you eventually get to a more positive growth outlook?
Andy Power: Thanks Michael. So, I think the three transactions, two buys and one sell, I think, have their nuances of near-term or temporary dilution followed by what we see as accretion. Obviously, Ascenty was a pretty strategic entry, acquiring the leading platform in Brazil, which was subsequently expanded into Santiago, Chile, which was a very large in-flight construction project essentially. So, very little near-term earnings. And also we suffer dilution in how we mitigated the risk and that transaction. The sale of the assets -- when you sell $1 billion in change of assets, so the low six cap and you lose that income right away, you're certainly going to have dilution to your per share FFO rate. And this transaction has its unique nuances with a closing sometime in 2020, timing of synergy, realizations are light where there's dilution. I think we're still focused on driving the growth in our FFO, AFFO, cash flow per share. It's what pays our dividends. But at the same time, I think we're looking at especially this transactions, the keystone strategic piece and global platform. And this is part of the reason why we prepare for transactions like this. Hence why we've kept the balance sheet in such good shape, why we've run the AFFO payout ratio so conservatively. It's been close to 70% or south, so very well covered. So, this mild dilution is temporary and I don't think a repeat story. And I think we're positioning the company for growth from all three of these initiatives quite honestly. And we do ask our investors to bear with us and the noise in the earnings and the ensuing handful of quarters. But we think we’re setting ourselves up for a stronger platform with accelerating growth.
Bill Stein: Hey Michael, let me also add to that. As David indicated, he and I have been talking for many years now. And the same is true for Chris Torto, we've been talking -- we talked for many years before we closed on that transaction. So these are opportunities that we've been tracking and have been interested in for a long time. There is nothing like that on our horizon today. I can say that unequivocally that we are not talking with anyone else. And that's not to say we won't do another acquisition, but right now, our plate is full.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. And then just something specific related to the deal, and it's been a long time since I've been an investment banker. Can you just walk through -- you said it was a 7% color in terms of a bid protection, and you have matching rights up to that 7%. And then it sounded like there was a 1% on equity breakup fee to any other bidder that would come in, so call it $1 a share per InterXion share. How does that 7% overbid with matching rates work?
Greg Wright: It's a little different, Michael. It's Greg. It's a 1% breakup fee. And then it's what's called a 7% overbid color. So it means is someone who comes in, if they would top the deal, they would have to pay 1%. And in order to top the deal, they have to be 7% above our bid. So that's how that works.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. My main question has to do with slide number 17, and some of the rental rate changes that you've seen, you reported 7.2% cash now in the industry and across some of the private data center operator. There has been probably pricing weakness and essentially cost per kilowatt reduction is down. However, you guys have clearly executed and reported a pretty; I would describe it as strong result at 7.2% above right positive. Can you just give us more color on how you are driving those results, what your customer are doing? Are they deploying to multiple locations? That’d be very helpful color for industry numbers.
Andy Power: Sure, Sami. This is Andy again. So, I would want to say, we've certainly had our fair share of negative cash mark-to-markets. And you can look at back in the last quarter as a prime example. This quarter, we were able to have the uplift for a handful of contracts, most notably when the large legacy DFT customers renewed at a shorter duration, the shorter duration that typically comes with a higher rate. So that would certainly contributor, as well as some other contracts were renewed during the quarter that kind of was able to drive a positive cash mark-to-market spread. It really all goes back to the vintage of the agreement, the market and supply/demands with fundamentals within that specific market and also the product segment. So while we're certainly quite pleased with the outcome of the third quarter, I'm not under the assumption that we're going to repeat plus 7% every quarter for the next four or five, we’ll certainly have our ups and downs. But net-net, I do think we are moving through our largest expiration of the year. We've had several record renewal quarters in a row, numerous top customer, multiyear, multiproduct renewals, staggering out those expirations. You can see as we've whittled down what's coming due in 2019 and beyond. And I do think these ties back to a comment you made is that really about selling the platform, the multiproduct, multi-geo offering to our customers, really trying to be a trusted partner and a solution provider to them. So they have one responsible party around the globe to assist them with whether it's a renewal in one market, expansion in other, network node, you name it. That's really how we're trying to drive the business. And I do think that does pay a little bit of dividends to our success overall.
Sami Badri: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi. I wanted to revisit, kind of, the longer term outlook the deal provides in terms of the amount of development under construction. How we should think about that growth? And then also the future capacity because it, seems like this is more of a longer-term strategic deal and not necessarily something that's going to impact things right away. And that probably drove more the transaction? Thank you. 
Andy Power: Hey, Richard. This is Andy. I can speak to the numbers here. There's a slide on the deck that, I think, paints a nice picture of the growth profile. I think it's slide 10. What's quite unique about this transaction, in addition to the broader global strategic nature of it, it really is kind of two interlocking puzzle pieces in terms of inventory and portfolio footprint. As I've mentioned, we basically topped off our growth in the Frankfurt market, and the InterXion team has done a great job bringing inventory on in the near future, so filling in gaps there. In London, that's a market where we've been having a pretty nice and future proofed runway for growth with our cloud house digital documents campus as well as our Crawley and working campuses. And that was more of a newer market. Similarly in France, we just reentered Paris, and the InterXion team has a dominant share in multimarkets in France. So let's call it 18 months out. I think we got a very complimentary inventory position, which we'd like. That includes over 80 megawatts under construction from InterXion that are north 40% pre-leased. We're bringing 40 megawatts to the table at about 40% pre-leased. So I think that kind of dovetails for the near-term picture. And then longer term, the Interxion team really done a fantastic job building out a long-term runway of growth clearly where they either own lease or options on several years' worth of inventory in strategic markets, including some of the budding growth markets outside of the Frankfurt, London and St. Paris market traditionally known for such a strong hold for. So I think it's a combination of near and longer-term growth.
Richard Choe: And will that -- this kind of options help you bridge the gap or when you start integrating the sales forces? And how should we think about the sales force integration going forward?
Andy Power: I think, this inventory set up is a fantastic thing for our customers. And when our customers have lots of opportunity to move into our footprint of combined company basis, that usually is a good for our sales force at the same time. We are just on the heels of announcement we got. We obviously got to work independently until our shareholders approve of this transaction and we close. And once we close, we're going to work together as well to combine. And with that, I think David wants to chime in.
David Ruberg: I just wanted to add, what's fascinating about this combination is when you look at the top 15 or 20 platform players in the world, we actually overlap substantially. But we approach them from two different orientations, one from the large size and one from the small size. And so when you look at this, even the sales forces are highly complementary in terms of the way they approach. When you look at the combined with a number of the top 3 or 4 customers, when you put these two companies together and you look at the relevance that we have as a combined entity for some of these behemoths, it's really impressive. So, it's not going to be as difficult to bring them together, because they bring complementary knowledge. One more on the compute side, one more on the connectivity side. So, I think it works.
Operator: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Stein for any closing remarks.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Sean. I'd like to wrap-up our call today by recapping the strategic merits of our combination with Interxion, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. The combined company will extend Interxion's successful strategy of creating and enabling valuable communities of interest in Europe by extending it across the combined companies' global footprint. Our businesses are highly complementary. The combination creates a leading pan-European data center provider, offering consistent, high quality services with low-latency access to approximately 70% of the GDP in Europe. Interxion's co-location capabilities combined with our hyperscale expertise will significantly enhance the combined companies' activity to address and solve our company's public and hybrid cloud architectural requirements on a global scale. Interxion has five projects under construction, which are over 40% pre-leased and represent a 40% expansion of the asset base and a source of significant potential embedded growth and long-term value creation. Last but not least, the transaction is expected to generate significant financial benefit. It's expected to be accretive to the long-term growth rate of the combined organization and will establish a global platform that we believe will significantly enhance our ability to create long-term value for both the customers, shareholders and employees of both companies. Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you at marketplace live at Spring Studios in New York next week.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. First and foremost, consistent execution against our customer success initiatives drove all-time high new logos, our second highest interconnection and renewal leasing and our third highest total bookings. Second, we leveraged our global platform to prudently allocate capital, where we were able to achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns around the world, creating significant value for shareholders. Third, we extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our inaugural ESG report, an official recognition as an ENERGY STAR partner. Last but not least, we capitalized on favorable market conditions to execute an opportunistic $900 million liability management trade, clearing our runway out to 2022 and extending our weighted average duration by nearly half the year while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down by 10 basis points. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The durability of Digital Realty's global platform was on full display in the second quarter of 2019. And our team was incredibly productive over the past 90 days. We delivered the third highest bookings in the Company's history. Demonstrating the strength of our globally diversified portfolio, we also signed the second highest volume of interconnection bookings as well as renewal leasing and we expanded our colocation offering into the Asia-Pacific region with a multi-market new transaction and customer expansion. We also landed an all-time high number of new logos this quarter, an encouraging indication, our efforts to penetrate enterprise demand are bearing fruit and a promising sign for future interconnection revenue growth prospects. Along those lines, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting MarketplaceLIVE at Spring Studios in New York on November 7, a daylong event connecting the community that builds the cloud network and Internet infrastructure. The event attracts a broad swath across the tech ecosystem and we are expecting over 600 attendees from network engineers and start-ups to solution architects and cloud service providers to CIOs at Fortune 500 companies. We further extended our global platform during the second quarter and we took steps to secure our supply chain with several strategic land acquisitions shown here on Page 3 of our presentation. We closed on three smaller strategic land parcels in Northern Virginia to further physically connect our market leading campus footprint. We also re-entered Paris with new capacity based on significant verified customer demand. And earlier this afternoon, we announced that we are under contract to acquire a parcel in Frankfurt, building upon the success of our sales in the second quarter as well as the recent investment and our coverage of Western Europe. We closed on a land parcel in Tokyo through our MC Digital Realty Japan partnership. Finally, we also announced early this afternoon, we are entering South Korea with plans to develop a carrier-neutral facility in the Sangam Digital Media City in northwest Seoul. We announced the grand openings of an expansion in Dublin in May, the second phase of our Osaka connected campus in June and most recently, we announced that our Latin America platform, Ascenty opened four fully leased facilities in Sao Paulo during the second quarter. We continue to build upon our industry-leading commitment to sustainability with the publication of our inaugural ESG report and we were officially named an ENERGY STAR partner. We continue to invest in our human capital with several key hires. We achieved the Amazon Web Services - service delivery designation for AWS Direct Connect. And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet locking in our lowest ever 10-year U.S. dollar bond coupon, and opportunistically terming up our 2020 and 2021 maturities. Let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 4. Following the record absorption in 2018, the primary data center metros in North America have been relatively quiet in 2019, especially given the tough year-over-year comparison in Northern Virginia, which is not only the largest data center market in the world, but it's also the most competitive with the broadest selection of existing competitors and the deepest pool of new entrants trying to stake a claim. Loudoun County is ground zero and Ashburn is the most desirable submarket. Even for prime locations, however, the supply demand pendulum has swung away from providers in favor of customers with various new entrants bringing speculative supply online while the most voracious consumers remain in digestion mode. We believe, we have a set of significant competitive advantages in Northern Virginia, given the scale of our footprint, the head start from selling to an installed customer base with a strong desire to grow adjacent to their existing deployments and the longest runway to support their growth. Ultimately, we believe it's a question of when, not if hyperscale procurement cycles enter their next phase of growth and the pendulum can swing back the other direction quickly. In the meantime, we do expect the current supply-demand dynamic will lead to dislocation in the market, which we believe will create investment opportunities for disciplined, well capitalized competitors. The New York metro area, in contrast, has seen a recent resurgence in demand and the market has gradually tightened, as excess inventory has been slowly absorbed while new deliveries have been sparse. In Dallas, there are number of competitors with available supply, but we continue to enjoy good success in Dallas, particularly on our Richardson campus where existing customers consistently expand with us despite the availability of competitive supply elsewhere in the Metroplex. Recent developments in Chicago have been particularly encouraging. The State of Illinois recently passed legislation, creating data center tax incentives that put Chicago back on par with other jurisdictions that have actively encouraged data center investment. Although, we have not signed any major new leases in Chicago, since Governor Pritzker signs a bill on June 28. We have seen an immediate uptick in customer interest. We are optimistic this bill will spur a rebound in demand. We commend Governor Pritzker and the Illinois State Legislature for their leadership in adopting this legislation as well as the Digital Realty Central region portfolio management team which worked extensively behind the scenes, along with the business and labor communities to advance this bipartisan legislation. Supply remain scarce in Santa Clara which is arguably the tightest market in the U.S. and generally commands a pricing premium relative to most other domestic metros. During the second quarter, we saw strong demand from cloud and from enterprise in Santa Clara. Back across the pond, recent market leadership in Europe has shifted from London to Frankfurt, which has been the standout metro in 2019. Following our success with an enterprise customer on our Frankfurt campus last quarter, we signed a major cloud service provider - brand new to our Sausenheim campus with a large and growing deployment. Although requirements in Europe remain smaller than the U.S., partly due to data sovereignty considerations they are getting bigger. The leading global cloud providers remain the primary consumers and these cloud providers continue to exhibit a clear preference for expanding adjacent to their initial deployments. So landing the initial deployment is key. Our Global Connected Campus strategy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this consumption pattern. You may have seen that Amsterdam recently placed a 12-month moratorium on data center construction. This is a developing situation and the potential impact on future projects is not entirely clear. However, from our perspective, barriers to entry just got higher and Amsterdam incumbents such as ourselves have a competitive advantage. We believe, we are very well positioned given the network density of our interconnection hub at Amsterdam Science Park. In-place permits on project, currently under construction at our De President campus and visibility to incremental capacity adjacent to, but not subject to either of the municipalities that have imposed the moratorium. Across the Asia Pacific region, demand remains robust in our key markets, driven primarily by global cloud service provider requirements. We have seen notable strength in Osaka, where we landed a major Japanese integrated communication service provider as a new logo, further validating our Connected Campus strategy for the Kansai region. Similar promising pipeline supports our ongoing campus development projects in Tokyo, Singapore, and Sydney. On the supply side, market inventory remains mostly in check and we remain bullish on our prospects in the region given our first mover advantage into Osaka, barriers to entry in Tokyo, government involvement in Singapore, and rapidly growing cloud adoption in Sydney. While the IT infrastructure landscape across the Asia-Pacific region continues to mature, we see a significant runway for growth for years to come. Finally, we continue to see a strong pipeline of demand for our platform in Latin America, specifically focused across Brazil and now Chile from leading global cloud providers along with new potential customers. We are quite pleased with the performance to date and believe, we are poised to continue to capture an outsized share of demand in this region, characterized by significant upside from growing Internet adoption along with limited availability of institutional quality data center capacity. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to capital allocation on Page 5. The data center sector is maturing as an asset class and we have seen an uptick in fresh capital targeting the sector. This has had the natural effect of compressing returns, particularly in the U.S. This trend is somewhat of a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the value of our existing portfolio. On the other hand, it also makes it harder for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions. We believe our global platform represents a competitive advantage in terms of capital allocation as well as access to capital. We have a unique ability to allocate capital, where we see the most attractive risk-adjusted returns around the world while also tapping the broadest, lowest cost pools of capital in the countries where we operate. In addition, we are adapting to the growing demand within the data center investment sales market by seeking to harvest capital from mature assets in the U.S. and redeploy the proceeds into higher growth opportunities elsewhere. We believe, we have a unique ability to allocate capital, where we see the most favorable risk adjusted returns on a global basis and we believe our current investment activity is creating meaningful value for shareholders. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic expansion keeps plodding along. In the U.S., the recovery is now in its 11th year and earlier this month, became the longest expansion on record. Nonetheless , both fiscal and monetary policy remains supportive. And the U.S. remains a relative bright spot in terms of global economic growth. As you've heard me say many times before data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth. We are fortunate to be operating in a business-levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business. I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7. As you can see, McKinsey estimates that digital transformation will add $13 trillion to global GDP by 2030 driving demand for distributed digital infrastructures that we are uniquely positioned to address. Thanks to our fit for purpose global footprint and interconnected scale. During the second quarter, we saw early indicators of digital transformation demand on our platform. We captured a record number of new logos, led by our enterprise vertical as these customers begin to deploy and connect components of their digital infrastructure globally. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs. We believe, we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. We signed total bookings of $62 million including $6 million from our Latin America platform, Ascenty at our pro rata share and a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $53 million with a weighted average lease term of a little over five years, including an $8 million colocation contribution. As Bill mentioned, this was our third best total bookings quarter and our second best interconnection quarter. I'd also like to clarify that Ascenty's second quarter bookings are in addition to the leases signed in the first quarter with a leading global cloud provider to anchor our entry into Chile. We also expanded our digital realty colocation offering into the Asia-Pacific region with a multi-market new transaction and customer expansion, as you can see from the leasing activity table in our press release. Although this was a relatively small transaction, hopefully, it is a Harbinger of bigger things to come as we move towards officially launching our first fully productized colocation offering in the region later this year. In general, we are winning a greater share overall as well as larger and multi-market and multi-geo colocation deals, reflecting our growing traction within the enterprise segment and these customers' global hybrid cloud use cases. Some of these wins are landing in non-productized colocation data centers. Even though these customers are consuming remote hand services and interconnection solutions commonly associated within colocation facilities. As product lines continue to blur, we are contemplating changes to our disclosure to provide insight consistent with the way we run the business. We will keep you apprised as we contemplate future changes to our disclosure with an eye towards maintaining transparent shareholder friendly communication while balancing continuity against the evolution of our business. During the second quarter, we delivered solid leasing volume up 24% sequentially with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We are also seeing an acceleration of our channel business with healthy double-digit growth relative to the first half of 2018. We added an all-time high 57 new logos during the second quarter, led by strength in our Enterprise segment, which accounted for 40 new logos. This was also a record quarter for new logos sourced through our channel partners, who contributed more new logos in the first half of this year, than they contributed all of last year. We are gaining traction within the enterprise segment of customers deploying hybrid multi cloud connected deployments globally through direct and partnership business combining the best of our ecosystems. Second quarter highlights include HCL, an alliance partner is one of the largest next generation technology companies that help enterprises reimagine their businesses. HCL selected Digital Realty to host their Oracle Demantra infrastructure and SAP cloud environments. This deployment is on behalf of a top 10 U.S.-based food and beverage company with over $10 billion in revenue and a global distribution network. Digital Realty's global platform paired with HCL's expertise and product management, market analytics and sales force management solutions enables HCL's customer to be highly responsive to the evolving pace of consumers worldwide. We continue to benefit from our strategic partnerships, including IBM, a major global automobile manufacturer is relocating their corporate headquarters to be closer to their strategic alliance partners. As part of the relocation, the auto manufacturer is leveraging IBM Direct Link dedicated hosting to enable their VMware environment to harness the power and flexibility of the IBM cloud. This hybrid cloud deployment enables fast direct connectivity of its legacy finance application built on an IBM mainframe to their virtualized environment hosted on the IBM Cloud through a digital realty fiber cross connect. The strategic partnership between Digital Realty and IBM enabled a seamless migration plan for the customer and secured the win for both companies. A large global multi conglomerate manufacturing and services company chose Digital Realty to deploy its edge networking node in our London data center. This company is working with our partner IBM to rightsize their data center footprint and manage their accelerating cloud sprawl and ballooning costs. The client chose Digital Realty as a key component of this complete digital refresh to utilize the speed, security and reliability of IBM Direct Link dedicated capabilities in our London location. By connecting to the multi-zone regional hub, IBM has deployed in our data center, our client can move vast amounts of data quickly and securely between co-located and cloud-based resources allowing them to deliver any application globally, where and when it is needed. We continue to see traction with our global interconnection platform. Mavenir, the only End-to-End, Cloud-Native Network Software Provider for cloud service providers is redefining network economics through automation products and solutions. By leveraging Digital Realty's service exchange, Mavenir is able to offer diverse passing with multiple ways to connect data center environments and ensure 99.999% uptime across their strategic global locations positioning them for continued expansion of their global service delivery. Let's turn to the composition of our customer base on Page 12. Don't forget, the cloud lives in a data center, in fact it probably lives in a Digital Realty data center as you can see from the global accounts that make up over one-third of our customer base. The network segment makes up over 25% of our customer base, and these pipes that connect customers to the clouds aren't going anywhere, regardless which workloads eventually migrate to the cloud. Resellers account for 15% of our total revenue. We think our reseller concentration is a little bit unique, not least because we have over nine years of remaining lease term with these customers and these customers are typically deployed in multiple markets around the world with us as their global partner of choice. Last but not least, Enterprise represents a little less than 25% of our total pie. Here again, we think our concentration is a little bit unique. The financial services sector has long been our largest enterprise vertical. These customers are highly regulated, typically risk averse and symbiotic repeat buyers as evidenced by the new business we did during the second quarter. Three of our top 10 deals were with existing financial services customers. We also see the growth in FinTech being relevant to our platform as they evolve their architectures to achieve, efficient data analytics out of their hybrid multicloud architectures. All of which is to say, it's a hybrid multi cloud world and we believe our fit for purpose portfolio is uniquely well suited to solve for the full supply chain. Turning to our backlog on Page 13. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped down from $144 million as of March 31, to $127 million at the end of the second quarter, primarily due to the deconsolidation of Ascenty. I'd like to point out that we've shown here the backlog for our consolidated portfolio which ties to the top line of our P&L. And we have also reflected our pro rata share of the backlog from unconsolidated joint ventures, which runs through the equity and unconsolidated JV line item, at the top of the bars on this chart. During the second quarter, the lag between signings and commencements was slightly above our long-term historical average at eight months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity. On Page 14, we signed a $125 million of renewals during the quarter in addition to new leases signed. This was the second highest quarterly renewal leasing volume in our history. Following the all-time high of $138 million in 4Q '18. Incidentally, the $116 million in 1Q '19 is now the third-highest. So our top three renewal quarters have all come within the last nine months . As you may recall, 2019 was our historical high watermark in terms of lease expirations. Halfway through the year, we have reduced our expirations down from 23% of total revenue as of 3Q '18 to less than 10% remaining as of June 30 while also extending our contracts expire and beyond 2019. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was nearly five years while cash rents on renewals rolled down 5.8%. We've delivered positive cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads in each of the past four years and although rents have been rolling down in 2019, our renewal leasing activity has been in line with our expectations, both in terms of volume, as well as rate. As I previously mentioned, we believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer, we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio . And whenever, we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings including both new business as well as renewals. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 80 basis points to 87.8% due to the customer bankruptcy we mentioned last quarter, as well as development deliveries placing servers in Frankfurt and Osaka, two of our tightest global metros. Same capital cash NOI was down 5%. This includes a 90 basis point FX headwind and you may also recall that we flagged last quarter that we faced a particularly tough comparison in the second quarter due to a sizable property tax refund, we collected in the second quarter of last year. We faced somewhat of a double whammy on the property tax line as we were hit with dramatically higher assessments in the Central region, this quarter, in addition to the refund in the year ago quarter. We intend to vigorously contest these unreasonable assessments and we have an excellent track record of prevailing on appeal. As evidenced by the sizable refund collected in the second quarter of last year. In the meantime, however, we are required to accrue based on the higher assessed values, which unfortunately introduces some volatility in the property tax line item. The U.S. dollar remains elevated relative to prior year exchange rates and FX represented roughly a 100 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 16. We manage currency risk by issuing locally-denominated debt, to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with a long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 1.6% year over year or essentially flat on a constant currency basis, primarily due to a tough comp from the sizable property tax refund in the second quarter of last year. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 17, we do expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half of the year, primarily due to stiffer foreign currency headwinds as the dollar has continued to strengthen over the course of the year, along with a higher share count from settling the forward equity offering. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating 2019 core FFO per share guidance, although there are few puts and takes in the drivers this quarter. As you may recall, we raised the range for net income by $0.25 last quarter to reflect the non-core activity running through the P&L, most notably the unrealized gain on the contribution of Ascenty to the joint venture with Brookfield. We are bringing the net income range back down by $0.15 this quarter to reflect the loss on early retirement of debt from the opportunistic refinancing of our 2020 and 2021 bond maturities at a 60 basis point savings as well as a non-cash Topic D-42 Charge from the redemption of our Series H preferred stock, which we replaced with our new Series K preferred at a 150 basis point tighter coupon. Both of these financing charges are added back to core FFO. Moving up the guidance table from the net income line, under the balance sheet section, we've updated our assumptions to reflect the actual outcomes on the refinancings I just mentioned. We've also raised our recurring CapEx guidance by $15 million. The higher recurring CapEx guide is not due to higher capital spending on the physical plant, but it's entirely due to capitalized leasing commissions on several strategic renewal transactions and is directly associated with locking in long-term contractual cash flow streams. Last but not least, our expectation for cash re-leasing spreads has improved from down high single-digits to down mid-single digits due to the evolving commercial terms on the mix of renewal transactions we currently expect to execute this year. We are keenly aware of the highly competitive dynamic, particularly in select U.S. markets, but nonetheless, the cash rent roll-down on our - in 2019 vintage expiration does not appear to be as pronounced as previously believed. In addition, although we are pleased with the trajectory of our quarter-over-quarter improvement in bookings, including a 24% increase this past quarter. Most of this activity has been concentrated in facilities still under construction. Given the eight month lag between signings and commencements, recent bookings won't really move the top line needle in calendar year 2019. Although the composition of our recent activity does position our sales team with incremental move-in ready opportunities to be offering customers in the back half of this year. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 18. Net debt to EBITDA stood at 6.1 times as of the end of the second quarter while fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.2 times. Pro forma for settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt to EBITDA remains in-line with our targeted range at 5.5 times, while fixed charge coverage is just under 4.5 times. In addition to proceeds from the forward equity offering, we expect to begin to realize the latent cash flow capacity from signed leases, including the 24 megawatts Ascenty just delivered, which are coming online in the third quarter, but which are not contributing to our last quarter annualized credit stats. Over time, we also expect to use proceeds from our capital recycling program to maintain our target leverage profile. In terms of second quarter capital markets activities, as previously mentioned, in early April, we completed the redemption of all 365 million of our 7.375% Series H preferred stock which we replaced with 210 million of permanent capital under our Series K Perpetual Preferred at 5.85% a savings of over 150 basis points. In June, we capitalized on favorable market conditions to raise $900 million of 10-year to U.S. dollars bonds at 3.6%. The lowest coupon we have ever achieved on a dollar denominated 10-year paper. This was an opportunistic liability management exercise and we use the proceeds to tender for our 3.4% notes due 2020 and our 5.25% senior notes due 2021. A little over 80% of the outstanding bonds were tendered during the second quarter and we settled the redemption of the remaining 20% in mid-July. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the debt maturity schedule on Page 19, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity by nearly half a year to 6.4 years and lowered our weighted average coupon by 10 basis points to 3.3%. A little over half of our debt is non- U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of our Page 19, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we'd be pleased to take your questions. Andrew, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: I have a couple of operational questions. I guess, first by region, in the major U.S. markets, so I'm wondering, where you see the leasing or demand pipeline, the strongest or quarter-to-date bookings geographically where that has been strongest? I think Bill mentioned a couple of examples in the script. And then on Asia and specifically Korea, I wondered, how you kind of view the puts and takes about deploying capital in that market given the large role that could shape or play in accommodating the hyperscale demand so far in that market and what is arguably lower colocation pricing, than in rest of Asia. And then finally on Europe, I just wondered the new land parcel in Hattersheim and expectations around how quickly one could potentially develop capacity there? Finally, just London, I don't think you mentioned that in your script, but any kind of updated views on the demand dynamics in the London market? Thanks.
Andrew Power: I'll try to weave the questions into a couple coherent answers, and I think we're going to probably ping-pong around the team here. So first off, U.S. markets, I would say this, the second quarter was accentuated with some pockets of strength in some more unusual places. As well some places where we've been pretty consistent kind of working from East to West, the Northern New Jersey, New York metro market that is continue to tighten. And we saw few wins in the financial services and other related verticals in that market during the quarter hop down to Dallas our Richardson campus. We continue to expand with both our existing and new customers landing on that campus and quite pleased with the progress on that market. And then over to the West Coast Santa Clara, obviously a very, very tight market we had both enterprise related and also top cloud service provider wins during 2Q. Looking a little bit into crystal ball more into back half of the year, I would say the Toronto market, where we had some great wins earlier in the year continues to be very tight. I think we're very well positioned with our campus location in that market. A brand new asset and we've had a few customers landing and also looking to expand in that location. We are looking at the incremental opportunities in - New York metro area. And also two markets, obviously a little bit more challenge for both Northern Virginia and Chicago. Bill related some of the good news on Chicago. So we're hoping for some green shoots there and in Northern Virginia we're also working on some capacity, some existing customers looking to expand with adjacency as well as some new customers looking to land on our market leading campus. I think you touched on London and Europe, maybe I'll hit that and then hand off Korea to Bill or maybe Craig can chime in on Frankfurt portion. So maybe on the front end, the Frankfurt-market as we mentioned has been one of our hottest markets, we initially ended that market just a few years ago. I think our first anchor customer was a top 3 CSP. We subsequently grew with an enterprise customer. And if you could see the absorption on our leasing table and developments, that was certainly our star for the quarter and we’re rapidly running out of capacity in that market. Maybe Greg, do you want to talk about some of the activity in our other release there in terms of expanding.
Gregory Wright: Well, first of all - I think one of the question, was in terms of Frankfurt - sorry I think one of the first question was in terms of Frankfurt in terms of potential timing. Look the contract is subject to conditions including power zoning and planning and that will probably take roughly 24 to 30 months, but again in terms of the layout of the site and the potential for the site. As we said, it's only 3 miles from the Frankfurt airport. We're very excited about that. And lastly over in Europe, London we’re pretty excited about opening up our Cloud House in Docklands’ campus strategy, a highly interconnected series of buildings in the Docklands of London. And we've been working on some strategic colocation story and wins in that market. We also have had some increase on our Crawley Campus and in some other pockets within the London portfolio. So seeing some good opportunities in that market as well, Bill, maybe you want to kick back to John's questions on Korea.
William Stein: I think Korea could be - we think Korea is going to be pretty similar to Japan in terms of how it plays out. We're not - we haven’t decided yet whether we're going to pursue that on our own or with a partner, but clearly we went into Osaka several years ago. Created a connected campus that's worked out extremely well for us and likewise, we've been building up in Tokyo. So Seoul is really the next leg of that strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: And I guess the first one is kind of follow-up Bill, earlier this year, I think you made some comments that looking to the second half, your trajectory for bookings that with a funnel look looked relatively strong and I think there has been some mixed commentary out there across the industry. So maybe, just an update, on your earlier comments in this year, about the second half of 2019?
William Stein: I'm sure, Michael. Well I mean, I think - that our performance hopefully in the second quarter is consistent with what we said in March, when we said we weren't going to write-off the balance of the year and I think clearly that's not the case. I think if you look at the second quarter versus first, there is a clear positive momentum and acceleration. It's our third highest bookings quarter, as Andy said, with a record number of new logos, standing at 57. And frankly, we expect continued improvement during the balance of the year. It's great to be able to leverage our global footprint. And that's how that's working out. So we expect that international is going to play a major role in the back half of the year. But we still would see a fair share of bookings coming out of North America. To sum up, we remain highly confident in the long-term - demand drivers for our business. Those being big data, mobile and Internet of Things and we really like our position given the strength of our global diversified platform.
Michael Funk: And just related question as well, thinking about the new market entry and the expansion that you announced today. Maybe just kind of walk through - I guess the intelligence, the thought process and even the - that the mind of the customer relationships and what you know about their expansion and how that maybe direct some of that new market entry. And the I guess the visibility that gives you into entering the new markets like South Korea and expanded in Frankfurt?
William Stein: Well this new market entry, and the expansion into - expansion Frankfurt, the re-entry into Paris. It's all based on conversations that we have with our customers. So it's - we're not going into these markets on a purely speculative basis. It is more than one customers do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: So just wanted to - you touched on Northern Virginia a little bit in your prepared remarks as being oversupplied. And you also alluded to that potentially creating some opportunities I’ll be curious about those opportunities if you could sort of talk about anything that you're seeing there. And then separately Andy in contrast as you were talking about some of the market strength in the back half you mentioned Northern Virginia, which kind of surprised me a little bit as it sounds like that's got the potential to pick up a little bit. Are you - you’ve good line of sight there in the second half or is that just you see customers kicking around some requirements and expecting to land somewhere, potentially with you guys.
William Stein: So, in regards to my commentary, I was speaking to our dialogues with our customers and so, not on a speculatively basis, really what we're seeing in terms of opportunities. Listen, Northern Virginia Ashburn obviously the largest market in the world. It's been the most robust and diverse. At the same time, it's become one of our most competitive markets and we're certainly seeing some pricing pressure on new opportunities while at the same time, some of our larger customers have been in code digestion mode for the first half of this year. We think that this market is going to work through this current supply demand challenge and we're optimistic on the market. We think these hyperscales are going to resume their growth and we are seeing some green shoots around some of these private outfits, not just in that market, but broadly speaking. Some of the private outfits who have entered the market in the last 12 to 18 months, who will either not move forward with speculative capacity or we have even seen signs where some of our selling land that they previously bought to build data center capacity. In the meantime, we're just being picking our spots so we're trying to find places where we compete beyond price, where our unique global platform can add substantial value that is customers who need a global partner in the full product suite. It's our installed and growing customer base on our Northern Virginia campuses that wants to grow with adjacency. And then lastly, it's customers to place value on the longest runway for growth for their deployments in that market, which they find in our campuses.
Jordan Sadler: So on the opportunity side, it sounds like there maybe some land parcels for example that maybe you guys might be able to pick up. And then separately on the leasing front, it sounds like you've got capacity coming online and even though that you have tenants who have been waiting like passes deliver which could lineup well for you guys in the second half. Is that fair?
William Stein: Well, I would just put some finer details, but I don't think we're - I think we’ll feel pretty good of our supply chain in Ashburn and other markets. And it’s these much more tighter markets be it a Paris or Frankfurt, South Korea, new market entry where we're focused on the land. So I don't see us other than the small parcels that really physically connected the campuses and added incremental Ingress/Egress to an existing campus partially owned. I don't see this picking up those land parcels. I do see as a good sign as potential competitor, the tide of potential competitors subsiding a little bit here, which helps overall backdrop. But going back to the demand that I was referencing, it hits all those highlights I was talking about, it was international customers looking for global partners across the full product spectrum. It's customers that landed in like certain building already on our campus and wants to grow 1 megawatt or 2 megawatts right next door. It's the larger customers who - we’ve already built the entire shell for and they're building out their capacity and call it three, six megawatt chunks and I have kind of anchored all their infrastructure on our campus. And lastly it specific customers that say, this is not my first time to lay my workload. I need to find a partner that is going to give me a really long runway for growth and they find that with Digital Realty. So all those are kind of examples I can think of mine of either opportunities we land in recent quarters or opportunities we're working on right now, in a still fairly competitive Ashburn market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: I'm just going to circle back with Nova once again. You talked about the supply demand imbalance and then more supply coming online. And then still sort of the market in digestion mode, but just trying to balance that and understand your thoughts on maybe and the confidence level you’ve seen some pick up. Obviously you're going to have some supply - your own supplier capacity coming online. But what is that then do in terms of pricing I mean are we really looking at a challenge to get to that low end of your pricing range in that market, and development yields?
William Stein: That's a market where there are certain private smaller location operators that are solely competing on price. That will likely in deals just to fill capacity and my guess is will be a short-lived run in our business quite honestly, given the competition. We're picking our spots. We're trying to find customers that really value our product offering and not just going to the lowest common denominator on price and we've been winning on those merits for some time. So obviously that's a market where the pricing has been under pressure given the relative supply demand backdrop. What I would - Eric what my comment really goes to is I don't think demand is bearing as some might suspect, and that's based on conversations we're having live with our customers. And we're going to pick our spots and be competitive and work through a potential temporary dislocation this market. And in fact, when you look at this in the broader digital realty, platform backdrop I think it's just a small piece of our puzzle as you saw from a quarter where we sequentially increased the signings 24 plus percent put up our bronze medal or number three in our records and Ashburn really didn't play to master amount to those signings at all. So I think we're going to work through this and come out the other side of this just fine.
Erik Rasmussen: And maybe just on the same cash NOI forecast. You reduce that to the mid-single digits versus high-single digits. How should we think about this and beyond this year and then will the headwinds from the legacy DFT business be completed this year?
Andrew Power: Sure so the - what I would say on that front. So we - got a couple things going against us in terms of the same-store pool. Obviously that the FX which we highlighted in the script, we also had the customer bankruptcy that we reserve for last quarter and it's going to flow through this quarter. There also - we also had a tough comp in terms of real estate property taxes. Quarter a year ago had some benefits. This quarter we started accruing for one of our central regions. If you net that out, it's not quite as bad on a kind of same-store basis, I think negative 5 is like closer to negative 2.5 when you kind of do the normalizations on both periods and the negative, it's really due to in our largest exploration year and despite quite strong retention. We've had some down time when released in capacity. As we also highlighted in our script quite pleased with the trajectory of the new signings the 57 new logos, great interconnection signings, multimarket, multi-GO colocation APAC. But there was one point, it's the signed commences, close to eight months. So in year 2019 contribution that might flow through that same-store pool is not as great as we'd like it to be in - the flip side of that that leaves inventory for our sales reps to be selling moving ready space in some hot markets and you could see in our self we will have capacity sitting available in a market like Amsterdam, which is obviously tightening on the backdrop of some of the municipality, moratoriums. Osaka, which has been a harder market and even three meg sitting in Frankfurt. We're quite honestly will probably be a food fight over that last capacity on that campus. And then lastly, I would just say while the same-store pool is very valid and very instrumental looking our financials, our dialogs with our customers is a total commercial package. So we're often tying in multiple product lines, new signings and renewals and a complex commercial solutions for our customers. So some often like a little bit in this quarter and certainly in the prior quarter, we may give a customer some relief on existing contract, but we're winning incremental on a share of their business and good returns and it's a win-win for the customer benefiting from platform digital and a commercial win for the company.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: First, if you could talk a little bit about just broadly the cloud impact that you're seeing on your business in terms of just the direction of bookings as well as what you're seeing on churn and the pace of migrations to the cloud from your customers? And then secondly if you could talk a little bit about what happened in terms of - I think it was the renewal rate in the PBB business and just maybe what caused the dip there? Thanks.
William Stein: Mike, I'll take your first question, Andy will take your second. Relative to the cloud, it's been - as you might expect a significant source of demand for us, and we haven't seen the pickup in churn that some of the others have you mentioned some of our peers have mentioned on the calls, I mean look this we've mentioned this is the third-highest booking quarter we've had huge number of international wins, 57 new logos, which was a record, second highest volume in cross connect bookings and we really do see the world. moving to a hybrid multi cloud architecture. And Digital is focused on the enterprise and we think our offerings such as the Service Exchange really enable to shift to a hybrid multi cloud. If cloud ultimately resides in a data center and they leave they sit in an awful lot of our data centers and they're signing many long-term deals with us. So we think we're really, really well positioned to benefit from the growth in cloud demand, but we're also very focused on attracting enterprise customers to sit both in our data center and connect to the clouds on our campuses. Andy do you want handle the second?
Andrew Power: And Michael, just so I make sure I address your second question. You mind repeating that you said the renewal rate on the PBB?
Michael Rollins: Yes. So if I look at the page 22, I'm sorry, 21 this quarter. I think the PBB retention ratio dropped to that 22.6% from the LTM of 93.5% and was curious if there is anything specific that cause the drop there?
Andrew Power: Yes. I think what you have is a little bit of a small sample set as you can see, especially on the square footage 39,000 versus almost 2 million a square feet in the prior quarter. So it's literally only four renewal contracts that happened this quarter. So 1, 1.5 depending on the square footage rating renewed. I believe that was a customer in our Houston footprint, not a large market for Digital Realty or a major focus and I think we only have a site or two in that market, but I would say it's pretty much an anomaly. And as you recall from last quarter, those power based buildings are typically very high retention rates and use the longest duration renewals given the fact that the customer is often putting even more substantial capital commitment into that capacity. So I don't think there is a trend or anything in that renewals time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: First up on the price renewal change the mid-single digits versus previously the high-single digits. Is that specifically because the legacy DuPont customer has not yet been renewed and is there now an expectation that they will not renew in 2019? And then secondly, there is some things that seem like they would drive your core FFO guidance up. So there is a one-time U.K. tax benefits in the first quarter, it seems like the equity forward didn't come in as linearly as maybe what was anticipated, and then obviously, as we just mentioned the reduction in the renewal spread, are the offsets to why that might not have happened, if I have them correctly, the FX, the bankruptcy, the top real estate property taxes and then the longer book-to-bill. And then just lastly, a higher level question, what does the capacity look like for the back half of this year in terms of available megawatts, if you will, in the markets where you're seeing the most demand. Do you have enough capacity effectively available you think in the markets where you're seeing the most demand to sustain the level of momentum you saw in the second quarter? Thank you.
Andrew Power: Thanks, Colby. I think there is a bunch of numbers questions in here. So let me try to tackle all three and no specific order. So actually, maybe I'll work in reverse order because it might be easier. So available capacity, I think we're set up pretty nicely in terms of available capacity in the back half of the year and you can see that either and what's on our development cycle in terms of unleased capacity or you can see in the pre-stabilized, just delivered and highlights in that - in those markets are as I mentioned, Frankfurt, Osaka, Amsterdam, London. These markets in our Latin America platform as well. So I think we're set up pretty nicely in terms of available capacity, they're coming on, back half of this year. But as you know, as we move into the back of this year, we're also working on capacity that's even coming on line in early 2020. So and many of these tighter markets be the Tokyo and others, the customers really stretching out the timelines been coming to us even earlier given there such limited capacity. What I'd like more in some of those markets, of course, Frankfurt’s a market where we just seen a rapid acceleration. So and it's a tightening market hence it's been tough to get land parcels and quite pleased with a global investment team is great work and timing that down on the heels of our success. But net-net, I think we're in a pretty good space for back half of 2019 going into 2020. Markets coming online and with capacity in the backdrop attractive demand. Going to - I think your guidance question, if you net out the outcome on the guidance, we obviously beat our internal numbers in the first quarter, largely due to some timings on the incentive close and our funding for bridging of our partners equity and being compensated for that. And as you move into second quarter, we kind of came in line with our numbers and if you look at kind of the math, you pretty much need to kind of flat line-ish with the second quarter numbers into both Q3 and Q4 to kind of get roughly to the midpoint of our guidance. I would say you've got a couple of things going on there. One, you can obviously - NOI coming online for capacity that are signed, but not commence. So that's the positive - the headwinds, which makes us reaffirm our guidance at its current range are, you have FX continuing to be a headwind one, a year-over-year basis. Two, you have our equity forward which we delayed to match our sources and uses to later in the year, so the share count from that equity forward getting drawdown is going to come into the share count and then three, I mentioned the headwind with the property tax accrual. Again, we do look to try to modify those an appeal, but we're not going to win or any type of appeal on that in, call it three months time. So those are the offsetting headwinds. And as I mentioned the signings while great quality on many metrics across the board, it does have a longer signed a commenced time period of eight months, so it's probably doing a little bit more - the second quarter signings are probably paying a little bit work to building this up for our 2020 numbers then actual in year 2019 contribution, but the positive - as I mentioned will leave us with moving ready capacity in several great markets for our sales reps to be selling into right now. Last but not least on the guidance table, we did improve our expectations for our cash mark-to-market for the full year. We don't want to specify any specific confidential customer dealings. What I can tell you is among our large both legacy digital and legacy DFT customers, we're moving closer and closer to final resolution of the path forward on some of their capacity renewals. We've worked with this customer who we've been helping in growing their capacity over the 12 – last 18 months. Across now, I think I believe all three of our connected Ashburn campus is the triangle that surround Loudon County. We've been helping them with connectivity across these campuses. Their needs and requests over time have changed and I think the shape and form of that renewal will be constructive for both the customer and for digital and likely result in a little bit better outcome in terms of rate as we push out some of those contracts that do expire over several years to begin with. A couple of years from there into the future. So that was really the driver for the guidance table change. So we do expect to complete that renewal in short order.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Bill Stein for any closing remarks.
William Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, delivering all-time high new logos, our second best renewal leasing in interconnection bookings and our third highest total bookings in our history. We extended our global footprint and took steps to secure our supply chain with several strategic land acquisitions. We re-entered Paris, we secured our second campus in Frankfurt and announced our entry into South Korea. We also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our inaugural ESG report and our official recognition as an Energy Star Partner. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity and the opportunistic issuance of another $900 million of long-term capital. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. I hope you enjoy the dark days of summer and hope to see many of you at marketplace live in New York in November.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-26 19:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to Digital Realty First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will end approximately after 60 minutes. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein, and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright, and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First and foremost, we continued to support our customers' global expansion requirements with an agreement to anchor development of a new campus in Santiago, Chile. Next, we demonstrated our commitment to deliver a sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises, renewable energy procurement and corporate governance enhancements. Third, we raised the dividend by 7%, our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet, redeeming high coupon debt and preferred stock, lowering our weighted average coupon by 30 basis points while simultaneously extending our weighted average duration by more than half a year with the opportunistic issuance of $1.6 billion of long-term capital. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
William Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. During the first quarter of 2019, the Digital Realty team continued to effectively press our competitive advantages. We capitalized on the strength of our comprehensive multiproduct offering by capturing healthy enterprise demand across multiple regions. We also advanced our private capital initiative by closing our joint venture with Brookfield and we further strengthened our balance sheet by locking in fixed rate long-term capital at attractive coupons. We continued to build upon our industry-leading commitment to sustainability and sound corporate governance, setting the stage for sustainable growth for all stakeholders. We further expanded our global platform with strategic land purchases in Tokyo and Singapore, as shown here on Page 3 of our presentation, and finally, we announced earlier this afternoon that we are entering Chile, Digital Realty's 14th country, with a 6-megawatt facility underway slated for delivery in the third quarter of 2020. Our strategy for new market entry is to follow our customers, and Chile is no exception. We are pleased to be supporting the growth of a leading global cloud provider who will be anchoring the first phase of our campus in Santiago. Chile is one of the most economically and politically stable countries in South America and is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank with a clearly quantified business-friendly investment climate and the highest per capita GDP in Latin America. Our Chilean operations will be conducted by the Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, our exclusive vehicle for data center investment in South America. It's obviously still early days since we just closed on the acquisition of Ascenty in December and the joint venture with Brookfield at the tail end of the first quarter, but and we are encouraged by our partnership with Brookfield, the early execution by the Ascenty team and the compelling growth opportunity within the region. We also continued to advance our ESG priorities over the past few months, highlighted here on Page 4. In January, we issued the first-ever data center green euro bond. Late January, we announced a long-term renewable power purchase agreement to secure 80 megawatts of solar power on behalf of Facebook to support their renewable energy goals. In late February, our Board of Directors submitted our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director-candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally, our Board also approved a proxy access standard for stockholders in late February. We are committed to sustainability and sound corporate governance principles and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. As most of you are aware, 2018 was a record year for data center net absorption and the primary metros across North America are still in digestion and restocking mode. To provide some context, North America represents approximately 80% of our total revenue and was responsible for 75% of our 2018 leasing activity, but only half of our current availability is located in North America. The same dynamic is true in [states] for Northern Virginia, our largest market at over 20% of total revenue. It accounted for 40% of our 2018 bookings, but less than 15% of our current availability. We expect to see a pickup in North America data center absorption in the second half of the year as data center providers restocking their shelves with inventory coincides with the next phase of hyperscale users' incremental growth requirements, taking adjacency next to existing applications and continuous runway for growth on our campuses. In Europe, recent leasing activity has been dominated by global cloud service providers who continue to sign expansions throughout the major metros. Data privacy and sovereignty rules are driving a distributed architecture, forcing cloud providers to establish a presence in all the major metros. So these expansions generally come in smaller increments than the hyperscale deployments in North America. Last year was likewise a record year for absorption in Europe with leading cloud providers deploying multiple megawatts across major metros. These cloud providers also exhibit a clear preference for expanding adjacent to existing deployments. So landing the initial deployment is key. Our Global Connected Campus strategy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this consumption pattern. Across the Asia Pacific regions, supply remains largely in check. The complexity of local regulatory frameworks, the difficulty of procuring power and the limited availability of sites with adequate connectivity all serve to limit competition. Demand is outpacing supply in several of our key APAC markets, notably, Singapore, Tokyo and Osaka. This is translating into solid execution and pipeline targeting our near and medium term available inventory in these markets, setting us up for attractive backdrop as we bring adjacent capacity online at our Singapore and Osaka campuses, in addition to our recently announced Tokyo campus development project. At the macro level, the Asia Pacific region is still likely in the very early stages of its communications infrastructure build-out, and we see a significant runway for growth for years to come. Finally, our pipeline of existing customer expansion and new customer opportunities is growing in both Brazil and now Chile, where we are the market-leading data center provider. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. Global economic expansion remains intact. The U.S. unemployment claims recently dipped below 200,000. Interbanks the world over have adopted a dovish stance and the risk of a full-blown trade war appears to be receding. As you've heard me say many times before, we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The hyperscale data center customers who drove outsized demand in 2018 marched to the beat of their own drum. Although they have largely remained in digestion mode in the early days of 2019, we remain highly confident in the longer-term trajectory of this demand. In addition, the resiliency of our business model enables us to capture robust and diverse demand from a broad swath of customer verticals across geographic regions around the world, as evidenced by our first quarter results. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to highlight a couple of the points on Page 7. According to Synergy Research, the total cloud market ecosystem passed the $250 billion revenue milestone in 2018, up 32% from the prior year. Separately, according to an IDC global study of 800 enterprise cloud users, 58% of respondents are now employing a hybrid cloud model, defined as using private and public resources for the same workload. Finally, an IDC study of 400 users of public cloud compute and storage services found that over 50% have recently moved the workload back on-premise. To effectively address the hybrid multi-cloud market, data center providers must offer a global interconnected solution from colocation to hyperscale. These trends obviously play directly to our strengths, help explain the durability of our recent results and bode very well for future demand cycles. Given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. As Bill indicated, our first quarter results highlighted the durability of the Digital Realty global platform with balanced performance across the regions, product types and customer segments. We signed total bookings of $50 million, including $9 million from Ascenty, a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million with a weighted average lease term of 10 years, including a $7 million colocation contribution. 5 of our top 10 deals in the first quarter were outside the U.S., including several top customers who were able to leverage our global platform to enable their growth across regions. For example, this quarter, we enabled the expansion of a cloud infrastructure provider, that specializes in helping developers launch applications into the cloud, helping them better serve their customers on the West Coast as well as APAC. Within our global account segment, we landed 2 sizable deployments north and south of the border with a leading global cloud service provider. Separately, we also landed a network edge node from another leading global cloud service provider, which we expect will enhance the interconnection profile of our campus in Dallas, Texas. We continue to track healthy demand within our global account segment, but the cloud accounted for just 1/3 of our first quarter bookings, as shown on Page 11. On a majority of our new business during the quarter was with existing customers, we added 43 new logos, with a particularly strong contribution from our enterprise segment. For example, a well-funded software startup leveraging artificial intelligence to develop safe and reliable technology for autonomous vehicles selected a Digital Realty data center to help their production application and deliver their technology on a global scale. Afterpay is a global fintech provider based in Australia providing a "buy now, pay later" payment platform. Their proprietary decision-making engine determines creditworthiness of their retail customers in a near real-time on a global scale, and they are leveraging service exchanges from earning their gateways in the U.S. and in Europe to simplify, scale and improve the user experience. We continue to see traction from European-based organizations keen to partner with a data center provider able to facilitate their global growth well into the future. A multinational semiconductor and software design company headquartered in New York selected Digital Realty to provide a global data center strategy to support the transition of their business services as the decommissioned data centers and extend their business reach. In particular, the partnership will facilitate their ability to extend their presence into Singapore in support of their APAC initiatives. They will now be able to deliver a full global services capability supported by Digital Realty in each region of -- around the world. In addition, a British satellite telecommunications company is expanding with us in Europe to provide further colocation solutions for their London and Amsterdam operations. The solution underpins the infrastructure required to support the launch of their new satellite later this year and will provide high-speed broadband services to their customers. Channel partners continued to contribute to our business and comprised 15% of our first quarter colocation and interconnection bookings and accounted for 25% of our new logos. One of our top channel partners brought us an opportunity to support a digital health care company that is redefining the way cardiac arrhythmias are clinically diagnosed by combining their wearable bio-sensing technology with cloud-based data analytics and machine learning capabilities. Their primary business model requires extensive data mining to help doctors predict and respond to cardiovascular events. The customer's proprietary cloud solution within Digital Realty required access to Azure, AWS and Salesforce cloud services. Digital Realty won the business by providing a superior low-latency and HIPAA compliant solution with the ability to connect to multiple cloud providers throughout our interconnection services, including Service Exchange. We're also seeing traction with the strategic relationships we have forged with leading cloud and managed service providers. For example, we're engaged with one of our global cloud's hyperscale customers to provide best-in-class ultra low-latency hybrid services to end customers with specific performance requirements. We're also teaming up with a major storage solution provider who offer services to end customers who wants to deploy private infrastructure in close proximity to the public cloud. Alliances like this greatly expand Digital Realty's addressable market and demonstrate our unique capabilities in terms of ubiquitous cloud interconnection and near-field proximity to underlying cloud infrastructure around the globe. Turning to our backlog on Page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stood at $144 million at the end of the first quarter. I'd like to point out here that the current backlog shown on Page 12 reflects the full contribution from Ascenty, whereas the Ascenty contribution will be shown in our 49% pro rata share going forward. The weighted average lag between the first quarter signings and commencements remained tighter than our long-term average and a little over 2 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13. We signed $116 million of renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed. This is the second highest quarterly renewal leasing volume in our history, right on the heels of the all-time high of $138 million in 4Q '18. The weighted average lease term on renewals was nearly 13 years, while cash rents on renewals were down 6.9%, driven primarily by strategic portfolio transaction as a single customer deployed a multiple powered base building shell as well as fully built-out turn-key capacity in 15 sites across our global platform. We renewed their footprint for 15 years on triple net lease terms, walking in these cash flows for years to come and maximizing the value from these facilities. We also effectively tied the strategic renewal to a multi-region expansion opportunity with the same customer. Excluding global relationships that have signed an incremental $15 million of annualized GAAP revenue over the past 6 months, the mark-to-market on first quarter renewals would have been essentially flat on a cash basis, as you can see from the data points on the bottom of Page 13. This incremental leasing activity is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic, long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 40 basis points to 88.6%, half due to development deliveries placed in service in Amsterdam and Chicago and half due to customer move-outs in Silicon Valley and Dallas. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen over the past 90 days and FX represented roughly a 100 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 14. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 15. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable-rate debt with longer-term fixed-rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move-in LIBOR will have a less than 1% impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 6% year-over-year or 7% on a constant currency basis and came in $0.10 above consensus. Delta relative to prior expectations was primarily due to interest income on the Brookfield joint venture funding as well as tax benefits due to a reduction in the corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came in effect during the first quarter. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect to dip back down in the second quarter due to the deconsolidation of the Ascenty joint venture going forward, the absence of the tax benefit in future periods and the forward equity drawdown, as you can see from the bridge on Page 16. We're revaluing in the second half of the year as several large leases commence. As you may have seen from the press release, we're reiterating 2019 core FFO per share guidance. Most of the drivers are unchanged, with the exception of updating financing activity and a reduction to our same-store growth outlook. In addition to continued FX headwinds, the primary change from our prior forecast includes the "blend and extend" component of the strategic portfolio transaction executed during the first quarter and bad debt expense related to a subscale private colocation reseller. We also face a particularly tough comparison in the second quarter due to a sizable property tax refund we collected in the second quarter of last year, which also weighs on the full year same-store growth comparison. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. Net debt-to-EBITDA remains in line at 5.5 times as of the end of the first quarter. Our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.6 times. Pro forma for the ins and outs of Brookfield's funding of the Ascenty joint venture and the forward equity drawdown, net debt-to-EBITDA is just over 5 times and fixed charge coverage is just over 4 times. Over the past several months, the Digital team capitalized on favorable market conditions to advance our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs. In early January, we did all $500 million of our 5.875% senior notes due 2020. We also executed against our strategy of locking in a long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the currency to support our assets with a green euro bond offering in early January. This was our second euro bond offering and also our second green bond, following the USD 500 million green bond released in 2015. But this was the first-ever data center euro green bond. The offering was well received, successfully raising gross proceeds of approximately $1 billion of 7-year paper at 2.5% while underscoring Digital Realty's industry-leading sustainability commitment. Market conditions continued to improve over the quarter, and in late February on the basis of reverse increase from investors, we reopened both the 2.5% euro green bond offering due 2026 as well as our recently issued 3.75% sterling bonds due 2030. And we raised another $450 million of long-term debt at attractive coupons. We follow the same playbook with a perpetual preferred equity portion of our capital stock during the first quarter. We announced the reduction of all 365 million of our 7.375% series H preferred stock and we raised $210 million of permanent capital under our new series K perpetual preferred at 5.85%. Finally, we advanced our private capital initiative, closing on the $700 million Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, a leading global asset manager. The successful execution against our financial strategy is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the debt maturity schedule on Page 18, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity by more than half a year and lowered our weighted average coupon by 30 basis points. A little over half our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 18, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Atkins of RBC Capital Markets.
John Atkins: So two questions. One, on the sales pipeline, I was wondering if it looks measly different than earlier this year and late last year. Or do you see a greater mix potentially of double-digit megawatt opportunities as the company brings on more inventory? And are there any notable exchanges by region in Asia Pac, Brazil, Europe and North America as you sort of think about the pipeline rest of the year versus earlier? And then I have kind of a margin question more conceptually, do you see an opportunity to get sustainably past the 60% EBITDA margin level? Or is high 50%s kind of appropriate given your anticipated development pipeline or other investments you're making in the business?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jon. This is Andy. Look, there's, I guess, still a handful questions in there, so let me try to unpack them. Overall pipeline, obviously, we're -- we don't only speak to a specific pipeline number. I think if you look at the composition of our signings in the first quarter, it's quite healthy across regions in terms of competition, size, the deals across industries, a great 43 new logos. So fairly healthy, and I think I've characterized the pipeline going forward consistent with that strength. Your question on the, I guess, more -- see more double-digit megawatt opportunities, say, on the whole, we've seen an increase in double-digit megawatt opportunities roll with additional inventory coming online. While that's been the case for Nashville or Dallas, Chicago, where we've been building out campuses for quite some time, it's been a little bit of a newer phenomenon in Frankfurt and Amsterdam or London or even in Toronto, and certainly Osaka, where, for example, where now these larger customers could see immediate inventory meets their needs, and you can see that runway to growth. So I do think you're going to continue to see that mix of more double-digit megawatt deals continue. I think your next question was a little bit of kind of compare and contrast on the markets. I'll try to do that efficiently. Maybe starting in Asia, I think we've seen some great strength that Bill mentioned. Firstly, in Singapore and Tokyo, markets were literally trying to find extra capacity in the broom closet for some of our customers as it relates to the next leg of our campuses in SIN12 or our newest campus in Tokyo come online. Osaka, this is not to highlight there, where we are bringing on capacity in a series of adjacent campus-like facilities where our customers are growing with us in a nice smooth runway. Hopping over to Europe, Frankfurt's going to highlight their great 3-megawatt signing to an IT service customer that had an enterprise customer that they exported from the U.S. into that market. We've seen some robustness there at a time where, I'd say, supply was quite limited. Back in the Americas, as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the competition was really Toronto. We're building upon our success there, and I think we've seen some incremental inbounds most recently there and some also -- some office -- the other wins in Dallas and Santa Clara. A little lighter on Ashburn, but that was very much subject to inventory. And then Bill kind of gave you a little preview of our entry to Chile and the success with Ascenty. So the second question, just so I have it right, Jon, was about EBITDA margins and where we get to see that going from here. So I guess the midpoint of our guidance is to be at about 58% adjusted EBITDA margin. As a reminder, that's down over 100 basis points year-over-year from ASC 842 accounting change for the expensing of nonsuccess-based leasing compensation. Right now, I could tell you we're much more focused on expanding -- or actually I should say we're less focused on expanding our industry-leading EBITDA margin and more focused on growth. Over the longer term, I think it's pretty intuitive as we continue to scale our platform globally, particularly in new markets that I mentioned with more volume campuses and with greater times and scale. I do see a longer-term trajectory to further EBITDA expansion, pushing up closer to the 60% area that you mentioned. But right now, again, the focus is more prioritizing growth given the feel that we have quite a healthy EBITDA margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: So first question is on guidance versus sort of the beat in the quarter. Andy, you touched on it when you went through Slide 16, which is always helpful. But I guess, just running the numbers as opposed to looking at the bars, if I backed the $1.73 in the quarter out of the $6.65, it implies that you're going to do $1.64 per quarter in order to get to the full year, or that's what you need to do, at least, which seems like a pretty sizable step down. I know you touched on some of the puts and takes, the Brookfield JV funding, obviously, is a little bit of a drag. The tax benefit, I guess, I could use a little bit of a better explanation for. And then separately, can you maybe elucidate what we should expect to happen on the forward equity a little bit better? Because at least in this illustration, it shows you taking down all of the forward equity prior to 2Q -- or before the 2Q bar? And then I'll have a follow-up.
Andrew Power: Sure. Thanks, Jordan. So I guess the components again. So Brookfield closed on its 49% joint venture the very last day of the quarter. So we had not anticipated that to take so long in terms of regulatory approvals and tax and legal structuring, but we did prepare for just in case, and they've compensated us for carrying their share in the investment with a current return. And that's, obviously, going to go away. So it's a bit of a onetime benefit to actually feel in the quarter. To a lesser extent, the U.K. corporate tax rates revised from 21% down with something slightly lower than that, I think, 17%. And obviously, we have non-U.S. dollar investments in London that we have to adjust our tax rate for deferred tax assets or liabilities in this case. So having a benefit to our core FFO, that appears in the quarter as well. So those are the things I'd say that contributed to the several pains of outperformance in the first quarter relative to our original guidance. And in terms of headwinds, that counteracted us in the quarter and also will counteract us in the full year. I think I spelled out we had some bad debt expense. We have a more troubled private colo reseller customer that's a relatively small percentage of our total portfolio, but does provide some headwinds during the quarter. It certainly kind of dampened our same-store NOI pool year-over-year growth and also will provide a headwind to the core FFO per share growth on a full year basis. So I'd say, right now, consistent with prior practice, which is really a philosophy of not sending the starters into the locker room after 1 of 4 quarters, we do keep our guidance constant. And going to your question on the -- a drawdown on the equity forward, so there's a $1.1 billion gross equity. We have not drawn down on any of it. As you can see from the balance sheet at 3/31, we had just over $800 million of revolver balance on the $2.6 billion revolver. We had about $130 million almost of cash on hand. Brookfield literally came in the last day so we couldn't even pay down the revolver with a portion of that till a day later. And I would say we're going to be drawing down a portion of it before the end of the second quarter. We took a little bit of poetic license on the chart. We're putting that bar just to the left of the second quarter bar, but I'd say the bulk of it will be -- bulk, if not all of it, will certainly be done by the end of the quarter.
Jordan Sadler: Just to clarify, the Brookfield cash doesn't -- didn't show up on the balance sheet at all. Is it because that's...
Andrew Power: I'm just stating we have a $127 million-or-so cash in the balance sheet at 3/31, because that money literally came in that single day and we couldn't send the wire to pay down more revolver balance for that piece.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. My follow-up was more on sort of funding longer term. You've recently -- and maybe this is a good question for Mr. Wright. You've recently talked about a self-funding model potentially, and I'm just curious if we can get an update, maybe a few months into the year what it looks like as you've sort of gone after the market or have taken an assessment in the portfolio, how we should be thinking about Digital's funding and sort of harvesting of assets this year.
Gregory Wright: Yes, Jordan. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, consistently, we've said previously, although our 2019 guidance does not include any of the disposition assumptions, we continue to remain focused on recycling capital and portfolio optimization. The company has a heritage to that. Bill was doing that 6, 7 years ago, and we continue to focus on those opportunities when they make sense. We're certainly continuing to evaluate the private markets as a source of capital, and clearly, what everyone know when we have anything to report. And with that said, you can reasonably expect us to periodically sell assets, particularly nondata center properties or assets in markets that no longer fit our strategy. Specifically, we discussed selling certain triple net lease assets potentially as well as potentially joint venturing stabilized assets where we can pull out some of that capital. We would joint venture it and redeploy that capital into higher-yielding development assets, which we think is a prudent capital allocation strategy. And look, I think, again, we haven't committed to any specific amounts and timing since. As Andy would touch on, we're fully funded through 2020. I want to say that it could be as high as a couple billion over multiple years, but again, no specific timing are announced.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Michael Funk: Yes, just a couple, guys. I mean, first, Bill, during the call, you made some comments and expectation for maybe a pickup or an absorption in the second half of 2019 from a large to hyperscale guys. I hope you can connect that back to some of the comments we've heard in the last week-or-so from Intel, for example, unit weakness there; NTSI, talking about inventory oversupply. Contrast it with Microsoft talking about building out their global data center regions. Maybe help us pull that together and talk about your own -- your view on the second half pickup in absorption?
William Stein: So keep in mind in the first half, we really didn't have any inventory in Northern Virginia, which is our strongest and biggest market, and that's going to be coming on in the second half. So that, at least, will give us some product to sell. I could tell you that just based on conversations that we're having -- well, in fact, backing up, the purchasing cycle of these CSPs tends to be spiky. It can be -- it has been volatile. And not all CSPs buy on the same schedule and some buy in far greater quantity than others, and in some regions, see greater orders than others. I mean, in general, Virginia is the highest and we see smaller orders. Historically, we've seen smaller orders in Europe versus North America. So there certainly was a lull in the first quarter. And I think despite that, we did $50 million in bookings, so we're happy with that. And in some ways, we feel that the quality of bookings is better in the first quarter because it's -- we're less dependent on the large spiky CSP orders. But I have no doubt that those orders will resume in the back half of the year.
Michael Funk: Okay. And then you also announced the -- you talked it earlier, the Chile deal in the first phase. I think you announced the size of the deal. Any additional commentary on future phases, what that could look like, the timing, any kind of underwriting commentary you can give us as well. What kind of rates are you underwriting that at?
William Stein: Sure, Michael. I'd like to fill in some of the details here. So this is very consistent with our Digital Realty new market entry expansion. Purely customer-led. And this one, in particular, derisked by simultaneous customer signing and our control of land, and ultimately, start of construction. This is a -- initially going to be about a little over 6, 6.3 megawatts data center hall in Santiago, but has a runway for growth too. Could be another 20-plus megawatts with adjacency. So -- and I think on the heels of this, I think we'll likely see additional other customers looking to expand in this market as well.
Michael Funk: Okay. And then, real quick...
William Stein: Mike, you probably know it, but the initial structure is leased hall, and that is really a function of time-to-market. Our expectation is that we will purchase that asset.
Michael Funk: Okay. And then one quick clarification, Andy, if I could. So the adjusted EBITDA guidance, is that apples-to-apples, what you gave us at 4Q? I didn't notice some adjustments for the -- for Ascenty. So just to clarify, is that the same guidance, or was there a change there?
Andrew Power: Sure. The -- I think we gave you adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, not Chile EBITDA. But so I'd say, if you look across that guidance table for each of the assumptions and, ultimately, the output row at the very bottom, we've kept that on an apples-to-apples basis throughout without no change. I think if you go back to our initial guidance back in the first weeks of January, we did try to give you what '18 going to look like under the change in accounting for ASC 842.
Michael Funk: Okay. So no change, even though if I calculate the adjusted EBITDA. I look at the back of your supplemental, there is the difference with the unconsolidated JV and then the noncontrolling interest now contributing to that.
Andrew Power: No. I mean, no -- same accounting for the table and the -- from left to right on there. I mean, the only difference is Ascenty, Brookfield. We owned 100% of Ascenty from December 21 on through all but the last -- very last day of the first quarter. So we recognized consolidated or almost 99%, I should say, of that venture. It actually does only 1% interest through our P&L. And on the last day when Brookfield closed on its 49%, it slipped to an unconsolidated joint venture at the -- and ultimately, given it's literally 1 day, it really wasn't material enough for disclosure on the back of our financial sup. It will be next quarter when we own 49% for a full 90 days. And we did provide a reconciliation on our leverage stats for both net debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage to make sure you're apples-to-apples in numerator and denominator for our provider share of ownership on those cats.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael: Great. I guess just 2 high-level questions. Your -- Bill, I think in that last comment or question, you mentioned you've no doubt, I guess, to your assumption to the larger deals in the second half of '19. And I'm just curious is that based on recent trends in the last few weeks, in the last month? Or would you feel just as confident, call it, on January 1? And then secondly, M&A. Obviously, it's been a key aspect of your strategy in the last several years. I know there's been some pushback on valuations, perhaps more recently over the last few quarters, if not a year. Are you seeing those change and are you seeing potentially more opportunities for you guys to do something than maybe you would have thought of just a few months ago?
William Stein: Sure, Colby, leet me -- I'll handle the first one and I think Greg can pick up on the second one. I wouldn't say that there's been any change since January that causes that. It's just a function of looking back over history and seeing what the buying pattern has been. Obviously the -- some of the CSPs have taken the very large blocks of space in the relatively recent past, which has taken some time for them to absorb. But if you've listened to the Microsoft earnings report today, their cloud business is clearly very robust. And I will assume that the other firms will report in a similar vein. And at the end of the day, you really need to procure a space to house these operations. And that's why we feel as we do.
Christopher Sharp: Yes. And just providing a little bit more color on that, Bill. A couple of the elements that we've been looking at the market is particularly around some of the services that we all see all these cloud providers launching. These services are becoming more complex and require a different type of infrastructure to meet their requirements. And so it's all about these huge data lakes and about the ability to do a cat cage or multi-megawatt deployments across our entire Connected Campus, which is where we still see every major provider out there launching a handful of new services every quarter. So there's -- all of that requires infrastructure to continue to meet the market demands of all the consumers globally.
Gregory Wright: This is Greg, responding to the M&A question. Look, I think when you take a look at the landscape right now, and so we've mentioned it before. We constantly monitor all opportunities, whether in the public market and the private markets, whenever it may be. At this time, I think your point is right. We're seeing a lot of potential M&A opportunities in the private market especially. And as you can imagine, given our position, we see everything. I think you also -- due to the fact that the pricing remains fairly robust, and that's true. With that said, I think we've shown our discipline and commitment in the past to only do deals that make strategic sense and we believe is the appropriate risk-adjusted return, and that's the way we're going to continue to pursue our M&A strategies. With that said, also another leg of that stool, it's not necessarily M&A, but we're looking at land purchases as well to continue to fund the company's growth. So the reality is we look at 3 different prongs, really: M&A, whether it's public or private; we look at both portfolio -- our private portfolio and one-off acquisitions; as well as land acquisitions. And again, this may change by market. But we go back and we monitor each market, determine what we think appropriate returns are and what our strategy is and what our customers are driving us in that market and weigh all those factors before we embark upon any M&A activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen: Maybe just circling back in Northern Virginia. Obviously, there's a slowdown we're seeing -- slower absorption in this market. Hearing a lot of inventory in the market and putting pressure on pricing. But can you just kind of talk to some of those sort of dynamics in that market? I know from what we're hearing and some of the things that we've seen so far reported kind of all jives with maybe a second half pickup. But can you just give a little bit more color on what you're hearing from customers there and just some clarity?
Andrew Power: Eric, this is Andy. I mean, I'll try to tackle that. So we've obviously been monitoring this market quite closely. It's certainly the most competitive market in the arena. I would also say it's historically been the largest and have the largest amount of demand and most robust and diverse demand across all cloud service providers and enterprise customers. We've, as Bill mentioned, had a pretty great phenomenal success of latest 12-plus months, call it, close to 99 megawatts to the point where pretty much all of our existing inventory had been leased. So we came up -- although short, now we did not anticipate that was going to happen a year prior when we would have grown incremental inventory. I think the way we think about tackling that market, we are closely monitoring relative competitiveness. We are very, very pleased with the fact that we are selling to a very large and growing installed customer base. Many customers want to grow with that adjacency, adjacent suite, adjacent buildings, really a short walk across the road or a conduit for the fiber to be pulled. And many of these customers who have already landed with us have that game plan already rounded out incremental capacity they want to take once they're fully utilizing their existing suites. So having that installed base is certainly a competitive advantage to date, and I think that will bear fruit as our new inventory -- our latest inventory comes online in the back half of 2019. The other thing I'd say is the tool we utilize in pretty much defending our rate of returns of profitability. And any more competitive market is really flexing the muscle of the global multiproduct portfolio and bringing together opportunities for our customer to grow in various supply constrained more rare and unique opportunities, be it Tokyo or Singapore or Osaka or Frankfurt or South America, kind of patching opportunities for these customers and not beholden necessarily do that private one-off competitor that has only has -- anything to sell is rate. So obviously, more to come. I will be even more close to the front lines as we have inventory to sell against that market. But I think we've got a tremendous value proposition and some pretty good tools in our toolkit to make sure we maximize value for that market and for the company.
Erik Rasmussen: So great. And so what I'm hearing is that, even though you may have lost out or you could be losing out on deals, it's not like because of your competitive advantage in this installed base, if you lost or out on this sign of first go-around, that business will come back or maybe even customers are kind of waiting for that incremental capacity to come online. And again, it's not just a pricing game or if you had -- because there was a lot of capacity that's in that market and a lot of inventory. So is that a fair way to capture that?
Andrew Power: Honestly, I would say that the timing of inventory tightness and demand is taking a bit of a pause kind of coincided for us in that market. So I'm not sure we really lost out based on our look at the market in the first quarter. There was a tremendous amount of deals we lost out on, even if they were at more competitive rates due to our lack of inventory. And I think that goes back to some of Bill's commentary of there we landed large consumers of our product in the prior 12 to 18 months that often take kind of several months to digest in the restocking mode, and then come back and want to grow with that capacity with adjacency. So today, I don't think there's really any regrettable losses in that market of any substance, even with a fairly competitive pricing opportunities out there from certainly many of our competitors that do not have other value-add for their customers beyond just offering a new price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.
Michael Rollins: Just curious if you can unpack a bit more of the same-store NOI for 2019. As you look into 2020, how should we think about the change in same-store NOI based on the mix of business that you have in the renewals for next year?
William Stein: Michael, why don't I -- maybe I'll start with actuals and kind of bridge to guidance table, just to kind of put a -- make it more clear. So our same-store NOI came in at negative 2.5%. That's cash NOI year-over-year for the quarter. I would splice it into there were normal course business that would have had that number coming closer to 1% positive or at least 70 basis points positive, for sure. And we had 3 more episodic -- at least 2 or 3 more episodic headwinds that hit us during the quarter. I mentioned there's bad debt expense that is the net against the revenue and obviously the cash NOI from the coprivate colo reseller that is a customer within our same-store pool. We also have that global relationship multimarket 15-year renewal, which had a, call it, blend and extend component. The customer had like 2.5 years left and we pushed them out 15 years. And while we lowered the rate, which you'll see in our PBB renewals and some of our TKF renewals, those leases are now cut on in the 2.5-plus rate for now 15 years, which we think is a value maximization path there. And then we also had some FX headwinds doing track with the dollar, because now then you hedge on an unlevered basis from the same-store NOI pool. So negative 2.5% as reported cash NOI. If you were to back out the bad debt, the FX and our strategic renewal, that would have been about 0.7 positive. I would say if you kind of then translate actuals for 1 quarter into guidance table for a full year, I would say about half of the decrease in the NOI is due to the bad debt expense and the blend and extend renewal. Again, that's not something we do every quarter or every year. We don't have that many customers that have that much capacity with that short of duration available to renewal at once, and you do renew it once and resets. And I'd say the other half, just overall, the FX, let's say the other half and just what I'd say we're seeing kind of outcomes on potential expiration, potential downtime for re-leasing. So nothing tremendously new, just maybe we're more cautious around looking at the same-store pool. Before I let you get to your second question, I would remind you and others on the call, the same-store pool is one piece of the puzzle just like our cash mark-to-markets. We do a tremendous amount of business that have new leasing tied to existing renewals. I think we've called out that on one of the slides in the deck that our mark-to-markets have actually been flat on a cash basis and positive on GAAP basis, about 1% to 3%. And the subset was customers did $50 million of GAAP with us. So on a relationship return versus same-store versus renewed capacity splicing, it's actually accretive to our cash flow and to our revenue.
Michael Rollins: And then how do you think about that for next year?
William Stein: Next year, we're really finding our way through the major renewals this year. So we've talked about the big 15 sites strategic portfolio of customer that was not a CSP. We are just at the very beginning of the second quarter executed with a top CSP, a long-term legacy digital customer for about 250,000 square feet, 20-plus megawatts at a pretty attractive renewal, call it, 5 years in term. And I'd say that one is kind of through now. And I'd say other than 1 legacy renewal from a company we've acquired 12 years ago, we're really getting to, I think, finer waters here in terms of these renewal headwinds. And I think we'll talk a lot less about them in 2020 and certainly 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies.
Jon Petersen: Maybe just very quickly. I just want to think it's not in the guidance, I know people will keep asking about it, but I just wanted to clarify. So the onetime payment you got from Brookfield and the U.K. tax benefit, were those contemplated in the initial guidance or was that not expected?
William Stein: Jon, we did not expect Brookfield to close 90 days into the first quarter. We thought that transaction was going to close very early in the year. It's not prior to the end of the year, quite honestly. And now we didn't expect that in the guidance, but we're planning for that in structuring of our deal with Brookfield and part of our transaction with Brookfield in exchange for us to assure them a 49% share of the incentive business. As they've navigated their regulatory and legal approvals, they were to compensate us for fronting their capital for what ended up being called just over 90 days. So that was not contemplated and we did not contemplate the change in U.K. tax -- corporate tax rates in our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: In terms of the commentary you made about focusing on growth, especially with the development coming on at the end of the year. Does it make sense that -- to look at the dividend growth kind of slowing to help fund the growth aspect? Or is that just kind of the law on large numbers? And if we can get a follow-up on how you think about the dividend growth rate, that would be great.
William Stein: Thanks, Richard. So I don't think this is a zero-sum game between dividend growth investing the platform for future top line growth. Really the dividend growth is predicated on really the growth in the taxable income as a REIT and ultimately our cash flows. We're now, call it, a 70% AFFO P/E ratio. That's on the heels of our dividend increase of just under 7% last quarter. And as to CF figure, I think you'd see the cash flows grow onto '19 and beyond. I think you'll see the dividend kind of move -- waxed up. Always what I'd say, I'll lean towards not overdistributing and maintaining a good portion of our capital in order to prevent the lines on external markets for funding our developmental growth opportunities. At the same time, we are certainly investing and focusing on accelerating our growth. I think that's a few points across the board. It's, obviously, I think, top of mind for our new Global Head of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer. We've made some changes to kind of accelerate the growth and to kind of further emphasize our focus on the enterprise customer seeking colocation and interconnection on a global platform. But again, I don't think this is one thing or another. These are both missions that I think we can deliver simultaneously.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Stein for any closing remarks.
William Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further expanded our global platform, closing the Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, securing strategic landholdings in key global metros and announcing our entry into Chile in support of our strategic customers' global growth aspirations. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises, renewable energy contracts and corporate governance enhancements. Third, we raised the dividend by 7%, the 14th consecutive year we've raised the dividend, dating all the way back to our inception in 2004. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity and the opportunistic issuance of $1.6 billion of long-term capital. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.+

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-05 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Due to scheduling constraints, today's call will be limited to 1 hour. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Stewart: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call will be CEO Bill Stein and CFO Andy Power. The call may contain forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  For a further discussion of risks related to our business see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.  Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our full year 2018 results. First, we delivered record bookings over one-third better than the previous all-time high. Next, we closed on the acquisition of Ascenty, expanding our global platform into Latin America and we further extended our sustainability leadership with continued expansion of our renewable energy capacity.  Third, we delivered 8% core FFO per share growth and we delivered double-digit growth in AFFO per share for the third time in the past four years. Last but not least, we further strengthen the balance sheet by recasting our line of credit and locking in long-term fixed rate debt at attractive coupons. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We advanced each of these three pillars during the fourth quarter. We extended our global footprint with our entry into Latin America. In December, we closed the acquisition of Ascenty, the leading data center platform in the rapidly growing Brazilian market shown here on page three of our presentation. Ascenty owns a high quality portfolio of purpose built world class data centers as well as a proprietary fiber network and is run by a best in class management team. Over 90% of the revenue is generated from investment grade or equivalent customers and over 75% of contractual cash rent is denominated in U.S. dollars. This transaction represents a highly strategic extension of our global platform offers a compelling growth opportunity and will be accretive to our long-term growth. Our top priority is deepening connections with our customers. We are also focused on strengthening connections across our organization. We made several important investments in our human capital during the fourth quarter most notably including the appointment of Greg Wright as Chief Investment Officer and Corey Dyer as Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Greg joins us following a long and distinguished career in investment banking. And he served as lead advisor on several transformational transactions for Digital Realty. Corey brings over 25 years of relevant industry experience, including colocation and interconnection sales leadership experience successfully targeting the enterprise customer segment. With these key additions in place we have filled out the team and are fully primed to press our competitive advantages and power our customers’ digital ambitions around the world. We also took several significant steps towards further extending our sustainability leadership over the past few months highlighted here on page four. In November, we received NAREIT’s data center Leader in the Light Award for the second consecutive year. We are the first and so far the only data center REIT to receive NAREITs leader in the light award for sustainable real estate practices. In December, we announced that we earned the U.S. EPA’s Energy Star certification for superior energy performance in 24 data centers in 2018. We also entered in an agreement with Salt River Project to source solar energy to power a portion of the load for our Arizona data center portfolio. In January we issued the first ever data center in Green Euro bond. And finally, just a couple of weeks ago we announced a long-term renewable power purchase agreement to secure 80 megawatts of solar power on behalf of Facebook to support their renewable energy goals. We are committed to managing our environmental impact in optimizing our use of energy and natural resources because we believe it's the right thing to do and because it matters to our customers.  Most of our top customers have 100% renewable energy targets and our ability to meet their needs for renewable and highly efficient data center solution sets us apart from our competitors. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page five. Moving from East to West with the sun data center demand remains robust across the Asia Pacific region, driven by local as well as global hyper scale users. In Japan, we recently announced a multi-megawatt multi-year agreement with a leading global cloud service provider to anchor the latest facility on our Osaka Connected campus scheduled for delivery the middle of this year. As you can see from the occupancy schedule in our supplemental we've also had significant activity in Singapore where we are quickly running out of capacity and recently announced the acquisition of a land parcel on a long-term ground lease to accommodate build out of our next facility at Liang drive on the east side of Singapore, scheduled for delivery the latter half of next year. The supply situation across the region remains largely in check. And given the robust demand backdrop, we expect to continue to invest to support our customers’ growth in existing core markets as well as potentially in select new markets. In Europe, supply demand dynamics are fairly balanced. Despite the noise around Brexit, we continue to see healthy demand, notably including a sizable global cloud network node deployment in our Crawley Campus in London during the fourth quarter. At Sovereign House in the Docklands we are nearing capacity. And we recently gave the go ahead to break ground on a Cloud House, an adjacent multi-megawatt facility that will offer customers a unique ability to land a new colocation deployment directly adjacent to the city's network dense interconnection hub. Incidentally, we acquired the freehold interest in Sovereign House during the fourth quarter and we now own this iconic London Docklands asset outright. Across the UK as well as the Continent, pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options along with differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence. Market vacancy remains in check across the major European markets, while competitors are bringing new supply to market it is being met by healthy demand, particularly from existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth. In the Americas, competition is similarly intense across the primary data center metros, including Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active Metro in the world. Despite the number of competitors and shovels in the ground, we are well positioned to outperform the competition, given our ability to address the full spectrum of our customers data center needs around the world, our deep installed customer base in Ashburn with a strong preference to expand next to their existing deployments. The longest runway for customers’ campus growth align with our agile delivery capabilities allowing for limited speculative risk. And last but certainly not least, the strength of our investment grade balance sheet. At the end of the day, we believe customers view our global platform, our operational and financial resiliency and our comprehensive space power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to the macro environment on page six, we are late in the cycle and comps are getting tougher across corporate America. Tough comps and moderating growth are a far cry from a global recession however, as evidenced by continued robust job growth in the U.S. as well as the very respectable growth in cloud revenues during the fourth quarter. Hyperscale requirements are big and getting bigger so new business could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But we continue to see very healthy demand from our customers. The trends underlying this demand are long-term and secular in nature. People don't stop using personal or professional social media just because it's late in the cycle. In fact, corporate IT outsourcing and cloud adoption are significant drivers of our business. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a slowdown, cost containment and achieving efficiencies become paramount. Constantly given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are very well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page eight. During the fourth quarter, we signed total bookings of $44 million, including a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $37 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years, including a $10 million colocation contribution. These results do not include an additional $18 million of previously disclosed bookings by the Ascenty during the fourth quarter.  Ascenty did not sign any deals during the last 10 days of the year after closing, but this volume of activity, particularly relative the size of the base should give you a good idea of why we are so excited about the growth potential for this platform. Our largest single deal during the fourth quarter was just 6 megawatts, and nearly 40% of our activity was outside of the U.S. Our domestic fourth quarter bookings were likewise diverse, with major contributors from the Bay Area, Houston, Dallas and Chicago markets. For the full year, we delivered total bookings of $268 million an all-time high and up 35% from the previous record of $199 million in the prior year. Colocation and interconnection bookings were flat year-over-year at $63 million, but third and fourth quarter results were both above the recent average. We continue to see the traction with accounts expanding with us globally, including a leading regional cloud provider, who expanded their footprint with us most recently in Singapore in the fourth quarter. We've helped this customer expand globally in the U.S., Europe and in Asia Pacific within the last 12 months. Another example is a global leading SaaS provider that we helped to expand into Japan through our Mitsubishi Corporation Digital Realty joint venture. Digital Realty is assisting this strategic partner in expanding their cloud presence in the region. They are in multiple sites across our global platform and this is their third deployment with us across APAC. One final example, I want to site illustrates our ability to help hyperscale our customers power their digital ambitions. One of the world's largest SaaS companies required a custom built data center. We signed the deal in Q1 and they commenced using the data center in Q4. Simply put, we were able to build and launch the first data haul for the customer within nine months. We're also pleased with our traction in the Enterprise segment. We are landing business from small, medium and large customers, who are positioned to grow with us. We added a total of more than 150 logos in 2018, more than half of which were enterprise customers and we signed a total of 868 contracts in 2018. Aarki rank the 19th fastest growing company in North America and number four in the Bay Area on 2018 Technology Fast 500 helps companies grow and re-engage their mobile users. Aarki is standardizing their global data center footprint with Digital Realty to ensure they have the scalable solutions around the world to meet their fast paced timelines, and support end user demand. Most recent colocation expansions were made across Ashburn and Amsterdam. Dialpad, who designed and developed cloud based platforms for enterprise communications is hosting their AI powered Cloud Phone System in Digital Realty Dallas and New York locations. We help build redundancy within the platform for our customer's end users. Dispatch Track, the number one last mile logistics platform that is currently being used by about 40% of all furniture and appliance deliveries that occur in the Continental United States has a unique requirement of owning its computer infrastructure with specialized hardware for its proprietary algorithms. After quite a bit of research Dispatch Track chose Digital Realty as a partner on this journey. Digital Realty’s world class infrastructure, commitment to standards in terms of certifications and processes presence across wide geographic locations will help Dispatch Track scale their solution and service their current and future customers better. Dispatch track is looking forward to consolidating and scaling all of their existing hosted infrastructure at Digital Realty. We continue to see very healthy networks sector business. This quarter a noble win was without scale a strategic partner of Dassault Systèmes at the forefront of cloud computing.  Out Scale’s primary focus is providing infrastructure services, hosted solutions and on premise private cloud as well as related to cloud based service like mapper as a service, rendering solutions, compute, storage and networking to many of the world's most respected companies. This new and much larger private cage environment for a longtime customer will enable Out Scale to grow and remain focused on their core competencies of providing secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service solutions to over 800 of the world's top corporate customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see traction with our service exchange platform. Net gain, who helps highly regulated industries such as healthcare, financial and legal services manage their IT infrastructure needed to shorten connection provisions in time and minimize latency between net gain facilities.  We provide a centralized colocation facility for their hybrid cloud architecture to connect to local customers. They were able to connect to major telecom providers to maintain 10 millisecond or less latency between facilities leveraging service exchange for fast, secure access to Azure cloud services and provide a high availability environment for customer application hosting. Total alliance and channel partners related bookings continue to contribute to our business. And our channel partners sourced nearly 20% of new logos in 2018 and over 25% of new logos during the fourth quarter. Through our channel partner, we landed a Korean IT based marketing and advertising company with a mission to support bringing Korean lifestyle fashion and entertainment imports in our LA data center to support its digital advertising and cloud business.  They chose Digital Realty because they needed the right location with maximum uptime to support their mission critical infrastructure, flexibility to support their private and hybrid cloud environments, access to data center and cloud connectivity and certification compliance. Our continued partnership and capabilities with IBM around their Direct Link products resulted in more than a 200% year-over-year increase from our total deployments in 2017 and we are working on several opportunities for 2019. Significant 2018 deployments with IBM included adding new IBM block chain and IBM hyper protect deployments allowing IBM customers to deploy their infrastructure and leverage secure, direct low latency access to IBM cloud and these advanced services all within a highly connected ecosystem supported by -- globally by Digital Realty.  Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped down from the all-time high at the end of the third quarter to $97 million as of year-end, due to an all-time high level commencements during the fourth quarter. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements was a little over three months speaking to the diversity of our fourth quarter signings activity. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10, we signed $138 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was five years and cash was rents rolled down 2.6%. For the full year, cash rents rolled up 0.3% a bit better than our slightly negative guidance.  Cash re-leasing spreads were negative for Turnkey as well as colo renewals in the fourth quarter. The colo roll down was entirely due to two top customers who started out in a colo environment early in their life cycle and have grown so significantly that they are both now hyperscaler users. Our unique product offering with the ability to accommodate single rack colocation and interconnection footprint since all the way up to multi megawatt hyperscale requirements enables us to continue to support the full spectrum of data center solutions for both of these strategic customers.  The turnkey roll down was largely due to the expiration in Houston where a customer renewed their existing footprint on a long-term lease, while simultaneously expanding and taking close to another megawatt of additional capacity likewise, on a long-term lease. This transaction is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. As you're probably aware, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will be negative in the high-single digits in 2019, primarily due to size of above market expirations within the legacy DFT portfolio, this roll down was fully baked into our underwriting at the time of the acquisition. As we work away past these pending renewals, we do expect to reach an inflection point and return to positive re-leasing spreads, driven by modest market rent growth and a steady progress. We have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance overall portfolio occupancy slipped 50 basis points to 89% due to a single non-data center customer who moved out of an entire Class B office building they were using as a call center on a campus earmarked for future redevelopment in Dallas. Needless to say, the square footage impact on reporter occupancy is far more pronounced than the economic impact given the low rent for a call center redevelopment candidate in Dallas. Property operating expenses picked up sequentially, primarily due to the timing of some repairs and maintenance projects we had expected to close out earlier in the year, along with the growth of our portfolio with more than 50 megawatts of capacity placed in service during the fourth quarter. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11, the U.S. dollar strengthened somewhat over the past 90 days and FX represented roughly a 50 basis points headwind to the year-over-year growth in our fourth quarter results. We manage currency risk by issuing locally to nominate debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy to matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a 1% impact to our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up approximately 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and the full year. We were a couple of pennies above consensus for the fourth quarter and we came at the at the top end of our original guidance range for the full year. We also deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth for the third time in the past four years. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating the 2019 guidance we rolled a few weeks ago. Almost all the drivers are unchanged except for debt financing. As you may know, just two days after we gave our initial 2019 guidelines the debt capital market seas parted across the pun and we're able to successfully tap the euro bond market for the first evergreen data center euro bond, raising approximately $1 billion of seven year paper at a 2.5% coupon. Our 2019 refinancing the capital spending needs have been put to bed, but we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year. And we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing and attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. Please keep in mind that our 2019 guidance includes a $0.20 impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. We don't typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the hit to the bottom line from the change in accounting policy it's worth noting that we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in AFFO per share. Please also keep in mind, this mid-single digit growth includes the 2% dilution from Ascenty and also absorbs a 100 to 200 basis points FX headwind. Excluding FX and accounting changes, we expect to deliver per share growth in line with our long-term sweet spot in the mid to high-single digits. In terms of the quarterly distribution, the first half of 2019 should represent roughly 49% of the full year results. While the second half should contribute roughly 51%. In terms of the quarterly dividend that payout policy is ultimately a board level decision. Given the actual cash flow growth in 2018, along with the projected growth in 2019, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just so as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. It's been another busy few months for the Digital Realty capital markets team characterized by consistent execution against financing strategy on maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs.  First and foremost in late September, we executed a forwarded equity offering to fund the Ascenty acquisition and development CapEx needs. We expect to receive approximately $1.1 billion of net proceeds when we settle the forward sale agreements. In early October, we issued approximately $520 million of 12 year sterling bonds at a 3.75% coupon. In late October, we recast our $3.3 billion global senior unsecured credit facilities tightening pricing for the line of credit by 10 basis points, extending the maturity date another three years to 2024 and upsizing availability by $350 million. We also completed a roughly $300 million five year revolving credit facility denominated in Japanese yen define our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. Shortly before year end, we closed on the Ascenty acquisition. The transaction was initially funded with $600 million of proceeds from a non-recourse five year secured term loan, $300 million of digital realty OP units and $1 billion of unsecured corporate borrowings. As you may recall, we expect to ultimately own Ascenty in a joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure, which we expect to close some time in the first quarter.  As you can see from the charts on page 13 leverages are artificially inflated at year end, since 100% of Ascenty debt is reflected on the balance sheet. Whereas our fourth quarter results include just a 10 day contribution from Ascenty. Pro forma for a full period contribution from Ascenty, the joint venture with Brookfield and the forward equity offering, leverage remains in line with our long-term target of approximately 5 times, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at north of 4 times. The success of these collective financing activities over the past several months is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As I mentioned a moment ago, we've already addressed our 2019 refinancing and capital spending needs, but we will continue to monitor the global debt capital markets consistent with our strategy of proactively managing the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. As you can see from the pro forma maturity schedule on page 15 the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity to six years, and lowered our weighted average coupon to 3.6%. Nearly half our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a national FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S., roughly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and over 95% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with less than $1 billion of maturities in any year until 2023 and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.  This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Jordan Sadler: Thank you and good afternoon. First, I'd like to see if you guys could drill down a little bit on the expectations of the pipeline as we -- and maybe level set us in terms of expectations for 2019. I know 2018 was a record year. We finished kind of on a dull note. I think a couple weeks ago you sounded a little bit optimistic at a recent conference and I'm just -- how should we be thinking about leasing volumes for 2019?
Andrew Power : Hey thanks Jordan, this is Andy, I’ll tackle that because I think you're referring to my most recent conference. Obviously we ended 2018 with what I would call very respectable quarter $44 million overall signings capping off a record year 35% year-over-year increase, which was a record -- on a record at $268 million. A lot of successes in there across regions be it in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America or markets specific and across product lines. And at the same time I think we entered 2019 with a similar amount of optimism on the overall demand backdrop. Bill, myself, Corey, Chris and the team we’ve been spending a lot of time with customers in just the first handful weeks of the year we hear a lot of positive feedback of what their demand profiles look like and then how we're really lining up in terms of our footprint and capabilities to be their trusted partner around the globe.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And so relative to 2018 you think 2018 was not necessarily an anomaly, sort of what it sounds like.
Andrew Power : I would say listen, we sat this time in the beginning of 2018, I certainly didn’t have the expectation that we're going to do 35% increase year-over-year and put record $268 million. But as we look at exiting 2018 and look at what's out in front of us in 2019 in terms of where we're seeing opportunities and we're overall honestly quite bringing on new inventory capacity such as the Osaka, Japan, Sydney Australia, our Frankfurt Hampshire and the London campuses, numerous colo footprints and then some of the usual names you've heard about North America be it Ashburn or otherwise I think we feel like we're pretty well positioned heading into this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So kind of a related question just about overall hyperscale demand and how it benefits the data center sector. And you talked about having inventory in a lot of the key markets, but I'm wondering from a competitive standpoint how do you think about the mix of business that goes to unlisted players versus listed data center operators such as yourself. And then, maybe drill down on kind of sales given the hiring of Corey into the organization. Any kind of thoughts on channel strategy or any changes whatsoever contemplated in kind of your go to market approach. Thanks. 
William Stein: Hey, thanks, John. I guess, what I would say at least what I have observed is that the private guys win the business when at least Digital doesn’t have inventory in the market. So it’s a question of availability. And I do think that we are the preferred partner to most of the hyperscale players.
Andrew Power : I’d add-on for that for half a second for turning your second question, Jon. I think in addition to what we’re seeing -- hearing from our customers very recently in terms of demand backdrop, I think we’re also hearing a overall outlook of potential vendor consolidation where they want to do business with fewer parties over the long run really global organizations that can scale with them and meet their needs across numerous markets and product offerings, which we think we line up very well on. In terms of changes to go to market and the like, Corey and Greg, just started with us literally the first week of January. We had already pushed up our sales kick-off we had a great kick-off that first week and our team is out of the gates here running hard for 2019. I'm sure Corey, is going to be digging in here and look at the things as ways to improve and obviously has a deep background across colocation interconnection capabilities and really penetrating the enterprise customer base an area where we're always looking to step up our game.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. And then quickly on, there was an interconnect announcement related to Ashburn in Chicago that you put out a couple weeks ago. And wanted to maybe get your thoughts on that overall prospects for cross Connect growth as well as your SDN partnership with Megaport? Thanks.
William Stein: No, absolutely. Thanks for the question John as always. So a couple elements to it. Yeah, the most recent announcement we just made inside of the Ashburn in Chicago markets are around expanding our internet exchange. And so, that was a lot of customer driven demand in those two markets. And because of the fact that, we have a comprehensive interconnection portfolio comprised of both the internet exchange and the service exchange, which meets a lot of our larger customer demands. I would tell you, the reasoning and why we went into Chicago in particular is the ownership of 350 East Cermak and how that building is becoming a bellwether of the broader workloads and interconnection requirements, and then associated Ashburn, that is the epicenter of where a lot of these clouds are building out. And so getting access to all of the networks via the IX was kind of the backdrop of why we were pushed into those markets. And just further solidifying the broader architectures that not only the hyperscalers are bringing to us, but also the enterprise. And so secondly to the partnership with Megaport, which is the underlying fabric on our service exchange. I mean, it's been a great partnership where it's really generated a lot of new revenue for us where it's -- we're having a different value based dialogue with a brand new ecosystem of enterprise customers coming in to consume cloud. And so it's an underpinning of our strategy going forward. And we've had a huge uptick in not only the dialogue, but also utilization of the platform. And so we're very happy with the outcome of that. And again, just to echo the sentiment of Andy and having Corey join the team were just getting focus on leveraging that even further in our dialogue so that we can represent the comprehensive portfolio that we have in these markets and all the inner connection capability that we have is really a unique differentiator for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Simon Flannery: Right. Thank you very much. Good evening. I think you referenced the opportunity to go into some new markets. Could you -- you've obviously been expanding a lot in some existing markets, particularly in Asia as well recently. Can you just talk about how we should think about that in 2019, and are you likely to do that organically developing new land or do you think M&A will be the path to get to get into those markets? And any updates on a few weeks of Ascenty under your belt any learnings that you've had since they've come onboard? Thanks.
William Stein: Thanks, Simon. So I think as you know, we don't target slices of the geographic pie by region. We look to allocate capital where we see the best risk adjusted returns. We're always looking at potential markets and we want to be prepared if there are good opportunities, but our criteria just remind you is that we're customer led into major new markets and we're looking for appropriate risk adjusted returns in these new markets. I'll turn it over to Andy to handle the Ascenty question.
Andrew Power : Simon, could you just repeat the Ascenty question, make sure I didn’t miss it?
Simon Flannery: Yes, you talked about the bookings, when you came on board, but just you’ve had it for six or seven weeks just how is the integration going and any more color that you've had on the opportunity since you've taken control.
Andrew Power : Great, thank you, Simon. So we closed I think the last week before the holidays, the 21st of December. We've had our first board meeting with the team, we've -- Brookfield has cleared it's our regulatory approvals and we're working towards finalizing their closing, which should happen in the next month or so.  We've been out in front of customers on a joint basis and have had some really terrific feedback from existing customers of legacy Digital Realty, legacy Ascenty and crossover, we've really gotten going on the rules of engagement for the Digital Realty 100 plus sales reps. In terms of feeding demand into that region, and we're also doing some late work on the supply chain design, constructional operational capabilities to really try to bring that benefit to the Ascenty platform. Albeit it's been a fast and furious couple weeks under our ownership to-date, but so far so good and seeing some positive signs, but obviously have a lot more to report on this topic in another 90 days or so. 
Simon Flannery: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. 
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you. In your comments, prepared remarks you mentioned the renewal spreads, how they're going to be down in the high-single digits. This you should be the trough and I think you said you expect them to go back to positive in 2020 and beyond. Just tied up the pricing is it your sense that pricing is going to start to trough I mean pricing, if you look at it on a like-for-like basis seems like it's been coming down for the last few years. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you think we are because as I did notice, for example, in your returns, you're now getting to 9% to 12%, whereas you've historically guided to 10% to 12%. And then secondly, as it relates to bookings or leasing for 2019, I appreciate you don't want to give us a hard commitment on what that number could look like. But when you think about it from a geographical dispersion perspective, is it fair to assume that we should see a notable percentage coming from international in 2019 than in 2018? Thank you.
Andrew Power : Thanks, Colby. Let me see if I can dissect the multi-pronged of that mixture tackle at all. So a couple concepts. So first on renewal spreads, we've -- we exited the year on a full year basis cash positive just slightly and a couple points of higher than on a GAAP basis. We called out some anomalies in the actual note that happened in the fourth quarter, but happy to expand upon those specific details. But cash positive for the full year and even greater that a gap positive we did call on our 2019 guidance released at the beginning of the year a cash negative mark-to-market really related primarily due to a large legacy customer we inherited in our acquisition of DFT. The outcome or underwriting of that event has not changed since our closing or initial acquisition. So same facts and circumstances just that timing looks like it's going to be coming fruition certainly in 2019. And beyond that plus I'd say another larger Power Base Building or PBB renewal that likely to get completed in the first quarter of 2019. We feel that we're kind of really working our way through the bulk of the larger customer bulk renewals including early renewals pushing out their maturities for 5, 7, 10 and 15 years. When you look at the next kind of top customers that have several of renewals in those customers have, I'd say a different, different either vintage of lease, one of those customers in fact typically only sign five year leases. So has not had a 10, 15 year run of bumps in their leases and much less chance to be way out of market. Hence our commentary, where we think the sensitive pickers moving to the pipe on here, when it comes to the expirations this year. Dovetailing to your overall -- that was renewal, so cash, upon cash upon expiration dovetailing to your question on pricing overall. If you look at our scale pricing, which I think is really more tied to that renewal comment. If we went market-by-market this quarter, I would say our scale pricing was really kind of flat to slightly up. Now, partly that is due to the overall mix in diversity of business. In North America, we were less concentrated with larger deals specifically in Ashburn and had more numerous wins in San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, and Chicago. But when you look apples to apples of signing in those same markets, and is close in terms of size. Those rates actually look flat to suddenly up. I think, I said in a earlier conference this year looking at Ashburn, for our third quarter signing where we did a lot of larger deals, our rates versus the prior 12 months were within like 100 basis points. So definitely speaking to a crescendo on the rates. Now, I'm not saying that there isn't a competitor that's going to throw in a low price out there, just to win a business. But I think we bring a lot to the table as Bill, mentioned with our global platform that’s multi-product our installed and growing customer base that wants to expand with adjacency, longest runway for a growth in a competitive market like Ashburn and other things agile to supply chain and counterparty risk as well.  I think last but not least, you really are touching on development returns and also bookings compositions. I think if you look at our development cycle what you're seeing are two things. There's a concentration of our current products in the development project pipeline are larger deals 20, 25 megawatt deals, 10 to 15 year lease terms, AAA minus rated credit counter parties, triple net leases. Hence they're pushing those North America returns down closer to the nines. And then outside the U.S., which is becoming a much larger share of our new growth be it on that table you’ll see it in Singapore, but also Osaka and the same thing over in Europe. The returns are a little lower, but you're also seeing those returns in an interest rate environment in those countries that is much, much lower than the U.S. And you could see that in the fact that we did seven year euro bonds two weeks ago at a 2.5% coupon. I think, I kind of hit them all there for you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks. So maybe just want to focus again on Northern Virginia. There is a lot of capital coming into the major markets especially Northern Virginia, which is shaping a lot of the development. But what are your thoughts on the private companies making these major investments for plan data center space? And how that impacts the overall industry and general fears of potential oversupply?
William Stein: Thanks, Erik. We've commented on this before. While there is a tremendous amount of supply obviously in Northern Virginia, there's an equal amount of demand, so absorption has been very strong. As I said earlier and Andy mentioned this too, if the hyperscale players have to choose between a private provider with whom they've done little to no business and Digital with whom they've done a substantial amount of business and they are also keen to bring their product to market as quickly as possible at least it’s been our experience that they would prefer to do business with the provider that offers the shortest cycle for providing a product. So that has to do with both contract and reliable construction deliveries and knowing that the building is going to operate as expected.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. And just maybe my follow up, kind of efficiencies in the past you talked about efficiencies in the various ways to control, bill cost to manage returns. But how much of those efficiencies can you still pull from? And are we coming towards the end where you may start to see some headwind because you don't have those same levers to pull. Thank you.
William Stein: So I think our team has done an excellent job of bringing out the cost from data centers design. But I think you note correctly that we're approaching a level where it's going to be difficult to take out more costs without impacting residual value. I think we're fortunate and that we've established that our VMI or vendor managed inventory and program in place with most of our major suppliers. And what that means is we have three year contracts in place that lock in pricing for critical equipment like generators switch gear, UPS modules. And so, we haven't been affected by rising steel prices because of those programs. It's also I think important for you to keep in mind that we are still the only data center REIT with investment grade ratings from all the major rating agencies and that gives us a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. And finally, we've been able to derisk labor inflation by keeping our contractors on site. So to sum up we have the benefits of buying in bulk across a global sales funnel. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. 
Michael Rollins : Hi. Two questions if I could. First, I noticed that you took out the goal for asset monetization relative to prior guidance tables. And I was wondering if you could size the potential for asset monetization and optimization of the portfolio and what kind of market is out there for the assets that would be up for consideration? And then just switching gears as you look at the hyperscale deployment that you've accommodated over the last couple of years, is there a way to quantify any magnetic effect those deployments are having to also get to additional enterprise bookings in a similar or nearby campus that either wanted to be close to the cloud or employ a hybrid cloud architecture? Thanks.
Andrew Power : Hey. Thanks, Michael. I'll tackle the first question then I'll pass it over to Chris on the second one. So asset monetization still is really very much part of our DNA here. It's in our heritage, and I think you could see that by the fact that even on the portfolio optimization and capital recycling track for some time, I think we sold about $800 plus million of assets outright in the last handful of years. I'm pretty sure that's more than any other data center provider out there. And also we are big fans of having our fishing pool in all the different pools of capital, both public and private. And that includes outright or joint venture ownership. And we've deployed joint venture ownership across multiple formats. So I would say we look through our portfolio and try to find areas where we want to focus and defocus and also opportunities to further optimize our capital structure through the use of private capital. I think, you could expect us to continue to focus our investment in the major markets where we see additional runway for growth the Ashburn’s and Santa Clara type markets or Dallas and Chicago’s, in North America, the Frankfurt's, London's, Dublin's, Amsterdam's in Europe and Osaka, Tokyo, Singapore and Sydney in Australia and Asia. And I think we'll see less of a focus on some of those other markets in terms of where we put further dollars or continue to invest. And with -- I'd say now over 200 data centers almost entirely unencumbered, the majority of which own fee simple. I think we've got a credible amount of flexibility to optimize our portfolio efficiently track various forms of capital and to recycle capital when we find it appropriate. Chris, do you want to hit the hyperscale and overall echo system question?
Chris Sharp: Yes, thanks Andy. Appreciate the question, Michael. So there's a couple elements to that. So it is somewhat hard to quantify. But still a lot of the industry research and papers out there are still indicating the fact that the enterprise 80 plus percent of that enterprises looking to achieve that hybrid multi cloud.  So one of the things we've often looked at, and we constantly track is not only the amount of uptake on the service exchange, which allows private connectivity to all of the major cloud providers on a very open platform, which we’ve referenced in the past and at a couple of conferences where you have access to 109 cloud on ramps associated with that platform, which is very, demonstrably and allowing customers to efficiently achieve the hybrid connectivity or access to these hyperscale services. And then I'd say the other key indicator that we've been watching a lot is the proximity, right? And so allowing enterprises to deploy chasing point in Ashburn where you could be immersed in the largest cloud epicenter in the world is a major differentiator, which is why you see a lot of the construction and the build in the amount of infrastructure pipeline that we have in that market. Because it's just a key indicator of the amount of uptick that we have associated with that. I don't have any specific metrics on how to quantify the attach rate to that at this point in time, but that's something that we constantly track and are really putting in a very tight model to our sales team to ensure that they're having that dialogue with the enterprise customers that they know which clouds they're betting their business on.  And how easily and efficiently consume them either via the service exchange, which is private connectivity or which is unique to our connected campus. The proximity of being deployed right next door to it, which Andy had referenced in the script earlier with IBM, which is a very unique model where customers can be right next door to the actual cloud services they're consuming. So we see a lot of that uptick coming to the market and we see no ending sight for a lot of that hybrid multi-cloud architectures. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Guttman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. 
Robert Guttman: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about the state of power availability in Northern Virginia and whether or not that is any constraint on market growth there? And secondly, last year's the full year’s leasing in North America was largely focused in Northern Virginia. I was wondering if when you're looking at the sales pipeline how does -- how did the rest of the markets look in U.S. versus a similar comparison the same time last year in terms of pipeline.
William Stein: Thanks, Robert. I'll jump on the first question and I think Andy will pick up the second piece. But, as far as power availability in Northern Virginia one of the things that we often really start to look at is how we master plan the multiple campuses that we've built out there. And one of the key elements of that master plan is working with the local power providers and early on establishing a demand profile associated with not only what we have today, but where we're headed. And a part of that is investing and ensuring that we get the proper substations built inside of the market, which is very unique to digital and from our long heritage in building out these campuses to ensure that we don't run out of any power. So not only with the campuses that we have populated today, but the future expansion campuses we're already in deep dialogue with a lot of local utility providers to ensure that we have proper access and redundant access in these core markets even outside of Northern Virginia. So we see nothing impacting our ability to meet our customer demand with the master plan facilities that we have today and also the future expansion that we have in that market. And I'll hand it over to Andy for the second part. 
Andrew Power : Thanks, Rob. So I mean if you look back at the fourth quarter or -- and a little bit of 2018 in terms of North America composition, fourth quarter was really not about Ashburn at all for us it was much more diverse. So we had north of a megawatt size in the San Francisco property area, we had signings in Houston close to a megawatt, Dallas, also in Chicago. And if I also go back a handful of quarters, I can certainly recall other major signing in the Chicago market as well as on the Dallas campus. Now those signings obviously get a little bit round out when you do a 25 megawatt deal in any given quarter. But it wasn't solely isolated to Ashburn or Northern Virginia. When I turn to looking at North America for 2019, I do think you'll still see a consistent demand for that Ashburn, Virginia robust demand market. But I think the conversations at Digital range a little more broadly all the way up into our newest delivery Toronto campus also out to some Santa Clara discussions. I know there has been some activity growing on our Richardson campus in Dallas. And then a market that's been a little bit of a sleeper going back a year or two is the New York City metro or northern New Jersey market where we've seen a pickup in financial services related demand on a few locations in that market. So definitely seeing the demand spread out a little bit to more pockets within North America portfolio in 2019 it feels like that it did in prior years.  And going back, I apologize, I think I skipped one of Colby’s questions ask about outlook for 2019 international versus non-international. Obviously we have the Ascenty portfolio, which is going to be go from count zero towards our $268 million record signings in 2018 and be a part of the picture in 2019. But putting that aside and really comparing apples to apples when I look at the inventory backdrop be it our campuses in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London. Some of the enterprise customer demand we're seeing in Dublin are new announcements, which we had in Sydney, Australia in terms of new deliveries and also in Osaka, Japan. I think what -- in the last year or two it was probably more of a 75% to 80% signings in North America and remainder outside of the U.S. or North America. I think you could see that complexion should become much more global. And I can tell you that was a major theme as we kicked off the year from a strategy to really kind of speak selling to our strengths of the global multi-product platform.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein, for any closing remarks.
William Stein: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our 2018 highlights, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers delivering record bookings of $268 million, a 35% increase from the previous all-time high the prior year. We further expanded our global platform with our entry into Latin America. And we further extended our sustainability leadership with the addition of 90 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. We delivered 8% growth in FFO per share at the top end of our original guidance, and we delivered double-digit growth in AFFO per share setting the stage for continued growth in our dividend. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1.1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth, refinancing our $3.3 billion credit facilities and issuing over $1 billion of long-term investment grade corporate bonds at very attractive coupons. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in March.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to Digital Realty's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Due to scheduling constraints, this call will be concluded after 60 minutes. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call will be CEO Bill Stein and CFO Andy Power. Chief Technology Officer Chris Sharp is also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. First, we followed up our record bookings in the prior quarter with our second highest and our backlog reached another high watermark. Next, we announced our entry into Latin America. Third, we beat consensus by a $0.01 and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share for the third time in the past four years. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet extending our weighted average debt maturity by a full year with the issuance of $520 million of 12-year paper at 3.75% and the refinancing of our $3.3 billion credit facilities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had a very productive third quarter with consistent execution against our strategic plan. Let's turn to page 2 of our presentation. The highlight of the quarter was the announcement of our entry into Latin America with a definitive agreement to acquire Ascenty for $1.8 billion. Ascenty is the leading data center platform in a rapidly growing market. It's best-in-class management team and proprietary fiber network have made it the partner of choice for the leading global cloud providers, and as a result, it has the largest market share. Ascenty's portfolio is comprised of eight in-service, purpose-built, world-class data centers and another six data centers currently under construction, totaling 106 megawatts of planned capacity. The in-service portfolio was approximately 97% leased as of September 30. While the data centers under construction were approximately 83% pre-leased. Since our announcement, the Ascenty management team has continued to execute generating additional fiber revenue and leasing another 3.6 megawatts in October to two leading global cloud providers, bringing their year-to-date leasing tally to approximately 30 megawatts. Given its high quality portfolio, Ascenty serves a blue chip customer base of 140 logos, including the leading global hyperscale cloud providers. In fact, investment grade or equivalent clients account for over 90% of revenue. In addition more than 75% of Ascenty's contractual cash rent is denominated in U.S. dollars substantially mitigating foreign currency exposure. I might add here that the real has appreciated by 10% since we announced the acquisition just over a month ago. This transaction immediately establishes Digital Realty as a leading data center provider in Latin America. Ascenty enjoys approximately 30% market share in Brazil far outstripping its competitors. We believe we can further accelerate the company's success, capture additional market share and expand our total addressable market by leveraging digital realties global platform. In fact we've received a number of inbound calls from existing customers inquiring about data center capacity in Brazil since our announcement in late September. The transaction also presents significant growth potential in a key emerging market. Brazil has the eighth largest economy in the world and it's the fifth most populous country, but less than 60% of the population currently has internet access. As this relatively young market continues to come online and as consumers, local enterprise customers and global IT service providers begin to expand their presence in Latin America, we see significant opportunities to ride this next wave of growth. Finally we've structured the transaction to benefit from two sets of partners with local market expertise and a strong track record of execution. We are pleased to be partnering with Brookfield, a leading global asset manager with a well-established track record of investments in Brazil, across infrastructure, renewable power, real estate and private equity. Brookfield has committed to initially invest $613 million in exchange for a 49% equity interest in a joint venture expected to ultimately own Ascenty. Brookfield has been investing in Brazil for over 100 years, and is now one of the largest investors in the country with over $40 billion of assets under management. The partnership with Brookfield provides unparalleled access, experience and resources within the market to help us grow and rollout our strategy. In addition Ascenty's management team led by CEO, Chris Torto is staying with the company. Management is rolling forward the substantial majority of its equity into Digital Realty OP units subject to a three year lockup as well as a 2% stake in the joint venture with Brookfield. This transaction is prudently financed. We raised common equity to fund our equity contribution the same day that we announced the acquisition, consistent with our historical practice, in addition to the equity contributions from Brookfield and the Ascenty management. We've also lined up non-recourse debt financing. Partly due to the conservative capital structure, the transaction is expected to be approximately 2% dilutive in 2019, and 1% dilutive in 2020. However, we expect it to be accretive over the longer term and significantly accretive to Digital Realty's long-term growth profile. Last but not least, the Ascenty acquisition is highly strategic. The portfolio is comprised of great assets along with a critical fiber network run by a top notch management team, all in a tough market to crack with significant verified customer demand. We spend a lot of time assessing global markets and we see precious few opportunities around the world with such a compelling growth trajectory. At the same time that we announced Ascenty, we also announced the pending acquisition of 424 acres of land next to Dulles International Airport for $237 million or a little less than $560,000 per acre. This is the parcel highlighted in Royal Blue at the bottom of the map here on page 3. The land purchase is consistent with our stated objective of securing our supply chain and our cost basis compares very favorably to recent comps of over $1 million per acre demonstrating how our global scale, balance sheet capacity and real estate heritage have further enhanced our ability to support our customers growth in the most important data center market in the world. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction crews remain active in the primary data center metros across North America, including Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world and through which over 70% of the world's Internet traffic passes each day. Despite the number of competitors and shovels in the ground, on current form, we see demand continuing to outstrip supply. Northern Virginia is also Digital Realty's largest concentration and we own over 375 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in our existing portfolio along with 74 megawatts currently under construction that are 89% pre-leased. Upon closing, this most recent land purchase, we will own 667 acres of strategic landholdings that will support the build out of over 1,000 megawatts of future capacity. In Europe, supply and demand dynamics are similarly healthy. Global cloud providers continue to drive robust demand in the region and multiple cloud providers have come to market for new deployments across the core metros. Enterprise demand has also begun to pick up particularly in London and Dublin. Pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options along with differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence. Market vacancy remains in check across the major European markets. While competitors are bringing new supply to market it is being met by healthy demand particularly from existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth. Across the Asia-Pacific region, demand remains robust with pockets of demand popping up in new markets along with steady demand for core markets. Supply remains largely in check, and the complexity of local regulatory frameworks, vendor pools and even language barriers serve to limit the number of pan-regional competitors. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as a key differentiator in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. Global economic expansion remains intact. Although, we are mindful of the risk of a global trade war which does have the potential to disrupt the broad-based current economic growth. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. Given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We had a very strong quarter with balanced performance across regions, product types and customer segments. The continued demand underscores the values customers see in Digital Realty. We provide the trusted foundation, powering our customers' digital ambitions. Customers choose us for many reasons. We offer them resiliency they can trust. We have secure, compliant and reliable data center solutions, including those powered by renewable energy. Our global footprint of interconnected scale data centers and hyperconnected hubs offers a broad range of solutions when and where our customers need them. And finally, our solutions help customers manage their strategic, financial, operational, and reputational risk. During the third quarter, we signed total bookings of $69 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $62 million, with a weighted average lease term of 10 years, including a $10 million colocation contribution. The total bookings number was our second best quarter ever, close on the heels of our $94 million all-time high in the prior quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $224 million compared to $198 million for the full year in 2017. The $18 million combined colocation and interconnection contribution was likewise the second highest on record. We are seeing solid traction with our Service Exchange platform, powered by our unique partnership with Megaport. This traction is partly due to the continued expansion of our key cloud destinations to include Salesforce, the largest SaaS provider, and top destination requests from many of our enterprise customers. Recent customer testimonials include a global voice solutions and service provider, who reported, "We now have 10 times the bandwidth with painless provisioning to different cloud services." While a company using Digital Realty to accelerate their AI strategy stated and I quote, "Having Service Exchange not only lowers the cost of our bandwidth by 80%, it also makes setting up virtual environments much easier." As these testimonials suggest, hybrid multi-cloud is the most sought after and efficient architecture for the overwhelming majority of enterprise customers. And our Service Exchange provides them simple, secure access to the most valuable ecosystems around the world. During the third quarter, our largest transaction was a 20-plus megawatt win with a global hyperscale cloud provider that selected us due to our repeatable contractual framework, attention to detail throughout the pursuit, and our ability to accommodate their future growth. This is hyperscale, the ability to meet current demand and to provide highly sophisticated customers the ability to efficiently land and expand. While the majority of our new business was with existing customers, we added 48 new logos during the quarter. In addition, through our alliance partner sales engagement, we added eight of our partners' new end user customers to our ecosystem. Our Enterprise segment delivered a notably strong contribution this quarter. Key wins included a global investment bank that's leveraging Digital Reality's network density for five new colocation deployments that will be used to upgrade their current global wide-area network. We will be providing one of the world's oldest stock exchanges with highly redundant dual meet-me-room connectivity to their Ashburn Data Center deployment. A not-for-profit oceanography foundation chose Digital Realty for its colocation environment that will be used to store, analyze, and distribute data in real time. Within our Network segment, key third quarter wins included: an edge expansion in San Francisco and New York metro areas for a leading open digital media platform provider; a backbone expansion in New York and L.A. for a leading national provider of communications services to businesses; and new backbone interconnection deployments in Dallas and Atlanta for a leader in content delivery, load balancing, and video and streaming services. Turning to our backlog on page 8, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached another all-time high of $148 million. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements was five months, a bit below the long-term average. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we signed $61 million of renewals during the third quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was 4.2 years, and cash rents on renewals rolled up 0.2%, driven by healthy cash releasing spreads on colocation and power-based building renewals. Turnkey releasing spreads were slightly negative during the third quarter, largely due to a single enterprise customer who renewed their existing footprint in our Franklin Park connected campus in Chicago while simultaneously expanding their presence in Franklin Park and establishing a sizable new presence on our Elk Grove Village campus, also in Chicago. This transaction is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And then whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. This particular transaction was a legacy Digital Realty renewal and was not one of the above-market leases within the former DFT properties we've called out previously. We do still expect these leases to roll down. And as a result, the mix of renewal activity in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked up 10 basis points to 89.5%, due primarily to positive absorption in London, Chicago, and Dallas. Turning to economic risk mitigation strategies on page 10, the U.S. dollar strengthened somewhat over the past 90 days, and FX represented roughly a 30 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our third quarter results. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 1% impact to full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 8% year-over-year and came in a $0.01 above consensus. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating 2018 core FFO per share guidance. Most of the drivers are unchanged except that we have now closed substantially all the asset sales contemplated in our plan. We have raised our expected development spend to reflect the recent land acquisitions and we may revisit the bond market later this year. As you update your earnings models and begin to roll forward 2019, please keep in mind that we expect to adopt the new lease accounting standard on January 1 of next year. From a lessee accounting perspective, those situations where Digital Realty is the tenant, such as for corporate office space and for data centers we operate subject to a leasehold, the primary impact is that we will be required to recognize a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on our balance sheet. We do not expect this to have an outsized impact on us given that we own substantially all of our real estate. And we expect to gross up the balance sheet somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 million to $800 million. From a lessor accounting perspective, where Digital Realty is the landlord, the primary impact is the indirect leasing compensation costs will no longer be capitalized and will be expensed going forward. If we had adopted the new lease accounting standard on January 1 of this year, we estimate it would have lowered 2018 core FFO per share by $0.15 to $0.20, which should give you a good baseline as you begin to frame the impact on our 2019 estimates. The irony is while these accounting changes will be dilutive to our reported earnings, they'll actually be accretive to the returns on our development projects since cost that were previously capitalized to our basis in that development project will now run through the P&L going forward. At the end of the day, there is no change to the underlying economics or to our cash flows. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 11. Over the past several months, the digital team has consistently executed on our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options, while minimizing the related cost. In mid-June, we raised $650 million of 10-year U.S. dollar bonds at a 4.45% coupon. In late August, our in-house team originated a $48 million 10-year secured CMBS mortgage loan at 4.3% for our joint venture property in Seattle; and in early September, we originated a $212 million five-year secured CMBS mortgage loan at 4.6% for our joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors. In late September, we executed a forward equity offering to fund the Ascenty acquisition and development CapEx needs, and we expect to receive approximately $1.1 billion of net proceeds when we settle the forward sale agreements. We also raised a $725 million private capital commitment from Brookfield, a leading global asset manager. In early October, we opportunistically accessed the sterling bond market raising $520 million of 12-year paper at a 3.75% coupon. And finally earlier this afternoon we announced the refinancing of our $3.3 billion global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing for the line of credit by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by three years and upsize the availability by $350 million. In the process, we also completed a roughly $300 million five-year revolving credit facility denominated in Japanese yen to fund our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. The global credit facilities were well oversubscribed and we would like to thank our entire bank group for their support. The success of these collective financing activities over the past several months is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers, and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As I mentioned a moment ago, we may revisit the Euro bond market later this year consistent with our strategy of actively managing the right side of our balance sheet, with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. As you can see from the pro forma maturity schedule on page 12, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity to six years, and our weighted average coupon is 3.6%. Net debt to EBITDA remained in line at 5.2 times as of the end of the third quarter and fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.1 times. Roughly 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly 100% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 12, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: My pleasure, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Funk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question tonight. One quick one to begin. So, earlier today there was some commentary on pricing trends in Northern Virginia and the impact that the negative pricing from that perspective is having on project yields. So hoping that you as a dominant operator in that market, maybe add your perspective and the expected returns that you're seeing in that marketplace?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Look I'm not going to speak for the returns that our competitors are earning, but our experience over the last couple quarters is that rents have been flat. And that includes some 20 plus megawatt deals that we've done in each of the last two quarters. I mean just something to keep in mind, we hear a lot about demand in other parts of the world particularly Europe, but year-to-date absorption in Northern Virginia is more than two times the absorption in the rest of Europe combined. So look I mean global scale really matters. It's part of our differentiated product offering, and we can and do provide the opportunities for our customers around the world. But I think the ability to satisfy their needs to both land and expand in Northern Virginia currently on both of our campuses the legacy DuPont campus and the new Digital campus we're building out is absolutely critical. And the Dulles land that we just acquired is a clear reflection of our real estate heritage, our DNA and we view that as a critical piece of our supply chain going forward and our ability to continue to support our customer base. So, I mean, the bottom line is Northern Virginia is a competitive market. But the current market dynamics we believe play to our strengths and enable us to achieve very attractive risk adjusted returns.
Michael J. Funk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I'm going to just follow with one more quick one. I know, you've maintained the guidance for a slight pressure on the rental rates and renewals for the full year and I heard your commentary about still cycling through some of the larger DFT deals, but thinking about fourth quarter and what we've seen year-to-date there, it seems to imply that you're expecting maybe to put at least one of those deals behind you in the fourth quarter, is that the correct read? And what kind of visibility do you have on those larger renewals from the legacy DFT?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. It's – this is Andy. I would say, listen, the timing of when any particular renewal gets done and over the finish line is always tricky to map to a quarter because the – our customers obviously don't necessarily march to that same cadence. Based on I'd say some advanced dialogue we've had with few of our larger customers that have a handful of renewals coming up in the next several quarters and years, I think our estimation is that we may get a few of the larger ones done in the fourth quarter hence we have a little bit of more cautious view to the mark-to-market, which has been year-to-date positive 2.5% on cash basis and I think close to 5.5% or so on a GAAP basis, hence the slightly negative on our full-year guidance table.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to just touch base on something of a little bit of a disconnect, obviously fundamentals, leasing, very robust. The equity markets not so much as it relates to data centers or at least it doesn't appear to be fully reflecting the success you guys have had this year in your stock price. So, I'm curious how do you tweak the capital allocation model for a rising interest rate environment given the capital intense business model like yours?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, Jordan, I think there are a couple of things. First of all, we continue to work to drive down our build costs. We've been quite successful with that. But basically, the bigger the building the more you can build, the lower you can drive your per unit costs. And for example in Northern Virginia, are building out which is you know almost 100 megawatts, it's 96 megawatts. That's up and it's basically leased, it is leased. And we've built that in less than a year. And so it clearly allows you to drive your unit cost down. The other part of that and somewhat related is our vendor management initiative, which – through which we lock in our vendors on three-year deals with fixed price contracts and that too particularly if there's some inflationary pressure, you know, it helps us keep our costs in line. Because of our scale we're able to buy both equipment and power in significant bulk. And similarly with land and we bought over 400 acres of land there next to Dulles Airport at I'd say less than half the market cost per acre. And I'd say the final piece of this in terms of how to function in a rising rate environment as it relates to the balance sheet and it's just – I'd say it's basic real estate fundamentals where you extend your debt. We just did a 12-year sterling deal, you fix your rates and you make sure you have plenty of liquidity and we just announced the refinancing of our revolver, booking upsize and reduced pricing. So I guess, what I'd say is as competition intensifies it's important that we continue to exploit our competitive advantages.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: That's fair. Just as a follow-up you took down and you mentioned the incremental land here in Northern Virginia in the quarter anywhere else where you see the need to backfill inventory in terms of land in a significant way?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, no, absolutely. So, and I think, we announced Sydney in this earnings release; we're looking at a couple of other markets in Asia, as well as Europe where we're going to be adding land. I think we're in pretty good shape in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Yeah, thank you. So couple of questions on international. So in Brazil, the sizes of those deployments are, they seemed a bit modest given the size of the opportunity and essentially leadership position in that market. And so I'm wondering when do you anticipate that the deal sizes might get larger in Brazil as they have directionally in Australia, Europe and U.S.? And then elsewhere in the region, I'm curious about just any updated thoughts on Mexico and (35:24) and other assets around there and how that might fit into your strategy. And then finally, if you could update us on the Japan joint venture and where things stand there? Thank you.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jon, this is Andy. I'll tackle the second – excuse me, I'll tackle the first of, I think, three in here, and I'll toss it to Bill, and he can toss it back to me if he likes. So first on the deal sizes, as we mentioned, a bit of a bring down since we announced the Ascenty transaction we signed, an incremental – or I shouldn't say we signed, the Ascenty team has signed an incremental 3.6 megawatts to two different customers, which speaks to your point that these are top cloud, global cloud service providers buying in the, call it, less than 3.6 megawatts a turn sizing, and that's consistent with their track record for certainly the last 12 months. I think that is very much comparable to their stages of growth for those similar customer profiles here in North America or Europe or Asia, for that matter, going several years back, and we're aware of the fact that the Ascenty team has been in dialogue with several of those customers in taking on certainly larger takes. So we expect, similar to migrations, in terms of size of capacity that the deal sizes will grow. We're quite pleased that the Ascenty platform and team has landed the initial cloud on ramp and compute nodes, and our hit track record is where these customers typically land is where they expand. So we're quite optimistic on that. Maybe I'll hand it over to Bill to talk about Mexico and the other markets, Jonathan Atkin.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jon, relative to other markets in Latin America, entry there will very much be driven in response to customer demand. We are in close dialogue with almost all of our top cloud customers, as you might imagine. And the extent to which we enter new markets will be driven by what we hear from them. So we're not going to embark upon a build it and they will come strategy as it relates to new markets. It will be very much driven by specific orders, if you will, from key customers. I think it's suffice to say though, there's a high likelihood that we'd enter at least one new market within the next 12 months down there based on what we're hearing.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then lastly, Jonathan, I think you had asked about also an update on our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation Japan. I would say things are going very well on that front. Last quarter we announced a strategic win with a top cloud service provider into the Tokyo asset. The capacity is coming online also in Osaka. I think subsequent to quarter end, we'll announce a new win with a top five cloud service provider on that new campus, and then we have a pretty long runway of growth on that campus and I have seen a substantial amount of customer inquiry. And I'd probably add Tokyo back to the list of locations where we'll be looking to continue to procure additional WAN capacity.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you, two if I may. First off on Ascenty, that deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. So I was hoping, Andy, you can remind us just how we should be thinking about landing that into our models to get to that 2% dilution, including the equity raise, which was a forward deal. How should we assume that that actually starts to flow into the actual income statement? And then as it relates to expansion, just piling on the last question, I think the market that Ascenty's talked about potentially going into is Chile. So I assume that that's the market within the next 12 months that you just referenced, but I just wanted to confirm that. And then also just wondering what your interest is in markets like Africa as well as others such as India and so forth. Thank you.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Colby. So you're correct, closing in the fourth quarter, our estimated timing is probably call it late November-ish. And obviously in conjunction with that we'll close on a portion of the equity offering to fund our share into that venture. We've obviously not given out 2019 guidance just yet given we're standing on the third quarter earnings call, and we'll be happy to give you components of the model for 2019 guidance when the full company guidance comes out. I think the best that I can give you is about 2% dilution in 2019, ultimately then becoming accretive by 2021, a good chunk of that dilution due to the fact that we are mitigating risk through a non-recourse secured debt financing that carries an interest rate double the Digital Realty interest rate. So forgoing that near-term FFO, and this is really a risk mitigating strategy, and we obviously have the financing components, be it the cost of debt and the amount of shares, so I bet you could back into the amount of EBITDA using the three numbers. Maybe I'll toss it back to Bill for thoughts on some of these other international markets.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, Colby, I gather you're looking for confirmation on whether or not Chile is the next entry point down there. Just keep in mind that when we enter a new market, we have a very rigorous process we go through here looking at the political risk, economic risk, currency risk, and everything that you expect. And at the end of the day, it goes to our board for approval. So I don't want to jump ahead of our board with respect to which new market we could enter next or the next one after that. Relative to Africa, I know you're referring to a specific opportunity there that's in the market, and you can assume that we see everything just because of our size and our history. Again, whether or not we act is really a function of a lot of factors, and that includes how comfortable we are with the risk factors associated with that market and the opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Thanks very much. Good evening. Bill, you talked a lot about the pipeline last quarter. Can you just update us in the various regions how the pipeline looks today, and then any changes in the cost of construction or other inflationary pressures given what we're seeing in the broader economy? Thanks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We actually have Chris Sharp here in the room, who runs design. And he might be able to speak to construction, given an opportunity to speak, and then we'll turn it over to Andy to talk about the pipeline.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. So just before we get to fourth quarter, maybe to recap on third quarter, we had a second best in the company's history $69 million total bookings. I would say it was robust and diverse, which is a great thing. We had a market step up in our colo and connectivity signings on a global basis, which included a few multi-market signings, really leveraging the power of the platform. We had a step up in North America colo, and interconnection by itself as well as EMEA and broad-based regional demand with key wins in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America, not only the dominant Ashburn market, but also in Chicago and Dallas, which was great to see. Turning to the back half of the year, the last quarter of the year and on to 2019, I think we're seeing a continuation of similar trends on the global accounts. We see the same customers where we've had success in the past continue to build out their footprints where they've previously landed with Digital Realty, and at the same time in active dialogue on some new market locations. Within the enterprise and network sector, this whole past quarter we had 48 new logos, call it 20%-plus step up from prior quarters, just a smidge below prior peaks on new logos, plus another eight new logos we landed through some of our P&A channels. So I think we're charting towards another strong colo interconnect quarter as well across the board driven by some pickup in the enterprise demand, as well as some new names within our network vertical. We're actually aligning some of the legacy network providers and some newer fiber and other over-the-top network providers. Chris, do you want to tackle the construction piece?
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Absolutely, thank you, Andy. So, Simon, great question and it was alluded to earlier by Bill with the fact that we have an industry-leading global supply chain and a part of that is a key element is the VMI program, Bill had walked through. But that VMI program is definitely something that's allowed us to really maintain a relatively the same cost in the same delivery timelines that we have for the last couple of quarters. I'm also trying to emphasize the fact that with the way that we've been building in larger chunks and being able to establish a longer term relationship with a lot of the local construction teams and keeping them on jobs for a longer period of time, have been able to also alleviate any kind of spikes or mishaps in any of the construction projects that we have coming online in the market today. But I'd also emphasize the fact that this is something that Digital has been doing for some time now and we have alluded to the real estate heritage of Digital Realty. I would also allude to the heritage of being a construction company that's operated in more markets around the world than a lot of our competitors. So that has provided us a very phenomenal opportunity to kind of consistently deliver our product offerings and some of the most economical elements possible to our customer base and meeting the stringent timelines that we're seeing from a lot of these larger and smaller customer base that's coming into our asset class. So I would say the short answer is, we don't see any spikes today and we've really locked in a lot of the variability and we continue to deliver I think an industry leading price point to the market today.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Do you have any way of quantifying the GAAP sales in your price, your cost per megawatt versus maybe some of these private equity new builds?
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: That's a great question. It depends on the market. There are so many variabilities. We can't really go into an apples-to-apples comparison, but I would tell you just some of the new money coming into the market, I don't think they really realize the stringent nature of giving power to the facility and securing the right resources and because of the competitive dynamic that exists in the market today, I would tell you that the talent that is required to build out these facilities is becoming extremely scarce. And that's why we continue to secure long-term contract with the appropriate people to do the very complex installs and builds. And that's why I tell you, it's really hard to place a simplistic model against their money coming in, but there are a lot of pitfalls out there that we've seen certain providers – with PE providers and even existing providers fall into on getting that power, getting those resources allocated. And then also the last piece that we've talked about a couple of times the supply chain, right. Making sure you have the available infrastructure and inventory to hit those timelines. And you know we've been able to achieve some industry leading timelines on delivery of shells, delivery of data hauls and just a full fit out. But I would tell you it's hard to give you any specifics, but we definitely are very pleased with some of the teams that we've had in the field for some time now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That was close, it's Michael Bilerman. So first question, I don't know if Bill or Andy want to take it. If you think about the Ascenty transaction, you talked a lot about how about how strategic it was. You know at the end of the day the deal was going to be somewhat dilutive to 2019 and 2020, given that there's a lot of development that has to be leased up in that portfolio, but you also talked about how it would accelerate your long-term growth profile. How should investors think about you doing other deals like this that could take down current growth for the potential of growth going forward and perhaps within that context, quantify a little bit how much you think this deal adds to your growth profile on a standalone basis?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Michael. This is Andy. I'll maybe start off and Bill and Chris can chime in. I think what we found here was a quite unique and somewhat unusual opportunity to enter a market and essentially step into a dominant market leading position, 30% plus market share, where the next competitor is close to a third in terms of size. So far ahead already landed the initial critical compute nodes in network on ramps for the top and largest buyers of what we offer and essentially have this dominant position to deploy incremental capital to support our customers' growth. Now what's unique about that with it was that close to half of the contractual revenue was associated with a project where the building is being constructed. So there's certainly timelines that these projects need to be delivered and contracts need to commence. And the other unique aspect, which I touched upon earlier is the fact that we went into this with a risk mitigation approach not only by choosing Brookfield as equity partner given their experience in the region for close to 100 years and their massive investments in that region, but we also pursued a non-recourse piece of secured debt financing that covers the cost of debt that is double-digit rate. So, we actively diluted our earnings attributed to heavier coupon debt in order to mitigate risk. And I'd say while it's dilutive to our core FFO and AFFO per share call it 2%, we see call it closer to 1% positive in 2021 and I would say that's on our fairly conservative underwriting really essentially building out the capacity that team in hand has today. And when in reality I think this platform is going to grow not only in Brazil onto the option land they have, but also in other parts of the South America as our platform. I don't think there's a lot of other opportunities that I've seen there in my career inside or outside the data center space or opportunities that I see out there today that really line up like that, like there's another one of these out there, but maybe Bill can chime in a little bit.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I think this is unique. Mike, this is in some ways a giant construction project, development project with the type of growth return – returns growth which we expect over multi-year period. So, you know while we've talked about unlevered returns that are in the high teens on these development projects, you know the EBITDA growth that I've seen in the underwriting, year one was 50%, year two about 35%. So obviously that's off a low base, but that's certainly accretive to our growth rates on standalone basis.
Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. Second question and this goes back to the minimal lease spreads that you're getting, and I recognize there is some legacy leases that are in there. But overall, the lease spreads are largely uninspiring. And when you think about the two real estate sectors that both have the secular demand trends, industrial and data centers, both have a lot of development going on. A lot of demand for space, industrial is seeing rent spreads in the 20% to 30% range, and the data centers are not seeing much at all. And, I want to know if you guys step back from just a real estate perspective, what is the factor overall because both of these sectors have a lot of supply that supply is being taken up. There's a lot of demand for the assets themselves and there's a lot of institutional capital that's being attracted to the space. So, why do you think the fundamental trends within the data centers are not as strong as they are sort of within industrial?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Mike, I guess my observation and we're not nearly as versed in industrial space as our neighbors at ProLogis, so they can give you maybe they – good thing to ask their view on the same question. But my understanding on industrial space is, it's an asset class that did not have rent growth for a fairly long time. And now a little bit more on the heels of some of the technology trends and the reorganization of the supply chain, you have these fairly attractive rental rate growth and ultimately releasing spreads. Our space certainly not been as long as it's been around as long as industrial space, really has it's a composite of leases that had called it 5 year, 10 year, 15 year leases with 2% to 3% bumps for a long time. And look, I agree with you, what is surprising you're not seeing much more aggressive cash mark-to-market. They're not, I won't say they're 2.5% year-to-date cash mark-to-market is not nothing, it's still decent. I think what you're seeing with our space is a different kind of cycle relative to the in-place leases relative to some of the industrial leases. And I also think what's a little bit different about our asset class and our platform is, and we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we try to utilize our competitive advantages when we have renewals with a customer like the one I mentioned, at one of our Chicago campuses, we're happy to take a less aggressive posture in that negotiation in order to either contractually tie-up at the same time or to have a happy customer that wants to grow with us. In that example, we renewed a less than 0.5 megawatt deal for the negative cash mark-to-market, but at the same time, we grew them at that same location where they were currently and also at a rough growth campus a total of 3 megawatts across both locations. So it's kind of a win-win, where you look at that just the renewal by itself and you would come away looking fairly negative. But I can tell you economically it was an attractive value proposition for Digital, and I think was attractive for the customer because they were able to enjoy the benefits of our platform.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Revisiting the pipeline, but I'm focused more on the hyperscale part of the pipeline. So, you've had two back to back very strong quarters with some large deals at both times, and I was wondering on that aspect of the pipeline are you seeing it really replenished or stable or is that part sort of trying to taking a pause. Secondly, similar question on a broader scale, I'd say that the Northern Virginia market absorbed like 168 megawatts in the first half probably eight times the next biggest market in North America. So the same question really on a broader not Digital specific basis, do you think this pace continues the next quarter or the next few quarters or does it take a pause, which is a more rational view.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rob, thanks for the question. So on the hyperscale platform to have two quarters in a row with 20 plus megawatt deals is fantastic. I can't tell you that I'm confident there's going to be definitely another one in the fourth quarter. At the same time, looking at the pipeline, we're in numerous active dialogues with customers in numerous markets around the globe supporting their growth and they're in all shapes and sizes, but when you get into the hyperscale arena with these customers, be it top five health service providers or other customers with similar profiles, the deals do tend to be larger. And I think, we – based on what we're seeing, we think there's going to be continuation of these customers growing and rolling out their infrastructures, not only in North America, but in all other markets as well. Turning to your Ashburn comments, so we've – I think we've averaged or we've done about 100 megawatts of leasing in Ashburn over the last four quarters or so. And obviously, based on the fact that we bought, I believe, the largest non-contiguous land capacity in megawatts was recently Ashburn. I think we're big believers in the continued growth of this market. I think, we have conviction around it based on a large and growing installed base of customers who keep coming back to us for the second, third and fourth takes and new customers who are coming in the market. When you get to these large numbers, you never know what quarter, you're not going to have another record for that market. But I think I very much like our value propositions for any customer looking to tour Ashburn because it's not just an Ashburn location. And I think we got – it's a conversation about the whole Digital Realty platform. I think we have a lot of other competitive advantages relative to other peers in the market. Chris, do you want to add anything on either of those?
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Absolutely. Thanks, Andy. You had highlighted this earlier, Andy, about proximity. And I think that's something that you have to look at, particularly in that market where we have these immense data lakes or immense set of infrastructure that's already deployed there. So that's why we're looking at this longer-term contiguous land where you have availability of power in a very proximate location. And there's a bunch of benefits that are afforded to a lot of our top customers and being able to provide them that. And so that's one element of why we see it growing within that market. And in particular, we're also seeing the fact that there are so many new applications coming to market. And we highlighted this at our Investor Day, where we talked about the second generation of cloud and the next wave of cloud infrastructure. So any of the AI or any of the new blockchain and any of the new technologies coming out, Ashburn is a critical epicenter to be able to leverage the existing data to support these new services. So they're not standalone silos, they need a consistent set of infrastructure to efficiently launch them at the global scale needed. But that's why we believe very strongly in the Ashburn market.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thank you. My question pertains to interconnection revenue growth that is decelerating on a year-on-year basis consistently through year-to-date 2018. And on the interconnection signings it looks like you were flat quarter on quarter, and I just wanted to get a better understanding of the dynamics that are at play here. Is it because wholesale is just predominantly taking off and diluting out the effects of interconnection? And do you anticipate a complete swing the other way around, maybe in about a year or two years' time, regarding the interconnection business? Is there a scenario where this accelerates? Maybe you can give us some color on that, especially as it pertains to some of these new applications you just mentioned in the prior question.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Sami. I'll talk a little bit about the most recent trends in both the interconnection revenue recognized through the P&L and also signings, where we think both are going, and then I'll ask Chris to chime in about applications and the implications from the applications. So obviously we had somewhat muted year-over-year growth in the P&L from the interconnection revenue, closer to mid-single-digits. I'm certainly not pleased where we think that product offer can go. We are – I would say a little bit in the results, you saw a little bit of headlines from some of the M&A consolidation on the telco space, where those buyers are just not as demonstrably large buyers of the interconnection offering when two of those companies have combined. And that trend has been playing out in the M&A world for a while and now starting to flow through a little bit on the P&L. I would say I remain optimistic for the ensuing quarters or next year in getting that revenue line item to be getting closer to high single digits, if not double digits on the P&L. What gives me optimism is we have been putting up more solid signings quarters, about $8 million for the last couple quarters. The composition of those signings have been from – you can see some of these in anecdotes we put from the customer signings about multi-market, re-architecting the backbones, multi-sites where they need new interconnection. And also what gives me confidence is the new logo trends, which have been trending up quarter over quarter each quarter this year to 48 new logos plus the eight through our P&A channel. And as we've seen in prior experiences, when new logos land, they obviously take initial connectivity offering, but then they substantially grow their customers' connectivity profile in the high teens. So the new logo connecting within our ecosystem spurs incremental interconnection revenue. The composition of the locations, it's certainly been the dominant North America sites, including New York City markets, Chicago, Atlanta, and then London and Europe. And I think one thing that's been a pretty good uplift is actually we've seen a material pickup in our interconnection or connectivity bookings within Ashburn, which I'd say is on the heels of launching some fairly quite successful colocation and interconnection offerings in that market. I'm not sure if we're going to do our second or third part that it gets that off. And so all these things to me in my mind are going to drive incremental interconnection bookings. And maybe I'll let Chris speak to a little bit of the longer-term trends.
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Andy, and yeah, Sami, so I think you're very aware of the interconnection dynamics that exist out there, but one of the other elements I would highlight is just some of the new cloud on-ramps that are coming into our facility. So those have a bit of a lag in picking up and customers really starting to be able to leverage that new interconnect paradigm that's core to digital. And I would tell you that as the interconnection shifts to where the actual clouds reside, it's creating a brand new opportunity, where you probably hear a lot of people talk about a cloud-first world. One of the things we've often looked at is we have to provide a different type of interconnect model to meet these new application demands. And so I would tell you that with these on-ramps coming into our connected campus and getting set up to where they can leverage the broader markets, and these are enterprise customers and it's across all the verticals, but they can leverage our Service Exchange to start to seamlessly consume all of these major cloud services privately in a much more secure broader manner. I definitely see that picking up. And one of the things we've also referenced at a high level is just some of the newer cloud applications that we've brought onto the Service Exchange, where it's not just about your traditional IaaS infrastructure, it's about SaaS. And so with the recent announcement of our Salesforce.com capability and bringing that SFDC infrastructure online so you can consume it privately as well, it's definitely setting us apart and making more and more ecosystems represented inside of our Digital Realty campus so that customers can get value out of that. And so there's not a new application coming to market that doesn't have very dynamic interconnection requirements, but I would say the last high-level element I would leave you with is the most efficient supply chain wins. So the more you can directly connect to where the actual cloud and network nodes are or where those services reside, the better off your overall performance is going to be. And that's something that we've touted on previous calls and we talk a lot about is the fact that we've brought to market what we feel is a very unique offering with interconnected scale, which represents the best of both worlds for the cloud providers and the cloud consumers. And so that set us up for some future growth potential around our interconnection, and we look at that very positively over the next couple of quarters.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, thank you very much for that color. And then my next question is just on bookings visibility. And I really just want to get an idea. For example, after 2Q 2018 results, how much visibility into 3Q 2018 signings did you guys have? Would you say half of the potential bookings you had visibility on? I just want to get an understanding on how we could put confidence in a long-term model as far as the same amount of bookings generated. And maybe you can explain to us. Are the leasing conversations completely changing with your customers versus about three years ago regarding future pipeline? I just want to get a better feel on that.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Sami. So listen this is a – as I mentioned another robust and diverse and successful quarter on the signings, six of the last seven quarters now, over $50 million, and it was a short strength across the product offerings and sectors. If you look at the, call it $69 million of bookings that the colocation and interconnection piece of the pie, which was call it approaching $18 million that has much more of a monthly cadence to it. So obviously, we have an idea of pipeline but those deals move from upside to outlook and commit every month in a monthly close. So let's call it just a little bit less than a third of the signings. On the larger end on the bigger side including the 20-plus megawatt deal that work, and that deal started well before June 30. And it probably went on for a couple quarters. The tricky thing about that is, it's a large massive project and aligning contractually and with deliveries and operationally takes a lot of work and a very talented sales team, remember taking the lead on that one, but really supported by the entire Digital Realty organization to bring that over. And that could have signed on September 1 or September 30, there's no – nobody can control that the destiny of that deal. After that you got several in the call it 1 megawatts to 5 or so megawatts, and they're all on the different tracks with different customers and different markets. And then we also have a handful deals in the middle. So I think the key is maintaining a very large and diverse pipeline and making sure we are delivering for the customers, and try to bring, meet their timelines as fast as possible.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter. As outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, delivering our second highest quarterly bookings on record. And our backlog reached another all-time high. We further extended our global platform with a definitive agreement to acquire Ascenty, the leading data center provider in the rapidly growing Brazilian market. We once again delivered solid current period financial results being in consensus by a $0.01 and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share again in 2018. Last but not least we further strengthened our balance sheet raising $1.1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth and refinancing our $3.3 billion of credit facilities to extend the weighted average maturity of our debt by a full year. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and for your interest in the company and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in November.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp is on the call and will be available for Q&A. The management may make forward -looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. First and foremost, consistent execution against our customer success initiatives drove new high watermarks for both bookings and backlog. Second, we beat consensus by $0.05 driven by operational outperformance and the beat flowed through to a $0.05 guidance raise in the phase of shifting FX headwinds. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet by terming out revolver borrowings with an oversubscribed offering of $650 million of ten-year paper at a 4.45% coupon. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Let's begin on page 2 of our presentation with a recap of the strategic initiatives we laid out at our Investor Day in December. As you may recall, we told you then our top priority was deepening connections with our customers, and we expected to achieve our objectives through a global connected sustainable framework. We highlighted several initiatives we were undertaking to reorient our business around our customers, including our executive sponsorship program, our Digital Delivers customer success program, and steps we've taken to streamline the customer contracting process. A little over six months later, I'm pleased to report these initiatives are bearing fruit. The strong performance of the digital team delivered in the first half clearly benefited from a healthy economic backdrop and the robust growth of our customers' businesses. But there's no doubt that our growing mind share with customers has also benefited from our concerted efforts to reorient our business around their needs. Let's turn to sustainability on page 3. We are committed to powering our global portfolio with 100% renewable energy because we believe it's the right thing to do and because it matters to our customers. Our 20-megawatt utility-scale solar power purchase contract announced in December 2017 commenced operations in late March. This is the most recent project in our 184-megawatt renewable portfolio to come online, and it is now delivering low cost renewable energy at Ashburn. We have been frequently recognized for our sustainability leadership, and in June, we were named a 2018 Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the Department of Energy's Better Buildings Alliance at the BOMA Expo. Green lease standards have become common in the main food groups, but have not traditionally been used in the data center industry. Digital Reality is the first global data center REIT to adopt green lease standards. Our actions are helping to evolve industry practices, enabling mutually beneficial arrangements between building owners and customers that align the costs and benefits of energy and resource efficiency investments by both parties to improve PUE and reduce operating costs. We are committed to sustainability and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. In North America, new data centers are popping up across the primary data center metros, especially in Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world, and through which more than 70% of the world's Internet traffic passes every day. Northern Virginia is also Digital Realty's largest concentration. We are blessed to own 370 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in our existing portfolio along with 63 megawatts currently under construction that are 87% pre-leased, in addition to 243 acres of strategic landholdings that will support the build out of another 390 megawatts of future capacity. The data center sector has been prone to oversupply in the past, but demand is rapidly outpacing supply and on current form, we see a greater risk of running out of inventory and missing the opportunity to support our customers' growth than risk of oversupply. We are taking proactive steps to secure our supply chain and replenish our inventory balance. And you may have seen that we've acquired a 13-acre parcel in Santa Clara as well as a 62-acre parcel in Manassas, Virginia. We've seen a similar dynamic in Europe where we did miss out on some recent business due to a lack of inventory. However, as we told you last quarter, we restocked the shelves and made up for some lost ground in the second quarter with a total of 10 megawatts sold. On the last call, we mentioned a four-megawatt deployment in Amsterdam with a top legacy DFT customer. Other key second quarter wins in Europe included a company that provides cloud-based solutions for the higher education sector security deployment in our Frankfurt colocation facility to provide local hosting services to German customers and to satisfy data sovereignty compliance requirements. They selected Digital Realty as their partner for this project due to the technical strength of our Frankfurt facility as well as our ability to meet their aggressive deployment schedule. Europe's leading provider of monitor security solutions for both business and residential properties selected Digital Realty in Amsterdam to consolidate their other data center deployments across the Nordics and Southern Europe. A British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer chose a digital location in London to replace their owned facility, meet their migration criteria and timeline and provide immediately available inventory with room to grow. Nearly three-fourths of the recent activity has been with existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth. Similar to the U.S., given our recent success, we are focused on building out remaining capacity within our current footprint and we are kicking off the initial phases of the next buildings on our campus locations to maintain a healthy inventory balance. Pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options in addition to differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence. Market vacancy is low across the major European markets, both new and established competitors are bringing new supply to market, but it is being met by healthy demand. Across the Asian Pacific region, the robust demand we have cited for the past several quarters continues to accelerate, particularly from Asian cloud service providers. Follow-on requirements from these clients are coming to market sooner-than-expected, deployments that were closed only a few years ago are already approaching full capacity. On the supply front, the build cycle in many Asia Pacific markets is longer than other regions, given complexity in the permitting and approval stage, as well as the need to build vertically in urban, land-constrained environments. Net-net, we believe our customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection product offering as a key differentiator in their selection of data center provider of choice. Let's turn to the intersection of supply and demand on page 5. A lot of ink has been spilled recently expressing concerns about pricing and profitability on hyperscale activity. I'd like to share a few data points that may help you understand our perspective on pricing and returns. First of all, the average lease term on leases we've signed over the last 12 months is more than two years longer than the average lease term over the prior 12 months. Quarterly bookings tend to get a lot of airtime and obviously our bookings have stepped up as well. But when you take those two extra years of lease term into account, you'll see that the total contract value we have signed over the last 12 months is more than double the contract value we signed over the previous 12 months. It goes without saying that hyperscale credit quality is excellent. In addition, the larger deal sizes we're doing today are also substantially de-risking our development pipeline. You can see that firsthand this quarter as the pre-leasing on our pipeline moved up from just over 40% to north of 60%. Consequently, while developing returns may be marginally lower today, we believe the returns on our current pipeline represent a respectable spread over our cost of capital, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis. And when you consider the greater volume and longer lease term, we believe our recent activity has created meaningful value for shareholders. Let's turn to the macro environment on page 6. As I said earlier, the global economic backdrop has been quite supportive for the last several quarters. We are mindful of the risk of a global trade war which does have the potential to disrupt the broad based current economic growth. However as you've heard me say many times before, we're fortunate to be operating a business levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular trends, I'd like to highlight just a couple of the figures on page 7. According to the Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey, over 70% of organizations report making significant or moderate cloud investments. According to a recent Gartner forecast, nearly $74 billion will be spent on cloud application services better known as Software-as-a-Service in 2018. This makes SaaS the top category in global public cloud spending this year. More than $40 billion or over 20% of the overall public cloud market will be spent on Infrastructure-as-a-Service in 2018. While SaaS is the biggest piece of the pie and is expected to stay that way through 2021, infrastructure is the fastest growing segment, up nearly 36% in 2018 according to Gartner. The global spend on public cloud services is expected to grow by more than 20% in 2018 reaching over $185 billion. IDC expects public cloud spending to grow over 20% a year for the next five years reaching north of $275 billion by 2021. To effectively address this market, data center providers must offer a global interconnected solution from colocation to hyperscale. These trends obviously play directly to our strengths, help explain the quality of our recent results and bode very well for future demand cycles. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 9. We signed total bookings for the second quarter of $94 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $86 million during the second quarter, including a $7.5 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the second quarter was over seven years. Our largest transaction was a 25-plus megawatt win with an existing hyperscale customer who selected us based on our distinguished operational track record and ability to accommodate their future growth needs. Second quarter wins were broad-based across products as well as geographic regions and bookings would have been north of $60 million even excluding the 25-plus megawatt hyperscale win. While the majority of our new signs were with existing customers, we added 39 new logos during the quarter from an industry-leading aerospace company to an international provider of shared workspaces sourced through one of our many partners. Within the enterprise segment, second quarter wins included: a global financial technology company chose Digital Realty as their go-to partner for data center consolidation and expansion, the customer recognized Digital Realty's ability to provide best-in-class facilities that met the most stringent security needs, a strong partner ecosystem for migration enablement and robust connectivity solutions; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology needed a specific connectivity solution in North America and Digital Realty delivered, the institute established a presence with us to accommodate high networking gear that will support research and development of Internet platform technology; an international semiconductor intellectual property supplier is expanding into new IoT services, with existing data center facilities in the U.S. and the UK, the company expanded with us with their presence in Texas, driven by security and their customer demand for a single-tenant environment. We saw strong demand this quarter in our network segment across the portfolio including, a 12-site backbone expansion for a leading global provider of communications and digital entertainment services, a new edge deployment in Atlanta for a leading global provider of software-defined networking and other services, a new networking deployment in Miami for a leading national provider of fiber optic network solutions and services, a new edge deployment in New York for a leading global provider of innovative solutions for satellite clients, and an expansion of network deployments in Atlanta and New York for a global media and technology company. Our strategic alliances and channel referral partner programs continue to help us drive growth and extend our reach to new customers. We continue to build our capabilities through partners who integrate our world-class data center capabilities into the solutions they offer customers. For example, during the second quarter, we partnered with Oracle to provide the right solution for a global mobile network provider with a set of private, low latency, high availability connections through our Service Exchange platform to their globally deployed production environments and directly to Oracle OCI cloud nodes within our data centers. As shown here on page 10, we also continued to expand our capabilities with IBM, one of our key strategic alliances where we have been able to embed our capabilities into their Direct Link products that allow customers to connect directly to their cloud infrastructure and advanced cloud services. We saw continued growth with that business in the second quarter by providing capabilities to IBM, its business partners and customers globally. These capabilities now include access to IBM Cloud, the IBM Direct Link on our Service Exchange platform providing customers, partners and IBM organizations the ability to choose how and where they want to connect to the IBM Cloud within our global footprint providing a secure, low latency, consistent and reliable set of capabilities. This partnership illustrates the unique value proposition of Digital Realty's comprehensive product offering. We are able to offer customers a wide variety of connection options such as a flexible private cloud footprint on our campus, directly adjacent to an IBM Cloud compute node, enabling the customer to connect directly and securely to their public cloud instance at incredible low latency, especially compared to an off-campus on-ramp, which is then has to tether back to the actual cloud compute engine sitting on a Digital Realty campus. This flexibility gives us a unique ability to solve for the full spectrum of our customers' hybrid multi-cloud architecture requirements. Turning to our backlog on page 11, the current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, reached another all-time high of $142 million. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was five months, a bit below the long-term average. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 12, we signed $76 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was 3.5 years and cash rents on renewals rolled up 3.4% with positive cash release and spreads across all product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio, most notably within former DFT properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy picked up 20 basis points to 89.4% due primarily to positive absorption in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Dallas. We expect portfolio occupancy should be essentially flat in the second half as continued positive absorption in the same-store pool will be partially offset by placing in-service development projects that have not yet reached stabilization. Turning to our economic risk mitigation on page 13, FX represented a modest tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our second quarter results. However, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen over the past 90 days and has acted as a bit of a drag on growth relative to the prior quarter. We now expect FX to represent a modest headwind in the second half of the year. Moving on to earnings growth on page 14, core FFO per share was up 8% year-over-year and came in $0.05 above consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by operational outperformance with lower than expected property taxes as well as operating expenses. As you may have seen from the press release, despite the foreign currency headwind, we are raising 2018 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Most of the drivers are unchanged aside from higher development spending due to our recent leasing wins and updated assumptions for FX, financings and asset sales closed during the second quarter. In terms of the quarterly run-rate, as you can see from the bridge on page 15, we expect to step back down by the extent of the beat in the third quarter due to higher interest expense from the recent bond issuance, timing of G&A investments and loss of NOI from our recent asset sales before rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter as several large leases commence. Last but not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 16. Net debt-to-EBITDA improved slightly to 5.2 times at the end of the second quarter and fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.3 times. As you can see from the chart on page 16, our weighted average debt maturity is approximately five years and the weighted average coupon is 3.5%. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly 100% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards long duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 16, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. So first, I just wanted to touch on investment activity for a second. It was reported, I believe, by Bloomberg a few weeks ago that you guys were in talks and looking at a large scale portfolio in Brazil. Anything you can offer up in terms of interest level in expansion into South America?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hi Jordan, thanks for the question. We, as you know, do not comment on market rumors, but I'll share with you our thought process regarding investments. First, as you know, we try to stay close to our customers, and in speaking with them, try to ascertain where they have an interest in growing. Second, we truly believe that our global platform represents a key competitive advantage. We think that's been validated with this quarter's results. When looking at new investment opportunities, we pay particular attention to new capabilities, new markets, platforms that are appealing. In our Investor Day last year, we did say that we were going to try to enter two new markets in the next three years and we put a map up of the largest economies. So from that map, you can probably draw your own conclusions. We do keep tabs on everything. We see everything because of our size. We look at potential markets all the time. And when we do participate in a new market and buy a portfolio, we try to remain disciplined with respect to capital allocation. So I hope that's helpful.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. It is. Separately, just on the results, I think congrats are due to you guys from the volume. We don't offer those up lightly, but that's obviously a big quarter. The one question regarding the volume is you did beat and you did raise by a similar amount to the beat in the quarter. Given the reasonably short lag between signing and commencement on this $94 million, why aren't we seeing a little bit more of a flow through into 2018?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Well, thank you first of all for the congratulations on the bookings in the quarter. We obviously feel really good about that. In terms of the specifics behind the guidance, I'll hand that off to Andy.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Jordan. So, as you mentioned, we were certainly pleased with not just the volume, but the composition of the new signings. The one thing I would note is a significant portion of those new signings were executed in the back half of the quarter. Thus the five months from sign to commence really only trickles in a few weeks or months into the fiscal 2018 year. The good news is that we are once again moving the chains on our guidance at the low and the high end and moving the guidance up to higher and higher single digit growth and we will get the full year benefit of those signings we signed this quarter next year, which does de-risk our growth in 2019.
Operator: The next question will be from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. I also want to echo the congratulations on obviously a very strong quarter. Two questions if I may. First on the interconnect revenue; it was flat roughly quarter-over-quarter. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that and what you're doing to potentially improve that and maybe what you think it should be. And then also just in light of the very strong bookings, just wanted to get some – remind us about your capital requirements. Do you think an equity raise is coming at some point to support this, maybe not this year but next year? Any color on what CapEx could look like in 2019 even if it's simply down, flat or up from this year would be helpful. Thank you.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks again, Colby, for the congratulations, appreciate it. This is Andy, maybe I'll tackle, actually probably both and let Bill and Chris chime in. On the interconnection front, we were pleased with the overall signs on interconnection and the step-up quarter-over-quarter, and we kind of often lump that together with the colocation signings, which did improve on a quarterly basis in terms of signings. They stepped up in Europe and North America and in aggregate, the largest contributors were some of our campus colocation expansions, be it Ashburn or Richardson, some new footprint in Atlanta we opened up in the last six to nine months, and also some of our core markets like New York, Chicago and London, we had some several wins in there for some great customers and I think what you're pointing out too is what flowed through the P&L, which was a little muted on a year-over-year basis. We did have some credits from our Amsterdam Data Tower migration moving some of our legacy customers from their existing footprint to newly built colocation facility to facilitate that disruption. We gave some credits on the interconnection revenue and we do think the other signs we signed will ultimately continue to grow that line item in the future. And I look at it as more of a longevity here of the re-architecting of the sales and marketing team, going vertical, getting the right reps on the right accounts and driving the cadence to drive more colocation interconnection revenue over the next several quarters. I think your second question was kind of around capital planning and financial policy. So, we did inch up the development CapEx guidance line item due to some of the wins we had on the signings front during the quarter and also attributable to some of the land purchases carrying future supply chain. Luckily, we ended the quarter at 5.2 times debt-to-EBITDA, in line with our targeted leverage levels and termed out our floating rate debt. So, we have call it less than $0.5 billion of revolver borrowings, so substantial liquidity and remain focused on organically or self-funding all our needs for 2018. Looking forward 2019, call it, the next 12 to 18 months from here, we're certainly going to have to evaluate all of our sources of capital, be it proceeds from our disposition capital-recycling program as well as other common, preferred equity and bond financing alternatives.
Operator: The next question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the land acquisitions in Santa Clara and Manassas, how are you thinking about the potential build out of those properties, and what's the long-term thought there, particularly you talked about Ashburn, but establishing a bigger footprint in Manassas? And then you did some divestitures in the quarter, can you just help us think through, is that it or are there likely to be more and how do you think about why get out of a market like Austin, what's the framework there for de-emphasizing some of those? Thanks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Simon, this is Bill. I'll start and let the other fellows here clean up. But first of all, relative to Manassas, what we're seeing is that the CSPs are basically going with three availability zones in the market. And so, Manassas represents a different availability zone than Loudoun, so it gives us the opportunity to land the same customer in the market, but in a slightly different location. So, Manassas is very attractive from that standpoint. And Santa Clara is a very tight market and we've talked about it before. It's the one market where supply is constrained and we see rents improving. And so, this particular location was adjacent to an existing data center of ours. It allows us to create a campus in that particular submarket. Relative to dispositions, we're not finished. I mean, while we are a data center company, we're also a real estate investment trust, and we're all about prudent portfolio management, which means we are monitoring the portfolio regularly and looking to sell assets that are less core to our strategy, maybe have slower growth, maybe some CapEx requirements. And so, those are typically markets that we don't see as having the same demand characteristics as some of our core markets, and those might be one-off assets. And that will continue. Andy or Chris, any?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I'll just say that the theme on the markets where we're concentrating our investment focus versus markets where we're monetizing the similar trends be it when we exit Philadelphia, St. Louis, Sacramento and redeploy those capitals into Ashburn, Chicago, Dallas, Santa Clara and similar markets abroad it is targeted markets with robust and diverse customer demand from across all of our verticals, be it our global accounts, enterprise or network verticals and moving out of markets or less concentration in markets that are much more dependent on regional IT outsource demand and somewhat single thread.
Operator: The next question will come from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, for taking the questions and congrats on the results. Just two questions. First, as it relates to your 2018 outlook and your expectation for slightly negative cash renewals, but your commentary seem to be somewhat positive. So I'm just trying to balance out what your guidance is versus some of the commentary that you had made. And then, secondly in Europe, obviously, it was a little light in Q1, but your business had picked up. How do you feel you're positioned now to capture some of that demand that you're seeing in the market is demonstrating?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Relative to Europe, we think we're in a good spot. In Frankfurt, we've leased 3 megs out of 9 meg total building and we're planning to begin construction on the other two nine meg properties on the site. And similarly, I understand we have some additional capacity and we'll be beginning construction soon there. Andy, do you want to handle the...?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Just round that out and I'll turn over to the mark-to-market. I mean, I think the Europe activity has certainly picked up on the execution front and it's been broad-based to ranging from top three global cloud service providers to Asia based cloud service providers to local, a win we had in London market from an enterprise customer. So broad-based and traction continues and pipeline grows. Turning to the mark-to-market, we've had a positive cash mark-to-market on our renewals in the first quarter. We had another positive mark-to-market in the second quarter. It was broad-based across all of the major product lines. That being said, as we've referenced before we do still have a handful of larger leases in the portfolio, most notably those we've inherited and somewhat underwrote in our acquisition of the DuPont Fabros portfolio that will likely renew in the coming quarters, that could bring the overall year slightly negative or into the red. So it's not a definitive time table when, which particular quarter those get executed, but we did want to make sure that we incorporate that into our full year guidance.
Operator: And the next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch base on sort of the inflation pressure that I'm kind of seeing in the industry both on raw materials and labor and what's sort of your outlook there over the next 12 months and your ability to pass that along and do you think that could possibly affect your development yields as you look at building out over the next 12 months? Thanks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank, we've touched on this before, but we have a program in place where we lock in our major equipment costs for three years. And that's really insulated us from equipment costs and material costs. The other thing that we do is we keep our contractors fully employed. In fact, if we're no longer building in one region, we'll move that contractor out to another region to keep them fully engaged and we find that by doing that it gives us very attractive labor cost as well. Andy, anything you'd like to add there.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Just something that was akin to the legacy DuPont portfolio as well. So, on many of our larger footprint customers, we've been moving forward with a triple net lease structure that allows us to pass through escalations and costs over the term of the contract, but it also insulates us on our returns over-time.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. I have two quick ones. One, in terms of the signings that you mentioned in the fourth quarter, how should we think about the level of contribution it has and then going into 2019 and then in terms of the top three customers that you have, there is a little bit of a shuffling in terms of the level in a positive way. How should we consider that? Thank you.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. I'll start Frank and let the team chime in. We do have a slide that kind of rolls forward our commencement timing and which we somewhat segmented of what's kind of commencing in the back half of 2018 and on into 2019. As I mentioned in response to I believe the first question, a good portion of the 4Q 2018 commencements are late 4Q 2018, but there are some larger leases in there that will kick in and obviously (40:33) that is you've got a full-year's benefit in 2019 de-risking our growth there. So that should give you a little bit of color on the backlog and we also kind of provided some rough guidance in the composition of the quarterly 2018 core FFO per share. Your second question, you're correct, we have a new name on the leaderboard in terms of our top customer list here at digital. I think we all love each and every one of our customers equally. So I'm not going to say that's a good thing or a bad thing, but certainly I've seen customers that are already on there, adding more locations and expanding with us and also new names jumping on that top 20 list anytime we can.
Operator: And the next question will come from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Just two quick questions. One, where do you guys stand on potential replacements for Dan and Scott or whether you're going to replace them at all and maybe talk a little bit about the organizational structure in that case. And the second is, Andy I was wondering if you could just be a little bit more specific, I guess, about 3Q guidance and then what's implied for 4Q just on a per share basis? Thank you.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Michael, I'll handle your first question, and Andy will handle the second one. Relative to replacements, first of all, I think we clearly believe in our team. We think we have a very talented team. We think that's validated by the second quarter that's been delivered. But having said that, we're looking at both internal and external candidates for both the head of sales position and the Chief Investment Officer position and we're looking at some what I think are very high quality, high caliber candidates. We've engaged a search firm. We're also mining our own network, which we think is very good. But you know given the strength of our platform and the existing team, we're focused on bringing on the right people versus timing, and we're in no rush to fill these positions. We have a deep and talented team and we remain focused on executing our strategic vision.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then Michael turning to your guidance question, probably I'm not going to hit the nail on the head with this answer given that our policy is really to give full-year guidance not quarterly, we did try to be helpful on one of the slides in the deck that kind of bridges you from the second quarter to the third and fourth. A couple of things I'd highlight or the three things I'd highlight are one, some of the step down between second quarter and third quarter is we did execute an upsized U.S. dollar 10-year bond offering last month. That turned out our revolver borrowings and as you can see on the guidance table, we did that a little bit earlier than we had previously assumed taking advantage of a market window and preserving liquidity and which we think is the right thing to do for the balance sheet. But it does have a somewhat of a little drag in the quarter-to-quarter earnings. We also will get hit with the loss of NOI and the timing delay between redeployment and those funds coming back on through our development yields from some of the acquisitions we completed during the second quarter and our plan to complete in the third and fourth quarter. And then that kind of stair steps you down to 3Q 2018. And then lastly the fourth quarter, we do have already signed leases several in Northern Virginia that have signed and are commencing in late or a portion of which will commence in 4Q 2018 and then also there is another larger lease in the Santa Clara market, it's multiple megawatts that I'm aware of coming online and kicking into fourth quarter 2018 contribution that steps that core FFO per share backup per our guidance.
Operator: The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question and also congratulations on a very big leasing number. I have a question about smaller item on the property taxes, which looks like that was a big part of the beat in the quarter, it was a significant step down. Do you expect this to be the recurring rate going forward or will that be stepping back up sort of more in line with where it's been historically. And secondly, in terms of hyperscale, I was wondering what you're seeing generally outside of the Northern Virginia market. Northern Virginia market seems extremely strong and then we hear a lot about it. But what are you seeing in terms of the scale of deployments in other locations around the country?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll start off and let Bill and Chris chime in here. On the property taxes, that's really due to proactive management always chasing down appeals and working wherever we can. And also a bit of conservative accruals in terms of our estimates, a portion of that would be non-recurring unless we continue to achieve on a different appeal in a different market. They really were broken up between our UK portfolio and the West Coast region of North America portfolio. So, a little bit of that I would say is one time in nature, but all baked into the full year guidance we've kind of already incorporated. Turning to hyperscale or scale, maybe I'll just kind of hit the tops of the waves and guys chime in as you see fit. Outside of Northern Virginia, we had in North America scale signings the larger – on the smaller end, the scale signings ranged from call it north of 500 kilowatts to as high as 6 megawatts in Austin, Phoenix, Toronto and Santa Clara, one of which I just mentioned. If you move over to Europe, there was some of the transactions I mentioned with the enterprise customer in London, was call it 700 kilowatts and then we had other transactions in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt ranging 2 megawatt to 4 megawatt each from three different customers. And then in Asia Pacific, we had on the smaller end, 600 kilowatt transaction from a European SaaS provider in Australia, multiple megawatt and then multiple megawatt signings from some of our other customers into Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Operator: The next question will be from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Bill, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but how would you describe the risk of running short of inventory over the medium-term to sustain the sales momentum you've seen as of late. I mean, is that something we should actually be concerned about or do you feel comfortable with the pipeline?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Well, that's why we have acquired the land that we did in Virginia, we acquired the land in Santa Clara. We'll probably have some other land announcements this quarter. So we're very focused on securing the frontend of the supply chain. We're laying down pads on our campuses so that we can build quickly when the demand materializes, so. And there are some markets where the inventory is being churned through very quickly, particularly in Northern Virginia but that's why we're adding land.
Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Got it. And maybe on the colocation side, now that you've been operating them both for a couple of years, can you help dimension the magnitude of the benefit that stemmed from pairing the Telecity divestiture assets with the Telex assets? Help us understand how valuable it is having a global presence in that business versus a regional presence?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. This is Andy, and then I'm going to pitch this to (49:30) Chris to add on. I mean I think we're seeing more and more multi-market, multi-product deployments. And the customer is coming to us with, I need these many, eight locations across North America, Asia, Europe of ranges of different sizes and different uses. And there's specific signs I can recall during the quarter with some of our network customers and some of our social media customers who have bought with us, not only large but also small network deployments in multiple markets, multiple geos. And I'm aware of many other transactions in the pipeline as well. We're having – being able to be at the table with these customers and being able to provide a solution, be it Amsterdam or London, Ashburn or Santa Clara and Asia Pacific equivalence is the key differentiator relative to our competitive set. And something we would not have had or would not be able to compete with just going back a handful of years. Chris, I don't know if you want to add on to that.
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No. I'd definitely echo the sentiment on the fact that it's not just about colo, it's in the interconnection as well. And so, taking that interconnection capability and applying it to our scale portfolio has definitely broadened the solution set that we can provide to the customer base and it's a very much a multi-national type of customers coming to Digital where they land and they have the ability to expand, not only into colo but also into scale, which is really a differentiator going forward. And so, being able to apply these services in a very seamless fashion, so that not only a lot of the large cloud that we've been talking a lot about today can land their initial deployment, but they have a lot of smaller customers that need that colo capability in close proximity to their cloud node where they have the most efficient way to achieve that hybrid multi-cloud model, which a majority of the enterprises are looking for. So the culmination of all those products coming together in a very efficient manner is really differentiated in Digital going forward.
Operator: The next question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the hyperscale requirements and with regard or some focus on the 25 megawatt deal that was signed this quarter, I'm just curious in terms of the nature of the requirements you're seeing and the specific markets. Are you able to flag for us or identify the types of workloads that are driving this acceleration in demand that you're seeing? Is it the use of AI and ML that's driving it or anything specific you could point to?
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Excellent question. Thank you, Jordan. It's a mix, right. So inside of 25 megawatts, you can do a lot. I would tell you that what we're seeing is there's a lot of demand for new services that are adjunct to an existing set of services. So customers are really landing and expanding and really looking at how they can future proof their deployment. But the culmination of a lot of this infrastructure coming to market is not only supporting AI and some of the new ML services, but if you look at any of these major cloud operators today, I mean, they're announcing services – a couple of services a week, and so the way to support those services and the fact that it's a bit of an arms race is why they are coming to Digital and Bill had touched on this around the land banks that we have in place, the power that we've procured, the fact that we're master planning a lot of the infrastructure we have out there, and can turn around a lot of this infrastructure in some of the shortest timeframes in the market is definitely top of mind for these customers. And then I would tell you the last piece around some of the workload dynamics is, it's a mash up of services for a lot of these operators. So, as I referenced earlier, that interconnection component is also top of mind not only achieving the 25 megawatts and having a line of sight to future expansion for their own needs, but where their broader ecosystem of partners also are going to be placed, and that's why you see us really master planning and looking at building some of the largest campuses that are out in the market today that are fully interconnected to support that. We talked about it's at the highest levels, the cloud as the supply chain, the most efficient supply chain brought to market, which supports every workload permutation we've seen in the market today.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jordan, just let me add to that. So one thing that's really important to our customers, I don't think we've exactly hit on it here, but it's the ability to expand. So not only do the customers want to be able to fit into what we have built or will soon have built. But they want to be able to look and see that there's room for their growth on a campus and that's either in the existing facility or in a building next door and that's I think one thing that Digital provides that many of our competitors can't offer. And it goes to our point that we think that scale and particularly the global scale is a key differentiating factor in this business is becoming more and more important to our customers.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And when you look at the scale requirements and this potential and this acceleration. Or, is pricing holding would you say or is it strengthening? How would you characterize it as it relates to (55:19) requirements.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I'd say it definitely varies by market as you'd expect in any real estate business. But, I think, the pricing is actually on a risk adjusted basis is pretty darn good for even the largest deals. You look at the term of the contract, you look at the credit quality and the bumps over the term of the contract and you take those returns against our weighted average cost of capital and so, it's a very healthy spread that I don't think you can find in many other parts of the real estate world, if any.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, reaching record highs in both our bookings and our backlog. We further extended our sustainability leadership with our industry recognition as a green lease leader. We delivered solid current period finance results beating consensus and raising guidance. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by terming out borrowings in our line of credit with the successful issuance of $650 million of 10-year investment grade U.S. dollar corporate bonds. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. And we hope you all enjoy the dog days of summer.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Digital Realty's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Due to scheduling constraints, this call will be a concluded after 60 minutes. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. The management may make forward -looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First of all, we set a new high watermark with quarterly bookings north of $60 million. Second, we beat consensus by nearly 4%, driven by consistent operational out performance and we've raised guidance by $0.05 at the low end. Third to beat in race, flows through to cash flow and we remain on track to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. Last but not least, we expect to achieve this growth while maintaining our target leverage and self-funding our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With our Annual Shareholders Meeting coming up in a little less than two weeks, I'd like to begin today with a discussion on governance, here on page 2 of our presentation. At our Investor Day in December, we shared with you our plan for providing shareholders the ability to amend our bylaws. I'm pleased to report that in early March, our board approved a resolution giving any 3% shareholder or any group of up to 10 shareholders comprising a 3% stake for three years the right to propose binding amendments to the company's bylaws. We believe that with this step, we are joining a small group of other high-quality REITs and leading the industry with sound corporate governance practices. In keeping with our commitment to ongoing board refreshment, we also disclosed in our proxy that longtime Director, Bob Zerbst will not be standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting. In addition to his role on the board, Bob served as Chairman of the Compensation Committee from 2012 to 2017, and as a board representative on our internal investment committee for the past four years. He was also Chairman of the Investment Committee at CBRE Investors, when the initial investment in GI Partners, our private equity predecessor was first approved. On behalf of the entire board, I'd like to extend our thanks to Bob for his years of service to the company. The governance principle behind our board refreshment philosophy is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. Following Bob's departure, 8 of our 10 directors who have joined the board within the past six years, whereas our Chairman and former Chairman have both served on the board since our IPO. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a de-staggered board, the majority of our directors' compensation is paid in stock, each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company, the board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements and finally since 2014, the substantial majority of management's long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Moving on to investment activity. We have already closed on the sale of seven non-core assets year-to-date, generating proceeds of approximately $185 million and realizing gains of a little over $50 million. As Andy will address in his prepared remarks this consistent execution on our capital recycling program has prompted us to raise the high-end of our range for dispositions guidance by an additional $100 million further bolstering our ability to self-fund our 2018 capital plan. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 3. In North America data center construction crews remain active across the primary data center metros particularly in Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world. It is also Digital Realty's largest concentration and we are blessed to have 345 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity on our two existing campuses in addition to 180 acres of strategic land holdings that will support the build-out of another 290 megawatts of future capacity. The market dynamic in Ashburn is highly competitive and customers have plenty of options to choose from both established players as well as new market entrants. By the same token however demand is both sufficiently robust and diverse to lift a lot of provider boats. New supply is coming online, but is being just as rapidly absorbed. On balance, the North American data center landscape is roughly at equilibrium as you might expect with a national vacancy rate at 10% on the dot. In Europe hyperscale users continue to dominate the data center league tables representing over 70% of first quarter leasing volume. We estimate that approximately 40 megawatts released across the region in the first quarter largely driven by hyperscale customers expanding in existing locations, London and Amsterdam were the standout metros this quarter followed by Frankfurt. Digital Realty did not have a particularly active first quarter in terms of signed deals, but we did restock the shelves and now have a full complement of inventory in each of the major metros in Europe. We are also off to a strong start in the second quarter having landed a 4 megawatt deployment in Amsterdam in April, our first global deployment with a top legacy DuPont Fabros customer. We expect to see further momentum in Europe over the next several quarters. In terms of current buying behavior, customers are looking for long-term commitment tied to flexibility and the ability to land and expand within the same location, which lines up perfectly with our Connected Campus strategy. Across the Asia-Pac region demand remains very healthy and is even showing early signs of further acceleration driven by hyperscale users both within the region, as well as Western destinations. While supply has remained largely in check, several sizeable requirements are prompting potential new entrants to explore new markets. The marketplace remains highly fragmented, which creates barriers to entry especially new geographies for unproven teams. That said, healthy demand dynamic is not yet translating to rental rate growth given the prospect of potential new supply coming to market. Net-net we believe our customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection product offering as a key differentiator in their selection of data center provider of choice. Let's turn to the intersection of supply and demand on page 4. Much ado has been made of the pricing and profitability on the recent spate of hyperscale activity and I'd like to take a moment to share our philosophy on pricing and returns. First and foremost, I would like to remind you that we've always targeted superior risk adjusted returns. Along the X-axis here on page 4, we've outlined the primary risk attributes we underwrite our new-builds. It stands to reason that we would be willing to accept a somewhat lower return on a project that is fully pre-leased to a high credit tenant on a long-term lease as opposed to a speculative new-build. In addition, it should be intuitive that we're able to achieve the lowest unit cost by building at scale or hyperscale, as the case may be. Finally, evolving customer preferences for higher power density and lower redundancy have enabled us to drive down build costs, shrinking the denominator in the return equation. As a result, we are still able to achieve risk adjusted returns that we consider quite acceptable on hyperscale builds. The returns on our current pipeline represent a respectable spread above our cost of capital and also represent a very meaningful spread above current cap rates. Unrealized development profit margins are somewhat theoretical, since we have no intention of flipping our core holdings, but we are confident that the returns we are able to achieve on our development pipeline are creating significant value for shareholders. Let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The global economic backdrop remains quite supportive and the long-term secular trends driving data center demand seem to be gaining momentum. The Cisco Global Cloud Index forecast that the number of hyperscale data centers will nearly double by 2021. Hyperscale data centers will account for more than half of all installed data center servers by 2021 and traffic within hyperscale data centers will quadruple by 2021. Digital Realty has the heritage and design expertise to officially meet this demand. Cisco also projects that 69% of the compute and 65% of the data will be housed in hyperscale facilities, which will become the foundation for the evolution of future ecosystems. Software-as-a-Service is expected to be the most popular cloud service model over the next five years and Digital Realty's Service Exchange facilitates secure, private access to critical SaaS applications. We continue to see a healthy and growing partnership with our large multinational clients resulting in tailored data center solutions for the world's largest and most demanding customers. It is these custom solutions that continue to position Digital Realty and the Connected Campus as the standard for global growth. Multi-region deployments are growing across all sales verticals, signaling a platform effect from our largest cloud, network and enterprise buyers and further validating the Connected Campus, our full product offering and our role as an international supplier of choice for their critical infrastructure. Earlier this week, we launched support for Google Cloud's Partner Interconnect, a new service from Google Cloud that allows customers to connect to Google Cloud Platform from anywhere. Partner Interconnect provides customers with the ability to extend private on-premises networks from Digital Realty data centers to the Google Cloud Platform, reaching a broad set of public and private cloud-based service offerings. The new offering will enable our service exchange customers to reach Google Cloud Platform services in nine global metros with additional markets to be brought online later this year. The Google announcement was just one highlight of a great start to the year and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup and deliver sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, given our global platform, our comprehensive suite of power and connectivity solutions, along with our operational and financial stability. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity, here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the first quarter of $61 million, including a $7 million contribution from interconnection. This marks the fourth quarter out of the past five we've delivered bookings north of $50 million. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $54 million during the first quarter, including a $6 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the first quarter was approximately eight years. We saw robust and balanced performance of lease signs across every month in the first quarter. We are seeing strong demand from current as well as new customers and we signed 32 new logos during the quarter. Demand across cloud customers remains strong, with many of the leading global cloud service providers expanding with us. A leading Chinese cloud and technology service provider expanded with us in Ashburn just a couple of quarters after first landing with us in that market. We are pleased with our progress in the enterprise segment, landing broad and diverse customer engagements. For example, one of the world's largest media entertainment technology and content companies needed immediate access to enterprise quality data center capacity in the red-hot Northern Virginia market to support a new complex cloud-connected application. The customer cited three reasons for selecting Digital Realty; our track record of operational and financial resiliency; the quality of our product and speed of delivery, capacity when and where they needed us; and ease of contracting. And National Cancer Research Institution selected Digital Realty based on our proven track record of operational excellence as well as our interconnection solutions. Their critical business applications will be migrating from another provider and will reside within our secure campus environment in Phoenix. A leading edge personal finance company that is focused on helping everyone make financial progress has selected Digital Realty to consolidate their back-end systems and storage into higher density racks to help future proof their rapid growth. One of the world's oldest stock exchanges acquired a company in the U.S., and as a result of this acquisition required data center expansion. Digital Realty was awarded one of two North America data center deployments. MOBITV delivers live and on-demand video to any screen connecting media reliably and securely anytime anywhere on any device. The customers connected media solutions solve the complexity of delivering video across networks, operating systems and devices while managing associated rights. MOBITV chose our 250 William Street location in Atlanta to utilize the extremely highly connected 56 Marietta ecosystem as an activation point for their TV channel content to directly connect to end users. We see continued strength in our network segment. Our first quarter network wins indicate continued strong demand for scale infrastructure in the infrastructure-as-a-service subsector in addition to multi-site colocation and interconnection demand in the content delivery network, Internet service provider, and global carrier subsectors, including a major backbone expansion with one of the largest telecommunication providers in the U.S. Our strategic alliances and channel referral partner programs continue to help us drive growth and provide a source of new customers. We are gaining traction with partners who want to include our capabilities into the solutions they offer their customers. For example, partnering with Insight one of our alliance partners, helped a customer migrate from a dated architecture as part of an overall technology refresh. We were a perfect fit to offer our colocation interconnection solutions paired with Insight's IT product and service capabilities. So the customer got one comprehensive solution. With IBM, one of our first strategic alliances, we have been able to embed our capabilities across their direct win products to allow their customers to connect directly to their cloud infrastructure and cloud services. Through this partnership, we drove solutions for our customers throughout our domestic campuses and internationally during the first quarter, strengthening our ecosystem, enhancing our ability to penetrate the enterprise vertical. As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliance program to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through our referral, sell-to and sell-with partnership programs. We are pleased with the results to-date and we expect continued growth in 2018. In terms of integration, our efforts related to the DuPont Fabros merger are winding down. A number of functional areas have completed their project plans and we've made solid progress towards achieving our synergy targets, but we remain focused on closing out all remaining tasks. The outstanding items are primarily related to operations and IT activities with some IT organizational alignment intentionally delayed so as to avoid disrupting the customer experience. We have successfully completed the migration of all accounting, finance and HR related applications and we will continue to work on the customer portal consolidation and network migration through year-end. We remain on track to meet or exceed our $18 million expense synergy target and we continue to expect the bulk of our integration activities will be wrapped up during the second quarter with loose ends completely tied up by the end of the year. Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $126 million. The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements was six months reflecting largely signed for space currently under construction and scheduled for delivery later this year. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we signed $57 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over four years and cash rents on renewal leases rolled up 4% with positive cash re-leasing spreads across all product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio, most notably within the former DuPont Fabros properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018. In terms of our first quarter operating performance, as we indicated last quarter, overall portfolio occupancy dipped 100 basis points sequentially to 89.2% due to a combination of development projects placed in service along with a churn event in Boston where an enterprise customer is consolidating their data center footprint. Similar to other opportunities within our portfolio, like the space we took back in Chicago a little over a year ago, a portion of this space will be repositioned to expand our Boston colocation product offering. We also expect portfolio occupancy to rebound beginning in the second quarter, and to finish the year essentially flat at 90% and change. Turning to our economic risk mitigation on page 10. The U.S. dollar continued to soften during the first quarter and FX represented a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our first quarter results. Interest rates on the other hand continue to rise during the first quarter as shown on the bottom of the page. By way of reminder, we target variable rate debt at less than 20% of total debt outstanding. And we were at 18% as of the end of the first quarter. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets, long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have just a 1% impact on our 2018 FFO per share. We believe our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed. Turning to earnings growth on page 11. Core FFO per share was up 7% year-over-year and came in $0.06 above consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by operational outperformance and favorable FX. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range of our 2018 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Most of the drivers are unchanged except for a 100 basis point increase in the low end of the range for the same-store guidance and updated FX assumptions, partially offset by another $100 million of asset sales. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect to dip down slightly in the second and third quarters due to the timing of G&A investments and loss of NOI from recent asset sales as you can see from the bridge on page 12 before rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter as several large leases commence. We do not typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but I would like to point out that as John mentioned, the beat on the FFO line flows through to cash flow and we remain on track to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. The growth in cash flow has likewise flowed through to our distributions to shareholders and in early March, the board approved a 9% increase in the per share dividend. This marked the 13th straight year we have grown our dividend and we are pleased to be among a select group of REITs to have raised the dividend each and every year since our initial public offering in 2004. Finally, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. Net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 5.3 times at the end of the first quarter and fixed charge coverage ticked up slightly to 4.3 times. Our cost and capital structure affords us the ability to self-fund over $1 billion of development spending in 2018 largely with cash flow from operations and an assist from the asset sales, Bill mentioned earlier. As a result, we expect to maintain our target leverage and coverage levels throughout 2018 without the need for additional common equity as proceeds from asset sales are used to pay down debt, the full run rate benefit of DFT synergies are realized and our cash flows continue to grow as leases signed commenced throughout the year. As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is approximately five years and the weighted average coupon is approximately 3.4%. Over 80% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly, 100% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our asset. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: My pleasure, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. First one just regarding the pace of leasing, I think this looks like one of the best quarters I can remember. And it comes on top of, as you pointed out, two pretty strong quarters, it happens to say lumpy but healthy on page 7. But this seems like leasing has gotten much more stable over the past few quarters. And so congrats on the execution, but I'm curious will we see increased volatility going forward and if so what is the bias, would it be upward volatility or downward?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, Jordan. You know we don't give bookings guidance and I sense from your question that you're trying to obtain bookings guidance. We're not going to change our policy. But as you might imagine, we're pleased with the trajectory over the past several quarters. You're correct, this is a record quarter. We've had great volume, also a very strong mix in products, logos and geographies. If you look back over the last 12 months, bookings have been trending up and that's how we obviously would like to keep it. We're confident in the growth of the business, long term growth of the business, so I would expect that quarterly volume will follow that as the current funnel is very healthy and we are confident that we can build on our recent momentum.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just moving on to the development pipeline which seems to be gaining some momentum as well, maybe you could speak to construction costs, you're quite a sizable developer in the scheme of things and construction costs appear to be rising as a function of increased demand, but also tariffs and skilled labor demands et cetera. How do you expect these rising construction costs to manifest themselves in the data center sector in your portfolio over the next couple of years, are rents going to come up a lot, because customers can bear the increases or will returns come down, what do you think?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Let me break that question apart. So first of all, I think that because of our designs, we've been doing an excellent job of taking costs out of the product, but I will say, I think it's going to be difficult to take much more cost out without affecting the residual value of the real estate. We have put in place something called our VMI program, which stands for vendor managed inventory. We have that in place for all of our major suppliers. And what that is, is a three-year contract where we've been able to lock in pricing for major items like generators, switchgear, UPS module. And importantly, we put that in place before the tariffs were put in place. So our pricing at least for the next three years won't be affected by rising steel prices. I think the other factor that's important for everyone to keep in mind on the call is that we're the only data center company with an investment-grade balance sheet. And I think it's not just the cost of our debt, but the way Andy has managed the balance sheet that gives us a distinct competitive advantage in not only a rising rate environment but, currently, an environment that has an inverted yield curve. So most of our debt is fixed and it's been termed out for quite a period of time. We've also been able to de-risk the labor inflation that I think we will certainly see by keeping our contractors very busy and on site. It's another one of the benefits of having a global sales funnel and buying in bulk. In terms of what's going to affect data center rents, we think that's most directly affected by supply. And if you think about the barriers to entry, it's a restriction in land, which we see certainly today in Silicon Valley and we think we're going to see it in Loudoun County in a few years. In some markets, you see a NIMBY sentiment, not in my backyard. We think that higher debt costs and build costs will also represent barriers to entry. So while I don't think that, with the exception of Silicon Valley, you're necessarily going to see rent growth in the very near term. I think that you'll definitely see it over the intermediate term.
Operator: The next question will be from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. So, a question about kind of the demand that you're seeing going forward, the scale demand. And is that basically upsized requirements by traditional scale customers or are you seeing a broadening of the types of customers, either by vertical or by region, that are interested in doing most of megawatt deals? And then, following on to the last answer about the developments. The development pipeline, just given the volume and demand out there, do you feel that you're appropriately staffed or would you consider having a little bit more work-in-process to accommodate what seems to be kind of a rebound in demand back to sort of 2016 levels? Thanks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jeff, I'm going to take the first part of that question and I'll ask Andy to take the second part of it. The requirements – and I've said this on several calls, but the requirements have definitely grown larger over the last several years, but on top of that, and you mentioned in your question, the demand is also broader. It's more than just a handful of CSPs. And we're seeing it out of social media, we're seeing it out of global cloud, not just U.S.-based CSPs, we're seeing it out of the SaaS players and we're seeing it out of multinational hardware and software companies. Maybe going back to Jordan's question though on the level of bookings. We do need at least one, what I would say, major anchor transaction every quarter to hit $50 million. If we have more than one, there will definitely be upside. If we don't hit that one, there will be downside. But I would say based on the volume that we see in our pipe, I'm confident that we'll get one. But nevertheless, it's still a lumpy business and that you see that with the 4-megawatt deal that that we announced that we signed in Amsterdam this month. But I can tell you that on balance, we're very encouraged by both the breadth and the depth of demand and we're looking forward to what the balance of this year has in store for us. Andy, why don't you take the second question of Jonathan's?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So your question related to appropriately stocking the development pipeline. It's obviously a very fine line as that we've seen from our competitors and we've experienced first-hand here at Digital in the history of our company. I would say we have a very robust capital planning function with a regular cadence, and we're doing our best to line up the supply and demand as the best we can. I think we do have some competitive advantages on many fronts. When you have a large installed customer base that is looking to grow in those markets with a preference to grow in adjacency to their existing loads, I think that translates into incremental wins that it's harder for a new competitor or a smaller provider to really attack. If you look at our pipeline in total, it's almost 130 megs, north of 40% pre-leased. That's obviously book ended by some speculative development capacity and also fully pre-leased activity. If you just look at Northern Virginia, which is north of 60 megawatts and that's north of 60% pre-leased, I can tell you that remaining, call it, 23 megawatts, 24 megawatts that isn't preleased, we're almost playing Tetris with the customers in terms of lining their timelines to move in with our delivery schedules. So, we're definitely tiptoeing that fine line and I think we have the right balance for right now.
Operator: The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. One, with the DuPont integration largely behind you, I was curious about your appetite for M&A, particularly with some news out there that there could be some assets that are out there for sale, including some in, I guess, Brazil. And then secondly, your – what is it – your retention ratio was 58%, I believe, in your disclosures. That's below where it's typically been. I was wondering if you could just provide some color as to what's behind and then what your expectations going forward would be. Thank you.
Scott E. Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Colby. Scott here. I'll take the first part of that question. Yes, we continue to look for other M&A opportunities. As you know, we're looking at everything that's out there or even not out there on the market. As always, we're focused on opportunities that have some strategic value to us, but as always, we are going to be good stewards of our shareholder capital and be disciplined as we pursue those opportunities.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Colby, just add to that, though. When you look at where the share prices are today and the multiples, they're obviously down from where they were a quarter or two. And that on the margin may make M&A less likely. And I think you couple that with where some of the recent trades occurred, which were at fairly lofty valuations. And I think that might argue that there would be less M&A near-term. Andy, do you want to pick up the second part of that question?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So I think you were pointing to the retention assuming just on the Scale TKF product, sub-60%. That was largely related to some churn. I think we'd called out a call a quarter or two ago in the Boston market an enterprise customer that was looking to consolidate some capacity. Now not all churn I would say is a bad thing. That provides an opportunity to take back space and re-productize that larger footprint into a colocation offering and expand our capabilities in the Boston market in particular. By and large, other than the episodic customer moving from here and there, we do have some positive churn events where customer is just outgrowing a traditional colocation environment and wants to grow with us on a campus. So a customer moving from one part of their portfolio to another can actually be a positive event. And on the colo side, the other major product domain, we actually had, maybe not record, but very high retention, low churn this quarter call it north of 90% retention on those capacity.
Operator: The question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks very much. So you talked about the healthy pipeline a few times. Are you seeing any benefit from tax reform in terms of IM enterprise spending on expansion? Any more confidence there or is that something that you think might feather in later in the year? And on the hyper-scale side of it, is there any change in the mix between what they're self-performing, doing themselves versus what they are using you or others for in terms of outsourcing to build? Thanks.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey Simon, it's Dan Papes, thanks for the question. From the pipeline perspective, you're right. As we've termed it here in our discussion today, it's very healthy. We're really pleased with it. We're pleased with the second quarter, and as we take a look at the remainder of the year. We really can't trace any of it directly back to tax reform. It may be a small factor in there, but there is nothing obvious about the demand we're seeing from enterprise or the CSPs related to tax reform. We like to think it's just a great job being done by our sales team, but no really there's just no trace back to that that we see. I'll let Andy take the second question. Thanks, Simon.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. In terms of do-it-yourself versus seeking a professional provider like the Digital Realty, I think by and large we've seen more of a trend from even very highly sophisticated, well-capitalized technology customers to come to a Digital especially in the major markets where we have full product offering in terms of space power and also on the connectivity side and where we have land holdings to allow for their business to grow for years to come. I can just look at the mix of our largest signings across the portfolio that we had several signs this quarter that were in the 2 megawatt to 3 megawatt size, several in the 4 megawatt to 6 megawatt. I think 6 megawatt was the highest, in total 6.5 megawatt. And it was from a smattering of customers, different customers, U.S. multinationals, top five cloud service providers, other large sophisticated enterprises that could have the ability to build their own data center and they've come to us for our capabilities in the global platform we deliver to them.
Operator: The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Couple things if I could. One is, if you go back to, I think it was slide 4 in the deck. You shaded the core-plus range of 9% to 12% for developing yield. And I'm curious how that fits into the current year guidance for developing yields of 10% to 12%? And what does this say about the future direction of the aggregate development yields for the Digital portfolio?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. This is Andy. I think the genesis of this chart was really to try to provide an illustrative view as to incremental risk takes on incremental reward and not an effort to change our guidance table, which we reiterated on the 10% to 12% for unlevered cash returns on our $1 billion of development spend. I think we obviously tilt towards the 10% when projects are de-risked. De-risk can happen from significant amount of pre-leasing or activity, and we tilt towards the higher end of that range when there's more risk in the equation.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to clarify just a lot of questions on the bookings. But, Bill, you mentioned feeling comfortable hitting the $15 million range assuming you get at least one anchor tenant, it sounds like 6.5% was the biggest for this quarter. So I mean is that what you mean when you're referring to an anchor tenant, something in that 5 megawatt or 6 megawatt deal size? And then second question is more on the dispositions. I know they're non-core, so maybe not a great read through for the rest of the value of the portfolio. But just curious if you could give some commentary on the California data centers that were 100% leased that traded at pretty high cap rate?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I mean we take a look on that deal that you mentioned, the $6 million deal, keep in mind that there was shell associated with that which will likely lead to some additional improved data center space that will be leased over time. But, yes, that's fair. Andy, you want to handle the asset sale question?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Actually, Scott, do you want to hit the dispose?
Scott E. Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I can nail that. Those assets were out in the, call it, the Sacramento market which is a non-core market, so not as robust a demand from the potential investors or buyers out there. Also one of those assets was a little challenged with some structural vacancy there which kind of led towards that higher yield on that.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And, Vin, I think in summary, it's a continuation of the capital recycling program that really under Bill in Scott's leadership started years back to kind of exit markets, exit non-core assets and redeploy that capital at better returns into the core portfolio.
Operator: The next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. So just curious on Europe, obviously the industry is seeing some strong growth there. Any thoughts on why not spending some capital and trying to be more aggressive in that market? How should we think about that going forward?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Frank. This is Andy. I can take that one. So I think we're doing a very good job at executing in Europe and timing is everything because the example we mentioned on the call, a very sizable customer landed in Amsterdam with us in our Scale campus. It was a legacy DFT relationship we were able to grow internationally and we thought it was going to land during the quarter and it popped over into the next month. And on the backs, I think though there's been a tremendous amount of activity in a few other markets outside of Amsterdam. In Frankfurt, where we've delivered our first campus offering 6 megawatts. We're moving well along in terms of landing an anchor customer with the top-five global service provider. And turning to London, I know the team is working on a, call it, a 600 kilowatt or so deal on the enterprise vertical as well as some demand coming out of our Asia Pacific sales team looking to land in the London market. So the timing of our inventory coming online seem to be quite fortuitous in terms of an increase in demand backdrop. And we think we have the right capacity, and if this continues, like we've seen in the very end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, I think that would point to continue to put investment into Europe.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, I just wanted to follow-up on the SG&A line. It really dropped dramatically quarter-to-quarter. How much is this just seasonal? Is this the new base level? And is it going to rebound through the year or is there something else going on there? And then I have one follow-up?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Richard. Thanks for that question. The answer to your question is yes and yes. It did step down partly due to seasonal in terms of bonus accruals. As we know our numbers and performance close to the end of the year. That number will ratchet up a little bit in the third and fourth quarters, and you can kind of look at that similar trend in past third and fourth quarters. We also were carrying in the G&A some head count and some non-comp expense associated with our DFT acquisition that has been winding down on both of those fronts. And we do think, it will step back up, as some of our G&A investments, be it our IT systems, our investment in the sales and marketing department, sales engineering and our overall IT department, as we work on finalizing our integrations and invest the team, similar to the comments we made at our Investor Day in the beginning of December, really to spend not massive dollars but amount in the budget to fuel growth in the business. So I do think they'll pick up in the back half of the year.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then looking at the supplemental, it seems like on the lease expiration things were pushed out. It might be a subtle difference, but just wanted to be able to ask about it. Have you been working to kind of extend out customers and it maybe is not something that you can just point out on a big level, but it seems like a lot of the 2018 and 2019 expirations have been pushed out. Is there something there that we should be aware of?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say we're always looking to push out customer contracts and having customers contracting with us for longer terms at fair and rising rates. So we did about $57 million of renewals. I don't think that was a record renewal quantity for us. The weighted average renewal term on the TKF which is the larger dollar longer term stuff, let's call it five years. And, no, we obviously keep chopping through our renewals every year. I think we're taking a very much a holistic approach with our global customer base and using those installed, embedded relationships and contracts to come to mutually beneficial outcomes and package more business together and use that installed customer base as a competitive advantage that helps our customers more than some of our competitors can.
Operator: The next question will be from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC: Thanks. Hey, guys. I noticed the base building construction pipeline increased by a fair amount this quarter. Can you provide some color on that?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: My gut, Lukas, is – that's on the developments-type pipeline that's really largely driven by some of the activity in Northern Virginia. And like I said, we've got, call it 23 megawatts that are as of the quarter were unleased and we're working fast and furiously and bringing on incremental shelves because we'll be quickly through building out on that campus, at least the first phase of it. We also – something I should mention. We also had in the prior quarter there was a shell that was not there that we brought online because the customer signed a lease for the entirety of a shell like in 36 megawatts, including initial take of 6 megawatts within it as well on a long-term basis. So that kind of speaks to the activity in that market, in particular that customers are in large amounts moving to fully contracts when we're literally looking at dirt and explain design very quickly.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC: That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. The straight line rent line item, looks like it's up a little bit over the last couple of quarters. And is that just driven by free rent on recent lease signings or what's kind of driving that line item?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I think there was something in the prior quarter that deflated that adjustment. It was episodic maybe on the leasehold side. I would say with signing more longer-term deals with escalators is going to certainly continue to widen that gap between your GAAP rent and your cash rent. So that would probably be another attributor to the widening of that number. But relatively I would say fairly small adjustment because I would say that the delta between our FFO and AFFO is relatively narrow speaking to the quality of our earnings.
Operator: The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, we haven't seen much power-based building for quite a while, and it turned up again this quarter. I was wondering, especially based on the comment you made, I think, answering the last question, does this indicate anything about the customer view? Why is this suddenly coming back into the picture? Is it a positive read on demand? And similarly, in Asia Pacific, you had significant Turn-Key leasing. I was wondering if you could provide some greater color on location and the context for that.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rob. Thanks for the question. So, I do think the data point you pointed out does point to a trend we're seeing in the business as these large either top five cloud service providers, other hyperscalers are seeing a long-term growth trend in their business. And they're looking to lock up capacity in large quantities, knowing that they'll grow into it over time. In that example, they took down the entire shell and rented that from us – or upon delivery, they will rent it from us, and then took one suite and then will grow into that suite – the full shell over time. I think that's something not necessarily identical structures, but I think that many of our large and growing customers are thinking long-term about the growth in their business. And this is just one way to tackle it. Turning to Asia, I would say, I just spent some time over there with our team over there who's incredibly talented and had some great success with the local customer base. And really, it's been about a bit of an import/export business and I don't say that in jest, but it's bringing those local customers into the data centers in Singapore where we had significant pick up in leasing with the new logo on a large-scale deal. And it's also setting that same demand to other parts of the Digital Realty portfolio. And I'm thinking particularly of some of the Chinese customers where they've sent that demand into North America on both coasts and also tracking deals, as I mentioned earlier, in the European market with that same profile of customer. So, overall, great progress from the team in Asia-Pacific in the last handful of quarters, actually.
Operator: The next question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I was hoping to drill down a bit further into rent changes that you're seeing at renewal. More specifically, if we slice your Turn-Key portfolio different ways, like older facilities versus newer facilities or Internet gateways versus corporate facilities or higher resiliency versus lower resiliency, are there differences in what you see at renewal or would you characterize them as fairly similar across the board? And then second, I was just hoping you give us an update on some of the customer service initiatives you're undertaking and if you're starting to see any benefit in the result?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Hey, Nick, I'll tackle the first one, and I'll toss it out to team to talk about on the customer service side. We have a table in the back of our financial supp, it's either page 20 or 21 or 22, that really breaks out the product offerings. I would say the outcome of our expirations in terms of cash mark-to-market is driven by the product offering. It's driven by the customer profile. And as you can see on that, the bulk of our Internet gateways, as you've mentioned, fall within our colocation footprint. And that's not exclusively, but you see that we had 3.5% cash mark-to-markets, all with 90% retention. And if you move to the Turn-Key Flex, which is typically a little bit larger scale, definitely approaching the multiple megawatts in terms of expirations and renewals, that was closer to 4%. It's those colocation product offerings, those Internet gateways are typically incredibly network customer dense, limited capacity, maybe the most challenging type of capacity to move to a new provider. But both, by and large, have had kind of cycled through some peak vintage leases and turned into positive in the last couple of quarters. The other thing I want to touch on real quickly is, we really try to take a holistic customer approach, agnostic to product, and try to bring as many pieces of business, be it a network node in an Internet gateway, a scale renewal in one of our campuses, business in North America or Asia or Europe, and bring that in a holistic fashion to the customer and bring more to the table than just a transactional experience, which we think is a win for the customer in terms of delivering more value, and we think it's a win for Digital. And that often how we treat that customer at the renewal and those economic equations may flow through with a little bit softer or positive cash mark-to-market, but may also translate into more signings in the portfolio near-term and in the future. Maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about the customer service initiative.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Nick, for the question. We look at our performance over the last few quarters and our confidence in the pipeline right now. I think your question on customer services is quite valid to ask because we feel like it's making a significant difference in the demand pipeline that we're seeing from our customers. We have customer success managers deployed across our client base. We've invested in that role inside the company so that we stay close to our existing customers, while the sales team is out building new pipeline and we have very, very positive feedback from our customers in regard to that. We mentioned previously our Digital Delivers Program, which basically when a customer has feedback for us they just click a hyperlink at the bottom of any of our emails and get a response in 24 hours, and very positive feedback on that. We've talked about the focus on cultural changes and customer centricity in the company. That's making a big difference for us as well. And then, finally to say again, the executive sponsor program where all of us are getting out into the field and spending time with our clients, understanding what their strategic and tactical needs are, makes us really well informed leadership team and able to much more effectively make decisions that end up in, we believe, much happier customers and repeat customers. That's working well for us.
Operator: And the next question will come from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. Could you give us more color on why interconnection grew around 7% 1Q 2018? And just in the context of just your performance in the quarter, can you give us a little more color on that? And also after that, a second part to that is, could you give us more color on the work you're doing with Megaport, considering you actually invested another $5 million in a follow-on equity offering? And I could go from there.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Sami. Maybe I'll just touch on the interconnection revenue on the signings and the full tour on the P&L and then I'll toss over to Chris Sharp, our CTO to add on to that and also give some commentary on the Megaport question you had. So it was a little bit lower – on the signings front obviously a step-up versus the prior quarter but still not at a level that we're completely satisfied with. I can't tell you, I'd pointed to something specific episodic on the signings. I often look at it the interconnection signings kind of hand-in-hand with the colocation signings where the bulk of that connectivity is being serviced. And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, while not at peak number were down, call it, just north of 10%. I attribute that largely to our pipeline and execution around some larger colocation deals. So sub megawatt, I call it 200 kilowatts, 300 kilowatts, 400 kilowatts, 500 kilowatts. And another dynamic going on there is some – the lines are blurring a little bit between our products in terms of colocation and scale and some of those type deals have actually fallen outside of the colo product into a scale TKF suite. We actually saw a tick up, close to 14% or about 0.5 megawatt for sub 600 kilowatt deals that landed outside of colo. A prime example of that was a large telecommunication company that landed with us I think in nine locations and about half were in product types colo and half were outside product types colo. But net-net I think it's good news because our breadth of product allows us to capture that and I think the pipeline for some of the larger colo deals, which should have additional connectivity in the ensuing quarters is looking pretty strong. But maybe I'll open it up to Chris to add on to that or touch on the Megaport question as well.
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. And Sami, yeah, you're are absolutely correct. We're very happy with the partnership that we have in place with Megaport today. It's a very unique partnership out in the market. One of the things that we always emphasize is that the core component to our overall service exchange which some of the key highlights are on the service exchange is, it's really changing the dialogue that we're having with customers today and allowing us to really remove a lot of complexity from their deployments and allowing them to stand up their hybrid cloud architectures and one customer in point after – in most recently win in this last quarter is Netgain. They are a cloud IT provider delivering cloud hosting and managed services for healthcare and financial vertical. It's really the service exchange is allowing them to provide a much more dynamic environment for their customers in accessing the Microsoft Azure cloud. And then lastly, I mean, one of the reasons that Netgain came to Digital is the fact that they're able to provide a more robust, very performance aware deployment and be able to access a set of future cloud services which allows them to really broaden their horizons and leverage a future set of cloud services across that exchange. And that's where, one of the reasons why we picked Megaport to partner with is that not only their work, but our conjoined working going to market allows us to really solve a very differentiated part of the market and the fact that we've been able to accelerate the launch of the service exchange into most recently Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London due to the customer demand because of the fact that we have all the top five cloud providers on that platform. So, that's including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, Oracle and IBM. So it's really allowing us to have a value based dialogue with our customer base. So we're very happy with the partnership we have in place with Megaport and we look to continue to expand the service exchange functionality across our portfolio.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we continue to execute on the integration of DuPont Fabros capitalizing on the value of the installed customer base to realize revenue synergies reaching record high bookings and backlog. We also delivered very solid current financial results being in consensus and raising guidance. Three of the sustainable growth in our earnings has flowed through to cash flow, as well as our distributions to shareholders. And our board recently approved a 9% increase in the per share dividend making this the 13th straight year that we've given shareholders a raise on the dividend. We achieved this growth in our distributions to shareholders while preserving our best-in-class balance sheet which we believe is a critical differentiator, particularly in a rising rate environment. Last but not least our board has approved a resolution giving shareholders the right to propose binding amendments to our bylaws. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and we hope to see many of you at NAREIT in June.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. First of all, we came in $0.04 ahead of the high end of our initial 2017 guidance range, driven by operational outperformance within both the legacy DFT and Digital Realty portfolios. Second, we've landed over 30 megawatts within the legacy DFT portfolio over the past five months, capitalizing on the value of the installed customer base to realize revenue synergies in addition to hitting our expense synergy targets. Third, we expect to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. Last but not least, we expect to achieve this growth while maintaining our target leverage and self-funding our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today on page two of our presentation with a recap of the principles that we laid out at our Investor Day in December. We've set ambitious growth targets over the next several years, and we expect to achieve them from a global connected sustainable framework. What that really means is further leveraging our leading global platform to cross-sell, in addition to addressing new markets that meet our risk adjusted return criteria. Our top priority is deepening our connections with customers to position us to meet their needs and support their growth. In addition, we are focused on further strengthening connections across the organization making sure that processes are streamlined, systems are integrated and people are performing efficiently. We are committed to sustainability and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let's turn to our recent investment activity on page 3. As you know, we entered Tokyo, a longtime target for us during the fourth quarter through a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. We contributed our recently completed project in Osaka, and Mitsubishi contributed two existing data centers in Tokyo. Japan is a highly strategic market and we see tremendous opportunity for growth over the next several years. We expect this joint venture will significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers' data center needs in Japan. In particular, we expect that Mitsubishi's global brand recognition and local enterprise expertise will meaningfully improve our ability to penetrate local demand. We also closed on the acquisition of a data center in Chicago from a private REIT during the fourth quarter for $315 million. This value add-play offers a healthy going in yield along with shell capacity that gives us an opportunity to boost the unlevered return up into the high single-digits. The investment represents an expansion in a core market and is occupied by existing Digital Realty customers with whom we had been independently working to meet their expansion requirements in Chicago. Separately, we closed on the sale of two non-core assets at a 7.1% cap rate generating a little over $70 million in net proceeds. And we recognized gains of approximately $27 million during the fourth quarter. Since year-end, we've sold two more non-core assets generating net proceeds of a little less than $90 million and we expect to recognize gains of approximately $25 million during the first quarter. Since embarking on our capital recycling program a little over three years ago, we have now sold a total of 14 assets generating over $500 million of net proceeds and recognizing sizable gains in the process. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets. We believe that culling the asset base is prudent real estate portfolio management and we expect to generate up to another $100 million of proceeds from asset sales in 2018. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. Data center construction crews remain active across the primary data center metros, particularly in Northern Virginia. However, some context may be in order. It's helpful to remember that according to CBRE, the Northern Virginia data center inventory is larger than the total data center stock in any country in either Europe or Asia Pacific. As a result, while the absolute number of megawatts under construction may be big, we are very comfortable with our development exposure, as well as the pace of absorption in Northern Virginia, especially in the context of such a deep and active market with vacancy hovering in the low single digits. In fact, those of you who saw the Ashburn time lapse video at our Investor Day in December will be aware that we expect all the developable land in Loudoun County will be fully built out in the coming years. We believe our strategic landholdings represent a precious commodity and a key competitive advantage. Very few markets around the world operate at such a well-oiled cadence as Northern Virginia. For instance, there has been very limited inventory available in Silicon Valley for over a year, so recent leasing velocity has slowed considerably pending the arrival of new deliveries. In Europe, demand is likewise robust, and 2017 was a record year for net absorption. Our participation was somewhat limited largely due to a lack of available inventory. We have recently brought capacity online in Amsterdam and London, and we expect to deliver additional capacity in the Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam in the first quarter to position us to capture a greater share of the strong current demand in Europe. Across the Asia Pacific region demand remains robust, particularly from the global hyperscale players. The supply situation varies considerably by market. The local markets tend to be dominated by large telcos, and there's generally a shortage of institutional quality modern data center stock. The region is highly fragmented with very few pan-regional offerings. The limited available options for state-of-the-art carrier neutral facilities across multiple markets plays directly to our competitive advantages. In addition to our deliveries, competitors are also bringing supply online to meet this demand, but the rapid pace of absorption is keeping vacancy rates below equilibrium in the single-digits. In sum, competition remains intense, particularly for larger requirements. And given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears careful watching. However, current vacancy rates are tight and we expect demand will continue to outstrip supply, while barriers to entry are beginning to emerge in select metros, which bodes well for long term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of infill portfolios such as ours. Now let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The biggest change over the last 90 days has been tax reform. We expect minimal impact on our financials from the specific provisions of the tax reform bill, but we do believe it will be good for our customers businesses. And as a result, it should bode well for data center demand. We saw very healthy growth from our customer base during the fourth quarter. The three leading cloud service providers each generated over $5 billion in cloud revenue during the fourth quarter alone, all growing at a very healthy clip well into the double digits. The top seven cloud providers all generated over $1 billion of cloud revenue in the fourth quarter. This broad based growth plays directly to the strengths of our carrier neutral, cloud neutral platform. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that we would be offering private connections to the Oracle Cloud in 14 major metros and a total of 59 data centers through our Service Exchange. Similar to other leading cloud providers, Oracle maintains a significant presence in numerous locations across multiple regions within our global portfolio. This recent announcement demonstrates the value proposition to our joint customers by giving them the ability to connect directly, privately and securely to a public cloud compute engine that sits right next to their private cloud environment within the same campus environment, reinforcing one of the key differentiators of our offering. The relevance of this capability was reinforced by the RightScale 2018 State of the Cloud Report published earlier this week, which found that on average companies are using about five public and private clouds. Separately, the Cisco Global Cloud Index forecasts that the number of hyperscale data centers will nearly double by 2021. Hyperscale data centers will account for more than half of all installed data center servers by 2021, and traffic within hyperscale data centers will quadruple by 2021. The opportunity to serve this rapidly growing segment of the market on a global scale meshes well with our competencies. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand set-up given our global platform, our comprehensive product offering, and our investment grade balance sheet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the fourth quarter of $56 million including a $6 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $50 million during the fourth quarter, including a $9 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the fourth quarter was approximately seven years. Our fourth quarter wins continue to showcase the strengths of our global platform, as well as the demand for our multiproduct offering from both new digital economy customers, as well as more traditional enterprises. A leading Internet hyperscale user further expanded its footprint with us taking down another 12 megawatts in Ashburn and underscoring the value of the installed customer base and the relationships inherited through the DFT transaction. We also won a sizable new logo deployment from a significant online multiplayer game creation platform further diversifying our customer base in Northern Virginia. Additionally, a primary global provider of financial market data and analytics grew with us in the tri-state area citing our operational effectiveness and our relationships with many of their subscribers. Finally, not that all roads lead to Ashburn, but it's certainly been a lynchpin of our ability to sell to an international customer base across four global theaters. Ashburn twofers during the fourth quarter included an expansion with a large Chinese cloud service provider on our newest Ashburn campus. A top five cloud service provider expanded with us not just in Ashburn, but also in Sydney. And we also expanded a European SaaS provider in Sydney in addition to their inaugural deployment back in Ashburn. Combined colocation and connectivity signings rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. One of the world's largest telecommunications companies expanded in four locations across North America. A leading provider of integrated telecommunications services in Latin America expanded with us in one of our lower Manhattan Internet gateways demonstrating that the critical connectivity points in our portfolio will continue to drive regionally diverse demand. Finally, on the enterprise front, one of America's oldest theater company selected Digital Realty as their trusted data center provider for all of their mission critical applications. Of the record 51 new logos added during the fourth quarter, nearly 19% were sourced through our North American and European colocation platforms, including 13 in Europe, likewise a regional high mark. Roughly half of these new logos were within the network sector, including a nationwide managed service provider, a cable provider and a computer software company; roughly half were enterprise, including an artificial intelligence platform, an online trading community, and a content provider. The breadth and diversity of this new business should serve to drive new end users to the connectivity ecosystems and bodes well for future interconnection revenue growth given the historical correlation between new logos and interconnection bookings in subsequent periods. Our partners and alliance capabilities delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year of 2017, we achieved significant growth compared to the prior year due to the establishment of an alliance partner framework in addition to our focus and execution against our existing partner programs. We also provided our partners a set of standardized colocation and connectivity rate cards to make it easier for them to include us in their menu of services. These programs effectively extend our reach to serve enterprise customer demand for comprehensive solutions through various leading IT services, network and cloud service providers. Through our recently announced partnership with Oracle, we've significantly expanded our customers' ability to connect to the Oracle Cloud through private dedicated access to Oracle Cloud infrastructure in 14 major metro areas and 59 Digital Realty data centers through our Connected Campus and Service Exchange interconnection platform. Through our continued partnership with IBM and leveraging Direct Link capabilities, we have been able to provide customers and IBM business partners direct access to the IBM Cloud in 20 data centers across nine global metros. These capabilities have allowed us to deploy a standardized hybrid colocation set of solutions sold with a direct dual fiber connection to the IBM Cloud platform that provides extremely low latency and highly secure access to the IBM Cloud. As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances programs to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through our referral, sell-to and sell-with partnership programs. We are pleased with the results to-date and we expect greater contributions in 2018. Our current partners and customers continue to see the value of our focus on working with quality solution and service providers to create a comprehensive IT solution offering and capabilities. In terms of integration, we made significant progress over the past several months and we are nearing the finish line in many respects. As of year-end, all former DFT employees have been on boarded onto the Digital Realty benefits platform and we have finalized the HRIS and payroll system conversions. At the property level, we completed the rebranding of all former DFT assets and we are wrapping up final security upgrades to bring all properties up to Digital Realty standards. We have completed alignment of onsite assets and equipment and we are finalizing the migration of the legacy DFT computerized maintenance management system onto our new platform. The systems integration is progressing well and the migration of accounting, finance and HR-related applications have all been completed. We expect to finish the network integration in the second quarter of 2018. The marketing team completed the rebranding of all customer-facing collateral and transitioned the DFT digital and social properties to DLR. All the acquired properties are now showcased on our website and we've added material to conform to our corporate standards. We remain on track to meet or exceed our $18 million expense synergy target and we still expect the vast majority of integration activities will be wrapped up by mid-year. Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $116 million. The step up from $106 million last quarter reflects the $50 million of space and power leases signed, offset by $38 million of commencements and a $2 million delta due to the contribution of our recently completed development project in Osaka to the joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements was eight months reflecting large leases signed for space currently under construction and scheduled for delivery later this year. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we retained 76% of fourth quarter lease expirations and we signed $64 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over four years and cash rents on renewal leases rolled up 2.3% with positive cash re-leasing spreads across product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio most notably within the former Dupont Fabros properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash for leasing spreads for the full year in 2018. On balance, however, we continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expiration. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 60 basis points sequentially to 90.2% due to development projects placed in service in Ashburn and Dallas along with a churn event in Phoenix, where an IT systems integrator lost their end user customer contract and let their lease with us lapse their expiration. We do expect portfolio occupancy to dip below 90% in the first quarter of 2018 likewise due to a combination of development projects placed in service in Ashburn, Toronto, Silicon Valley and London, along with a churn event in Boston, where an enterprise customer is consolidating their data center footprint. Similar to other opportunities within our portfolio, like the space we took back in Chicago a year ago, this space will be repositioned to expand our Boston colocation product offering. However, we also expect portfolio occupancy to rebound beginning in the second quarter, and to finish the year essentially flat at 90% and change. The U.S. dollar continued to soften during the fourth quarter and FX represented a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our fourth quarter results. Interest rates on the other hand, begin to rise during the fourth quarter as shown on page 10. We target variable rate debt at less than 20% of total debt outstanding and we were at 14% as of year-end. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 1% impact to our 2018 FFO per share. In addition, although the 10-year benchmark may have backed up considerably over the past five months, our credit spreads have actually compressed meaningfully over the past two years as you can see depicted on the chart at the bottom of page 10. As a result, from an all-in cost of borrowing perspective, our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed. Turning to earnings growth on page 11. Core FFO per share grew more than 8% compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year of 2017, core FFO per share grew a little over 7% and came in $0.04 above the high end of our initial guidance range. Aside from updating the low end of the range for asset sales close to-date in the first quarter, our 2018 guidance is essentially unchanged from the initial outlook we rolled out just over a month ago. In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first half of 2018 should represent approximately 48% of the full year results, while the second half should contribute roughly 52%. In other words, the fourth quarter should represent a pretty good run rate for the first half of the year with a step-up in the second half. We don't typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but I would like to point out that recurring CapEx was up a little over $10 million sequentially during the fourth quarter. The biggest portion of the higher spend in the fourth quarter was one-time in nature related to value add activities at a non-core suburban office building in the Bay Area that was sold recently and this investment more than recouped. As a result, we now expect to deliver double digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the low AFFO payout ratio along with the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Finally, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 12. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 6 times at the end of the third quarter to 5.2 times at year end and fixed charge coverage improved from just under 4 times in the third quarter to 4.2 times in the fourth quarter. As you may recall, leverage was somewhat overstated in the third quarter since all the debt related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition was on the balance sheet as of September 30, but the third quarter P&L included just a 17 day contribution from the DFT assets. We expect levers to gradually improve over the course of 2018 as the full run rate benefit of DFT synergies are realized, and our cash flows continue to grow as signed leases commence throughout the year. It's important to note that our cost and capital structure affords us the ability to self-fund over $1 billion of development spending in 2018, largely with cash flow from operations and an assist from the asset sales Bill mentioned earlier. As a result, we expect to maintain our target leverage and coverage levels throughout 2018 without the need for additional common equity. As you can see from the chart on page 12, the weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately six years, and the weighted average coupon is just under 3.5%. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a potentially rising rate environment. And nearly 100% percent of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 12, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we would be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Certainly, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. My question, I wanted to harken back to the Investor Day commentary. Bill, you talked about the opportunity to take share on the leasing front going forward, recognizing that the market cap of DLR was larger in proportion relative to the leasing overall versus peers. And I just wonder a couple of months later if you could maybe take stock a little bit and talk about the measures you've implemented and what kind of progress you're making? And then maybe offer a little bit of context in terms of that progress around one of your large competitors, peers in the space coming into the hyperscale build business and one of the former CEOs announcing they're launching a new platform in the business?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Jordan. First of all, I assume you're referring to Tom Ray with your last point.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah, Tom Ray and Equinix.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Right.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Not too difficult.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We have the highest regard for Tom, we welcome him back to the space. He is what I would call an absolutely rational competitor. I think, he's been a responsible steward of investors' capital and a great allocator of capital. So he's the type of person that we like to see coming into this space. But back to Investor Day, the steps that we outlined at that time were the executive sponsor program, a number of investments in customer success, as well as a streamlining of our underwriting and contract approval – contract negotiation process. And I can tell you that during the fourth quarter, two-thirds of our fourth quarter wins involved an executive sponsor. So, I think that part of the program is working quite well. On the commercial side, the legal and commercial teams have worked very hard to put standard forms in place with quite a few of our customers, most of the major customers, and that's made it much easier to execute business with us, with very minimal additional negotiation. In fact 90% of the fourth quarter scale business was done with this type of arrangement in place. So we're very encouraged by what I'd say are the early results, but we recognize that there's always room for improvement, but importantly, I think in terms of the benefits of doing business with Digital, clearly the global platform is quite important, anchored by irreplaceable gateways. We've got our comprehensive product offering from a single cabinet all the way up to hyperscale. And I think without – our investment grade balance sheet is without peer. And I think that's clearly very important in terms of minimizing counterparty risk for these firms that are signing up for long term with us to lease their mission critical facilities. So, I think this – once again this sets us up quite well for capturing what we think is going to be not only additional share, but a rising tide of demand in 2018.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then – it's helpful. And then as a follow-up maybe for Scott, I'd just be interested in his thoughts on the capital that seems to be cramming its way into this space. Your balance sheet is good for sure, but is there an opportunity beyond these non-core assets that you've sold to opportunistically monetize some of your stabilized assets, just seeing the multiples being paid in the high-20 times EBITDA or what have you for certain assets. Is there an opportunity here for Digital?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, Jordan, that's an interesting question and I do agree with you, there's sort of awful lot of capital coming in market, and clearly we're seeing some pretty big valuations out there. We're going to take a deep dive in our portfolio a little later this year and we're going to look at non-core assets, non-core markets, underperforming assets, assets which may become at risk for underperforming. But I think your point is good, and part of that would be looking at assets where essentially we've created all the value we can create and would it make more sense to redeploy that capital somewhere else in our portfolio. And as you know we've done that before with a joint venture that we put together with Pru several years ago. So, I think, it would be reasonable for us to bear that in mind as we review the portfolio later this year.
Operator: The next question will be from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. So following a bit on Scott's comment about valuations, I mean, the Infomart deal announced yesterday points to a pretty attractive cap rate, and I just wonder to what extent do you see that as being transferable to your Internet gateway assets? And anything you're seeing out there in terms of the valuations around regular turnkey product to be kind of interested in your perspective? Thanks.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. We think it's entirely applicable to the – to our Internet gateways. It's a – Infomart is a great asset, highly strategic, little more so for Equinix I think than others. And I think they are in a good position to add value there, but you're right, I mean, we can all kind of sort out what that multiple is there, and if you look at those multiples and apply that to our Internet gateways, I think, you're getting out some rather full valuations on that. As it relates to other assets out there, we've seen a compression in cap rates. I mean, clearly the Infomart multiple relates to these kind of highly strategic Internet gateways, but we've seen cap rates in general come down and compress. There used to be a lot more differentiation across product types and – of assets and they're getting a lot closer. I think that bandwidth is maybe 100 basis points or 150 basis points wide, where it used to be more like 300 basis points wide for kind of the more traditional assets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's very helpful. And then with your major global peer kind of going hyper-scale, getting more into kind of wide area connectivity, I just sort of wanted to maybe get an update on the flip side in terms of your retail initiatives, Megaport partnership and anything else that is kind of worth highlighting that maybe Andy and Bill didn't capture in the scripts? Thanks.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. We're absolutely committed to the retail colo business. In the fourth quarter we had 51 new logos, fully 90% of those came through colocation, half from network and half from enterprise. And since we acquired Telx, we've doubled our megawatt capacity, committed to the colo product, we're up to 92 megawatts and that's both organically and through acquisitions. We plan to launch our colo business in Asia-Pac later this year. But I will say that we're definitely seeing a convergence of strategies and we can see that with the Equinix announcement today with customers and competitors recognize the value of interconnected scale, our offering of the full menu of options from a single rack to multiple megawatts along with the ability to connect directly, privately and securely from the enterprise customers' private cloud instance to a public cloud compute engine in order for there to be relevance to their hybrid cloud architecture. So, we think the colocation product is a very important element of our comprehensive product offering. And we're going to continue to invest in this business to support our customers' needs.
Operator: The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. You did $199 million in annualized revenue in bookings or leasing in 2017 with two strong quarters in the last two quarters. Based on what you're seeing, well, I appreciate that bookings could jump quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter, I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the momentum that you're seeing and what your expectations are for 2018? Do you think you could be above the $199 million in 2018? And then secondly, CapEx when you gave your guidance earlier this year for the $900 million to $1.1 billion, that was meaningfully below what we were anticipating, that was already – and we had already been modelling something less than what if you just simply added DFT and DLR together. Can you just talk about your confidence that this is the right number of CapEx and the risk that we could find yourself in a year from now that you're undersupplied with inventory? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Colby. This is Andy, I'll try to take the – start the first half of the first one, maybe add – Dan, chime in as well. So kind of just speaking to our most recent fourth quarter, overall we thought this is great results in terms overall robustness in volume, in terms of diversity by customer, geography and product line. We had numerous customers expanding with us as you heard in the script, we had numerous customer signed in multiple geographic regions. Are – the biggest signing was into the legacy DFT portfolio, for all we made up about 25% of all the signings, so 75% of the signings were in legacy Digital portfolio, and as Bill just mentioned a second ago, 51 new logos which was a new record for us, so all in all great. I would say the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter seemed to be continuing into the beginning of the year, and I – we are certainly shooting for higher than $200 million of signings in 2018, albeit we're not providing any specific guidance on that line item. But I'll ask Dan if he has any other color on fourth quarter or our pipeline?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks Colby. Thanks Andy. So the fourth quarter and our positive feelings about the first quarter this time I don't think are any coincidence given the restructuring that we went through last year from a go-to-market perspective. We have a lot of things that play into our success, teams outside of the sales organization for sure. But in the second and third quarter, we went through a major restructuring, Colby, as you know and that all started to settle in, in the third quarter and we believe it started to pay some dividends for us in the fourth quarter. It's early in the first quarter. We are six weeks in; we feel positive about what we've done so far even with a very busy January with PTC and the sales kick off. And the pipeline that we see going into I'll say the rest of this quarter and into the second and maybe early into the third makes us feel positive and makes us feel very good. Of course, as I always like to say we have to execute against that pipeline, but we do feel like we're in a very good position.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Colby back to your second question on capital. So when you do a deal with a company like DFT, I think, there are going to naturally be some capital synergies. You're not going to expand at the same sort of planned rate in certain – in identical markets, where if you had remained independent. So I think there is clearly some shrinkage of capital deployment from that standpoint. But when I look at our inventory, I think, it's – I think, we're in pretty good shape to be quite candid with you. And, frankly if we see additional demand in any of these markets, we'll add more capital. We'll tune it up. So we're pretty flexible in that area.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And just to round out your question on the CapEx, which was part 2. So, our midpoint of our guidance is about $1 billion, about $1.1 billion on the high end. I would say we as a team have certainly learned the lesson over the last handful of years of making sure inventory coming online and to make sure we have that fine balance especially in our core active development market. So our active pipeline has about 123 megawatts under construction, half of it leased, the other half available. And many of these markets be it like in Ashburn, we've delivered large shells and have had active signings into filling up our legacy campuses and into the latest buildings on our new campuses. So trying to obviously not overextend ourselves and put our balance sheet at risk, but not put us in a position where we're missing a good opportunity for one of our customers due to timing of inventory.
Operator: The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. A couple questions. First, you mentioned the idea of revisiting some of the portfolio for non-core assets. Is this the time – given where some of the strategic transactions have taken place on multiples and cap rates, is this the time to consider a more aggressive exploration of monetizing the power based buildings that would be very valuable to some of the tenants that sit inside of that. And then secondly, just curious as you talk about the competitive environment, if you could unpack maybe how the environment for pricing might be changing in 2018 versus 2017. And if you can put some context around the cash re-leasing spreads you saw in the fourth quarter on a cash basis relative to the guidance for slightly negative in 2018? Thanks.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Michael. It's Scott, I'll take the first half of that question, and I think that's an – it's an excellent question. I assume, you're saying on some of those PBBs perhaps, thinking about selling those to the customers that are in the building. Listen, I think everything is on the table. I will say the mitigating issues on that though typically are, what is the nature and design of the building and what market is it located in. Many of those still represent tremendous upside opportunity for us in the event, we were to get them back. Our basis is relatively low and they are extremely good investments for what they are, but in some cases, we could actually generate some pretty impressive returns if we got those back. So wouldn't want to forego future upside for the sake of a good cap rate today, but we'll keep that all in mind as we evaluate these opportunities.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Michael, on the pricing and re-leasing question, I think, there was kind of two parts packaged in there. I guess, 2017 versus 2018 overall pricing, I mean, while we are in a competitive market for sure, we are seeing a tremendous amount of demand. So that intersection is kind of keeping pricing relatively intact with some exceptions to the positive, and the tight ends of the market build out in Santa Clara, where supply is still limited. On the re-leasing spreads, I mean, we've been coming through this kind of a journey where we've been bringing our re-leasing spreads further into the positive territory. This quarter was a positive outlier, positive across the major product sets, our colocation re-leasing spreads ticked up to 3.5%. We are positive on the TKF. Now, we do still have, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some above market leases in certain parts of the portfolio. Those are largely related to leases that were – came to us via one of our – the major acquisition last year with DFT. The timing of when those renew and the rates that they renew at obviously would put – could put a negative into those stats in any given quarter. But by and large, we see it slightly negative for the full year together for the combined portfolio largely driven to those select above market leases.
Operator: The next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Hey, everyone. Just want to ask a question about some of the initiatives, Bill, that you mentioned earlier, the executive sponsorship and some of the customer service initiatives that you talked about at the Investor Day. First, just curious from a spending perspective on the SG&A front, how much of the costs for some of those programs are already in the run rate and how much is on the com? And also just curious, I think, speed which you mentioned has been a criticism of the company in the past. Curious, if you have any stats on how long it takes to get leases done today versus maybe six months ago? And then just one other follow-up.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I'll ask Andy to cover the SG&A question. On the second part, we actually looked at this in the fourth quarter and we've taken eight days out of the process for documentation in this last quarter on average. So we've shortened that I think pretty substantially, but I would tell you, there is a great deal of variety. I mean look, if you – we are doing business with a customer with whom we've done a lot of business before, we can ink a deal in just a couple days and it can be a very large deal, if it's a new customer then that obviously would – can take longer.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then on the spend and kind of investment in our customers, in our systems, in our teams, Vin, I think, you're probably harking back to a slide from our Investor Day in December really showing the power of the platform and our scale and being able to invest I think in the last year 100 basis points of revenue back into the business, and still maintain industry leading EBITDA and G&A margins. That spend was really illustrative. It's going to come in many forms, it's going to come in the G&A line, in terms of investment in our team, hiring the right sales personnel, or it's going to come in our systems. We launched a new accounting system for our colo platform in Europe this year. It's going to come in the capital side in terms of integrating our latest acquisition. It's going to come on the marketing side, but all in all that spend is going to be spent throughout 2018 and is fully baked into the numbers that we've put in our guidance table released at the beginning of the year, fully incorporated.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Vincent, it's Dan Papes, if I could just add a few comments to actually on top of Bill's. Our executive sponsorship program relating back to the SG&A question cost us a little bit airfare other than that having our leadership team out in the field, talking to our customer, executives, understanding their needs, responding to unique requirements that they may have, has paid great dividends at very little expense to the company and has also informed us as a leadership team to be more effective in some of the strategic decisions we make. So that's made a big difference. Another is again, it didn't take any G&A for us to take a look at our processes and our approval processes and how we how we work bids through our system, and shorten those timeframes meaningfully in order to be able to accommodate our customers and eliminate this stigma that you mentioned of us being slow. We get – in the last six months we've gotten just really, really positive feedback from our customers, from brokers, from partners about the fact that people are seeing us to be faster on our feet, more flexible and working together with our customers in a customer centric way that's making a difference. All of those things translate into less tangible, but certainly very meaningful benefits to us as a company, I think that the business results have been and will continue to be positively influenced by that.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks a lot for that. That's very helpful. I just – my second question is just, trends seem to be moving in the right direction, leasing volumes have been pretty healthy here over the last couple quarters. Industry commentary also seems to be pretty favorable from a demand perspective. The one metric that seems to be a little bit at odds with this is the same-store NOI growth which seems – has been softening a little bit, still positive, but curious if you could provide any color on, on what's driving that trend?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin, I think, we're going to give you an exception for the third question here. So – and I'll do the honor. So same-store NOI growth little softer this year in our guide and our guidance relative to 2017, and also we've put up in the fourth quarter and really has to do with some episodic churn and the re-leasing of that capacity. Obviously, as you see from our stats, we typically retain 75% to 80% of our customer's expirations, even higher than that sometimes on the colocation, but we don't retain 100%. Two specific churn events that are impacting the same-store pool; one in Phoenix where a systems integrator lost its end customer, and let its lease lapse at expiration that happened at the very end of the year, another one that's expected to happen in the very beginning of 2018 is in Boston. Now, again these are down – essentially downtime for – associated with re-leasing of that space that is putting a negative headwind to the year-over-year same-store growth. Not all just glass half-full, because in Phoenix, that's a market where we've been essentially full in terms of capacity, so this brings on some attractive inventory, it's a space where actually we should be able to densify it and bring incremental power, so we're able to generate potentially higher revenue from that footprint. So there is an upside, but there will be a downside, in terms of, in your cash for that asset. And then in Boston, this – that was a scale customer that is churning out, and that gives us – gave us an opportunity to re-productize a portion of that space as colocation, and we launched that along with Service Exchange in the Boston market. That goes very well with our recently hired sales team members to form the Boston market coming online at the end of last year. So, we think that same-store pool should accelerate coming out of 2018.
Operator: The next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Looking at the joint venture with Mitsubishi, can you give us some color on their data centers that are contributing and how utilized they are and how we should think about that? And then I guess a question for Dan around the sales force. Have you completed the reorg with sort of all the moving parts there and where are you finding the sales people here, are you seeing with demand high for the industry you're having trouble with churn or how should we think about that? Thanks.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank, Scott here. I'm looking for the exact numbers. They are largely utilized, I think, they're north of 80% utilized in there; and I can get you the – I'll get back to you with the exact number on that. But there is some upside potential there with the additional leasing.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Frank, to your second question about the sales force. So, yes, the restructuring of our sales forces is completed. Always will be some small adjustments here and there, but we really completed the major part of the restructuring in the second quarter last year, and then it was a matter of it settling in which happened in the third quarter for the most part, and then the fourth quarter was us operating in the new business model, which to me will – that new business model would just get better and better for us as we go forward. As far as churn goes, there is no question. It is a very competitive market for talent, especially in the colocation space, but we are – we're finding people, we're not finding them quite at the pace that we'd like, but we have most of our head count slots full now, which is great. And the places that we're getting them, we're getting them at our competitors. We're getting them from our competitors with our – I'll call it sort of our new story about the way we're trying to operate in the market with customer centricity, we're getting them with our – basically our very strong business results. They want to come work in a company that's stable, established, doing well and has a growth plan. I'll also say that they – there are a couple of companies that have exited this – the colocation and connectivity business or sold their businesses, or have been acquired. And those salespeople, the top salespeople in those organizations they don't want that instability. They want the stability of being in a firm like ours. And so when we have conversations with them, when we tell them our story, it's been positive for us from a recruiting perspective.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. And hey, Frank, the – just give you the breakdown. The north building in Mitaka was 73% occupied and the south building is 86% occupied, and then blended together it's 78% occupied.
Operator: The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the colo business, the – with the scale business we could see volatility, but it seems like there's been more focus on the colo business, more capacity dedicated to it. Is this level of signings to the $9 million range and then maybe higher kind of the new level we should be looking for, and what's driving it? Is it the focus or is it the supply or kind of everything kind of coming together on that aspect of the business? And then a quick follow-up on maintenance recurring CapEx that was up a little bit, wanted to get a little more detail on how should we think about that going forward?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I'll take the first. Andy will address the second. The colo business, not sure exactly how you phrased that, Richard, but we're – we want to grow that colocation business, back to Jordan's question about growth from Investor Day. We're trying to grow meaningfully in our scale business and we're trying to grow meaningfully in our colocation business. A lot of the transformation we went through last year was in that colocation go to market space, and we – it is our strong intent to continue to grow our colocation business, it may be just a little bit lumpy, less lumpy of course than the scale business, but we intend to make that go up into the right with our team.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Just around that, I'll hit on the CapEx. I think, it's – if you look at the progression through the year, you should look at kind of the colocation and connectivity lines of almost kind of hand-in-hand because the bulk of that connectivity are from those colocation customers. The trajectory of the year during the changes in the sales team, we were a little bit softer in the first two quarters in our new logo adds. That's stepped up in the third quarter from 30 to 36, and then stepped up to a record of 51 in the fourth quarter, including a record in Europe in particular of 13 new logos, all colo oriented. And then that ties to the mix of space and power which flows to the colocation size and the connectivity. A lot of those new logos are coming to Digital for the first time, coming to our ecosystems within our gateways, or our campuses, taking our digital cage cabinets and power requirements and base requirements from connectivity. And then we think that'll spur incremental connectivity from other customers in those assets want – seeking to connect to them. So we're quite pleased with the overall combined results, which is about a, I think, 14% step up on for colo and connectivity combined quarter-over-quarter and we're looking to continue to drive that growth. And then lastly, on your other question, about a $10 million increase quarter-over-quarter to recurring CapEx, the bulk of that was actually related to something not core to our business. We spent some capital on the tenant improvement front to re-tenant a office building in California, in the East Bay asset that was not a data center that dates back to our pre-IPO days. And we re-tenanted that asset and just sold that beginning of the year for – I believe north of $70 million, $75 million. So part of our capital recycling program. So that non-core spend was a major driver in that quarter-over-quarter CapEx – recurring CapEx step up.
Operator: The next question will be from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks. In your prepared remarks, Bill, you talked about the tax reform and the benefits from companies bringing tax – bringing their cash overseas and investing more in the U.S. Apple is somebody who's talked a lot about that. Just kind of curious if you could expand more on what the opportunity is there, and if you're actually seeing an increase in RFPs out there in the market from these type of customers as a result of tax reform? And then somewhat related it seems like every year we're hearing more and more about sustainability. You guys have been certainly talking about it more. I'm curious if you could – I don't know if you have any numbers to quantify around this, but to the extent that you have customers that are able to build their own facilities, what can you offer in terms of facilities you build that are sustainable, comparable to what a lot of these large guys can build on their own?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, on tax reform, I would tell you that the pipeline of opportunities that we're seeing right now is bigger than anything I've seen since I started with the company in 2004. Now whether that's attributable to tax reform, I don't know. It may be due to just cloud and other technological trends, but it's definitely larger by a fair degree than anything I've seen before. So in terms of the sustainability initiatives, we've been pursuing that for the last few years. We've won a number of awards for it, we've been recognized for it by NAREIT as the – it's called the Leader in the Light award within the data center group, and so we're very proud of that. And we've actually partnered with some of our customers trying to let them leverage our contracts and our connections in this area in sustainable power, so – and we've actually some of the RFPs we've responded to have green energy as a prerequisite to bidding. So it's very important to us and it's important to I would say a high percentage of the customers with whom we work. Andy or Dan, anything you'd like to add?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes. I would add, Jon, on the sustainability point that Bill made. We – our customers talk about it, talk about that with us all the time. And it's one of those situations where we can make it work for our customers. And it ends up just being a good thing because sustainability, we all would agree is a good thing in principle. It also happens to be very good business and our customers are urging us to focus on this. We're doing so and that works really well between them and us.
Operator: The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, two if I may. First, I believe commencements were $38 million in the quarter and according to the last waterfall chart, I think, it implied $48 million. So, commencements were a little lower, and I was wondering if that was just – if that was customer driven or availability driven? And secondly, I appreciate all the really positive commentary about the scale of the pipeline. And I was wondering if you know given the secular strength and the progress you've made with the sales organization and flexibility, if you could – there is a way to quantify that difference, maybe from a year-over-year perspective?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rob, this is Andy. I'm just trying to find the prior quarter commencements. I – the bridge, I know, is we added $50 million, we took out $38 million, and we lost $2 million because of the JV. So, maybe we can follow-up just to figure out the details, there is a nuance quarter-over-quarter.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Sure.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then the second question was quantify the difference year mix in terms of all the changes. Dan, do you want to take a stab at that?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Robert, so this is sort of this early on in these changes, I wouldn't dare to quantify it, the impact at this point. I do know we've won some deals that I suspect we might not have won, had we been the company of 18 or 24 months ago. I know that we're having discussions with some customers who previously wouldn't put us on the bidders list or call us when they had a requirement. So there's no question in our mind that the changes in the way we're doing things is having a positive impact. I am sorry. I'd love to put a number on it, but we know it's making a difference and it's my hope and expectation that that's going to be one of the factors that's going to show in the growth results that we're going to deliver here as a company over time.
Operator: The next question will be from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a clarification on the $6 million contribution from interconnection booking that was highlighted in the press release. I was hoping you could tell us more about this, was this from handful of customers or was this from a single – or the majority from a single customer, for instance a global car provider that is trying to aggressively expand globally right now?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Sami, our interconnection signings is incredibly diverse. I can tell you the largest single contributor is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, I mean, it's any given signing. So that was not one big cross connection – cross connect signing, it was a – it's from numerous carriers, it's from numerous cloud providers, enterprises assortment. Now, it's largely concentrated, one in our colocation facilities both in North American and Europe. Two, in our most highly connected ecosystems within our Internet gateways and then supplemented with connectivity on our campus colocation outfits, but it is a very diverse mix of signings.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. And then recently Digital announced Oracle will be expanding in 14 new locations. And then at their cloud event earlier this week, they announced global plans. Will they be building their own data centers in some of these new markets, or are they – or is the announcement in coordination with Digital as they go global and expand and kind of put a little bit of catch up with the bigger cloud providers?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sami, I'm going to have Chris Sharper, our CTO tackle that one, because he is heavily involved with that announcement.
Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Absolutely. Thank you, Andy. Definitely, Oracle is growing rather rapidly, and so we're very proud of the partnership we've been able to put in the market with them, and it's definitely an early innings, I would say, on the amount of ecosystems that are going to be built around that infrastructure. So we're very excited about that. But definitely the growth that they're starting to put out into the market, I think, they'll look at all of their options. And what's nice about Digital is, we have the heritage to do it from build-to-suit where we can support them in that manner. But all the way across the board to helping them in our existing facilities globally, and so that's why we see a lot of early success in this already, and we continue to see a growth pattern, not only for Oracle, but all these major cloud providers as they start to really invest in that global platform to access their customers privately and securely in a very efficient manner.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And just to clarify, I think, the second part of your question, Sami. The – not to name any specific customers, but I would say by and large, the majority of our customers are seeking us to pursue an outsourced third party multi-customer data center environment, not to go do it on their own. Even the most well large capitalized, I think that's due to our value proposition of having a global footprint of highly connected assets, the campuses and the land to future proof our customers growth. And I would think that based on the fact we've seen that name you just mentioned quickly ascend our top customers' list that they are no different.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing comments.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we demonstrated our commitment to prudent capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders. We harvested mature assets to recycle capital where appropriate. We invested opportunistically in core domestic markets to earn acceptable current return with an opportunity to generate future upside from further value creation. And we extended our global platform to enter a highly strategic new international market with a well-respected local partner. Two, we made significant progress towards finalizing the integration of our recent acquisitions, delivering on our stated expense synergy targets and building on the established customer relationships to realize revenue synergies as well. Three, we beat the high end of our initial 2017 guidance range and set the stage for sustainable growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share in 2018 and beyond. Fourth, last but not least, our disciplined capital allocation and deliberate balance sheet management has positioned us to safely navigate a rising interest rate environment and self-fund our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying a thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you later this year at the various investor conferences. Thank you.

A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Let's begin on page 2 of our presentation. I'd like to focus today on capital allocation. As you know, we closed on the acquisition of DuPont Fabros during the third quarter, a high quality, highly complementary portfolio concentrated in top-tier U.S. metros and an accretive prudently financed transaction that expands our relationships with a blue chip customer base. Integration is well underway and Andy will cover this in detail in his comments. Earlier this week, we announced a 50/50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation to enhance our ability to provide data center solutions in Japan. And we provided a summary here on page 3. In a nutshell, we are contributing our recently completed project in Osaka and Mitsubishi is contributing two existing data centers in Tokyo. Although the venture is non-exclusive, the expectation is that this will be both partners primary data center investment vehicle in Japan. Japan is a highly strategic market and we see tremendous opportunity for growth over the next several years. This joint venture establishes our presence in Tokyo, which has been a longtime target market for us. In addition, we expect this joint venture will significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers data center needs in Japan. In particular, we expect that Mitsubishi's global brand recognition and local enterprise expertise will meaningfully improve our ability to penetrate local demand. Back in the U.S. we also entered into an agreement this week to acquire a data center in Chicago from a private REIT for $315 million. This value add-play offers a healthy going in yield along with shell capacity that gives us an opportunity to boost the unleveraged return up into the high single-digits. This investment represents an expansion in our core market and is occupied by existing Digital Realty customers with whom we have been independently working to meet their expansion requirements in the market. During the third quarter, we took steps to support our customers growth in key metro areas. We acquired land parcels adjacent to our existing holdings in Osaka, Japan and Garland, Texas during the third quarter. These parcels will ultimately support the development of more than 50 megawatts of incremental capacity, once our existing campuses in these markets are fully sold out. During the third quarter, we also announced that we were breaking ground on a new 14 megawatt data center in Sydney, Australia adjacent to our existing facility in Erskine Park. We also announced the expansion of our Silicon Valley Connected Campus with a 6 megawatt facility at 3205 Alfred Street in Santa Clara, California which is scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2018. We are pursuing LEED Gold certification for this project and we also received LEED Silver certification for the most recently completed building at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago during the third quarter. I'm also very pleased to report that we were ranked 6th on the EPA's top 30 Tech & Telecom list of green power users and we ranked 12th on the EPA's national top 100 list of green power users across all industries. As disclosed in our press release, we took a $29 million impairment charge during the third quarter on three underperforming properties to write them down to their estimated fair market value. These assets are generally redevelopment projects in markets where data center demand has proven to be comparatively thin, namely Boston and Sacramento. These assets no longer fit our strategy or investment criteria, and are classified as held for sale. We have a strong track record of success, on both development and redevelopment projects, but these three assets were clearly not our best performers, and we are reallocating resources and capital to assets and markets that represent a better opportunity to create value for our shareholders. We sold one asset during the third quarter, a fully leased Powered Base Building data center in Austin, Texas. We sold the asset to the user for $20 million at a 5% cap rate and recognized a $10 million gain on the sale during the third quarter. We sold another asset in Northern Virginia after the end of the quarter, likewise to a user, one of our publicly traded data center, REIT peers for $34 million at a 7% cap. This asset was held in a consolidated joint venture with Equinix, and we expect to book a $15 million gain on the sale during the fourth quarter of which our pro-rata share will be approximately $12 million. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center metros, but leasing velocity remains robust and industry participants are mostly adhering to a just in time inventory management approach, helping to keep new supply largely in check. Demand is outpacing supply in most major markets. The near-term funnel remains healthy and demand seems to be picking up as we head into the end of the year. In addition, vacancy rates remain tight across the board prompting us to bring on measured amounts of capacity to meet demand in select metro areas like Sydney, Silicon Valley and Chicago. We have seen a flurry of recent land deals in core markets and the number of new competitors is on the rise, although we believe our global platform, scale and operational track record represent key competitive advantages. Given the sector's recent history, any prospect of an uptick in speculative new supply bears watching. However, we remain encouraged by the depth and breadth of demand for our scale, co-location and interconnection solutions. We expect the demand will continue to outstrip supply, while barriers to entry are beginning to grow in select metros, which we believe bodes well for long-term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of infill portfolios such as ours. Now, let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The current monetary, fiscal, and regulatory climate remains broadly supportive and the prospect of tax reform remains intact. Global economic growth forecasts have improved somewhat over the past 90 days and most economic indicators have edged up as well. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth or the price of oil. However, data is the new oil, driving the digital economy, and data wants to be close to the compute engine. Compute engines reside within the scaled data center footprints and Digital Realty scale strategy is the prerequisite to enabling these deployments. Workloads need to be logically close and connected to data lakes, and we are well-positioned to connect workloads to data on our global connected campus network and through our Service Exchange offering. Enterprise architectures are going through a transformation and workloads are transitioning from on-premise to a hybrid multi-cloud environment. Our comprehensive product offering is critical to capturing this shift. Cloud demand continues to grow at a rapid clip, but future growth in the data center sector will come from artificial intelligence. The power, cooling and interconnection requirements for AI applications are drastically different than traditional workloads, and Digital Realty is well-positioned to support the unique requirements and tremendous growth potential of this next-generation technology suite. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the third quarter of $58 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power, totaling $50 million during the third quarter, including a $6 million co-location contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the third quarter was nine years. Our third quarter wins showcase the strengths of our combined organization as the bulk of our activity was concentrated on our collective campuses in Ashburn, which is not only the largest and fastest growing data center market in the world, but also the combined company's largest metro area in terms of existing capacity and ability to support our customers growth. Although the lion's share of our bookings landed in North America, two of our top five wins during the third quarter were with leading Chinese cloud and Internet service providers sourced by our Asia-Pacific sales team. We closed six fairly sizable transactions with customers from China during the third quarter, including three direct deals with existing customers, two direct deals with new logos, and one channel transaction with an existing customer. We were quite pleased to be able to support the growth of these magnet customers' respective footprints here in the U.S. Our enterprise team notched several strategic wins, including a new logo win that brought a global provider of food, agricultural and industrial products to our Chicago campus. We also continued to support the growth of an existing customer, a provider of data protection solutions for businesses and IT professionals with their expansion into a third location within our portfolio. Our network team continued to support the growth of a wired and wireless communications infrastructure customer on our Dallas campus, in addition to ecosystem-rich wins with global cloud and network service providers in our New York Internet gateways. We added a total of 36 new logos during the third quarter and we signed over 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 900 transactions. We continue to build and refine our partners and alliances capabilities to extend our reach to serve enterprise customer demand both directly and through various leading IT services and cloud service providers. Through our alliance program, we delivered an integrated solution for a second site deployment for a leading multinational networking and telecommunications equipment manufacturer during the third quarter. We're also continuing to expand our capabilities and footprint with cloud service providers. Through our Connected Campus and Service Exchange interconnection platform, we are enabling customers to establish direct private connections to the leading Infrastructure-as-a-Service, PaaS and higher value SaaS offerings globally from our data centers on a connected network with a single user interface. These capabilities help our customers accelerate deployments of hybrid cloud solutions and open new opportunities to serve enterprise customers either directly or through our partners and alliances programs. As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances programs to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through a set of referral, sell-to and sell-with programs. Our current partners and customers see the value of our focus on working with quality solution and service providers to create a comprehensive IT solution offering. In terms of integration, activities related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition are well underway. We have established a comprehensive communication program for the team members who joined Digital Realty at closing, and we have executed a customer outreach plan to embrace all legacy DFT clients. At the property level, we are completing security system upgrades to ensure that each of the acquired properties meets Digital Realty standards. We're also performing system audits and updating operations, policies and procedures. The systems integration is progressing well, and the migration of accounting, finance, and HR-related applications is expected to be finished by year-end. We will continue to update all customer-facing material and will sunset the DFT logo and marketing materials during the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate that the vast majority of integration activities will be wrapped up by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Turning to our backlog on page 8, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $106 million. The step up from $64 million last quarter reflects the $50 million of space and power leases signed, along with the $59 million backlog inherited from the DuPont Fabros acquisition offset by $67 million of commencements. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements improved to four months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9. We retained 86% of third quarter lease expirations, and we signed $66 million of renewals during the third quarter, in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over six years, and cash rents on renewal leases rolled down 3.8%, primarily due to two sizable above market leases that were renewed during the third quarter, one on the East Coast, and one in Phoenix. These are the two markets we have previously called out as the primary culprits of above market rents in our portfolio. These are unfortunately not the last two above market leases in the portfolio, thus the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. On balance, however, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will be positive for the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth, and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 170 basis points sequentially to 90.8%, partially due to the inclusion of the stabilized DFT assets. However, we also registered positive net absorption within the standalone Digital Realty portfolio, notably in Dallas, Chicago and the Bay area, and same-capital portfolio occupancy also improved by 30 basis points sequentially to 90.2%. The US dollar continued to soften during the third quarter, and finally rolled over relative to the prior year, as you can see depicted on the chart at the bottom of page 10. As a result, FX represented roughly a 30 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our third quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. Same-capital cash NOI growth was 4.1% on a reported basis for the third quarter and 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew by 5% both on a reported and a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share came in $0.03 ahead of consensus, as well as our own internal forecast. And as you may have seen from the press release, we are raising guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow through from the deal (20: 21). In terms of the quarterly distribution, we still expect the first half will represent roughly 51% of the full year results, while the second half is still expected to contribute roughly 49%. This does imply a step down from the third quarter to the fourth quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, the primary driver is a full quarter with the higher share count outstanding following the close of the DFT acquisition late in the third quarter. We still expect to realize approximately $18 million of annualized overhead synergies and we still expect the transaction will be roughly 2% accretive to core FFO per share in 2018 and roughly 4% accretive to 2018 AFFO per share. However, these synergies will not fully be realized until 2018 and the quarterly run rate is expected to spring load in the fourth quarter before bouncing back in 2018. With respect to AFFO, I would like to highlight again this quarter the long term trend in straight-line rent. As you can see on page 13, non-cash straight-line rental revenue has come down from a run rate of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, all the way down to less than $2 million in this quarter. Over that same time, quarterly revenue has grown by 60% from $380 million to more than $600 million. This trend reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals, as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline, which has driven steady growth in our cash flows and sustained improvement in the quality of our earnings. We had another particularly active quarter on the financing front with numerous steps taken to further strengthen our balance sheet over the past 90 days, which we have itemized here on page 14. In late July, we issued two tranches of Sterling denominated bonds with a weighted average maturity of 10 years, and a blended coupon of just over 3% raising gross proceeds of approximately $780 million. In early August, we prefunded a portion of the DuPont Fabros acquisition with the issuance of $1.35 billion of U.S. dollar bonds with a weighted average maturity of nine years, and a blended coupon of 3.45%. This was only the sixth time an investment grade U.S. listed REIT has issued a $1 billion or more in a single tranche of bonds. The transaction was well oversubscribed and priced 10 basis points inside of where our existing bonds were trading on the secondary market prior to the transaction. Needless to say, we're pleased with the solid execution and the strong investor interest in the Digital Realty credit story. We also raised $200 million of perpetual preferred equity at 5.25%, an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty and the lowest rate ever achieved on a REIT preferred offering with a crossover rating. In mid-September, we closed on the DuPont Fabros acquisition and exchanged all the outstanding DFT common shares and units for approximately 43 million shares of DLR common stock and 6 million OP units. Also in conjunction with the DuPont Fabros acquisition, we exchanged the DFT 6.625% Series C Preferred for a new Digital Realty Series C Preferred with a liquidation value of $201 million. We also tendered for the DFT 5.875% high-yield notes due 2021, settled nearly 80% of the $600 million outstanding at closing in mid-September and redeemed the remainder within a few days post closing. Subsequent to quarter-end, we redeemed all $250 million of the DFT 5.625% high-yield notes due 2023 and a blended 106.3% of par or a total cost of $270.5 million, including accrued interest and the make-whole premium. When the dust settled at the end of the quarter, debt-to-EBITDA stood at 6 times and fixed charge coverage was just under 4 times, as you can see from the left side of the chart on page 15. However, that's a bit misleading, since all the debt related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition was on the balance sheet as of September 30, but the third quarter only included a 17-day contribution from the DFT assets. Adjusting for a full-quarter contribution, the balance sheet actually improves as a result of the DuPont Fabros acquisition and debt-to-EBITDA dips down below 5x and fixed charge coverage remains above 4x, as you can see on the right-hand side of the chart. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 16, we have a clear runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet remains well-positioned for growth consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: I would be happy to, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much. I wondered on the international front, if you could talk a little bit about Europe and any sort of update on Frankfurt as well as the momentum you're seeing with retail and interconnects in the acquired Telecity assets, as well as over in Japan with Mitsubishi joint venture, and how you intend to staff and brand that? Will that be kind of its own operating entity or would that be a DLR branded in some fashion? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan, this is Andy. Maybe I'll take the first part, touch on Europe, and then I'll hand it over to Scott to give you an update on the Mitsubishi JV. So over – I think the first part of the question was with regard to Frankfurt. I had an opportunity to spend some time with the team in Frankfurt a handful of weeks ago. I was able to tour our new scale campus that is quickly coming online, which I think is going to be a great flagship scale product offering in that market. I know we are in advanced discussions with one of the top five cloud service providers to serve as an anchor customer for that site. So that will be a great win. And then also I've spent some time with the team operating the colocation site, which was one of the eight properties we acquired summer previously, and we've had great wins there on the colocation and interconnection front with a fairly strong lease-up to that specific asset's occupancy. Broadly speaking, I think Europe in general had a fairly strong first half. We had a comparable anchor win to our campus on the scale side. In Amsterdam we had growth from a U.S. specialty cloud provider in Dublin and we had some great wins on the colo and interconnection side as well. In some of our London assets, I think, we had a little bit lighter quarter in the third quarter, largely due to some of the timing of inventory coming online, but I do expect to see a pretty strong fourth quarter on the Europe front. And I'll hand it over to Scott to talk to the Mitsubishi JV.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Jonathan. On Mitsubishi JV, that's going to be co-branded, but it will be very clear that it's a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Digital Realty. We're very excited about this opportunity. It's going to allow us to further serve our customers in this important Japanese market and specifically access to the Tokyo market. As you can imagine, it's a long process to go it alone there. We have a lot of our international customers have immediate needs in Japan, which we'd like to be able to serve and this really gets us up the curve a lot faster on that. We get to bring our global customer base, our global platform and operations, development capabilities, a balance sheet obviously, they bring a strong balance sheet as well as local presence, land positions and relationships that will help us both address the market in a much more timely and effective manner for our customers.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then finally just is there anything post the end of the quarter that you could provide any granularity on in terms of pre-leasing in the portfolio?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, no new news to post to you on the handful of days we're into October, but I think you can expect an update from us somewhat close to mid-quarter in our Investor Day coming in early December.
Operator: And the next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. Bill, in your prepared remarks, you touched on the demand picking up heading into the end of the year. And, Andy, you just ran through some of the strength. It sounds like that Europe could be a nice pacesetter for next quarter. I'm trying to figure out on a pro forma basis with DFT what the new bogey is in terms of leasing for DLR on a quarterly basis? And I know you don't really give guidance around that, but should we expect if demand is picking up that the 4Q could be as good as the volume we were able to produce in 3Q?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Jordan. This is Dan Papes. I'll start with an answer to that. I'd just characterize it this way that the acquisition and – sorry, the merger with DFT has certainly stirred up interest from their customer base and our customer base. And we're optimistic that that's going to be helpful. But, at the same time, I don't want to – we don't really commit to a run rate or anything like that. I would just say that we feel like the demand in the fourth quarter is healthy. And from what visibility we have into the first quarter, it's healthy as well. We're going to just have to see how we execute against the pipeline of opportunities that we have. And you'll see that unfold as we're able to close transactions. If anybody wants to...
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jordan, what I would add too is that the deals are definitely getting bigger. There are bigger deals in the pipeline. But with that comes lumpiness. So we could have a great quarter in the fourth quarter or it could be a great quarter in the first quarter, but there is a lot of potential volume in Dan's pipe for sure.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I was glad to see that the asset sale pipeline appears to be picking up a little bit. It seems like you guys are cleaning out some of the slower growth or assets with less opportunity. Can you maybe just flesh out, Scott, for us, what this looks like, this held-for-sale pipeline in terms of overall volume and then maybe what else might be in the portfolio in terms of scale to dispose of?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Sure thing, Jordon. So these were – we went through and looked at our portfolio and tried to identify some of the other assets that would be considered non-core or non-core markets, and we came up with these additional assets – four assets that we're putting into the held-for-sale category. We are also conducting regular reviews on our portfolio. So it's a little premature to tell you what the volume might be of other ones, so if you can give me a few months to work through that. We're expecting that these assets will probably trade somewhere in the first half of 2018, the ones that we have right now, but I think it's safe to assume that we will regularly review our portfolio to cull non-core or underperforming assets.
Operator: And the next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Two questions, if I may. Of the 33 megawatts of TKF that was leased in North America in the quarter, how much of that was in legacy DLR facilities versus legacy DuPont Fabros facilities? And then, secondly, the $59 million of backlog that you referenced for DuPont, is that the backlog that they had at the end of their second quarter, or is that the backlog that they had as of the last day before the transaction closed with you? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Colby. Andy here. So, going to your first question, I would say a large share of our North America signings were in the Ashburn market, and there were some fairly large signings in there. But it was fairly spread as well. So we had a top five cloud service provider sign a multiple megawatt deal, which really was the last major signing to cap off our previous Digital Realty standalone campus. We had the first meg-plus deal from an international customer signed onto the new Building L and we also had sizable signings into the legacy DFT ACC complex. So it was...
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is it fair to assume that then 20 megawatts in that 33 megawatts came from the DuPont Fabros facilities?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say the – I can tell you all the signings – new signings in the legacy DFT assets happened really just post the shareholder vote by both companies. The largest signing I think was about 15 megs on a single lease, but adding up to total customers, it probably approaches that 20 megawatts number from one customer.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And then on the backlog?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then your second question, that was the 2Q backlog.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: So did they sign anything between the second quarter close and when the deal with you closed that is worth calling out?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: There were no new signings between 6/30/2017 and the shareholder vote.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder, Bill, if you could expand on your prepared remarks about AI and, in particular, just help us understand what you see as the kind of the market opportunity there and how the timing, when does that really start to impact your volumes in terms of orders and revenues? Thanks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We've always seen some demand for it. So it's – what I'd say, we're at the – we're in the first half inning of a nine-inning game there. And our take is that it's going to be -as I said, the demand will be substantial and I think the power requirements will be significant as well going into this. And I think we'll see a lot of this from our existing customer base. Dan, you might want to expand on that?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay...
Operator: I'm sorry, was there another question from you, Mr. Flannery?
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I don't know, was there – was Dan going to follow up on that?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, Bill, I think sufficiently answered the question, Simon, unless you have a specific follow up.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Well, on the power requirements, is that something that might require kind of a denser build in future phases, or do you think you're going to accomplish that within your existing architecture?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I think we can accomplish more power density within our existing build.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I mean ...
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: ... Simon, just want to add – this is Andy. Just to add onto that. I mean, we're seeing a range of customer density demands, and it's not always dictated by specific industry verticals for that matter. But you may have enterprise customers that wants a lower density in terms of power per square foot and you may have other customers that are driving that well into the 200 watts per square foot. And I believe we create our build to be able to bring incremental power to the floor as needed and respond to the customer demand. And I think this AI trend is going to further those boundaries.
Operator: And the next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Talk to us a little bit about the DFT model sort of as a product set. Are you looking to expand that model possibly through some of your other campuses? How are you look at that? And then as sort of a follow-up. For a couple of markets DFT was in, particularly I think in Canada, they're a little bit new for you. How has pre-leasing trended in those markets during the quarter? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank, this is Andy. So on the model, so pretty much anything really in-flight, in terms of near-term deliveries or last legs of expansion are pretty much dictated by the existing DFT design. So you can expect that for our most recent deliveries just wrapping up in Santa Clara ,the next builds of our ACC 10 Phase 2 and similarly in Chicago. When it comes to new swathes of available capacity, be it just down the road from the ACC complex and our latest land acreage in Ashburn, we are creating Building L, which is the first phase is 36 megawatts, but that entire site has capacity to call it 250 megawatts, and we have greater ability on those land parcels to provide various build types depending on the customer demand. So we think being able to have the flexibility to offer various designs to capture a broader amount of customer demand is a competitive strength. And having that with the acreage and power capacity in core growing markets is also to our advantage. Your second question was really I think speaking to cross-sells and some of the newer expansions. Toronto, in particular, we've seen great interest from several customers, legacy DFT customers that had looked in to expand with a megawatt or so. We've also seen interest from legacy Digital Realty customers that really had not done any business with DFT but had been looking for capacity in Toronto where we're essentially out of inventory and fully leased and now looking to expand. So we think there are substantial cross-sell opportunities here, and the Toronto is just a one-off example of something that will down the road pay dividends.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think it can have – this is Scott. The Toronto is kind of a land constrained market, so the supply is somewhat limited. So I think that will help us in our leasing there.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Frank, it's Dan, too, just as the leader of the sales organization, I'm very happy to have inventory in Toronto for our customers, because that's something that our customers have been expressing interest in since I've been here. Similar to my being happy to have inventory now in Frankfurt for customers who have been asking for it for some time. So that's good.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead.
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon, good evening, guys. Bill, DFT I think negotiated a lot of their super wholesale deals at the various highest level of the executive pool. I think you mentioned it was a pretty simple lease structure. Do you guys have a plan in place to kind of go and attack those same customers to Andy's point of maybe changing your build structure to some extent? So is there a sales plan? Is there kind of a lease structure that you're contemplating to go after that group of tenants? And as a follow-up to that, can you update us maybe on the Facebook leases that you inherited.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So in terms of executive interaction with the customers, we have something that we call an executive sponsor program here at Digital. So we have accounts that are assigned to members of our executive leadership team for coverage in addition to the day-to-day sales team. So we'll have two or three accounts assigned to individuals on our leadership team. I'm sorry, what was your other question?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I can help out. The other one on the design side, I think building larger footprint buildings with larger data halls is something we've done on many occasions. I think it's important to remember the most significant departure between us and DuPont from a design standpoint was really the way the UPS is designed. We have typically built a battery UPS system, and they've done a rotary piller unit UPS system, which by the way we have many of those deployments in our portfolio. So it's a matter of preference on that, and of course we're always reviewing to see which is the best design.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And the second part of that ...
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just on...
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sorry.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sorry, go ahead.
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just on the Facebook leases was just the second part of that. Sorry, if I interrupted.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. So I think you asked about an update on a major customer. No, obviously, we can't provide any specific details. They're confidential to our customer. We did have a very large volume of renewals. I believe it was our highest quarterly renewal quantum in the history of digital, but we did not – I could tell you there were not any major renewals executed during the quarter.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And can I just to add to Bill's answer, Dave, in regards to I think your question was something around senior executives being involved in transactions and bringing them to closure. We have become much more active in that way as a senior leadership team in the field. I, myself and my peers and Bill spend, I would say, daresay much more time with clients now than we did a year ago. And we also did one – of the things that we saw from DuPont Fabros was they were very effective in that. And as we look at best practices from DuPont Fabros, we saw that as a success factor that we feel like is important for us to leverage, so we are doing a lot more of that. I think it's a great question and something that we're focused on.
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Please go ahead.
Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first, I was wondering if you went back to slide seven, if it was possible to break out the dollar impact of the leasing between the heritage digital business versus DuPont in the quarter? And then just second to that, you mentioned that a lot of the activity was concentrated in the Ashburn market during the quarter, and do you think that was just an issue of where customer decisions were getting made, or is there some share shift that may be happening in some of the other markets, or is even possible that it's just what's in the available-to-sale category? Just some insights on the concentration maybe versus historical diversity of bookings would be helpful.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Michael, this is Andy. Let me see if I can tackle, I may have to reverse order. So last quarter was a very hot Dallas quarter, we had multiple customers with multiple megawatt signings, this quarter was a very hot Ashburn quarter. I can tell you Ashburn is a very competitive market, probably our most competitive, but we had many wins in Ashburn during the quarter from various types of buyers of cloud buyers, other international companies and other technology companies. I'm not sure – and there's obviously very well known merits to why customers choose Ashburn, why this quarter versus last quarter or the quarter preceded made Ashburn the winner. I'm not sure there was anything that pointed out specifically. I think it's a market that has demand from the most amount of industry verticals, you have top cloud companies, network companies, enterprise customers, all seeking to deploy there. And this was obviously a big winning quarter for us on all of our three major locations in Ashburn. I think your second question was really breaking out how much of the third quarter signings landed in the legacy ACC construct. I think I've touched on this with an response to Colby's question. I believe the largest signing was roughly 15-ish megs and the second largest was 7 megs. Both of those into legacy DFT ACC complexes. And then I think after that there was a 4.5 megawatt signing into the last building on the legacy Loughton Digital Campus, and then over 1.5 meg landed in the brand new building now on our latest Digital Realty campus and the largest capacity for growth. I would say it's not all Ashburn. We did have deals ranging from 300, 200 kilowatts to close to 1.5 meg; also in San Francisco, down in Santa Clara and Chicago and Dallas, it's just that the predominance of winnings was in Ashburn this quarter.
Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I was just curious, it seemed like you guys were making a special point about the demand or the signings that you had from some of the larger Chinese cloud, and Internet players. And I was just curious are you seeing significant pick-up in interest from that region, and those types of tenants such that we might see a bit of an uplift over the next couple of quarters from that category?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vincent, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. I'll take the scenario that we're excited about the opportunity, we did capture three inbound opportunities as you heard from Chinese cloud service providers. And we don't believe they're done. We believe that it could be the start of something very important for us. So we're on it and pursuing it and hopeful it will continue to provide us some meaningful opportunities for growth. I would not say these are anomalous transactions. I think that there will be several more in the future and we want to go capture those.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And, Bill, maybe going back to something you said in your opening remarks about rising barriers to entry in certain markets. I mean it seems like land availability is becoming a problem for certain markets, but I was just curious if you could provide some more color on what you meant by – what barriers exactly were you referring to?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: You're right. I mean land is significant. It's a significant issue in Silicon Valley. It will be an issue in Loughton. I think that's why you're seeing this sort of mad rush to acquire land because there's the availability of suitable sites is definitely depleting. And then, in certain markets, power is an issue; it's not a permanent barrier, but it certainly can be a multi-year barrier. I want to go back to – for your first question, though, the other thing that we've done as a change is that we now have a Mandarin speaking salesperson based in Hong Kong in our Hong Kong office, and so we're covering the Mainland Chinese companies from that office with this person and that has clearly worked out well. That person had prior relationships with the Chinese Internet companies.
Operator: The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Just to follow-up on that quickly, where are you seeing more of the activity from the Chinese companies? Where are they looking? And it seems like we're hearing more about the Chinese cloud players coming to the U.S. So just kind of trying to get a sense of where they're interested in booking space.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Richard. So it's actually fairly broad-based. We had signings in Ashburn, we had signings in Santa Clara, we had signings in Chicago, and then some smaller signings in Atlanta and Portland. So it's actually been pretty broad-based. But, obviously, I think the larger signings are more aligned with our campus locations and many of those signings usually land with 1 meg or so, and with the customer quickly coming back looking to expand.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And I guess you have been very consistent with the 57% to 59% adjusted EBITDA margin with DuPont. Should we expect that to go to the higher end as things get integrated or are enough things happening that you're investing and that range is kind of the range we should be looking for?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: My guess is, with the quarter – really a full quarter and half-a-month of the DFT transaction under our belt, we will be guiding slightly to the higher end of that range of our guidance, and obviously it should be more helpful as we move into 2018, given the operating efficiencies from that portfolio.
Operator: The next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about – you did a number of kind of one-off dispositions and acquisitions, kind of curious, some more color on, I guess, the ease of selling stabilized data centers on a one-off basis. I think historically we've seen more of M&A focused on large portfolio transactions, I guess, it's becoming easier as the industry kind of normalizes to sell one-off buildings. And then, specifically, on the two dispositions you did, the one in Austin at a 5% cap rate and the one in Sterling, Virginia at 7%, just curious for some more details on what the discrepancy in those cap rates would be. I would think a Northern Virginia data center would trade at a lower cap rate just given the strength of that market. Curious about some more details specifically on those buildings.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Jon. And I'll take the two assets first and then I'll go to the other one. But, Austin, as you know, we sold it to the existing customer there and that was a separately negotiated transaction and we think we got a good outcome on that from a cap rate perspective. Virginia, and by the way, it's a general statement, I think cap rates are probably not the best way to always look at these. But if you look at Virginia that asset was a joint venture with Equinix. They were interested in disposing of that asset as well. If you look at it on a whole picture of all the metrics on a price per foot, the quality of the asset, the amount of office and the relative data center, if you look at all of those components on it, you'll see that it was a pretty good outcome from a valuation perspective. So, the cap rates can be a little misleading on those two. The ease of selling one-off assets in markets, I would say, if you had a good one-off asset in a core market, they're probably still pretty easy to sell, you get outside of the core markets and they can get a little bit more difficult to sell, because then the size of them will determine who the potential customers are that might – or the buyers that might buy that. So it does get a little more difficult in – Sacramento is a good example, we're going to pair an asset that we've held for sale with another existing well leased asset in an effort to kind of get a little more bulk there and attract some other buyers.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up on that same point, I'm just kind of curious which type of building is commanding a lower cap rate today, kind of a power-based building leased do like a credit tenant on a long-term basis or just kind of your traditional multi-tenant wholesale data center building?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think the long-term lease PBB kind of net lease assets are still easy to buy and a little lower on the cap rate spectrum just given there's a much larger universe of buyers. You can find a lot of passive buyers who would clip coupons. For the multi-tenant data centers, you have to consider what you're going to do from an operational standpoint. But I will also say as a general statement, there's been – while those cap rates used to have a few hundred basis points spread between them, those spreads have got compressed quite a bit. And in some cases, they're kind of right on top of each other.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Not sure if you touched on this yet, but I was wondering if you could offer an update on the COO search.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Jordan. I can do that. We engaged Heidrick & Struggles to do the search. I think that they've certainly sourced a number of highly qualified candidates. I've met with several as have members of the management team here. So, I think we're making good progress. But I think what's important here is that we're going to take as much time as we need to, to find the right addition to the team. And I feel comfortable and confident that things are being handled appropriately in the interim. We have Chris Sharp, who is now part of the leadership team, in-charge of his old area, plus product and NSEs (58:12), and then the data center ops team is reporting into Andy. So, things are in good hands while we pursue this search.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the interconnection side, during the quarter it looks like you added 1,400 cross-connects sequentially, was that entirely organic? So, no contribution from DFT whatsoever?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Correct. No material contribution from DFT.
Operator: And the last question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC: Thanks. Hey, guys. Can you provide some color on market rent growth across your portfolio?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Lukas. Andy here. Happy to do that. I would say, if you look at to maybe start with North America, rental rates in the Ashburn market, where you've seen the largest amount of demand, but also the largest amounts of competition and supply are relatively flat. Conversely if you go to the other coast to the Valley, we're continuing to see a modest uptick in rents, certainly on a year-over-year basis really due to the supply constraints in that market, limited capacity coming online by ourselves and our competitors and there's much less competitors. Kind of in between Chicago, Dallas and maybe kind of put them certainly in between those two bookends for you, flat to slightly rising rates. Broadly speaking, I think despite the robustness in the overall volume of demand, the fact that supply is rising up to just try to intersect with that demand is something that kind of puts a bit of a lid on rates from spiking and you also have a phenomenon where the buyers are buying in bigger and bigger quantities, hence commanding better pricing on each of those buys. We remain optimistic that these rates stay flat to slightly increasing, going within the U.S. for half a second. I think we're seeing similar trends in our major campus oriented markets, be it Frankfurt, London, Hampshire and Dublin, and same thing in Singapore and Sydney.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC: That's really helpful. And then one last quick one. The straight line rents, they've been declining over time. Can you remind us what the main driver of that is?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Two drivers. One is just obviously just natural as you move through the lease of the delta between cash and GAAP rents changes. But I think the more material one is really a firming up over several quarters, not just a quarter-over-quarter change, but several quarters and even probably years of the market where really less and less incentives, free rent or ramps had been given away as the market tightened and came out of trough, and hence we were able to command firmer pricing and less incentives, that's more of a better quality of our earnings.
Operator: And at this time, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we closed on the acquisition of DuPont Fabros, a high quality, highly complementary portfolio concentrated in top tier U.S. metros, an accretive, prudently financed transaction that expands our relationships with a blue chip customer base. Two, we delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.03 and we raised the midpoint of our full year guidance by $0.03 as well. Last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by refinancing DuPont Fabros's high yield debt with attractively priced long-term capital and exchanging the DFT common shares units and preferred stock for DLR common and preferred equity. We finished the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA below 5 times and fixed charge coverage above 4 times, both pro forma, for a full quarter contribution from DuPont Fabros. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you at our Investor Day in December.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that you will afforded time for one question and one follow-up. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you.

Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The highlight of second quarter was of course the announcement of our agreement to merge with DuPont Fabros. And I'd like to begin today by recapping the strategic merits of that transaction. Our customers and the desire to better serve them through more offerings in more locations are the key reason and the primary strategic rationale for this deal. This transaction is consistent with our strategy of offering a comprehensive set of data center solution from single-cabinet colocation and interconnection, all the way up to multi-megawatt deployments as represented here on page 2 of our presentation. At the far end of the spectrum, this combination significantly expands our hyperscale product offering and enhances our ability to meet the rapidly growing needs of the leading cloud service providers. This deal is also consistent with our stated investment criteria, shown on page 3. The transaction expands our presence in strategic U.S. data center metros and the two portfolios are highly complement. The transaction is expected to be roughly 2% accretive to core FFO per share of 2018 and roughly 4% accretive to 2018 AFFO per share. Last, but not least the combination continues to enhance the overall strength of the balance sheet. DuPont Fabros owns a high-quality portfolio of purpose-built data centers, as you can see from the profile on page 4. And as evidenced by the 98% occupancy on the in-service portfolio. The merger will benefit Digital Realty by bolstering its presence and expanding its product offering in three top tier metro areas, while DuPont Fabros will realize significant benefits of diversification from the combination with Digital Realty's existing footprint in 145 properties across 33 global metropolitan areas. In addition to world class assets in high demand metros DuPont Fabros will also bring some outstanding team members and industry best practices that we look forward to leveraging. Their culture of putting the customer first will complement our move towards becoming as customer centric an organization as we've ever been. Turning to the pro forma stack on page 5. The combined company will be the ninth largest REIT in the index with an equity market cap of approximately $24 billion and a total enterprise value of $33 billion. The balance sheet impact will be leverage neutral, but given the exceptional credit quality of the customer base, the long lease terms and the high proportion of owned real estate, we would expect the combined companies unsecured debt program should improve due to broader investor base and greater liquidity that should over time result in an even lower cost of capital. The benefits of this scale translates directly to operating efficiencies as shown on page 6. DuPont Fabros has always run one of the tightest ships in the business and given the additional economies of scale and cost savings achieved through the transaction, the combined organization will have by far the most efficient cost structure and the highest EBITDA margin in the data center sector. DuPont Fabros is also unique in the data center sector, in that it owns the dirt under all of its datacenters. The combined organization will likewise own the greatest percentage of real estate within the sector. To sum it all up, we are very excited about the strategic transaction which will enhance our ability to serve our customers and hyperscale cloud customers, in particular, in the top data center metro areas across the U.S. It will be accretive to earnings and cash flow in year one and strengthens our balance sheet. The complementary nature of the two footprints, customer bases, and product offerings provide mirror image diversification and enhancement benefits, and augment our ability to create significant long-term value for both sets of shareholders. Along the lines of sustainable long-term value creation, I would also like to highlight the recent announcement that Digital Reality ranked 6th on the U.S. EPA's top 30 Tech & Telecom list of the Largest Consumers of Green Power and 12th on the National Top 100 list of Green Power Users. We are proud of our sustainability initiatives and we remain committed to manage our environmental impact in optimizing our use of energy and natural resources because we believe it's the right thing to do, and because it matters to our customers. Sourcing renewable energy is also important to many of our customers, including some of the world's largest consumers of data center capacity and our ability to meet their needs for renewable, and highly efficient data center solution sets us apart from our competitors. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 9. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center metros, but leasing velocity remains robust and the industry has almost universally transitioned to a just-in-time inventory management approach, helping to keep new supply largely in check. Their near-term funnel remains healthy and we are currently chasing requirements from all of the leading cloud providers, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service as well as PaaS and SaaS providers. The size of these near-term requirements is generally smaller with some of the hyperscale deployments we saw in 2016. But we see demand as broad-based and consistent, and we expect to see larger requirements over the intermediate term. In addition, vacancy rates remain tight across the board, and supply constraints are building in top tier metro areas notably including Silicon Valley. Competition remains intense, particularly for larger requirements and given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears watching carefully. However, we were encouraged by the depth and breadth of demand for our scale, colocation and interconnection solutions and we believe tightening conditions bode well for long-term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of in-field portfolios like ours. And now, let's turn to the macro environment on page 10. While the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remain uncertain, the current monetary, fiscal and regulatory climate is broadly supportive. Economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, but good enough to sustain continued growth. In addition, our expectations for the U.S. have recently been tempered somewhat. Growth prospects in our global regions outside the U.S. have brightened off late, against a broadly supportive macro-economic backdrop, a long-term secular shift to digital applications such as cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and autonomous cars is driving robust dealer center demand. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup, here with our global platform, our comprehensive product offering and our fortress balance sheet. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 12. Our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $34 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $27million during the second quarter, including an $8 million colocation contribution. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages to generate numerous second quarter wins. We transacted in 20 of our 33 global metro areas during the second quarter and the majority of our second quarter business was across multiple metros. On the heels of the robust absorption in both Europe and Asia Pacific during the first quarter, our North America region generated the lion's share of new leasing due to the timing of inventory coming online abroad along with strong second quarter signings on our campuses in Ashburn and Dallas. The largest single deal was 4 megawatts, and colocation and interconnection accounted for more than 40% of our total bookings. We added 30 new logos during the second quarter and we signed nearly 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 800 transactions. We continue to support the growth of various top cloud service providers across regions. These wins included Infrastructure-as-a-Service, PaaS and SaaS providers growing their footprint in multiple metro areas. Our multi-pronged strategy of serving enterprise customer demand both directly and through various IT service providers and other partners also continues to bear fruit. We were able to directly support the growth of a long time financial services customer with the expansion of their footprint in Singapore. Through our partner channel, we also added a top three U.S. Money Center Bank as a first time Digital Realty customer across three locations in North America. We also built on our recent success in the healthcare vertical by lending a new hospital system with a partner on our Dallas campus. The leading cloud service providers have recently announced the enterprise versions of their hybrid cloud offerings designed to be more conducive to supporting private data and security requirements. These enterprise offerings should simplify hybrid cloud solutions, and open new opportunities to serve enterprise customers, either directly or through our partners and alliances program. As mentioned last quarter, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances program to create meaningful upside for our business over time. Our partners and our customers value our focus on working with quality solution providers. We feel good about our partners growing ability to position our value proposition as part of their overall solution to their customers. We are pleased with the progress during the second quarter and we are encouraged by the momentum we are building. In terms of integration, activities are proceeding as planned. Our product rationalization workshops were held in June and we are now focusing on the steps necessary to create a consistent product portfolio and customer experience across all sites, ultimately, uniting all products, delivery models, operations support and billing under a common platform. The teams are busy consolidating our back office systems and we expect to have the eight European assets we acquired on our new platform by the end of the year. In terms of the financial results we registered sequential gains in occupancy, as well as revenues for the European acquisition portfolio for the second quarter in a row versus the trend of revenue declines that predated our stewardship. With respect to do DuPont Fabros, while it remains business as usual until the merger closes, innovation planning is well underway. Although this will be our largest acquisition to-date, we expect a seamless integration after closing. The DuPont Fabros portfolio consist of just 12 operating properties in three major metro areas where Digital Reality has an existing presence. In addition, DuPont Fabros has just 32 customers compared to 2,300 for Digital Reality. Turning to our backlog on page 13, the current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $64 million. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements remained healthy at six months, in line with long-term historical averages. Moving onto renewal leasing activity on page 14, we retained 72.5% of second quarter lease expirations. And we signed a record $65 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over eight years and cash releasing spreads were up a healthy 6.5% overall, with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the second quarter, including another solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals and a consistent mid-single digit mark-to-market on colocation renewals. We do still have pockets of above market rents throughout the portfolio, and we currently expect to see a negative cash mark-to-market on our third quarter renewal activity. On balance however, cash releasing spreads were positive for the second quarter and we still expect cash releasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finished lease expirations. In terms of our second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was down 30 basis points sequentially to 89.1% due primarily to recently completed development deliveries placed in service during the second quarter and two small expirations within our Internet gateway buildings in Dallas and Chicago. Both of these footprints are currently being repurposed as colocation inventory and we expect to generate additional upside over time from lease of the space at meaningfully higher rents. The U.S. dollar softened somewhat during the second quarter although it also remains somewhat of a headwind relevant to the second quarter of 2016 given the spikes following Brexit in June and the U.S. Presidential Election in November as you can see from the chart at the bottom of page 15. As a result, while comps should begin to get easier in the second half of the year, FX still represented roughly 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 16. Same capital cash NOI growth was 3.1% on a reported basis for the second quarter and 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew by 8.5% on a reported basis and was up a little over 10% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share was $0.05 ahead of consensus although we do expect the quarterly run rate to step down in the second half of the year as shown here on page 17. In terms of the quarterly distribution, we now expect the first half will represent roughly 51% of full year results while the second half is expected to contribute roughly 49%. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating our guidance despite the $0.05 beat during the second quarter. The primary reason we are still in path on the full-year guidance is the pending merger with DuPont Fabros. In particular, the merger closing date remains uncertain whereas we expect to line up long-term financing as market conditions permit. You may recall that we raised approximately $770 million of proceeds from a sterling bond issuance earlier this month whereas our guidance contemplated just $500 million of long-term debt. We also expect to raise long-term financing in advance of closing the transaction. We still expect to realize $18 million of annualized overhead synergies from the DuPont Fabros merger, and we still expect the transaction to be roughly 2% accretive to core FFO per share in 2018, and roughly 4% accretive to 2018 AFFO per share. However, these synergies will not be realized until 2018 and given the number of moving parts, we felt it best to leave guidance unchanged for the time being despite the outperformance in the first half. With respect to AFFO, I would like to highlight again this quarter the long-term trend in straight line rent as shown on page 18. This chart reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline which has driven steady growth on our cash flows and sustained improvement in the quality of our earnings. The second quarter was particularly active on the financing front, with numerous steps taken to further strengthen our balance sheet over the past 90 days, which we have itemized here on page 19. In early April, we redeemed $182.5 million of high coupon preferred stock. As mentioned on our last call, we booked a related $0.04 topic D-42 charge during the second quarter, which is excluded from core FFO per share. The preferred redemption was essentially funded with $211 million of gross proceeds from settlement of the remaining forward equity offering we raised one year ago in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In May, we issued a €125 million of two-year floating rate notes to refinance borrowings under our line of credit. The interest rate on these notes is EURIBOR plus 50 basis points or half the spread on our line of credit for an all in initial coupon of just under 17 basis points. In late June, we refinanced and upsized the secured loan outstanding on the Westin building, the premier internet gateway for the Pacific Northwest which we own in a 50-50 joint venture partnership with Clise Properties in Seattle. This transaction led to a $3.3 million gain during the second quarter, since total cash distributions from the refinancing and prior operations now exceed our investment basis in the joint venture. The gain on the amount of excess distributions from the refinancing above our investment basis run through the equity and earnings of unconsolidated JV line on the P&L. Given the non-recurring nature of the gain, it has been excluded from core FFO per share. Last but not least, we raised a total of GBP 600 million Sterling bonds or approximately US$770 million in two tranches subsequent to quarter end. The blended coupon of these tranches is just over 3% and the blended term is just under 10 years. As mentioned earlier, this bond offering was contemplated in our original guidance given our recently expanded presence in Europe and consistent with our financing strategy of managing currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. The amount of the raise was upsized however from $500 million at the midpoint of our guidance to $770 million. We expect to use the excess proceeds to repay a portion of DuPont Fabros' debt in connection with the acquisition. Of note, however, the seven-year tranche included an SMR provision, which enables us to retire the debt at 101% of par in the event that DuPont Fabros transaction does not close by December 15, 2017. Finally, as you could see from the left side of page 20, we have a clear run rate with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. We ended the quarter with fixed charge coverage above 4 times and debt to EBITDA at approximately 5 times. Our balance sheet remains well-positioned for growth, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Once again, you will be limited to one question and one follow-up. At this time we would like to take our first question from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I have a question and then a follow-up. Regarding the DFT acquisition, what is the most up-to-date expectation on timing, maybe a sense of where we are on the potential as you see review and shareholder vote? And then I'm curious how you are working them vis-à-vis leasing pipeline if there is any sort cross over there to the extent that you're able to look to their inventory or if that's being kept completely separate.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And thanks, Jordan, this is Andy. In terms of timing we are right now, we put our initial proxy on file at the beginning of July, and we're readying that final version to out and solicit votes, from both the Digital Reality and the DFT shareholders in the coming weeks. And our best ballpark, I'd say on timing of the actual final tallying of the shareholder votes and the meeting, and ultimately closing this would be call it late third quarter, early fourth quarter. In terms of business planning, I can tell you there's a lot of activity going on, on the integration planning side, getting ready for the closing, day one and beyond. But with regard to competitive intelligence, chasing competitive deals. Right now, up until this transaction is approved and closed, we have to act as two separate independent companies and we're not sharing any information of the sort.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, as a follow-up I noticed that cross-connect volume was a bit lighter in the quarter relative to the last few quarter in terms of new cross-connect signed, and at the same time I noticed that you guys made this investment in June in Megaport so maybe likely unrelated, but maybe you could address both items?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll – I think, you were able to sneak four questions in here, but let me tackle the cross-connect volume and return. So, I would say it was a slight bit under the previous quarter in volumes of cross-connects, but there is obviously a numerous variations of products underlying in terms of physical cross-connect. So I think the better economic indicator looking at the Cross-connect revenue line item on the P&L, which is up year-over-year call it 20%, obviously there is a – not enough – there's an apples and oranges there from our acquisition in Europe, there wasn't in the numbers. On a more organic basis, just North America, the cross-connect revenue was up call it low teens, so we're quite pleased with that number. And then I think to your last and final question with regard to an investment we made and maybe I'll ask Jarrett to chime in on that front.
Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jordan, if you recall we launched the product, the service exchange in December. It's on track and it had a plan, we're continuing to expand to 17 markets by early 2018. We're still very supportive. We wanted to take a different approach and integrate it into our product, integrate it into our portal, we've enhanced the redundancy of the platform, but we also wanted to remain open in terms of future opportunities, the open service exchange environment to allow other options to come in. But we ended up investing the million because largely we wanted to really maintain close ties to that software development partner, because it's integrated in our interconnection platform with strong alignment, with our management team and their board, and we're staying very, very close in terms of the service development road map and also the go to market interest on behalf of our customers.
Operator: The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off on leasing, obviously the slowdown this quarter relative to last quarter came from international. Can you just remind us when you will be in a better position with capacity in those international markets where you're seeing that demand, so that you could potentially go after that and we could see a stronger number? And then just more broadly as it relates to that, just what are your expectations for leasing as we are sitting here now in the third quarter? And then just my other question had to do with additional M&A. I appreciate from a size perspective that DuPont is a very large transaction, but as you mentioned fairly simplistic hopefully in terms of the integration. To the extent if you see something out there that you want to go after that's large in nature, are you prevented from doing so or would you still have the ability to go after that?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Let me start off, Colby. What, Jordan, I think, started answer for two, we got three to four pattern here. So, we'll try to...
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: I've just two.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: -- clear these quickly.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Three, I'm sorry.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Your first question was on the signings and inventory timing. So, in the back of our financial supplement, we have our active development pipeline and in particular you will see in Europe, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London, deliveries of – on a largely concentrated on our campuses be it Crawley in London, the President in Amsterdam, and also in Frankfurt, deliveries call it late fourth quarter, early first quarter 2018. Late fourth quarter of 2017, early first quarter of 2018. So, that's where our larger footprint, that doesn't mean we're totally sold out in all those markets. We do have incremental capacity in Dublin, We do have – we're not a 100% leased from some of those campuses and we do have some capacity in our gateways, but the larger footprint capacity inventory supply chains coming on call back half of this year or early next year. Your second question, you said it was...
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Any color for the third quarter.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Colby, hi, this is Dan Papes, and thanks for your question. First you commented on the second quarter and it perhaps being a little later, I would like to just note that in the first half of 2017 we actually grew 17% year-over-year in total lease signed, new lease signings versus first half of 2016 and our colocation business grew 14% year-over-year in the first half 2017 versus 2016. And that's after you just for the – for the Telecity acquisition. So, a strong first half and you kind of note the uneven nature of demand in this industry, but when you look at the first half, it's something to feel pretty good about. But as we look at the third quarter, we like what we see from a pipeline perspective and a demand perspective both across the scale business and the colocation business. I would just say, I kind of extend that even to the second half, we like the pipeline, pipeline is one thing. The other is executing on that pipeline, which we plan to do. We've got a very strong team in place as I think you know we restructured the team in the first quarter. And we feel like we're well-positioned now to have a strong second half and third quarter as well. Now – now we're going about executing against that.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Colby, Scott here. Your last question was on additional M&A. Clearly, we're focused on integration right now of the existing acquisitions and getting the DuPont deal closed and integrated. Very important for us to get that right as we move forward. Certainly doesn't put us out of the game when it comes to considering and looking at other M&A opportunities and we'll continue to evaluate those that are consistent with our strategy. But we clearly will consider integration issues as we contemplate any of these other opportunities.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So just two questions. One, I know there's a drop in a rent from CenturyLink Cyxtera, are they consolidating their footprint or is that just the impact of breaking out CenturyLink from Cyxtera, were sent to – where some of that kind of get spoken out separately? And then the second question is just a little bit of market color, and I'm interested in which metros did you see the greatest kind of demand for interconnection and colocation bookings? Thank you.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. I'll start off on the one. So Cyxtera, CenturyLink that's the product of the transaction where CenturyLink sold its colocation business where they lease long term from Digital Realty numerous of those locations. And so, Cyxtera now becomes our top customer as a standalone business albeit CenturyLink did remain in equity ownership in that business. That business now being run by Manny Medina and his team, who has a long history with Digital and we're looking forward to support that customer and it's growth and in terms of activity with Cyxtera going forward, I'm pretty sure we've actually had some business together in terms of renewals subsequent to the transaction. So all things full steam ahead, CenturyLink is still a large customer with the sites, they aren't in the top customer list. It is not a top 20 customers anymore and they still have numerous network node deployments, probably largely concentrated in our Internet gateway facilities. And then in terms of trends and signings. I don't have the by market interconnection signs, I can tell you some stats on the – in terms of demand or the industry verticals. Go forward, Jarrett.
Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: It's Jarrett. Early trends we saw some good momentum in the new campus in Ashburn, with the colocation and the pull through there. Our traditional markets are strong on the interconnection trend. Chicago, New York, the Gateway, Santa Clara, those big three markets in North America. So – and we're seeing pull through, early pull through on some of the colocation as far as the service exchange launch as well. So, those were kind of the core markets we saw some growth.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. I'll just stick to my two questions. First on the merger, have you had any – I actually have that. How the customer conversations gone after the announcement and are there opportunities in specific markets that you had in some of those conversations that's kind of from the perspective of revenue synergies, and then, my other question is, this was partly asked earlier, but it's a little bit slightly different. You have $31 million in revenue, kind of at the forward year at this time last year, and if you look at the commencements now, it's sort of $11 million and wondering if any of that is related to just kind of changes in your – in enterprise time horizons when you're doing bookings or are there other factors that are kind of driving where you stand now versus where you stood this time last year?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Answer to your first question, Paul, the customer conversations have gone well. Obviously, we have a very different offering than DuPont has on a global basis as well as a smaller footprint offerings in the interconnection. So there has been a positive reception in that respect.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. So Paul, let me just add to Bill's comments. This is Dan Papes. Our customers like DuPont Fabros, and they like doing business with them. One of the things Bill mentioned in his opening monolog was that we thought that DuPont Fabros would add to our customer efforts to become ever more customer-centric and DuPont Fabros has a reputation in the marketplace for being such, and the feedback from our customers along those lines is, we like doing business with them and that will help us like doing business with you guys even more. Our customers are also, especially obviously our largest scale customers, like to know that we'll have if and when the merger closes that we're going to have the inventory that they need in the markets in which they are growing. One of the reasons obviously that we pursued the merger was because of the quality markets they are in, the quality products they have, and the quality products that they are building. So, the feedback we are getting from the market is, from our customers and some of our potential customers is universally of it.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then Paul on your second question, just to frame it, so I think you are referring to our rollout forward of our backlog table in slide 13 of the deck, where this year we have about a $11 million commencing in 2018 and the same period a year ago it was I believe $31 million. I think that's really just a product of the signs that have no commenced on the book. Last year I can think of at that time we had signed for some fairly large deals in like Osaka, Japan, where we had literally signed the deal before we had broken ground on the site. So these were much larger amount of signing with a forward commencing period. So, I think it's really a timing of inventory coming on relative to signings that are in the backlog, that's driving that. And then just lastly I want to circle back because John Stewart reminded me, he didn't think I appropriately addressed Jonathan Atkin's question, to make sure I was clear. The reason Cyxtera and CenturyLink disappeared from that number two tenant and Cyxtera appears is because CenturyLink sold its datacenter business, and Cyxtera is the new customer for those 20 assets that are on our top list. Just to be clear on that point.
Operator: And the next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon. I think, Bill made a comment in the prepared remarks regarding some large requirement for RFDs floating around in the marketplace. Just expand on that a bit?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Matt, can you come closer to the phone, it's hard to hear you.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Is that better?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes, thanks.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Yeah, so just with respect to the large requirements referred to in the prepared remark, I was hoping if you could just expand on that a bit, with respect to customer verticals or application types, a little color around that, and then also whether you think you have the right inventory in the right markets to be competitive on those deals?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: First the Vertical segment, Dan do you want to talk to, and I'll jump on the application.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, but momentarily.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay. Just from the application side, I think, Matt, one of the things we're seeing is the growth of performance-sensitive applications that are network that are latency dependent and throughput dependent, and that one is scale in the campuses. And if you look through that lens, we continue to see the cloud compute deploy, you've seen those are in smaller deployment sizes at this point. But we're excited enterprise private cloud and storage solutions to support that. There was a major wave in the last quarter, and frankly, over the last few weeks of all these new announcements to support enterprises, or part of the Azure platform or Oracle's platform, or VMware, for example. The big drivers right now we're starting to see in this deployment are higher power density solutions for application, artificial intelligence and machine learning that plays off of the cloud in hybrid cloud. And then, definitely mobility, we're seeing early days at the internet gateways of growth on the mobile applications as well. So, those are kind of the drivers and then Dan, if you want to talk to the vertical sectors?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, so thank you, Matthew. We, as I have previously stated have organized our go-to-market teams by what we call buyer types and verticals and we call them sectors. First is the Global Solutions sector, that's our cloud service providers and hyperscalers. And I think I mentioned that we see continued strong demand in that area. And we're going to continue to serve that, and the contemplated merger with DuPont Fabros is going to serve us well there. From an enterprise perspective, we think took our eyes off that in the previous couple of years, we now have our eyes staring straight at that market. And within the enterprise space the conversations we're having with clients all the time is about hybrid cloud. And what direction they should take or what direction some of them plan to take, and how we can serve them with – with the portfolio of solutions that we have both with the ability to go from a single cabinet to a multi-megawatt deployment, but also with our Connected Campus and service exchange capabilities. But we're a quarter-and-a-half into focusing on the enterprise in a different way and we're seeing that as a good thing for us to have done. And then in the network space we're seeing, I would – we don't report our number separately but from a sector perspective, our sales into the network space and our pipeline into the network space is one that we're very excited about and will continue to contribute positively in the future.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful color. Thank you, and just as a follow-up, it looks like there was a nice sequential improvement in retention ratio on primarily on the PBB side, but I was wondering if you could just comment on the TKF retention, which seems to be kind of tracking well below historical trend through the first half?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Matt. So, the – we agree we had fairly high retention both on PBB and colocation, PBB in the second quarter at 89% and colocation at 90% and the other thing I'd highlight is the lease tem, a lot of these transactions are fairly long; 7.7 years for TKF, 8.6 years for PBB, for weighted average across the all the products of just over eight years. With regard to TKF the retention dipped a little bit below the last 12 months and obviously a little below the historical average. It was a slightly lighter renewal on the quantum, it's about 20% of the last 12 months average in terms expiring sort of fees, so the sample set was a little smaller, in particular there was a megawatt or 2 megawatt expiration, where the customer decided to not retain with us on that specific lease, but actually consolidated their applications and their load into other space that they had taken with us on that same campus in a building where they had more room to grow. So, a bit of moving the puzzle pieces together, but obviously a technical non-retention and that is on one of our campuses in one of the top 40 North America markets, where you see strong demand and we had strong new signings in that market. So, I know we've released a portion of that but I think we will be able to quickly release in the interim.
Operator: The next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. Just a question on guidance. Last quarter you talked about how the first quarter and the fourth quarter were going to the highest and it sound like the second quarter will be a down quarter, and clearly we are up this quarter. I'm just kind of curious where did we come in – where did you guys come in above your own expectations this quarter versus what you had expected last quarter, and I'm trying to figure out how that doesn't flow through to the rest of guidance? I appreciate, yeah, for the financing coming, but it would seem to me that revenue and EBITDA is trending ahead of your expectations.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Jon. So we beat our internal reforecast by handful of pennies, I would say 50% of that was operational and the other 50% was financing and other items in the P&L. On the operational piece, there were some good wins, but not all of it flows though, a one-time item or two. And on the financing some of that is a product of delaying our sterling bond offering which we had anticipated doing earlier in the quarter, but obviously we are caught off sides and being able to access couple of markets while we're in M&A discussions and ultimately wind up this transaction. So that transaction, we may end up moving forward that till in July. So we are little ahead for the quarter. When you look at back half of the year, where Digital Realty standalone, it's a bit of a delay actually in terms of what we said last quarter where we thought it was going to be a strong first half and a little bit of step down in the back half just got pushed a quarter. The things that we have working against us and offsetting some of our revenue gains are some operational seasonality, things that's of some – on a colocation, we're having exposure to the power cost that we've in the summers. And then there is also our dispositions we have not closed any of those dispositions yet, although our team is working hard and making great progress. But obviously when you sell assets that are income producing, you lose FFO, rate allocates, and I think that timing of those disposal will be kind of backend loaded. And then just lastly holistically on guidance, we do – we do have some handful of pennies in negative carry. We upsized the Sterling bond offering and now portion of that Sterling bond offering will go to ultimately refinance the DFT transaction. And then we have the moving parts of the remaining U.S. dollar long-term financings and the ultimate timing of closing the DFT transaction. So, we felt it more prudent to leave our current core FFO guidance as it is for now and then come back and update you post-closing of those transaction.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just – just one follow-up on DFT, one thing I heard you guys talk about is the customers like doing business with DFT, or at least the customers they had like doing business with them. Just kind of curious what you can do to, I guess, keep those relationships strong and kind of what it is about what they like doing business with DFT. Now that you had a little more time to kind of research the process there, is it the design of the buildings, is there a certain key people that need to be kept, is it lease structures, just maybe a little more details on what you guys think you need to keep that culture?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, John. This is Dan Papes. A few things that we've observed. One is that DFT they have very close, I would call it, business relationships at very senior levels with our customers and interact with them frequently. They have a smaller number of customers, so at some degree they are able to do that, but it's also cultural and there are some people there that will add few our culture from a customer centricity perspective that we think will be helpful. They also have some customer support processes that we haven't been able to dive into deep detail with, but the way they interact with our customers on a regular basis from an operations perspective has been shared with us from our shared client base and we feel like that out of our operations group we'll gain benefits from that from the processes and the philosophies with which they used to manage their customer relationships day to day. So, those are some of the things that we've observed and that we're going to try to leverage should the merger close, and I'm sure there'll be other things that we'll uncover as we go that tell us why those customers enjoy doing business with them, will enjoy doing business with us together.
Operator: The next question will come...
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: The only..
Operator: I'm sorry, go ahead.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I'm sorry. Sorry, Denise to interrupt you. The only thing I would add is I think that the key element is not being "single courted" on your relationships, and having the team at the executive level at the site, in design extraction, in sales and operations all supporting these huts for day in and day out. They certainly had some early wins with some large customers and they were able to support those growth, and showing that great support and success was translated into incremental wins over time. And think of large customers that land and expand them in ASH1 campus and continue to want to do so. That's very similar to here at Digital, we had some great some wins with likes of ridesharing company and another social company and we're early with them, and we had great experience with them so. I think, we've come together with two similar cultures, and I think, it's going to be a great combination together.
Operator: And the next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Hey everyone. Just a follow-up on the last question. Just in terms of closed business relationships that you mentioned, do you have visibility on how successfully you will be able to keep those folks have those relationships?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey Vin, this is Andy, again. I can tell you we made that a high priority here at Digital, Bill out of the gate spent significant amount of time, great meeting with team and the field throughout the entire organization. just in the last handful of weeks, I've spent a fair amount of time with Scott Davis and team going through all the three core North American campuses, sitting down with their operational team in the field, the guys and ladies and gentlemen that are day-in day-out supporting those customers and their mission-critical infrastructure and we try to give insurances that our goal is to have them as long time here at Digital going forward.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay. And Vin, this is Dan. I'll just add to that. Bill has made very clear to us and with the approach here that we agree with, which is we didn't just buy some very high quality assets, if we – when -- if and when the merger closes, there are also some best practices and some cultural elements, some of – what some of those that I just mentioned in my – in my previous comments that our value here that we want to retain and leverage and so forth, that includes, that includes people. So it's what we see here is we're – we're probably acquiring, we are acquiring some industry best practices that in some cases might be better than the way we do things today. And we want to go ahead and leverage those. And some strong people with not only who have strong relationships with customers, but also some strong people from a delivery and design perspective as well. So our idea here is to capitalize on the multi-pronged portions of DuPont Fabros that goes beyond the assets, includes the people, the processes and elements of the culture.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks for that. On a totally different topic, I mean, you mentioned, Bill you talked about the G&A margin, the leading G&A margin of the combined entity, and I was just curious is there an opportunity been in sort of $7 million to $8 million bookings level here on the interconnection side for a while. Curious if you were to step up the investment on the G&A side, is there an opportunity to really bolster that booking number or do you think that that's not really the way to get that number higher?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I mean, Vin. I think we do need some additional sales resources, Dan is looking. But I don't think he is fully staffed quite yet. So it's not going to hit G&A in a material way. But with the right sales sources in a couple of his sectors, we can certainly move that number.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Vincent, a few comments from me. As the leader of the sales organization, we – I would say, as Bill mentioned, a marginal amount of additional sales resources, we think would be helpful here. We're also very focused on the quality of our resources. We have made some significant, I would say, upgrades in the quality of our sales people, and some of them may cost a little bit more, but we – if we take on less of them and they are more productive, that's very helpful to us. The equation comes out the same from a cost perspective. And so, we – that's the approach we're taking. I don't see a need, and I don't go ask Bill and Andy for meaningful or impactful from a financial perspective additional sales head count at this time. I think, we drive based on the head count that we have today, and make sure it's quality head count.
Operator: The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about kind of bigger picture given the DuPont acquisition and other company, certain companies focusing on big could providers. How should we think about the hyperscale cloud business? It's lumpy, but it seems like it can last for a while, do you see this as a multi-year type of business that is worth going after or is it something that it's just kind of the here and now, and wanted to get your sense on that.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rich. This is Bill. You hit it right, it's lumpy, unquestionably lumpy, it's getting lumpier, I think. I think the potential orders are getting bigger. And I think, it's here for the foreseeable future, at least we have – we don't have any indications yet, that it's waning. Dan, do you want to add to that?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes, Richard, just to add to that, I think, Bill uses the right term foreseeable future. When we talk to our large customers, cloud service providers, and those aren't CSPs, that are hyperscalers, they don't talk about a trough in 2018 or anything like that. Their plans seem to be to continue to grow, it's just not to get too basic about it. But the fact of the matter is, the amount of the data is exploding, and the amount of processing is exploding, the need for storage is exploding. And it's hard when you just kind of look at what happen in the IT industry today, and the demands of customers for more or more data, just if you look out as far as you can see, and you just can't see why it would diminish anytime within our line of sight. So, we think – we just think, it's going to continue, and we're going to keep going after it.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then to follow-up a little bit on the acquisition. In terms of – and I appreciate if you do want to provide specific customer, but Facebook is a significant customer of yours, it's 1.6 years average lease term, DuPont has got some renewals up and coming, how is that going to be handled in terms of renewals for both the companies in terms of dealing with larger customers that are coming up?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Richard, and obviously just want to reiterate up until the transaction closes we are operating as two independent companies. So, the DFT team is handling renewals as well as new leasing with their customer base and we're doing the same with our customer base on our side of the table. I can tell you for the larger customer, the larger hyperscalers, cloud service providers or names that you've referenced, we're in active discussion on renewals and in locations where we have them with near term expirations, there what they have expressed to us is desire to stay and renew on a long term basis. And these are the customers that in other locations they have recently grown with us. So, the leases have just recently commenced, or will be commencing soon. I would anticipate the DFT side is having similar types of conversations with their customer base and many of these are the same customers.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I think also you can look at DuPont's addressed this issue particularly with Facebook in their Q4 2016 prepared remarks and then again in Q1 of 2017 and that will give you a little color, but there's probably not a lot add to that.
Operator: And the next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Just a little bit of upside on some of the tenant reimbursements that we are looking for, just curious is anything going on there, anything one time and then you mentioned you acquiring Green Power and I keep hearing this from others in the industry as a growing demand. It's becoming a little bit more of a focus from some of the customers. What do you think that you're doing there that maybe others are not that's enabling you to source more Green Power and how do you plan to meet that need going forward?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Sure, Richard. There is nothing that materially comes to mind as episodic on the reimbursements either on the consolidated basis or on a same capital basis, but happy to follow-up with you offline if there is something we see there. On the Green initiative and I will open this up obviously to Jarrett and team here. I think a few things, I think our scale and our creditworthiness as a counterparty has been a differentiating factor. I know that is something that when we entered into our wind farm purchase agreement several quarters ago, we could financially provides sustainable Green Power to a North America colocation footprint, that they were seeking an investor grade credit rated party, which was kind of linked to the ultimate financings to get that project up and running. And being the only investor grade data center REIT, we are the only one out there to really offer that. Jarrett, is there anything else do you want to add on the Green front?
Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks. The vision was really predates me, Bill really set up the dedicated team to set up a sustainability vision, had a dedicated team. And then we've engaged from our product and with sales, if we sort of the – kind of we've interviewed the customers and they're really seeing value on it. So, we started with the wind power deal, but we covered our colocation product with this. We've since augmented with solar initiatives, and there is a whole team now working – a power working group that is working on that focus, and you can see the results as we were really announcing this quarter. You are seeing that being recognized now in the industry as a leadership role and we're committed to that globally.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And you are correct, Frank, it's important to our customers.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking your question. So, in looking at your customer lists, it looks like you had some really nice gains quarter-over-quarter with some of your top customers like Uber, Oracle and NaviSite, particularly stood out, but it also looks like Rackspace returned 14,000 square feet and reduced its annualized rent. I was wondering if the reduction from Rackspace is what is reflected in the 65% retention ratio in the turnkey category? And secondly, since they are 9% customer of DuPont Fabros and I believe that last we saw them, they were somewhat underutilized on their commitment of space although that's a while before they went private. What do you see? Is there a possibility of more return space from them going forward?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Rob. And obviously, due to confidentiality reasons, we don't like to speak to specific customers ins and outs, but if a customer's location is decreasing, that would obviously fall in the non-retain bucket of an expiration. There's certain customers, and I have bought it in the names, like the name you mentioned that has taken space down with us over time in multiple suites in a campus and sometimes they want to consolidate their infrastructure to be more centralized or take up an entire building versus having it in multiple buildings across the campus. So, there are some times we're moving parts and consolidation comes to play. And our retained space is not necessarily an awful thing, because incremental deliveries they may have already leased with us maybe commencing coming online. So, not necessarily specific to the name you mentioned, but that's a trend we've seen and really part of our value proposition where a customer can land with us and know their business model is going to be future proofed based on the series of buildings we have on campuses in hundreds of acres that we have adjacent to it.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay, thanks, and if I could just do one follow-up. In light of the DuPont acquisition, could you just restate your view point on sort of very large hyperscale single-tenant assets and the construction of them going forward who are participating in those opportunities?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We are certainly seeking to participate in those opportunities with the – just to refresh everyone's memory and the DFT team filed their second quarter earnings release this morning, they've an active pipeline of projects that are in construction and some of which I toured in the last several weeks meeting the team, and there were call it – almost 80 megawatts of active development across their core markets, and those are roughly half preleased, with great customers commencing leases but leaving space that will be coming online and be readily available to lease for large footprint or small footprint scale customers. So we remain committed to the full product spectrum from the (1:06:55) up to the hyperscale.
Operator: And the next question will come from Andrew DeGasperi of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask first on the acquisition with DuPont. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment now that most of your customers know you're obviously going to merge and are you seeing potentially any delays in your agreements because of that or any potential opportunities on the flip side for that matter?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Andrew, given the fact that we must be fiduciaries to our independent shareholders and act – operate independently. I have not seen any change in terms of competitive nature or delays to business to-date.
Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And I just want to follow-up. As far as your synergy number for the acquisition, I know you're still probably tight lipped about it, but since you've been doing the due diligence for a while, is there a potential for expanding that number at this point?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would just – at this point, which we are now call it just over almost two months since the acquisition and based on the fact that we did extensive diligence of this business and this team, and prior to the transaction, I think I would right now currently would reiterate the, call it, $18 million-ish of overhead, which is I would say 70%-ish of their G&A.
Operator: And the next question will come from Mathew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for coming back around to me. Just regarding the topic of green energy and your initiatives there over the last several months. What do you think that brings to the conversation regarding some key renewals in DuPont's portfolio and just with respect to kind of your capabilities and your rankings in those – in the green power area relative to DuPont and your capabilities there?
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say, where the puff is going on Green is – it's going to become more of a table stakes requirement for any of these large sophisticated customers and consumers of power. And I think we have some competitive advantage today given how long we've been making sustainability a priority to digital. The financial benefits I mentioned as a counterparty to secure the – secure green power. So I think we're very much aligned with what our customers want from sustainability and green front, and I think we're only going to as a combined company with DFT, be able to offer the – that offering to our customers in a likely lower cost and more comprehensive way.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today, by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page. We set the stage for continued future value creation, with an agreement to merge with DuPont Fabros, a high-quality, highly complementary portfolio, concentrated in top tier U.S. metros, in an accretive transaction that strengthens our balance sheet and expands our relationship with the blue-chip customer base. We also continue to support the growth of a diverse mix of customers who are driving the digital economy with a healthy level of new business and record renewal activity. We delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.05. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet by settling the remainder of our forward equity offering using the proceeds to redeem high coupon preferred and opportunistically raising an ample mix of attractively priced debt capital. We finished the quarter with the debt-to-EBITDA at approximately 5 times and fixed charge coverage over 4 times. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and we hope you enjoyed the dark days of Zorro.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, we would like to limit the questions to one and one follow-up. This event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, see our 2016 10-K (01:17). This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today with a discussion about governance. As you may recall, we announced last year that our Board of Directors expects to appoint Laurence Chapman as Chairman of the Board at our upcoming annual meeting in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. Laurence will take over as Chairman from Dennis Singleton, who is standing for re-election and is expected to continue serving on the board after he steps down as Chairman. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that Mary Hogan Preusse will be joining our board as well. Many of you may know Mary. She has spent the past 17 years at APG Asset Management, where she has served as a portfolio manager, most recently with responsibility for managing all of the firm's public real estate investments in North and South America, totaling over $13 billion in assets. APG is a leading advocate for shareholder-friendly corporate governance structures and responsible real estate investing. APG has also been one of our top ten actively managed shareholders for the past 12 years. So Mary is intimately familiar with our business, given her portfolio management responsibilities. We are delighted to bring Mary's institutional shareholder perspective to the boardroom and we look forward to welcoming her to our board. You may also recall that last year, we announced the appointment of Mark Patterson and Afshin Mohebbi to our board as well. Mark brings deep real estate expertise to the board, whereas Afshin's extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors adds a highly complementary skill set. The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. Following Mary's appointment, 6 of our 10 directors who have joined the board within the past four years. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered board. The majority of our directors' compensation is paid in stock. Each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company. The board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014, the substantial majority of management's long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along similar lines, we recently added our support to The Corporate Colocation and Cloud Buyers' Principles and the mission of future Internet power to power the Internet with 100% renewable energy. In addition, we achieved our 20% energy reduction target under the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge nearly five years ahead of schedule. Let's turn now to our go-to-market approach on page 3. When he joined in November, Dan Papes' first order of business was to fully integrate the sales and marketing organizations of Telx and the recently acquired European assets into a single global sales force. This integration was completed early in the first quarter. These two acquisitions were transformative transactions for Digital Realty, more than tripling our customer count. Given this evolution, as well as the significant share of repeat business from existing customers, it is critical for us to become as customer-centric an organization as we have ever been. To best capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of us, we restructured our sales force during the first quarter to better align our sales efforts with our customers' buying behavior. Our sales force is now organized into three customer buying groups: Global Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and Network Solutions. We expect these changes will help us deepen our relationships with our customers and fully leverage the strengths of our global multi-product platform. It is still early days and we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we are encouraged by the early results as evidenced by the solid bookings during the first quarter. In addition to these three sales segments, we are investing in our channel program to support our go-to-market strategy. As mentioned last quarter, we believe the channel program holds considerable promise for Digital Realty. We expect our partners and alliances will enable us to reach customers we otherwise would not, employing an efficient cost of sales structure. We have important relationships with IBM and AT&T, which are providing growth, particularly in the enterprise segment, which we see opportunity for enterprise end-users to benefit from the services and solutions that our partners can offer to their customers. During the first quarter, our channel program influenced a low single-digit percentage of our total bookings. In order to build upon that base, we hired a seasoned executive from a Fortune 50 leading IT services provider. Building a profitable, sustainable and growth-oriented partner ecosystem will require focus and commitment. We expect this effort will begin to pay dividends for us later this year and into next year. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets but so does net absorption, as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines, and where available capacity has been recently delivered, it has also been rapidly absorbed. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears watching carefully. However, demand continues to outpace supply. Competitors are behaving rationally and new entrants have largely targeted stabilized investments rather than speculative development. In summary, development pipelines are active but pre-leasing is healthy, market vacancy is tight, current construction is concentrated in core markets, characterized by robust leasing activity and the scars from the last cycle are still fresh. Now let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. While the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remain uncertain, the current monetary fiscal and regulatory climate is broadly supportive. In addition, the index of leading economic indicators has continued to climb and recently hit a new high while interest rates have leveled off somewhat. Against this favorable macroeconomic backdrop, the secular shift towards corporate IT outsourcing appears to be accelerating. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup, given our global platform, our comprehensive product offering and our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power, to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with the leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the first quarter were a little over $50 million, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million during the first quarter, including an $11 million colocation contribution. The first quarter activity played to our strengths. We transacted in 21 of our 33 global markets during the first quarter and roughly 20% of first quarter customers transacted with us in multiple markets. Approximately two-thirds of our activity was concentrated in North America, with the balance evenly split between Europe and Asia. The quarter did not hinge on any one transaction. The largest single deal was just 3.2 megawatts and colocation and interconnection accounted for nearly 40% of our total bookings. We added 28 new logos during the first quarter and we signed over 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 900 transactions. First quarter wins included numerous signings from top cloud service providers, specialized cloud verticals and other vibrant customers driving the digital economy. Our wins included new customer deployments in new markets as well as continued expansion of existing customer infrastructure within our portfolio. These signings were both big and small and landed within our footprint of urban infill Internet gateways as well as larger scale campus locations across four continents. On the enterprise front, our wins included strong customer demand from both IT service providers, as well as numerous enterprise customers that came directly to Digital, including a large U.S. healthcare company, a multinational semiconductor and software firm and a global investment management firm. In terms of integration, we're off to a strong start in 2017. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we combined our European teams during the fourth quarter. In 2017, we're focused on consolidating our systems and streamlining our processes. You can see one byproduct from this process visible in the face of the P&L this quarter. We have collapsed the repairs and maintenance expense line item into the rental property operating expense line. We will do our best to minimize any external facing impact from the integration process. In this instance, however, the efficiencies gained, as we sunset multiple general ledger systems, were significant enough to make the changes worthwhile. In addition to general ledger systems, we have also unified our product offerings under a single Digital Realty brand and we expect to go through a product rationalization later this year. Our colocation expansion plans are underway and we're beginning to generate revenue synergies with customer wins and new cross-selling opportunities. We currently have in the works an expansion of our Service Exchange from eight U.S. markets to a total of 17 markets across our three major geographic regions by year-end. In addition, we will be rolling out Layer 3 capabilities in the coming months to enable SaaS providers on this Service Exchange. Finally, by the end of the year, we expect to have substantially completed integration of our recent acquisitions into our ongoing operations. Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $79 million. The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements remained healthy at less than three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9. Tenant retention was well below our historical average at 42% during the first quarter, driven by two somewhat unique move-outs. The first was a 3-megawatt deployment in Silicon Valley, previously occupied by an online gaming company, whose needs had shrunk. This capacity has been completely re-leased. The second was a Powered Base Building move-out in Atlanta. The single tenant customer had occupied the building for 13 years and had invested significant capital to build out a customized data center solution. We were unable to come to terms on a renewal. And while re-leasing this space will require both time and capital, the existing infrastructure provides a compelling opportunity to redevelop a Powered Base Building shell into fully built-out data center product at an attractive cost basis. Atlanta is a core data center market with competitive power cost and a suburban scale offering would be highly complementary to our dominant colocation and interconnection hub at 56 Marietta. This property is also adjacent to a 1 million square foot campus owned and operated by a top 3 cloud service provider. Preliminary project footing is underway and we expect to proceed with the redevelopment subject to market demand. Excluding these two special situations, our tenant retention during the first quarter would have been north of 80% across all property types. In terms of renewal leasing activity, we signed $46 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. Cash re-leasing spreads were up 3.1% overall with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the first quarter, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals. We do still have pockets of above-market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the first quarter and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finished lease expirations. In terms of our first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 89.4%. Same capital portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points sequentially due to incremental leasing, primarily in the West region. You may recall that on the past couple of earnings calls, we've discussed taking assignment of a colocation reseller customer's PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago. And we mentioned last quarter that we're negotiating the lease to backfill roughly 25% of the space that will bring us back to breakeven. I'm pleased to report that we signed that lease during the first quarter and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters. The U.S. dollar's steadied upward march leveled off somewhat during the first quarter. As you can see from the chart, at the bottom of page 10, however, the dollar was considerably stronger in the first quarter of 2017 relative to the first quarter of 2016, given the spikes following Brexit in June and the U.S. Presidential Election in November. As a result, while comps should begin to get easier in the second half of the year, FX still represented roughly 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. Same capital cash NOI growth was 3.4% on a reported basis for the first quarter and 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and was up nearly 9% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share was $0.06 ahead of the consensus although the first quarter may be somewhat of a high watermark for the first part of the year as you can see here on page 12. We don't typically give quarterly guidance but it's important to note that we expect the run rate to dip down in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter due to a combination of higher property tax accruals, higher G&A expense related to promotions, merit increases and timing of stock grants, as well as the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May. In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first and fourth quarters will represent a little over 51% of the full year figure while the second and third quarters are expected to represent a little less than 49%. We also expect to record a $0.04 Topic D-42 charge during the second quarter related to the redemption of our Series F Preferred Stock in early April. This non-cash charge will be excluded from non – from core FFO per share. As you may have also seen from the press release, we raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the outperformance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year. Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 13. As mentioned, we expect to settle the remainder of the forward equity offering at expiration on May 19. We also expect to realize up to $200 million of proceeds from non-core asset sales. In addition we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends. Finally, we expect to raise up to $500 million of long-term fixed rate debt. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will most likely look to further our FX hedging strategy with a sterling bond offering later this year. In terms of uses of capital, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January. In April, we redeemed the $182.5 million liquidation value of our 6.625% Series F Preferred Stock. We are on track to spend $125 million to $135 million of recurring CapEx and $800 million to $1 billion of development CapEx in 2017. Spending on both categories ran below expectations last year, but picked up in the first quarter. In terms of the components of AFFO, we would also like to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, as shown on page 14. This chart reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline, which has driven steady growth in our cash flows and sustained the improvement in the quality of our earnings. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. We ended the first quarter with fixed charge coverage above four times and debt-to-EBITDA below five times. We expect debt-to-EBITDA to hover right around five times for the rest of the year. I'm pleased to report that S&P acknowledged the strength of our financial condition and the favorable industry backdrop as they revised the outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive during the first quarter. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: I would be happy to. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session The first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. So I've got a question about the sales force. And if you could talk a little bit more about the kind of the realignment efforts. Where do things stand now in terms of (23:16) and then how did the sales roles change in light of the products alignments that Andy was talking about?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Andy, do you want to cover that?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jonathan, thanks for that question. We restructured our sales team in early in the first quarter, as Bill mentioned in his beginning comments. And what we did there was we decided to organize our sales team to sell to our customers in a way they buy, cloud service providers buy differently than enterprises and differently than network solution providers. What we've done is trained our sales team around these solutions. We've also hired skilled resources onto the team in order to make sure that we're providing expertise and solutions to our customers' opportunities and problems. And we're deepening those skills throughout the year. We saw some positive impact from that in the first quarter, as you can see from the strong sales numbers that we turned in. But we also expect that as our skills deepen and our relationships deepen and the strategy itself takes hold that we'll see continued progress as a result. It's not an overnight dramatic doubling of sales kind of an impact. But it, over time, will be the right strategic move. And again, we saw impact from that in the first quarter that we thought was very positive. I think it's important to note that we did do the restructuring at the beginning of the first quarter. It was a major restructuring and integration of the Telx, Digital and Telecity assets. And yet still turned in a strong quarter, which we feel very good about.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Do you have a, kind of, a targeted portion of bookings that you would look to be generated by channel partners over time as well as a mix between wholesale versus retail?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We do. So, first of all, the mix that we had in the first quarter, Jonathan, we were very comfortable with. Other than the fact that we want to grow our channel opportunities significantly over time, this balance of about 60% of scale business and 40% of colo business is one that we're comfortable with and we'd like to maintain over time. As it relates to channels and alliances, Bill mentioned in his opening comments as well that we did low single digits of the business that we did – booked in the first quarter through our channel partners. That is something that we're very focused on changing. I'm not going to give you a, necessarily, a percentage target of our sales right now that we'd like to generate through the channel, except to tell you that we'd like it to be meaningfully higher than that and I think it's probably safe to say that at some point in 2018, to make it double-digit portion of our bookings, the percentage of our bookings in 2018. We think that we can get there. Change of focus on channels and partners and alliances is a meaningful endeavor and takes new processes and methodologies for working with partners. The leader that we've hired from a top IT managed services provider, who has extensive channel experience, has that reengineering of our channel organization underway. And, I think, starting in the fourth quarter and certainly in 2018, you'll start seeing impacts that really matter in those areas, which will be positive.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to come back to the overall leasing volume in the quarter and then maybe the composition of it. I think Andy, in your commentary, you identified the largest deal as 3.2 megs. I'm curious, one, what the demand funnel looks like, maybe for Dan, if you could talk about it in the context of how it's built over the quarter and where we really stand? And then just within that funnel, what you're seeing, if anything, from the CSPs?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jordan, this is Andy, maybe I'll speak to give you a little more color on the quarter, then let's see what you can get out of Dan on our pipeline. So if you look at the total amount of signings for the quarter, the – we had a similar concentration in kind of that SMACC vertical, which is cloud and other parts of the digital economy, which is about 65% of the total volume. What was a little bit different this quarter is that about – of that component, it was more heavily weighted to other parts of the digital economy relative to just the top cloud service providers. We still had a significant portion, I think, a third of that chunk I just described was top cloud service providers but there's a lot – there's a whole bunch of other parts of specialty clouds, other parts of companies that are part of the digital economy and have their businesses over the Internet, were a driver. And then rounded out, the other 35% of the total demand, was a combination of IT service providers and a host of other customers, which I'd probably characterized as enterprise. So, we really attacked enterprise customers two ways with our – a great group of IT service providers and also enterprise that come to us directly. That mix has been fairly consistent. But it did pick up a little bit at the end of the last year and into the first quarter. And I'll turn it over to Dan, if he wants to touch on pipeline.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, yes. Jordan, thanks for the question. Our pipeline for the second and third quarters, which I tend to look at it over multiple quarters at this time, looks to have a similar mix to what Andy described that we saw in the first quarter and then what we've seen in the past. I will say that the demand in all areas, in interconnection, in colocation and in our scale business, looks to us to be very solid. And it's our job to go out and capture that business but we're pleased to have the opportunities out in front of us to go after and try to capture. So the demand funnel looks good and again, will drive those results that you'll see in the coming quarters.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just a follow-up on the FFO flow through the year, Andy. Any insight you could offer in terms of the contribution of the $68 million of backlog that's starting in 2017? And maybe an explanation as to how much the G&A is going to fluctuate?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, we intentionally wanted to make sure we didn't have any surprises here because we do have a little bit of a funky quarterly distribution of our core FFO per share this year. So we did have a little bit of a pull forward of some good news on the revenue and NOI front during the quarter. We had a positive outcome on a property tax accrual. So, we do see a quarter-to-quarter step down, due to some of those good newses not repeating themselves. And the G&A is going to pick up, based on timing of when we did our promotions, merit increases and stock grants. And then we do have a decent portion of our backlog that comes in back half of the year. I think, I'm not sure if that's included in our prepared remarks, we signed our – a lease for the second phase of Osaka, which is – that property is essentially now fully leased and we've also purchased a land parcel for expansion of that campus. Both the first customer and the second customer that will be landing in Osaka are late back half of 2017 revenue event. So they'll be coming on in the fourth quarter and providing some growth going into 2018.
Operator: And the next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. The first is, I'm looking at slide seven and I'm looking at slide 18. And I'm wondering, to what extent you have the opportunity for this $50 million in bookings to become more of a run rate for the company and kind of help that curve on – the bars on chart 18, given you have a bigger presence in Europe now, you're growing in Asia, as you mentioned, you've got interconnection as a more pressing focus. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how to think about where the new run rate for this business should be? And if you're able to get there, does that change the way FFO and AFFO can grow on a go-forward basis? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll just highlight some of the components that got us to north of $50 million signings this quarter, which I do think lend itself to additional strong quarters in 2017. Although I – we can't promise and I can't promise north of $50 million every quarter of 2017. I mean, you're 100% right. One way to generate incremental revenue is to do that in incremental footprint. And I think you saw that in a few pockets of our portfolio in the first quarter. I already talked about our wins in Osaka. If you hop over to Europe for a second, I can tell you that we had a fairly large signing within a new customer to Digital in Dublin. We had a similar – existing digital customer that anchor our scale campus deployment in Amsterdam. We also had some wins on the colocation front. So we had expansion in both U.S. and Europe in terms of colocation signing wins. And I can tell you, Frankfurt is coming online, from a campus perspective, at the back half of 2017. We haven't signed any major leases there to date, but we have had smaller wins in Frankfurt, including a digital – long time digital relationship, a colocation customer that was seeking colocation footprint. We are able to place them into one of those eight assets we acquired last summer with a 250-kilowatt or 240-kilowatt colocation footprint. But they came to us, not just because of that, seeking that deployment, but also our relationship and the fact that they could see the growth into our campus down the road in the future. So lots of positive momentum. New places to sell that could lend itself to continued steady-eddy growth in our signings. And that's obviously what we're seeking. And I don't know if anyone else wants to chime in here on that front.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Michael, it's Dan Papes. So, just to add to Andy's comments. I talked about the balance that we had in the quarter, the contributions from interconnection, colocation and scale. And Andy had mentioned that our – the deal sizes in the scale side of the business were in this 2-megawatt to 5-megawatt range. We do think that that combination, that healthy balance of sales across our portfolio should provide us, over time, the ability to provide sort of less lumpy kinds of quarters. But it's the nature of this business, given the fact that some of those larger transactions happen, the 5 mega – when you get towards the 5-megawatt transactions, there'll still be some up and down over quarters. But I think over time, you'll be able to draw the line in the bar chart that shows a consistent upward trend. And again, I think the balance that we have across the portfolio really helps us a lot in regards to that.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And if you're able to achieve that level, would that be a catalyst for upside in your outlook for FFO and the opportunity for AFFO? Or is this a type of activity that's now priced into your guidance for 2017?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: If you're able to kind of exceed our internal lease expectations and kind of hit the right-hand side of that guidance table on, call it, page 5 or 6 of our financial supplement, I mean, we see tremendous flow through and you see that by the fact of our operating margins at the property level or EBITDA level. So those will certainly be indicators that pushes through the higher end, if not, above the higher end of the guidance. But again, it's only – we got three quarter – three months, one quarter done, so we got a long way to go still.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Mike, one thing I'd like to add is, to the extent we are doing this business outside the U.S. and because we match fund, the interest costs are lower outside the U.S. than they are in the U.S. right now. So there's an incremental effect there.
Operator: And the next question will come from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Just in terms of the – I don't know if this is provided somewhere, I missed it in the sup or something. But in terms of the kind of the quarterly pace of FFO that you mentioned in one of the slides in the presentation, I assume that chart is just kind of illustrative, because it looks like a much bigger impact versus kind of the 51%-49% breakout between kind of what you provided. But do you have any numbers on kind of the G&A impact and the property taxes, just to kind of quantify their impact on the quarters?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Paul, we try to stick with the precedents, and the precedent here has been to give annual guidance and not provide the quarterly granularity. And we certainly help to work with modeling questions off-line, if anyone would like to discuss. We just – given that a little bit of a pickup in G&A, pick up in G&A was like roughly around 6% of our revenue. So, obviously trending towards the low-end of our guidance range. That's going to be a little bit of a haircut. And we also have some capital stack items, which have been not there. The last leg of our forward equity offering will close out in that 2.4 million shares to our share count. So those items, in particular, are obviously going to create a little bit of a step down from the first quarter to the second quarter for core FFO per share. But we see that being offset with additional revenue from our properties in the back half of the year.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And I could follow up on a couple of line items, I guess. And just my other question on Service Exchange, you've had, I guess, five or six months now that you've kind of been operational in the eight markets and you're about to kind of double that, I guess. Are there any takeaways from your experience so far? And kind of how you're seeing that as a driver of kind of the interconnection and colo sides of the business? And in terms of maybe what kind of customer segmentation is seeing the most take-up? And how material a driver could be over the next year or so?
Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Paul, this is Jarrett. It's still early days, we actually launched in December. And we really – we're pleased and on track and slightly ahead of plan. It is changing the dialogue we're having with our customers, especially around the broader interconnection value. We can now do that all through our portal. Day one, our customers get private access to the top three cloud service providers from all our sites, so that's Microsoft, Google, AWS and now, Oracle. And I'll give you just three quick examples, we – just this quarter; we did – a global managed service provider is now offering high-bandwidth secure access for multi-cloud to support hybrid cloud for enterprise. So they're winning enterprise deals. And as part of the deal in Frankfurt, they actually required us to have a Service Exchange launch there. There's a global system integrator who is using Service Exchange now to allow self-service for their customers on our interconnection platform in Virginia and multiple sites. And then there's a disruptive new kind of hyper-converged player who is actually using the Service Exchange to provision in an automated fashion, using our Service Exchange platform in – on the West Coast. And so we're seeing different use cases. We're communicating that through the sales team and channel. But again, this is really our first full quarter of launching that product.
Operator: The next question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC: Thanks. Hey, guys. One of your peers this morning talked about an improvement in the New York market. Is that something you're seeing as well?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I think there was some commentary around New Jersey in particular. I'd say the New York market for us is a little bit bifurcated. We still have fairly dominant positions with their Internet gateways into the city, which is obviously focused on performance-sensitive colocation and interconnection points. We continue to see strong demand, be it 111 8th, 60 Hudson, 32 Avenue of Americas. Out in New Jersey, we're not – we don't have a ton of available space. We've not been a active developer really in that market given the retrenching of the demand for a while. We did do a handful leasing, but I think you'll see our 2 Peekay Building in New Jersey, that's – occupancy has picked up in the last quarter. But I wouldn't – relative to other things or wins we had during the quarter, I wouldn't say that was a standout market for us.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC: That's helpful. And then looking at the presentation, it looks like the slide focused on Telx is gone. Can you comment at all about the things that were used to be on that slide in terms of how the business is trending relative to your expectations?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So we sunsetted that slide with kind of the year one completion of our underwriting and meeting and exceeding them on all of our financial objectives. Broadly speaking, integration from the Telx transaction is really down to a limited amount of items. The teams fully are integrated. That unification of the sales and marketing team under Dan's leadership was the final piece of that. We do have to sunset the Telx accounting system, which we'll complete later this year. But from a people, process and systems standpoint, we're almost really close to the finish line, if not there. In terms of financials, that's really been a part of our success in, on – in the North America colocation and interconnection business. You've seen that's had a – we've had a tick up in our signings volume, you've seen a tick-up in our interconnection revenue line item, be it quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. We've grown the North America colocation footprint. I believe the total colo footprint is now about a 17% expansion relative to prior to when we bought the Telx business. So we've grown them in Ashburn, and had some wins with new customer there. We've grown them in the Richardson Campus. We've expanded their footprint in 350 East (44:58) Cermak and we're also seeing some strong demand in our 600 West 7th asset in LA. So off to a start, (45:08) pretty much through the chute on integration and continue to track along and be a key contributor of our business despite the slide not being in the deck anymore.
Operator: And the next question will come from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You saw a nice step-up in colocation in North America compared to the prior quarters. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on what's behind that. Is it more a function of internal changes at Digital? Is it related to sales restructuring at all? Or is it timing? Or is it a change in demand in the market?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey Rob, this is Andy again and congratulations on your new post.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Well-deserved.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So you were asking colocation signings volumes quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year?
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yeah, the $9.5 million number versus the prior quarters, which were all – probably a string of quarters, which were more like in 6s?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. It's a piece of the colo numbers, obviously, Europe, the addition of the eight assets in Europe. But you can see in our table, the signing numbers are broken out. So they're – and you still do see a step-up in North America volumes. I think our colo interconnection signings were our highest signings numbers since we acquired the Telx business, a little – about two years ago almost. And I think in the history of Telx, it's a top two, yes, top two performance. I think we saw, not only continuation of traditional customers growing their footprint or connectivity packages but we saw a lot of new wins, be it new customers to the colocation footprint or an existing customer going to a new market, both of which not only spur – that case type not only spurs demand for space and power but incremental connectivity. So I think those are some of the elements that kind of drove the results. I'm not – I think coming together as one unified team under Dan's leadership certainly played a part in it. But I think having more time with the full multi-product offering across the globe certainly helps us as well.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great, sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everyone. Just a question going back to the bookings volumes and the potential for that to go up over time. So you've got the sales force realigned at this point, you've got a channel partner program that hopefully will ramp up as well and market demand seems to be quite strong, 2x current supply. I was just wondering, to what degree your own supply is a potential constraint. And maybe part of that is, page 38 of the sup, you have all your inventory. I'm curious, how much of that inventory is entitled or is ready to start depending on demand and that kind of thing?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin. I would say, we've done a pretty darn good job at, what I'll call, supply chain management, and a lot of that we owe to Scott and his team's success of procuring the long lead time items, be it land, at our many campuses, locations and whether it's in Ashburn, Virginia or in Franklin Park in Chicago or in Richardson in Dallas. We either own or control a significant amount of acreage typically adjacent to our existing campus that really lends itself to our value proposition of having these customers being able to come to our campus and we can show that they can land and expand and not outgrow our footprint. So we do not see any scenarios where we're really sold out, especially in our kind of core active development markets such as the core four in North America, our Ashburn (49:18) Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley, which is probably one of the tightest markets, we're bringing on incremental space at the end of this year in terms of new capacity. And we see a similar scenario in London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Singapore. Osaka, Japan, now that we had success there, we do have the land, it will take us a little bit longer. So we won't be bringing on incremental capacity in 2017 or early 2018 for that property, but shortly thereafter, with that recent acquisition. So I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of being able to meet near-term and long-term demand.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then turning the question back to an earlier part of the conversation around the cloud service providers. I mean, last year or 2016 was sort of the year of the CSP. This year, volumes for the first quarter so far seem pretty good across the board. But you may be on the smaller size deals side of things. Just curious how the conversations are this year versus last with the bigger hyperscale guys.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, Vincent, this is Dan Papes. The conversations, I think continue to be around growth. The cloud service provider demand, to us, looks – continues to look strong. As kind of as far as the eye can see, I don't see it diminishing. We do see an interesting mix of deals that are in this 2-megawatt to 5-megawatt range that we brought down in the first quarter and some larger transactions. I see it, I see the trend continuing the way it's done in the past. And it's one of the things that we feel good about as we look forward at the opportunity before us. Andy, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. But...
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Same page here.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: And the next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks and good afternoon. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time talking about the overall health of the U.S. market, looking forward maybe 6 to 12 months. We've seen yields across some of the peer group dip a little bit. And I can appreciate that you're not necessarily pursuing the same type of customer funnel but how do overall supply levels look relative to what you would consider a stable run rate of demand? And then just maybe as an add-on to that, how would you compare the health of the U.S. market relative to Europe at the moment? And I guess, all else being equal, where would you prefer to invest your next dollar of capital right now?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Matt. I'll start and I'll let the other guys chime in here. So broadly speaking, I mean, I'll speak to more scale orientation, that's the bigger volumes side in terms of size of deals. The Ashburn continues to be a very robust and diverse customer backdrop. We continue to see numerous signings, fairly sizable signings. Obviously, Ashburn, there is also a competitive set. So we are competing with deals. We think we're winning our fair share, or if not more. And we still see demand being very large and growing and eclipsing that supply in that market. After Ashburn, you kind of go to Dallas and Chicago in terms of overall size of markets. Similar number – similar dynamics, I'd say to an Ashburn but probably just a little bit smaller in terms of markets, smaller in terms of number of customers, smaller in terms of some of the size of the deals in some scenarios. And if you head west to Silicon Valley, that's probably our tightest market by far, a much more limited supply. I can tell you that based on the demand outpacing supply in that market, we've seen an uptick in face rates of deals signed, we signed, I'd call it, two deals kind of 0.5 megawatt each. So kind of small scale or large colo deals at, call it 150-ish or north rates per kilowatt in this past quarter. And I know those rates going back several quarters or a year or could've been in the 130s-ish kind of area. So you've seen a little bit of pick up and that's the one market where large deals seem to be picking up based on supply and demand dynamics. Europe, as a whole, it's – we have a smaller presence there relative to our U.S. business. Those major markets are not quite at the same size as an Ashburn, Virginia. But I'd still say that we had good progress in London, especially if you look in the kind of last, call it, six to nine months, all post Brexit. I believe we had quote (54:35) $16 million of signings or so during that time period. We've kind of really filled out our existing scale campuses and moving on to expansion in Crawley, and we had some good progress in Dublin and Amsterdam as well as in the scale leasing side as well. I'm not sure there's a favorite although I certainly like the attributes of Silicon Valley when rates pick up like that. That's incremental profit to the bottom line by controlling supply in that market that's very limited. But we're seeing – if you've seen our sup, our returns are little bit higher in North America than Europe and then followed by Asia. Asia is way down a little bit based on the fact that Osaka, where we went in there with a little bit of an anchor de-risking market entry, signed two fairly large anchor deals to round out that initial campus. And also you have the fact that overall returns in Japan are a little bit lower. But I'm not sure I have a favorite. I'll let the other guys chime in – any other commentary?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Scott here, Matt. Look, I wish we had the luxury of being able to pick and choose where the next dollar went. The reality of it is it's still a lumpy business. And so you kind of have to go where the demand is and where you can do signings and generate revenues on all that. I would say for the yields dipping a little bit, I think part of that can be explained with there's more liquidity in the industry and more aggressive capital. And some competitors out there are willing to be a little more aggressive as it relates to yields. So I don't find that entirely shocking. And that will fluctuate depending on how supply and demand balances out in those markets over time. But the fact that you're seeing that now, it shouldn't be too shocking of that. But beyond that, I think Andy was spot on, on the differences between the three regions.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Matt. One thing I want to emphasize, though, is, I think it's important to have space in all of these markets to satisfy our customer's requirements. Our top 20 customers, of those, 95% of them are in multiple regions. And another 70% of the top 20 are in Europe and the U.S. And then frankly 25% of them are in Europe and in Asia. So, yeah, it's just important that you have space, we think, where we have it to meet their demands as they arise.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I really appreciate all the color there, guys.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: And the next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wanted to, I guess, follow up on one specific market, which is Dallas. We're getting questions specific to RagingWire and the large facility that they just opened up there. And I'm just curious if you think if that by itself could negatively pressure that market, perhaps, for the remainder of 2017 and what you're seeing there. And then secondly, on the bookings, there's been a lot of focus on this. Clearly, it's a good quarter, I think, by your standards as well as, I think, how it's being perceived by investors. But I guess with the book-to-bill being just three months, I'm surprised that that's not leading to some acceleration in growth. And maybe that's just a reflection that you guys have a pretty large range in your revenue today, it's about $100 million, or maybe it's the churn that you kind of called out that you're expecting in two situations, including in Atlanta. Just trying to get a better sense why when we see strong bookings like that, we don't necessarily see it flowing through into an uptick in terms of how you're talking about revenue expectations. Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe, Colby, I'll speak to Dallas first. So I can tell you that we've had – I know we had some decently sized wins in the Dallas market last quarter, in the fourth quarter, one with a partner that landed a healthcare company on our campus and then this quarter, we had a digital economy name with a decent kind of meg-plus deal landed on the Richardson Campus as well. And I know we have a – and that market specifically kind of has some attractive opportunities that we're working on right now with some of our largest customers looking to grow their footprint. I think, obviously, we're not alone in Dallas and we're competing with RagingWire and others. I think, those are the types of markets where you have to really differentiate yourself and bring more to the table of the customer, be it multiple U.S. markets, multiple geographic regions, a public company, investor-grade track record and 10-plus years of operating excellence. So there's a lot of things we do to differentiate our value prop with each customers and to have – and differentiate our relationships with the customers to win over some of them, may be in one or two markets, be it just in the U.S. In terms of the flow through, yes, we are quite pleased with the sign to commence creeping down to just under three months. I think you nailed the reasons in your own question, actually. We do have a range in the revenue line item. We do have some churn, which I highlighted but I would call churn with a silver lining because it's opportunities to, where we can reposition space and make incremental or are making incremental returns on that space and that's, I would say, that's part of the reason that we went with a $0.05 increase to the bottom end of our guidance and kept the top end constant.
Operator: And the next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. In terms of, I guess, you mentioned earlier, on colocation footprint, it's up to, up 17%. Where can we expect that to go over time? And then kind of following up with a lot of the signings questions, will that help kind of keep colocation at this $10 million and higher level given that colocation seems to be pretty steady relative to, I guess, Turn-Key Flex?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Richard, it's really all predicated on our success here. So we've taken an approach to incrementally grow our colocation footprint what we thought it made sense, be it in our Internet gateways, where we already had a dominant presence right in the (01:01:16) room, had a connectivity and ecosystems stronghold and could build out incremental pods for – to sell colo into all new places, where you put the flags, be it in Ashburn or Richardson and Franklin Park is probably the next stop on the North America campus and Dublin is probably the next stop on the European campus. And I know Singapore is probably the next step on the Asia campus. But we're doing it very incrementally, call it 0.5 meg to 1 meg increments. We're not going to build a 5-megawatt, 10-megawatt colo all, and just waiting to fill it up over a longer time period. And the other thing I'd say, you have working against in the pie chart is that we do have – I mean, we're still doing pretty strong larger footprint scale wins. Scale was 61% of total signings during the quarter. And we have – that part of the pie is growing at the same time. So I wish I could tell it's going to be exactly this but we're trying to make sure we have the offering for the full product suite, the cage or (01:02:17) cabinet up to the multiple megawatts halls. And depending where demand and customers grow, that's going to (01:02:23) get bucketed between a colocation or a scale customer suite.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And I know it's very volatile quarter-to-quarter but in just kind of eyeballing the new leases and renewals, it seems like the contract lengths are extending out a little bit longer for the different products versus the last 12 months. Can you give us any color with regard to that?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Two trends, I would say, bigger the deployment, longer the term. If a customer wants to do a massive deployment, with us at least, they want to go 10, 15 years and we – that's something we appreciate and we want them to go 10, 15 years given the concentration risk of when that one expiration comes due. So anything kind of call it, 5, 10 years or north, we're trying to push for longer and the customer usually is also pushing for longer customarily. Secondly, you'll see our Powered Base Building renewals, that's – those are – just to remind you, those are places where we own a highly improved shell and the customers put on their own dollar the full build-out of the last, call it, 70% to 80% of the infrastructure. They've got lots of dollars sunk in the space and you can see those renewals when they do come through, they have customers contracting for a longer time period than a fully built out suite.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page. One, we retooled our sales force to better align with our customers' buying behavior without sacrificing current period results and we delivered robust bookings during the first quarter, up over 50% from the previous quarter. We delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.06. We raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the out-performance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet by paying down high coupon debt and preferred equity. We finished the quarter with our debt to equity ratio below 5 times, fixed charge coverage above 4 times and Standard & Poor's revised their outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive. Last, but not least, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. 2016 was a very good year for Digital Realty. We delivered solid execution against each of the objectives of our strategic plan outlined here on page 2 of our earnings deck. We remain focused on realizing the highest possible risk adjusted returns. We achieved a 30 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital in 2016, bringing the cumulative three year gain to 180 basis points. Given the size of our asset base, we believe this represents a meaningful movement of the needle since 2013. We made substantial headway towards the successful integration of Telx. We also closed on another strategic acquisition, a portfolio of eight high-quality carrier-neutral data centers in Europe. This acquisition was accretive, prudently financed and coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. We also advanced our goal of diversifying our product offerings, with the launch of our Service Exchange in November, the continued growth of our Partners and Alliances Program and the expansion of our colocation footprint beyond the original 20 Telx locations. We also made solid progress towards our goal of achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share. We hit our target for 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion two years ahead of plan. We also beat the high-end of our original guidance range, delivering 9% growth in core FFO per share and 22% growth in AFFO per share. Both metrics are on an as reported basis. On a constant currency basis, FFO per share growth would be in double-digits and AFFO per share growth would be north of 23%. Just, as importantly, we were able to achieve this growth without levering up. In fact, we actually reduced leverage by almost half-a-turn in 2016. We initially unveiled these three year guidepost at our Investor Day in October 2015. Please mark your calendars for the 2017 edition in New York on December 5. By way of preview, our priorities going forward will be geared towards further developing our considerable base of talent to come together as one fully integrated team centered around our customers. Let's take a closer look at the expansion of our product offerings on page three. As you know, we launched our Service Exchange last November. Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secured connections to multiple cloud service providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. Service Exchange provides more value to our customers by simplifying interconnection and making access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable and easier to use than ever before when we went live in 43 facilities across eight markets in November and we are on track to rollout another 17 sites across another nine markets in 2017. In addition, we will be again offering Layer 3 capabilities during the second quarter. Layer 3 capabilities are a requirement to enable enterprise customers to reliably consume SaaS or Software-as-a-Service offerings from a private cloud environment. This means that our customers will be able to realize the benefits of a full suite of public cloud services, including infrastructure, platform and Software-as-a-Service, without incurring exposure of a traditional public Internet connection. In a nutshell, this offering will allow our customers to realize the benefit of the public cloud without the complexity or security issues associated with hybrid cloud architectures. In addition to the launch of Service Exchange, we saw an acceleration of our activity in our Partners and Alliances Program during the fourth quarter with a pickup in bookings on our Direct Link Colocation offering with IBM Bluemix as well as a significant back-to-back transaction with a leading IT services provider supporting a publicly-traded healthcare service provider. I'm pleased to report that our level of activity continues to grow, particularly where we are able to combine our capabilities with those of our partners like the Direct Link Colocation offering with IBM. These programs highlight our unique competitive differentiation with our ability to offer customers a full spectrum of data center solutions from a single cabinet all the way up to multi-megawatt deployments. We are pleased with the early progress of our Partners and Alliances Program and we are looking forward to taking it to the next level in 2017 under Dan Papes' leadership. You may recall that Dan joined us this past year in November as Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27 year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business. In addition to Dan's experience leading large global direct sales teams, he has significant channels and alliances experience, having led the global cloud and data center business at a $6 billion global IT distributor. As I said, we are excited about the prospects for meaningful growth in our channel program under his leadership. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page four. Just last week, Cisco reported that global mobile data traffic grew an estimated 63% in 2016. Looking ahead, Gartner projects that the shift to the cloud will either directly or indirectly impact $1 trillion of IT spending by the year 2020. JLL reports that several major cloud providers anticipate that they will need to triple their existing infrastructure by 2020 to meet that demand. We are as confident as we've ever been in the long-term demand profile. While cloud leasing activity may have been somewhat front-end loaded in 2016, the long-term trend is clearly marching up and to the right. The outsized leasing volume in the first half of last year grow record absorption for the data center sector in 2016. Current market vacancy rates are in this mid-single digits in most core markets and demand continues to outpace supply. Deal sizes are getting bigger and lumpier, and they no longer have the same cadence. And the biggest and lumpiest deals do not necessarily translate to the most value creation. For our part, we're taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global Connected Campus footprint. Our competitors are largely behaving rationally. But we have seen an uptick in fresh capital targeting the sector. To-date, recent investments have mostly been focused on stabilized assets, perhaps reflecting a tacit acknowledgment that barriers to entry maybe higher that meets the eye. The floodgates have opened for data center packages coming to market, but the supply of products on the market has not depressed pricing. In fact, values have firmed considerably. Cap rates are in the sixes, and EBITDA multiples are in the mid-teens. This can be somewhat of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the value of our existing portfolio, and it makes our recent acquisitions look particularly compelling. On the other hand, it also makes it harder for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions, and it potentially introduces new competitors. In summary, development pipelines are active, but pre-leasing is healthy, market vacancy is tight, current construction is concentrated in core markets characterized by robust leasing velocity, and the scars of the lifecycle are still fresh. Now, let's turn to the macro environment on page five. The economic outlook has improved over the last 90 days, although the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remains uncertain. Despite the improved outlook, it's still a low growth world, and competition is fierce for the pockets of growth, excuse me, that do exist. We believe we have a set of key competitive advantages, namely, our Global Platform, our brand, our operational track record, and our fortress balance sheet that give us a significant leg up on would be competitors. That certainly doesn't mean that we can rest on our laurels. We must continue to innovate, continuously improve and provide even greater value to our customers. As you've heard me say many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. We consider ourselves very fortunate to be beneficiaries of highly disruptive technological trends like the shift to the cloud, e-commerce and driverless cars. Over time, we expect property types that are levered to the digital economy will become increasingly core holdings. Not only do we have the good fortune to be operating in a growth industry, but we believe that we have the best platform. We are well-positioned to come together as one team oriented around our customers and capitalize on unique opportunity in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over the Andy Power to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $33 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $25 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $7 million colocation contribution. Our fourth quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win a robust, get profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. Fourth quarter wins included multiple top cloud service providers signing across multiple continents. They also included strong customer demand from several of our other key verticals, including cable and network, a rapidly growing ridesharing company, connected caller applications, IT service providers and a few diverse customers within our financial services vertical. We added a total of 50 new logos during the fourth quarter. The lion's share of these new logos were landed by our colocation and interconnection business which has consistently contributed more than $13 million of bookings every quarter since our acquisition of Telx in late 2015. This consistent performance helps smooth out some of the lumpiness inherent in our traditional large footprint leasing particularly in the hyperscale age. The complementary nature of the colocation and interconnection business with our existing platform was a key part of the strategic rationale for the Telx transaction. That rationale has been proven out over the first year of our stewardship as shown on the M&A scorecard here on page 8. The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, although revenues remain split 50-50 roughly, interconnection continues to outpace colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. We expect interconnection revenue will grow faster in 2017 than 2016. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $42 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. We made substantial headways towards realizing the embedded growth potential within the Telx portfolio as evidenced by the 480 basis point pickup in same-store utilization. This successful lease-up enabled us to achieve 99% of our full year 2016 revenue target. Executing on our revenue plan combined with our performance and operational and corporate cost containment enabled us to significantly exceed our full year 2016 cash EBITDA target of $148 million prior to synergies in addition to our $15 million expense synergy target. We also laid the ground work for realization of revenue synergies in 2017 and beyond as we began the process of expanding our colocation and the interconnection footprint across eight markets in North America, representing nearly 7 megawatts of incremental capacity. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and we look forward to continue progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and across our global Connected Campus network. In terms of the portfolio of eight European data centers we acquired last year, we are likewise well underway towards a smooth integration. We're able to consolidate all the corporate employees from the acquired business into our existing office. And Rob Coupland, who's appointment as Managing Director for the region was announced last September, is now managing one team out of our combined European headquarters on Gracechurch Street in London. We are stabilized and on track with our initial underwriting assumptions. By the end of 2017, we expect to have fully integrated the eight new properties into our portfolio. Turning to our backlog on page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $78 million. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements reminded healthy at just three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We retained 75% of fourth quarter lease expirations, roughly in line with our historical average, and we signed $47 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. Cash re-leasing spreads were positive 3.5% for the fourth quarter and positive 2.6% for full year 2016. During the quarter cash re-leasing spreads were positive across all property types, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals. We do still have pockets of above market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region. So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016, and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially to 89.4%, primarily due to taking assignment of a colocation reseller customers PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago, which we discussed on our third quarter call. We are actively negotiating the lease for roughly 25% of the former customer's capacity that will bring us back to breakeven, and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease-up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters. You may recall, as part of this transaction, we took ownership of the former customer's data center improvement and infrastructure with an original cost basis of approximately $85 million, and a current fair market value of approximately $30 million. This transaction explains the bulk of the $33 million of other revenue on the face of our P&L this quarter. The gain on this lease termination is included in NAREIT defined FFO, but is excluded from core FFO. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, and FX represented a 150 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Although our global footprint does expose our reported earnings to currency translation movements, it enables us to satisfy the growing data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we view as a key competitive advantage. Same capital cash NOI growth was flat for the fourth quarter and up 1.4% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, same capital cash NOI growth was a positive 2.7% on a reported basis, and up 3.6% on a constant currency basis. For 2017, same capital cash NOI growth is expected to be similar to full year 2016, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $5.72 for the full-year, an increase of nearly 9% on a reported basis, and up a little over 10% on a constant currency basis. Growth in AFFO per share was better than 20% for the full year, driven by greater cash flow contribution from our core business, accretion from the Telx acquisition, continued burn-off of straight line rent and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend. Our current AFFO payout ratio is sub-70%, and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. As usual, we expect our board of directors will revisit the dividend policy at the February Board Meeting later this month. In 2017, we expect AFFO per share growth to much more closely match FFO per share growth. None of these assumptions underline our 2017 guidance have changed since we provided our initial outlook just over a month ago. And we are reiterating guidance for 2017. Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 12. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid $108 million of mortgage debt at a weighted average coupon of a little over 6%. We now have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. Subsequent to year-end, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January. Our 6.625% Series F of Preferred Stock is callable in April and we expect to fund the $182.5 million redemption by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares, subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May. Aside from the remainder of the forward equity offering and barring any unforeseen acquisition activity, our plan does not contemplate any additional common equity issuance in 2017. Even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA will remain below five times throughout the entire year. We also expect to capitalize on the current strength of the data center investment sales market by continuing to prune our portfolio and selling up to another $200 million of assets this year. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends. Finally, we expect to raise another $500 million of long-term fixed rate financing later this year. As you can see from the bubbles in the map on page 13, we have the most foreign currency exposure to the British pound. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to further our FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling denominated debt later this year. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we've also mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Over the course of the year, we brought our floating rate debt exposure down by more than a half to a little less than 10% of total debt outstanding at year-end, as shown in the pie charts on the right side of page 14. On the left side of the page 14, it appears that we have – it is apparent that we've also cleared the runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall thereafter. Finally, we reduced leverage from 5.2 times at the end of 2015 to 4.8 times at the end of 2016. Our balance sheet is primed for growth consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Certainly, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. So, my first question is on M&A and if you could comment on the remaining milestones as you integrate the new European assets and as well the kind of the many potential that you see in enhancing interconnection revenues there? And then if you could also maybe talk about your views on further inorganic growth in Europe or elsewhere? There has obviously been a lot of recent M&A transactions where you did not participate. And then I've got a follow-up. Thank you.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, Jonathan. Hi, Scott here. I think Andy touched on a couple of those items here, but I'll just go over them again. We're off to a great start with the EMEA portfolio that we acquired. We're on track with our underwriting there. The overall EMEA team has been fully integrated under the Digital Realty umbrella and that was finalized in the fourth quarter, so that's going well. In 2017, we will focus on integration of systems and processes. Over there, we are migrating the Amsterdam one connectivity ecosystems over to Science Park tower. And we have our colo expansion plans into new locations in the European market, are underway. We're seeing good customer activity and we're cross-selling products and I think all that bodes well for revenue synergies. On the cross-connect, so I think it's reasonable to view the growth there is going to be a little more modest than it would be by U.S. standards. The European market is structurally different as it relate to that. So, I think that you temper the expectations there. I think it's more common to see kind of 5% to 10% of revenues coming out of cross-connects in these European assets. On further inorganic M&A, as we always say, we look at everything. We're looking for opportunities that are strategic and complementary, that we can prudently finance and represent a good investment value for our shareholders. And by that we mean accretive. I think as a general statement that I can say that we are not looking to acquire assets just to get bigger. And many of the opportunities that were out there presented – really had neither a strategic value nor represented good value until it's easy for us to be interested observers on those. But I think we're going to remain disciplined in our approach to this. And we're not going to jump on any opportunities that will really only serve to make us bigger and not better.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then, maybe switching gears for Dan Papes. I wondered if you could maybe summarize how you see your priorities over the coming quarters now that you've been onboard for a few months. Thanks.
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Jon, it's been a very busy three months for me since joining Digital Realty. And we've gotten a lot done and it will inform my priorities just to tell you the things that we've been focusing on in those three months. Very pleased to see the level of talent that we have across the organization. I've also brought some new people in as well and have a few more coming. So we'll strengthen our team even more. We've also taken that talent from three entities, really, and turned it into one. We had Telx skills and Digital skills and Telecity skills and we've taken the best of all of them and turned that into one global sales organization. So, in the coming quarters we'll leverage that to generate some meaningful growth for the business. We really are now one global team and we're taking our portfolio to market that way. We actually just had a successful kickoff last week of the integrated team. And I'm very pleased with how quickly our team has jelled. We also have reorganized our go-to-market organization around our customers and our markets. And are now going to market in the form of verticals that specialize in the unique ways that each of those vertical customers buy. We're providing solutions to them. We're not going to market by geography or by products. We're trying to help our customers meet new opportunities and solve challenges that they have in their businesses. Another major priority for me, Bill mentioned it several times in his opening statements, is Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances. We believe that there is meaningful upside for us in that business. And so we're going to put a special emphasis on that, and invest significantly from a go-to-market perspective in that space. It allows us to reach many new customers that we might not otherwise have been able to reach and it allows us to do that at a much lower cost of sales. And so, we see the opportunity to generate benefits for ourselves, for our partner – those who partner with us, as well as our customers in the end. So, all of this, we believe – as we focus on it in the coming quarters, will be good for our business and it will position us to capitalize on our comprehensive platform to generate future growth.
Operator: And the next question will come Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up Dan, if I could on the Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances emphasis that you're going to have. And just to ask you if there is some kind of metric by which we can sort of track you or benchmark you, where we could start to understand the opportunity in the Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances area?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes. So, what I can – as we develop the program, we can probably give you more specific metrics. We are just launching the new emphasized approach to it. We've already seen good results, as you saw from the Direct Link Colo, as we talked about the deal with IBM on Direct Link Colo, which actually generated about $3 million in TCV last year, but giving you a comprehensive set of financial targets and number of partners around that will be something I think we'll be able to give you in the coming quarter.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I think...
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And, Jordan, just to add on there, just chime-in for one second.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And, I think we had – to be fair, we've had some successful partners in the last quarter, new partner that landed a fairly sizable deal with us in North America, supporting a publicly-listed healthcare company. I think one of the financial elements I think you'll see, and be it – Dan's been here for three months, so don't count on it tomorrow. But an acceleration of sales and revenue on the back – without a commensurate acceleration of sales head count is a way to financially see our results for the partners and channels kind of bearing fruit.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. Thanks, Andy. The other question I had was, I guess, Andy, you talked about IX growing at a faster rate in 2017, I thought maybe you could expand on that?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So we – on a year-over-year basis, we've – our interconnection revenue, it's grown more than double – just more than double-digit, just because we've added some incremental capacity. But on just a pure same-store basis it's kind of low-teens, outpacing the pure colocation growth. And, well, I would say kind of part and parcel with our expanding the footprint and the opportunities for additional colocation, interconnection opportunities. We expect a modest pickup in that growth, in the revenue on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. You mentioned in your comments about the balance sheet and the leverage coming down to 4.8 times. As you look into the possibility of rates being where they are or higher, how does that affect the target leverage that you want to achieve over the next few years and how you're looking at the balance sheet funding development? And then just secondly on the point of development, I think your guidance flagged about $800 million to a $1 billion of development for 2017. The construction in progress that's left to go later on in the disclosures is, I think a little over $600 million. And I'm curious if you could talk a bit more about bridging those two and the types of opportunities that you might be looking at? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Mike, I'll take – try to take both of those. So, on the balance sheet standpoint, we have a financial strategy of kind of having a balance sheet that's positioned for growth; and we kind of first and foremost target a leverage metric around 5-ish times debt to EBITDA. Now it's gotten – in the past it's been a little bit higher than that, probably up to 5.5 times. Today, we stand kind of a little below that, roughly 4.8 times. We philosophically think for our business mix and being an active developer, that's the right way to run the capitalization of the company. We are also hopeful though of obviously a rising rate environment finally coming to bear. And the way we try to think about protecting against that is one, minimizing our floating rate debt as much as possible. So today we stand, I believe 10% of our debt is floating rate, which is primarily borrowings outstanding under our revolver and that's been literally cut in half over the last year. And two, mitigating our maturity risk, so kind of matching the duration of our cash flows and our assets with long-term fixed rate debt financing. So if you look at our debt maturity schedule, you won't see much of any debt covenant due before 2020. And then thereafter we try to stagger the bars, so that we're not kind of putting any risk on the balance sheet. And those things hold for me as the CFO in a rising rate environment or quite frankly in many different rate environments. Going to your second question, the CapEx spend, the CapEx implied by the guidance at the end of the year relative to where we came out. Quite honestly, probably we're trending sub to the midpoint of that guidance going into the end of the year. It's really a product of timing. We – some projects slipped over into 2017, let's call it maybe a $100 million of that spend is kind of a calendar year slip. We are still seeing that even with that we did have a marked increase in CapEx year-over-year spent from 2015 to 2016 and our 2016 to 2017 midpoint does imply another increase. I think that's a product of two things. We've had a fair bit of success on the scale side of the business, building our campuses, expanding our customer footprint and helping them grow to the various buildings we have on other campuses. And 2017 and onto 2018 is going to have two new more demonstrative markets that they really had no contribution in prior years with Frankfurt, Germany in Europe and Osaka, Japan in Asia.
Operator: And the next question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, LLC: Thanks. Hi, guys. I was hoping we could touch on Brexit and just I'm wondering if you're seeing any clarity in terms of how tenants are starting to think about managing that.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hi Lukas, it's Bill. We – post Brexit, we actually signed a fair number of deals in London, while before Brexit we hadn't done much business at all. So I think, from that standpoint, Brexit perhaps has been good for the London market. But having said that we are building in Frankfurt and Amsterdam, and we're definitely seeing demand in both of those markets as well.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, LLC: Great. And then, also could we just touch on real quickly the integration costs, is that all of the European portfolio, is some of that Telx and then just how are those integration costs tracking relative to your initial expectations?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. This quarter the integration costs are more heavily weighted towards the European portfolio. Quite frankly, a large chunk of it is – we hired a consultant firm to kind of help us through the integration process. So we have outside third-party advisors, with that domain expertise across all the multiple functions that touch the combined company. So a large of that is paying consultants to kind of help us facilitate that integration. There maybe a little bit on the Telx side on that, but I would say that's not a larger or a material amount to spend. And in terms of tracking, we've always set budgets at the time of the acquisition and then refresh moving into our 2017 spend. I'd say we're tracking slightly below budget, but overall these are not massive dollar spends in any regards in terms of integration. I think especially as it relates to the European portfolio, where it was really an absorption of their team without tremendous overlap given their colocation interconnection expertise and our scale expertise. So, it's not a huge dollar integration bucket to begin with.
Operator: The next question will be from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Great. Two questions, if I may. When I look at your bookings in 2015 versus 2016, excluding interconnect, they're roughly flat at about $127 million. And as the company has gotten bigger, when you look at what you're targeting in terms of growth expectations, what is the new reset on where bookings should be? I appreciate that there is a $33 million this quarter and I appreciate that they will be lumpy, but when we look in 2017, can you give us any color in terms of what you consider to be – what you consider to be hitting your bookings target? Also as it relates to the dividend, I appreciate that the board is going to be meeting later this month to go over that. But can you talk about the AFFO payout ratio in terms of where you'd be comfortable with that and ultimately where you can potentially go? It seems like there's potentially an opportunity here to increase the dividend at a greater rate in 2017 than we saw last year. Thanks.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll touch on the dividend first. So on the dividend, obviously, as you know, it is ultimately in the board's hands and management will make a recommendation to the board to accept or approve. But as you've seen from the growth in our cash flow and our AFFO, and where our payoff stands today, I think there is a fairly decent chance that the dividend increase will accelerate or be greater than the prior year's dividend increase. While – with the one caveat being this, Colby, that while we're not the developer, I do view retaining capital as an attractive source versus going out to the market. So every dollar I can retain and redeploy into our active development pipeline that we develop to 10 to 12 returns is an accretive use of that capital. So I don't think you'll see our payout ratio move wildly. At the same time, I do think the dividend is going to increase a little bit more this year than last year. When I talk about signings, I mean, we have internal numbers where we have really market-by-market based on what we see the pipeline demand, and how that lines up with our available supply and our timing of bringing new supply coming onboard. We obviously did not give you that – a line item for that in our table, in our guidance, although we do give a fairly robust disclosure. It's something that's a little bit subjective, because as you move through the year, different markets heat up and different markets cool down, and different lines of our business be it scale or colo kind of move in the same degree. So, we're interested in focusing on winning demand at attractive rates to generate profitable returns on our capital. My goal was more and more every quarter, the best I – the most I can. I don't think we have like a specific internal goal we want to share, as in terms of a leasing volume number here on this call.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: I'm trying to – I guess what I'm trying to do is, you guys I think are targeting mid-to-high-single digits FFO per share growth each year. And at this juncture, with the company the size that it is now, I guess I am trying to just triangulate back to – what we need to see from a bookings perspective over – again, not on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I appreciate that lumpiness, but on an aggregate year basis, what that might be, but I guess that's something we'll have to try and look at it a little bit more.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Listen, Colby, what I would say is, listen, we've just finished the fourth quarter. Some of the fourth quarter signs obviously have implications on the rest of how 2017 goes. We're halfway through the first quarter. And right here on this call we're reiterating our guidance that we gave you on January 3. So based on everything we've signed in 4Q, based on everything we know we signed so far in 1Q, we think we're on a signings momentum or velocity that's going to generate that FFO growth you just mentioned.
Operator: The next question will come from Richard Choe of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - ‎J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you. Following up on that a little bit. In terms of colocation and interconnection it seems like signings have been very steady and that has pretty good visibility. The Turn-Key Flex seems to be a lot more volatile. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the pipeline, kind of, longer-term that maybe makes you feel better about potential signings in the future in that section?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Richard. I'd say the pipeline looks pretty good. To give you a data point, our investment committee used to meet every other week. Now we meet every week. Same amount of time in those meetings and that's really to discuss the deals that are in front of us. So, it's a good pipeline. There is no question about that. Dan, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No. I would just reiterate. It's a good pipeline and we're awfully busy getting those proposals out the door.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: But I will say too, Richard, that there is no question that on average the scale deals are higher. There was a...
Richard Y. Choe - ‎J.P. Morgan: And then you said that they're getting more complicated and lumpy, but that doesn't mean that they are dying down at all. It's just taking longer to kind of get through these deals.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, no, but they're bigger. On average they're bigger.
Richard Y. Choe - ‎J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to touch base on the Dallas market. There's been a lot of press about that market being particularly strong or expected to be particularly strong this year. Just curious if you could share your thoughts on that market from what you're seeing both on demand and the supply side.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin. This is Andy. I'm pretty sure you're referring to an article that described Dallas as 2016 Chicago. I would say a little bit different dynamic there. It feels like there's more competitors. There's more competitors with supply. At the same time, we've had some pretty good traction recently in terms of signings in that market and pipeline of additional deals in that market. But I have not seen anything that necessarily unlock the flood gate in Dallas. And you can just pull up public disclosure you'll notice that it does have a fairly wide competitive set that we're competing within that market.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Got it. Okay. And next question is really going back to the same capital side of things. I mean that there has been some slowing trends there for the last few quarters, I think ended up at the low-end of the guidance range for 2016. But just curious if you could just comment on what is sort of driving that deceleration outside of FX, obviously. And then, maybe talk about the changes in the same-store pool now with Telx being in there. How that changes the comparisons year-over-year?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So I think that the thing you didn't mention, which is a little bit of anomaly is that the fourth quarter had a 1.4% constant currency growth quarter-over-quarter. I would say it's probably another 100 basis point higher than that due to some anomalies around some tax assessment or refunds I should say that we received in the prior year, which makes for a tough comp. And we did receive some impact from that PBB lease we took back and obviously are re-leasing right now. So it's probably 100 basis points higher than the 1.4% on a constant currency basis. On a full year basis, I think, we're towards the higher end of our initial guidance at 2.7% as reported and 3.6% constant currency, so fairly happy with that. I would say it was a smaller pull this year because we tried to be intellectually honest with how we treated Telx in that analysis. Moving to 2017, I'd say the biggest impact will be including the Telx contribution, will be the pooling that's a lot more meaningful and the larger component of our company. So it will give you a better read through as to same capital look for all more of digital than it did during 2016.
Operator: And the next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. When you look out at the various markets that – where you're operating, are you seeing any sort of rational behavior either in pricing or market entry? What is that looking like? And then, now what areas can we expect you to emphasize going forward, both sort of inorganic and an organic growth? You have various types of assets. What should we expect you to put most of the emphasis on going forward?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank. On the market question, I mean, first of all, New Jersey continues to be our weakest market. I wouldn't say that there is irrational pricing there. There just is weak demand. I think where you find potentially irrational pricing is when there is a significantly sized deal, a very large deal that you'll find people that – who price very competitively for those. What was your second question?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: The areas to emphasize organic and inorganic growth. And I think – Frank, I think I touched on a little bit too is, we're still focused on opportunities that are strategic to our business and also represent a good investment value for our shareholders and not focus on things that are just going to make as bigger. So, good examples of those are some of the opportunities out there have been just a collection of assets. And they've been very fully priced. And, frankly, I'm kind of surprised that how full the pricing has been in the market given the supply of assets that have been up there for sale. And I think that's a testimony to the strong investor appetite for our data center assets. But we do try to focus on the more strategic ones. Anything that's just a collection of assets of two, three, four, just pure data center assets that are fully priced relative to our cost of capital aren't particularly attractive because all it does is let us get bigger and it increases the denominator and dilutes our future growth. So, we don't find those particularly exciting because we can develop those on our own. So, again, we will focus on opportunities that we believe are strategic and we can generate some synergies out of and also are attractively priced relative to our cost of capital and represent an accretive transaction as well as something that we can prudently finance. So, we're going to stick to our discipline going forward as we have in the past. And I hope it continues to play out for us the way it always has.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thank you. Yeah. I just kind of have one question. Looking at the re-leasing spreads on your Turn-Key Flex portfolio, still positive, they were good this quarter. I'm curious what year those leases were initially signed and one thing that I want to get at is, I know about four years ago 2013 was when rents really took a dip and I'm wondering when we're going to start to renew those leases and if we should expect re-leasing – when we should start to expect to re-leasing spread kind of ramp up as those rents what I presume are below where current market was – were leased and when they renew?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jon, this is Andy. So, I don't have a pinpoint on the actual year for those leases. I would say they both probably go back call it 5 to 10 years. I don't think – I mean, as you look through our Turn-Key, which is predominantly larger footprint, longer-term leases, they almost all have some type of annual escalation of call it 2%, 2.5%, 3% over that duration, be it 7 or 10 years. So they've been increasing for many years now. We have not gone to a point where we've had massive spiky uplifts upon the cash mark-to-markets. I think that's a product of being on the scale customer, they're bigger deals, they've had escalations for a longer time period and I don't think we've gotten to the expiration or the extension time for really trough rates yet at least.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Do you have any sense about – you're saying – so essentially I should take 2013, add 5 to 10 years, so we're still two or three years away from really seeing that, those rents roll.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: It feels like it, but I would say that the payments are little bit – the customers will very often come, they want to come and do a long-term extension well before their actual contractual extension. So there is potential for customers to come early to do renewals, but it does feel like what you're looking for maybe a couple of more years out there.
Operator: The next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just revisiting the revenue guidance. I guess there is a, about a 5% delta there in the range, about a $100 million. I'm just curious what would you say the key variables are in terms of execution or may be just the market environment that – to get you to the high end of the revenue guide this year?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Matt. I would – I mean, I would say the key variables on that range are one of execution rate and it's probably more on the scale side execution and then the colocation interconnection side in our – performance just given the mix of our business, and the stacks of the size of the deals on the scale side, can be – tend to be a lot larger and bigger impactors. And the other thing, I would say, FX, I believe, could have another impact there. And going back several years, you probably wouldn't have heard us talk about this much, but we're living in an environment where the pounds drop from a $1.45 to $1.20, and we have a large piece of our business in the UK, that obviously has a – can create a large headwind to our top line growth. Now, as I mentioned, we hedged that having, new – to couple sterling bond offerings north of $1 billion dollars, there's multi-currency revolver and term loan so that headwind doesn't 100% flow through to our bottom line, but it would – can put some variability into the top line growth.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then one follow-up on the development pipeline. It looks like you had a couple of fully leased projects slip out of there, but pretty good increase on a sequential basis, and I think it's higher here than I've seen in quite a while. I guess – what's your sort of line of sight into having that pool substantially leased up by the time those assets are released into the stabilized pool?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, the deliveries you mentioned – sorry, go ahead, Matt.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess by the time they're delivered?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, the deliveries you mentioned that came out of the pool on the scale side I believe were 88% leased. So, they're almost 90% leased by the time we actually finished the construction of the building. We have a slide in the deck that kind of highlights our three North America core active development markets that did 10 to 15 megawatts per month in the last 12 months of deliveries and those are all kind of 88 to 94 or so percent leased upon the time we opened up. You are correct, the active development pipeline has increased a fair bit. I think it's a roughly $250-ish million versus the prior quarter in terms of total projects. That includes some of those – I mean obviously we've been increasing with our global footprint expanding in Europe and Asia. Some colo projects which are a little smaller dollars have been added to the list. Those typically obviously did not have much preleasing before they open up. I think we feel pretty confident on bringing those on in time at attractive cost to us and be able to lease a significant share up by the time we open the doors. Many of those projects actually are like the last buildings on some of our major campuses, be it the K building or H building down in Ashburn before we move on to the next parcel of land; or the 9377 building in Chicago. So, we're kind of rounding out some of our large campuses and now having to move to the next door property for our next phase of growth. And in that case, that's often customers that have already been in our building, wanting to really stack up that last piece of inventory so that their engineers don't even have to cross the road even though it's a short distance. So, I think we feel pretty good about that. At the same time, if you would stop all the – stop the music and everyone has to find a chair, I think our committed spend on that pipeline, meaning the spend we have to spend or would be in default on is about $190 million. So, it's 0.2, 3.3 turns of EBITDA and we can easily address it with our revolver that's got $200 million outstanding.
Operator: And the next question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Curious regarding the scale funnel, it sounds like the deals are bigger you said. So, should we expect, is it safe to assume more scale deals from DLR in 2017 versus 2016?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I certainly hope so. I mean – kidding aside, I mean we wouldn't increase the active development pipeline by that size and we won't be moving on to build at the adjacent campuses if we didn't have conviction on the pipeline. Now, they're not a done deal, obviously there's only a certain amount that's pre-leased today and we're only a month-and-a-half into the year, but that's certainly the goal. I don't know if Dan you want to add anything to that?
Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add is we do see a strong pipeline in the CSP and hyperscale space and it's not just domestic. I think it's important to point out that our global footprint is very appealing to the hyperscale customers. And as we expand our footprint in Asia and in Europe, we're seeing good strong demand for those sites as well.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Jordan, some of the changes we're making on the sales team, we expect will allow us to gain deeper penetration into the customer and thus will unearth additional opportunities with these major players.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, a little bit of a follow-up for maybe Scott or Andy, you could tag team. This is sort of strategically year-over-year plus into the – even more so now into the Telx acquisition and integration and living with it. And so I'm kind of curious on your view of colo and interconnection relative to scale and basically where you see the best risk-adjusted returns for your money?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: You want me to start or you want to go?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Go ahead, I'll hang on.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So maybe I'll just touch on Telx holistically and kind of a year-end checkup kind of thing and then I'll let Scott talk to kind of risk adjusted returns, whether – from an investment kind of hat. I mean, obviously, Jordan, or maybe not obviously, I think we're pretty proud of what I call successful acquisition financing and more – most of the integration. I mean, we've navigated a substantial re-org that generates significant expense synergies. We either met or exceeded our underwriting targets, we've unified the team under one Digital Realty brand and we also leveraged some new found expertise and adopted market-leading customer portal. And then, on the new future, I think, we're generating revenue synergies with the footprint expansion to markets like Ashburn, Richardson and also just growing the footprint some of our gateways be it Chicago or LA or Phoenix. So, all-in-all I think we're on track. And I think it's been a fruitful, I mean, a good overall experience. And I think we're building momentum that's going to bear fruit into 2017 and beyond.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Jordon on the risk reward spectrum of it, it's really – it's kind of interesting. So, the way I look at it, it's a little bit of a toss-up. You could generate better operating margins on the colo side, be it shorter contract terms, you have smaller customers, typically more diversified customer bases. But then, you also have limits of how big it can be, and we can take some of these markets. Northern Virginia is a great example, 2 megawatts of leasing and – of colo in Northern Virginia is a big year for any company. And 2 megawatts is kind of the first week of January for scale. So, it's a tough call. I think really at the end of the day, what our view on this is, is you want to have both. We want to have a full spectrum platform to offer space and power and connectivity to a customer, whether you want a cabinet or you want a 100 megawatts. And we want to do that on a global scale, because what we see the customers wanting from us right now is they have – they have a lot of different needs over a lot of different markets, and a lot of different types and needs. So, they might need a colo deployment in one market, they might need scale in one, hyperscale in another. And they want to be able to come to a single vendor for that to partner with and provide them with some consistency of delivery across the globe. And we know, we're the only ones right now that are even close to be able to do that on a global scale. And we think we're seeing a good chance to being the only ones. And so, it's kind of hard to really separate, I mean because they are both very important.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2016, as outlined here on the last page. We had another very good year characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. We met or exceeded our Telx underwriting targets and we continue to extend our global footprint with the closing of the European portfolio acquisition. We continue to enhance our product offerings with the launch of Service Exchange, the expansion of our Partners and Alliances program and the expansion of our global footprint to 11 new facilities across eight new and existing markets. We raised guidance three times over the course of the year delivering core FFO per share growth above the high-end of our original guidance range, and we delivered outsized growth in AFFO per share. Finally, we achieved this growth while strengthening our balance sheet. We paid down virtually all of our remaining secured debt. We reduced our floating rate debt exposure by more than half, and we lowered leverage by nearly half a turn. Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to say congratulations and thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in early March.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive quarter characterized by healthy leasing activity and solid execution against virtually every objective of our strategic plan laid out here on page two of our earnings deck. As you may have seen, we announced this afternoon that we've appointed Dan Papes as Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Dan was most recently President of Unify North America, formerly Siemens Networking Systems, where he had responsibility for managing all aspects of the business with total ownership of the P&L. Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27-year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business, including roles as Vice President of Global Cloud Services Sales and Vice President of Global Telecommunications Industry Sales. He has experienced leading global sales organizations and he has been responsible for driving significant growth in revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team and we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level. I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaap who ran our scale sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Rossabi who continues to lead our colocation and interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism, while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of eight highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, as shown here on page three. This transaction was strategic and complementary to our existing business; it was financially accretive, and prudently financed. In terms of integration, we are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Coupland as Managing Director for the region. Rob, previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam data tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully built out IT load of nine megawatts. Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers, and cable companies. In addition, we are on track to deliver the first of three phases of our 27 megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017. We have seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. Over the next quarter, we will be stabilizing our operations in the region and executing our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully leased Saint-Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter, as well as the previously announced sale of a four-property domestic datacenter portfolio. We do still have three small assets held for sale on the balance sheet but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our non-core assets. Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on page four. We announced the launch of our Service Exchange at MarketplaceLIVE in September. Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. Service Exchange simplifies interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable, and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, Service Exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access than the public internet. Service Exchange is powered by Megaport combining our respective core strengths. Digital Realty's high-availability datacenter offerings cover the spectrum from single rack co-location to multiple megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers' current needs and to enable their future growth. Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand to new markets. Service Exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from RightScale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multi-cloud strategy citing security, managing multiple clouds and the lack of resources as the top three challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service Exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds. Our Partners and Alliances program continues to grow, with several of our important partner sponsoring and participating in our very successful MarketplaceLIVE event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter, as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. In addition, with the announcement of Service Exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our existing partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of Service Exchange into their own offerings. We are very excited about the expanded opportunities Service Exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our Partners and Alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million, and deals executed during the quarter grew our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our Partners and Alliances program in early 2015. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page five. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply, competitors are behaving rationally, new entrants remain few and far between, and we are seeing healthy consolidation. In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia, as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters. Given the current pace of absorption of the remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers future growth during the third quarter as shown here on page six with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburn and Chicago, as well as the site of a future campus in Garland, Texas once our Richardson campus is fully sold out. And now let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we've built our organization to thrive, regardless of our environment, with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet, and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hard-working employees. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on page nine. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We assigned new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an $8 million co-location contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers signing across multiple locations and multiple continents. They also included a smaller, but rapidly growing new customer signing across four different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in co-location and interconnection signings in the U.S. with our interconnection bookings representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and one of the top three quarters in Telx's history. I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers. At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days. And I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke co-location reseller customer's PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 East Cermak in downtown Chicago. And we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly six megawatts of capacity, an original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million. As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 co-location customer leases and entered into a new agreement with a reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet gateway which has remained north of 96% leased for the past six years. Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and pre-leasing campaign to line up anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 East Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property at 350 East Cermak. Turning to our backlog on page 10, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted-average lag between third quarter signings and commencements remain healthy at four months below the historical average of roughly six months. Turning to renewal leasing activity on page 11, we retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and non-technical space offset by a roll down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix that we've called out for the last couple of quarters, which drove the roll down on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several above-market leases remaining now primarily in the Northeast region. So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. On balance, however, we still expect re-leasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the sub-70% lease portfolio in Europe along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy is measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond it to invested capital. If you turn to the next slide on page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built-out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140-basis-point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. Let's turn to Telx here on page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior two expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around MarketplaceLIVE and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. We do expect enhanced revenue flow through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as MarketplaceLIVE. The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be in focus on key facilities both interconnection hubs and connected campuses to drive growth and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that maybe easily accessed within the same building or Connected Campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth. With respect to expanding our customer base, we have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, the colocation and interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions, our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across eight markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity, not including the full transfer of 365 Main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia, during the third quarter. Funnel activity has met expectations, and new sales bookings have been positive. Capacity expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing (20:52) and connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust community of connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity at 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may pre-purchase space and power as needed. Finally, MarketplaceLIVE 2016 was an overwhelming success with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new Service Exchange in partnership with Megaport. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to a continued progress, as we refine our go to market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. At the one-year mark post-closing, we are on track to meet or exceed our underlying (21:53) targets and conclude the integration process. The volatility in currencies during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented a 100-basis-piont to 200-basis-piont drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling-denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation, as we head into 2017. I would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. Same capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis. And we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth respectively. Turning to the longer-term outlook on page 16 that we introduced on our Investor Day last October, you may recall that we got into a mid-to-high single digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts, but notably, AFFO per share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend. For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer-term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid-to-high single digits, and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017, early next year. By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps due to a full year contribution from Telx, as well as the burn-off of the one-time benefits to AFFO in 2016. Absent external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 than 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share each and every year as a public company and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception. Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of the net proceeds was used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier and we recognized a gain on sale of $169 million during the third quarter. We also redeemed our 7% Series E Preferred Stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognized a $10 million non-cash Topic D-42 charge for the write-off of the original issuance cost, which is an add-back to core FFO. We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt at a 5.9% weighted average interest rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this pay down by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May. Upon retirement of the mortgage debt pre-payable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining, or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also proactively termed out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, and as shown on page 18, floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. Even in a rising rate environment, a 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise on target with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1 times at September 30. Pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements, debt-to-EBIDTA will be less than 5 times. Our balance sheet is poised for new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Ed, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. First question comes down to guidance. Some of the assumptions moved around slightly; the one that you touched on was occupancy, and I was hoping maybe you can shed a little bit more light. You may have mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but on the overall reduction there in the assumption? And then, on the other side of things, it seems like you were ahead on a number of metrics and I would have thought ultimately that that would have contributed to better FFO growth on the year on a core basis, at least. Can you maybe just speak to those two points?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jordan. So, maybe turning to the guidance first. We reiterated the same guidance as the previous quarter of $5.65 to $5.75 core FFO per share. There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think, 50 basis points on the low end, a 30 basis point tweak on the G&A. The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing obviously the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy, and that number includes existing vacancy. That portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our data tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand new, up to nine megawatts asset, which is part of this transaction that will also bring some vacancy into the quarter. And then the other major driver I'd say is, in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took the assignment of a PBB lease, obviously that will go from a 100% occupied 83,000 square feet to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suite. Net-net, we think that was a great transaction for not only for the exiting customer but really for Digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable market-ready space in an incredibly hot market. That asset's been north of 96% for numerous years now. And then going to your second question, overall the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics, we either beat by a penny or met consensus estimates, but it was pretty much in line with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you probably were highlighting. The one thing I would say not negative but something that maybe put a little bit of drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was probably related to onboarding the European portfolio, which was expected. I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition which closed in early July and travel and work to bring that team into the fold, and probably some other activity around the or seasonally-related activity around our Marketplace Live initiative and other events. And the last thing I can think of off the top of my head, we did bring on two new board member during the quarter which has a little bit of incremental cost to the company, but I think they will be well worth it in the long run.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So, the question I had was around interconnection revenues, and I was interested in both the legacy Digital Realty properties as well as legacy Telecity over in Europe, and what are your plans or what's the progress towards phasing in the interconnects towards more of a recurring revenue stream? And then the follow-up is just looking at slide six, the land parcel slide made me wonder a little bit about Santa Clara, and how you view some of the opportunities there including maybe inorganic growth. And then any kind of update on Frankfurt's given that you have a building there and then you also have a new build that you've entered into, and so what are some of the plans that you have in that market? Thanks very much.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, interconnection, Santa Clara, Frankfurt, I'll do the first one and then I'll toss the last two to Scott. On interconnection, we are obviously integrating and bringing on board not only eight great assets in the Dockland, (34:17) the Science Park and also in Frankfurt, but a really tremendous team and also a new leader to lead our EMEA region. Their interconnection model had a very significant portion of reoccurring revenue spend, or not exact type of productization, but similar recurring revenue model. There will be further alignment across the global portfolio in terms of our interconnection services as we move forward. We've experienced, as you saw, a very strong quarter for interconnection signings quarter-over-quarter. And I think that is hopefully going to continue, and I think you are going to find us continue on those eight parts of the portfolio we're expanding our colocation, interconnection footprint be it in existing Internet gateways where Telx has historical resided, or on our connected campuses like in Ashburn or Richardson or other pockets of the portfolio. And I'll turn the Silicon Valley question over to Scott Peterson.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: On Santa Clara, we all know that there is discussion about a portfolio that's available on the market there. And we look at every opportunity in the marketplace, as we all know. We'll always keep an eye on that to see whether we view it as being strategic and how well it integrates into our portfolio and if it represents a good economic value and a good investment for our shareholders. We have a couple of land sites, smaller land sites available for future development in Santa Clara. We continue to look for additional capacity in that market since it's a good market. I think anybody familiar with that would know it's a tough market from a land perspective, so we need to be very creative in terms of acquiring more inventory there. As far as Frankfurt goes, we're very pleased with the level of activity. We're getting in that market. I think it started off very strong, and we'll continue to propose that to a number of customers on that, and so we've been very happy with the progress there so far.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, it's Paul Morgan. Just on the Service Exchange rollout and your interconnection, your volumes, how should we think about the timing of the rollout into additional markets? It looks like you've got kind of about half the ones you planned through 2017? Is that a near-term in Europe and the rest of the U.S.? And then that $9 million, 16% of your bookings in the quarter that's a good number. How are you guys thinking about that as a share and as a potential growth rate going forward, especially after the Service Exchange roll out?
Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. This is Jarrett. In terms of the Service Exchange, we're committed to an open environment. We've traditionally won business in the network-to-network, network-to-content, and network-to-enterprise verticals. This really gives us an opportunity to participate in the cloud ecosystem, which requires a new product offering and capability. So day one, we're announcing primarily our North America platform, but we're phasing it where we actually control the portal, we control the customer experience, and this allows our customers to essentially order virtual cross connects. So the phasing is largely deployed. We wanted to have colocation, interconnection, and our scale offerings, and now with the European assets we'll accelerate that as our second phase. So ultimately we'll have 15 markets, 24 data centers by second quarter of next year.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then my other question...
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Maybe I'll...
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, no, please, go ahead. If you want to say it again just to make sure we address it appropriately.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: No, I was going on to my follow-ups. If you have something more to say on interconnects, that's great.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I was just going to address I think to your question on the $9 million. So that's $9 million of total interconnection signings this quarter, we were $8 million or around $8 million last quarter. I am not sure we're going to continue that pace of quarter-over-quarter acceleration; it's quite rapid. But I think the key is continuing to bring on space at these very interconnection-dense locations as one part to spur additional interconnection revenue, and I think we're doing that by expanding in the likes of 56 Marietta, getting additional inventory in Cermak and other locations. And then I think the next leg of it will be leveraging the interconnection revenue that will come from the enterprise, the cloud, coming off the Service Exchange. But I think that second part will be more of a (39:27) later in the 2017 revenue generation.
Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks. And then just in terms of a couple of markets where you're committing capital for expansion, can you maybe comment on Northern Virginia and Chicago and the competitive environment there? You have some of your peers also doing the same. And I know what you've said about the demand-supply equilibrium now. But if you look into 2017 and 2018, how are you thinking about – give us an update how you're thinking about your preleasing and the future demand-supply balance?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Those were two particular markets, and we have a little bit of a – a little map in the deck of our campuses in Franklin Park in Chicago and obviously in Ashburn, Virginia. And based on pipeline signings we've completed to-date or through the end of the quarter, I should say, plus pipeline, there is a decent potential that we could be finishing out our existing (40:35) campus, the last 9377 building of Franklin Park and the last buildings on our Ashburn campus in the next several quarters, which should dovetail very well with the timing of deliveries of those parcels that are literally adjacent to the campus coming online. So those markets obviously are not without competition, but we seem to win our fair share and having a fairly robust pipeline in those two particular markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Hey, guys. Just maybe sticking with the Chicago market, you've got some land now in Franklin Park, you've got potential build-out next to the E Cermak and you took back some availability from the PBB tenant. Just curious based on your pipeline demand funnel, where are you seeing I guess more demand? Is it more downtown or is it in the Franklin Park area?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin. It's Andy again. We're seeing the demand in both locations. It's just different types of demand and at obviously different price points. As I just mentioned – on Franklin Park you're typically catering to a customer that is looking for more affordable total cost of ownership, seeking large amounts of space and power, and likely seeking an economic model that's in the low $100s per kilowatts. If you're going down to Cermak, we're signing and filling up space, including the space we just took possession of, at rates that could be more than double that. And that customer is obviously not taking – likely taking one megawatts to two megawatts at a time, is taking smaller quantums. They could be around 300 kilowatts, 400 kilowatts, but they're really taking those small amounts of space and willing to pay those higher prices in order to have the connectivity that our Cermak building offers. So we're seeing I'd say different demand sets in both locations but both seem fairly strong.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just maybe a question on the bookings trends. Last quarter there was concerns about the slowdown in bookings and then you had also announced some activity in early 3Q and it was discussed as a timing issue. So you take the two quarters together, you're at the $40 million-ish mark, which is relatively close to what it was in the prior couple quarters. Given the fact that you now have additional availability here in Chicago, you've got a new head of sales in place, some other development availability on the European portfolio as well, I guess, should we expect some steady increases in those bookings numbers, or is there any reason to think that we wouldn't see that in the next several quarters?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's fair to say. There's no surprises on this end that we were not pleased with the second quarter, but if you look at the third quarter, which was a quarter that quite frankly we were without a global head of sales for two-thirds of it and had a tremendous effort by both Andrew Schaap and Tony Rossabi stepping up to deliver for us. Net-net, I was pretty happy where the third quarter came out. I think there are some key takeaways that when I look through it, it was somewhat in our script. The demand was robust and diverse. We weren't counting on one single customer to do a single 10-meg deal. We had numerous customers, we had cloud service providers, other parts of SMACC, IT service. The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the London market post the Brexit vote, and those signings came not only from cloud service providers; they came from a disaster recovery firm, they came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers filling our existing signings in our funnel going into the fourth quarter. I wouldn't tell you I could bank on $55 million again in the fourth quarter, but I think when we have that pretty steady-eddie run rate trend – if you look back, and I think we have on our slide deck like a rolling LTM number that kind of looks how our trends are fairly smooth if you look over a long time period.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's – it's Scott here – that's page 21, I believe of the appendix. If you look at that, it does quarter-by-quarter on a trailing 12 months and you'll see that there's a much smoother line there, if you will. We always talk about the business being lumpy. So if you compare that with the signings in the main deck, you'll see how that smoothes out the lumpiness a little bit. The only one to take a look at is you'll see a little bump in early 2014, which is we had – kind of, we had very high signings when we were clearing through that excess inventory that had been built over the prior year-and-a-half or so. So that's a good illustration of how the – if you look over longer timeframes, the lumpiness gets smoothed out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good afternoon. If we think about the situation in Cermak where you took out that PBB customer, how many of those types of scenarios are you looking at across your portfolio where you might step in and do something like that?
Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Manny, they are always kind of few and far between. It's a product of the expiration schedules of various customers, our demand in those locations. I would say they're somewhat of events where the stars and moon and sun have to align. In Cermak we had a very highly leased, high-demand building with a customer, due to some regulatory constraints was looking to exit that building. Their lease I think only had like a year-and-a-half or so to run on it, so there was a path to a transaction that was beneficial to them and obviously beneficial to us. There is a handful of other pockets in the portfolio where that may apply, but I wouldn't say that is something that we can necessarily count on in any regards.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then going back to the occupancy guidance, just to make sure that I and other people on the call understand this correctl, when you say down 150 basis points to 200 basis points, that's versus December 31 of last year, correct?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Correct.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And so right now you're roughly 150 basis points down already. So you're saying that you could go down another 50 basis points from here through year-end. Is that right?
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We are saying we'll go down another...
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): 91.4%...
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Manny, this is John Stewart. We expect to be flat from here.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So the 89.9% where you ended is already at that guidance point?
John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Correct.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Great, thank you. I want to talk about the color commentary you gave on 2017 growth and how you anticipate it I think moderately slowing down. And I am just curious, is that based on just the trajectory of bookings and what's happened so far in 2016 and how you see that getting installed over the next few months and how that might make it more difficult to achieve the same growth in 2017 already at this point. Is it more a change in your expectation around market dynamics, whether it's in demand or pricing or is it perhaps even just a mix shift in terms of the assets you have now versus what you may have had going into 2016. And then I guess as a part of that, I was wondering if you can give some color on how the eight facilities that you acquired from Equinix/Telecity have been performing in terms of growth maybe over the last year, or any other color you can provide so we get a sense of what those assets look like in terms of their trajectory? Thank you.
Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Colby. The answer to your first question, those are some good ideas, but really, foreign currency is the biggest headwind. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we obviously look to hedge that with issuing sterling bonds, euro bonds, multi-currency revolver, and term loan. But there is obviously a spread between the yields on our assets and the cost of that debt. And that's – again, it's earnings translation risk, not economic risk. We're not repatriating capital in a meaningful way that we are having losses, but the FX I would say is the largest driver to that, I would say, sentiment preview. And then on the eight or so – on the eight European assets, five in London, two in Amsterdam, one in Frankfurt, maybe I will let – give Scott a chance to jump in on performance with the underwriting?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hi, Colby. Thanks. Yeah, so the performance since acquisition, it's only been a short time and so we've been very pleased with that performance. We're on track. If you looked at the performance prior to the acquisition, you saw – I think, your question was performance and specifically vacancy. You saw the vacancy there tick up a little bit and that was primarily the result of two large tenants migrating – customers migrating out of the portfolio, one of which came to us in our portfolio and the other one actually left and went to a – it was a gaming company that went closer to their corporate headquarters, geographically far away. But other than that the stickiness there has been pretty good and the velocity has been good too.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: And are those facilities growing at a rate similar, for example, to the Telx portfolio or is it more in line with the traditional DLRs, any color on that?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: From a utilization standpoint, probably a little closer to the Telx portfolio, if that's what you are...
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: I was talking about revenue growth.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Oh, revenue growth, it was – kind of – it's in between where we are and Telx.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sumit Sharma of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, everybody. Thank you for the transparency and the detail in the supplement and everything. Sort of a basic question in terms of, I guess, one of the things that we are wondering was the pricing per square foot or the GAAP rent per square foot for the new signings was kind of lower, down to $126 a square foot. I am struggling to figure out whether this is just regular way lumpiness and a function of product and geographic mix, or was there some pricing pressure that you saw?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say it's more of a mix contribution. We had a significant amount of signings from several customers and I'd say one of our lower price point markets, be it Northern Virginia or Chicago versus prior periods where we might have had more signings in the Silicon Valley or other higher priced markets. Now, the – I wouldn't – it's tough to take the signings from the second quarter as a great comparable data point. That was obviously a very small sample set in terms of signings, but on apples-to-apples basis, I wouldn't say we're seeing tremendous pricing pressure. The rates are held in relatively flat and the $120s due to concentration in North America in those lower price point markets. And at those rates those signings are still as you can see from our active development pipeline generating returns on our invested capital, unlevered returns right in our target thresholds of 10.5% to 12.5%.
Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's superb. If I could ask one more question. I guess in terms of your business mix which, roughly estimating the retail or the colo portion of the business is now or at least over 1Q and 2Q a little less than 30%. I guess, is there some kind of composition level that you foresee into 2017 or 2018? Do you see that go up to one-third or 35% or 40% in terms of just revenues?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: You know, it's – I would say there is no specific targeted mix that we have on the board that we're shooting for. And you are seeing very strong growth on both fronts. Obviously a substantial amount of our external growth had been acquisition of colocation-oriented, interconnection-oriented facilities over the last few years, which obviously moved that needle in addition to the organic growth associated with those acquisitions. But at the same time, a large chunk of our active development pipeline is developing scale projects, be it on our campus in North America and Asia, Australia or in Europe. And that is still a significant component to the growth. So I am not sure I could tell you the percentages are going to diverge one way or another. We're very focused on having the right assets and the right capabilities across all four continents to capture robust and profitable demand.
Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. Following up on that a little bit, it seemed like – with Q2 being light and 1Q was strong in terms of signings, but 3Q is very strong, it seems like the turnkey flex signings were of a bigger scale, a lot more square footage and I guess the average rent per square foot was a little bit lower. But on the colocation side, it seemed like the pricing was better and it seemed like there is some strength there. So kind of taking all this in, how would you characterize the environment for colocation and, I guess, the turnkey flex products? What are you seeing – where are you seeing strength or weakness?
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, the turnkey flex product is what we call scale or previously called wholesale. The bulk of the activity in North America or Northern Virginia, Chicago and Dallas was soft obviously with Silicon Valley kind of falling after that in terms of demand. And it's been – it was a robust quarter, and the pipeline for the fourth quarter remains robust as well. It's a significant amount of repeat business. It's a significant amount of multi-site business. It's a business where the customer is signing one-time on multiple continents with us. The size of the deals most recently kind of ranged from, call it, almost 1 meg to almost 4 megs in terms of size of scale deal. So there is some variability in that. Some of the bigger customers are taking bigger deployments. I already touched on some of the pricing trends there. On the colocation and interconnection side, you're really seeing, I think, the combinations of success really strategic internet gateway assets, a talented sales and marketing organization around them, executing on filling those assets up and these assets command higher prices given what they offer to the customers that decide to deploy in these locations. We, again, – we're in – we have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation interconnection efforts. We are not in all 50 states or 100 countries. We picked our spots to be in the internet gateway, the internet hubs or in select connected campuses which have connectivity to the cloud service providers for the enterprise. So, I think, where we picked our spots and how we tackled it, it's been able to generate pretty strong volumes at attractive rates have increase in the last quarter on the colo front.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And one quick follow-up, the European signings are strong. Was that legacy digital or was there any significant contribution from the Telecity-Equinix assets.
Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: The given – most of it is legacy digital. The colocation piece was contributed from the assets and the new team that joined the company. So, the 4 megs and $6.6 million of annualized revenue was legacy digital assets.
Operator: And our last question for the call will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. So I guess, just my question is more around expectations for Dan. Give us an idea of what do you expect to see change on the sales force and what are sort of his mandate kind of out of the box?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: This is Bill. His initial mandate is going to be to fully integrate the Telx Equicity (59:14) and Digital sales teams and create the appropriate efficiencies there, and then develop the right go-to-market, working off of what the team has developed, and then further to push on the partners and alliances front.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So with that, if we were to see better growth than sort of what the Street has modeled next year, would that entail hiring more sales people, and what would have to – what would change to see better than Street growth next year?
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So Dan hasn't come on board yet, so I'm not going to give him his budget whether it's a lower head count or a higher head count, and we haven't talked revenues yet either. So he starts next week. So, I think, we're premature there.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein, CEO for any closing remarks.
William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Ed. I would like to wrap up our call today by recapping our third quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 19. We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution, against our strategic plan. We continue to extend our global footprint with the closing of the European portfolio acquisition. We further enhanced our product offerings with the announcement of the launch of our service exchange. We're also continuing to deliver outsized growth in AFFO per share. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering used to redeem high coupon preferred equity and secured debt. In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you at Madrid in a few weeks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Trust Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Stewart: Thank you, Dan. The speakers on today’s call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including 2016 guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, see our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
William Stein: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I’d like to begin today with the discussion on governance. We recently announced that Laurence Chapman has been named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. The Board expects to appoint Laurence as Chairman of the Board at its next Annual Meeting in May 2017. Many of you have had the opportunity to interact with Dennis Singleton, who has served as our Chairman since April 2012 when the Company’s founder resigned from the Board. Dennis led the Board during a period of significant transition, including a change in CEO as well as several other executives, a change in Board composition, and two strategic acquisitions that have meaningfully enhanced the Company’s growth profile and product mix. It is expected that Dennis will continue to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors after he steps down as Chairman. In addition, I’m pleased to announce that Mark Patterson has joined our Board effective yesterday. Many of you may also be familiar with Mark. He was formerly the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch and prior to that he was the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Citi Group. He serves on the board of UDR as well as General Growth. We are absolutely delighted to welcome Mark to our Board. The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered Board. The majority of our Directors fees are paid in stock. Each of our Directors maintains a sizable investment in the Company. The Board and Senior Management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014 100% of the senior management teams long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder performance. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along those lines we announced several industry-leading sustainability initiatives earlier this month including a long-term agreement to procure wind power offsetting 100% of our U.S. colocation and interconnection energy footprint. Let’s turn to Page 2 of our presentation to recap the guide posts of our strategic plan. Delivering superior risk adjusted returns is our guiding principle. This entails emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we are willing to turndown deals that do not provide a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We also execute when we can achieve the best long-term outcome for shareholders irrespective of short-term reporting requirements. In terms of capital allocation, the highlight of the second quarter was the agreement that we reached to acquire a portfolio of eight highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt, three of the most important interconnection hubs in Europe as shown here on Page 3. This transaction met all of our acquisition criteria. It was strategic and complimentary to our existing business financially accretive and prudently financed. These eight data centers are highly complementary to our European platform. The portfolio serves more than 650 customers predominantly concentrated in the network cloud and IT services, content and digital media and financial services verticals. The concentration lines up very well with our target customer verticals and more than 80% of these customers are new relationships to Digital Realty. In addition, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, underscoring the value of these new customer relationships. As you know, this sales process was dictated by the European Commission with the clear objective of standing up a business that would be immediately competitive in the marketplace. What you may not know is that this business came staffed with 130 employees including 16 sales and marketing professionals. In contrast to the Telx acquisition, we have not underwritten any expense synergies in this acquisition. We are very pleased with the caliber of the personnel as well as the properties that we’ve acquired with this transaction and we welcome these new employees to the Digital Realty family. In terms of integration, it’s still early days, but we are actively working to ensure a smooth transition for the acquired business into the Digital Realty platform. And we are leveraging the lessons learned from the Telx integration to create a seamlessly repeatable process. Our teams are focused on communicating with our customers and employees and we are executing on short-term objectives for the business, moving people, integrating processes and standardizing reporting. Over the next quarter, we’ll finalize the plan to extend our colocation and interconnection platform and we will communicate it as appropriate. I should pause here for a moment to address the impact of Brexit. We did anticipate a potential Brexit scenario in our underwriting and we did hedge the purchase price, but we have not altered our global strategy. Fundamentally, we do not believe the EU referendum will materially impact global data center demand or our global portfolio as the secular demand drivers remain intact and the transatlantic cable landings have not moved. We believe our global platform is one of our key competitive advantages and we do not plan to exit either the UK or Continental Europe regardless of the outcome of the EU referendum. Early in the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our fully leased [san andonin] data center in Paris to Equinix for approximately $210 million or $575 per square foot. Also early in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of a four property data center portfolio as shown here on Page 4. The sales price was a $115 million or roughly $250 per square foot. Excluding 251 exchange, where the sole tenant is moving out this month. The portfolio cap rate is in the low 6s on forward contractual cash NOI and in the mid 7s assuming the near-term expiration were to renew. Since embarking on our capital recycling program in the second quarter of 2014, we have sold 10 properties and one investment generating net proceeds of $420 million not including the Paris property now under contract. As I’ve said previously, we’ve been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of our non-core assets and this portfolio sale substantially concludes our capital recycling program. We do however continue to believe that calling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our global connected campus strategy. In terms of expanding our product offerings, we’ve been working closely with our customers and leveraging the combined heritage of Digital Realty as a large footprint leader in addition to the Telx colocation and interconnection legacy. We are close to launching our service exchange which will further allow us to enable customers with dynamically interconnected large footprint and colocation data center solutions on a seamless connected campus uniquely meeting customer requirements. The service exchange is core to empowering hybrid cloud and IoT architectures in an extremely efficient and agile manner. We look forward to providing more details over the coming months and unveiling the benefits of the service exchange with our robust cloud ecosystem partners. In addition, we are continuing to make solid progress on the Telx integration. We are executing our systems roadmap. That work is on track and is expected to continue for the next several quarters. We planned to sunset the Telx brand during the third quarter and we are in the process of unifying our multi-product global sales force which we also expect to complete during the third quarter. Along similar lines, our partners and alliances program continues to expand. I am pleased to announce that CenturyLink, our second largest customer has joined our program enhancing options for connectivity, managed services and cloud services for our customers. During the second quarter, the partners and alliances program continue to drive revenues, including for hybrid cloud deployments that highlight the benefits of our connected campus strategy. I am pleased with the progress that we are making. In addition to adding CenturyLink to our partners and alliances program during the second quarter, we have begun executing on transactions for hybrid cloud deployments with one of our best customers and partners in advance of our formal go-to-market campaign which is set to begin shortly. As a result, we have already begun to realize revenue from this partnership and we expect to see even greater uptake once we formally launched the campaign. During the first half of the year, the partners and alliances group increased the total contract value of deals executed by more than 20% albeit off a modest base. The pipeline remains robust at approximately $40 million even after several deals were executed during the second quarter. Now let’s turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. New supplies picked up in Dallas and Northern Virginia over the past 90 days. Given the sector’s recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, demand is robust in both of these markets and pre-leasing levels on development pipelines are healthy. In addition, current market vacancy rates are low at our own portfolios in these markets are likewise north of 90% leased. Northern Virginia and Dallas are both national data center markets characterized by robust leasing velocity and solidly positive net absorption. And now let’s turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly over the past 90 days, primarily due to uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum. That data center industry has the good fortune of being levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both someone independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy. We believe it’s still early days for cloud adoption and the related build-out of cloud service providers compute node footprints. Although cloud requirements are lumpy and price sensitive. From where we sit and looks like the wave of cloud service provider demand has not crested yet. And we see a set way building on the horizon from the Internet of Things and connected devices. Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30% of enterprises will use cloud service providers direct when cloud connectivity services up from less than 1% at the end of last year. Given is expected growth strategic planners at the cloud providers are actively mapping out their approach. We believe that we are well-positioned to support this continued growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet the full spectrum of our customers data center demand requirements on a global basis. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?
Andrew Power: Thank you, Bill. Let’s begin with our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases totally $15 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, including a $6 million colocation space and power contribution. Interconnection contributed an additional $8 million and our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue. While this is towards the lower end of our recent activity levels. We are taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global connected campus footprint. We are winning diverse demand across attractive verticals including cloud service providers both big and small along with other growing segments of digital economy, IT service providers and other large sophisticated users. You’ll note the appearance of a Fortune 50 hyper-scale cloud service provider on our top twenty customer list this quarter. At the same time we also added more than forty new logos for the second consecutive quarter. Long story short we are focused on landing demand from a diverse and growing customer set. Along those lines, I am pleased to report that during the month of July we have already signed an additional $20 million of total bookings, including space, power and interconnection. This activity has included significant singings across all three geographic regions including a healthy mix of large enterprise software cloud providers, hyper-scale cloud providers, IT service providers and financial service customers. The total bookings figure includes $6 million of annualized colocation and interconnection bookings. In fact, the month of July has already been the best month for Telx since our acquisition. While we are not satisfied with the level of large footprint leasing during the second quarter. The pipeline for the second half is sizable and we are cautiously optimistic that we are back on track to return to normalize activity levels in the second half of the year. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced standard $70 million. The bulk of which is expected commenced within the next 12 months. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was a record low at 1.5 months. Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10, we retained 85% of second quarter lease expirations and we signed just under $60 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was up a little less than 3% overall with a positive cash mark-to-market across all property types, including another quarter of plus 5% for colocation. This was a bit better than expected largely because we did not execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix and on the East Coast that we have called out last quarter. We do still expect to renew those leases later this year, so we may see negative cash mark-to-market on our second half renewals. For the full year we now expect releasing spread to be slightly positive on a cash basis up from our previous guidance of flat on a cash basis. In general we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we’re making on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. Let’s turn to Telx here on Page 11. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $94 million of revenue during the second quarter representing 9% growth year-over-year. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50 interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 11%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expend synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the second quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts and we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. We have added a number of new sales reps who have already begun contributing to the success of this business. As part of integrating our global sales force we planned to add - continue to add sales resources through the end of the year including key position to drive our vertical ecosystem development and solutions efforts. The colocation and interconnection strategy has been to focus on key facilities and drive growth associated with our ecosystem including multi-site customer wins. We are seeing progress across five emerging ecosystems, networks, subsea cable systems, mobile, digital content and over the top distribution and the cloud community. During the second quarter, we announced that we landed another undersea cable system in our Hillsboro, Oregon facility. Subsea cable systems are an area of particular focus for us and we have had success today in the Pacific Northwest where there has been a heightened interest in landing cables. In mid May we announced that we will be launching colocation and interconnection services on our Ashburn campus during the third quarter. We are scheduled to launch in September but the sale team has begun pre-selling the site. And we already signed a handful of new deals. In addition, Atlanta has shown significant growth over the past few years and we are completely sold out. So we have begun working to bring on additional capacity to accommodate our overflow from 56 Marietta and should launch early next year. As mentioned last quarter Marketplace Live will take place in New York on September 22. We look forward to providing updates on products and services and formally introduced in our revised branding and we hope many of you will be able to join us there. In summary, at the one year mark since the Telx acquisition announcement we’re on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and complete the integration process. Turning to our financial results on Page 12, we reported 2Q 2016 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.04 ahead of consensus. The outperformance was fairly broad based with the topline OpEx, G&A and interest expense is a penny ahead of expectations. AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the beat at the FFO line as well as accretion from Telx and a further reduction in straight line rental revenue as shown on Page 13. Recurring CapEx was also down significantly again this quarter. Although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up in the second half of the year. Since a portion of the lower CapEx spend is essentially timing related the second quarter AFFO per share growth is somewhat inflated. But nonetheless we’re well on our way to delivering the double-digit AFFO per share growth we committed to at our Investor Day last October. The AFFO payout ratio is now sub 70% and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital. The current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. The bottom line is that quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating reflecting the improved underwriting discipline we’ve instilled over the past two years along with consistently improving data center market fundamentals. As you may have seen from the press release we raised our core FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at both ends of the range. We’ve raised the full year projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points again this quarter to 57% at the midpoint. You may recall from our Investor Day presentation last October, the lease set out a target of a 200 basis point EBITDA margin expansion by 2018 from 55% to 57%. We are nowhere close to hanging out the mission accomplished banner today and we do expect the EBITDA margin will continue to fluctuate over time as we reinvest in the business, but we are pleased with the progress we are making towards the final objective on our three-year guideposts achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share. We also raised our 2016 same capital cash NOI growth guidance again this quarter by 150 basis points at the low end up to 2.5% to 4% or roughly 3.5% to 5% on a constant currency basis. FX represented roughly 50 to 100 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 14. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. As shown on Page 15, the UK represents approximately 13% of total revenues and approximately 5% is denominated in euros. Pro forma for the eight property portfolio acquisitions that closed in July. However, as you can see from the table in the middle of the page, we have over $1 billion of strong debt outstanding and we also completed our inaugural $600 million Eurobond offering earlier this year. We have effectively matched the currency of our assets with our liabilities in these markets. So our total European net asset exposure including currency hedges is less than 5%. We may tap the sterling bond market again either later this year or earlier next year to further naturally hedge our sterling-denominated assets. Finally, I’d like to point out that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure; it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements, our strategic customers around the world which we believe is a key competitive advantage. In terms of our second quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy was flat sequentially at 93%. Overall portfolio occupancy dipped 50 basis points sequentially to 90.4% due primarily to development deliveries placed in service in our highest demand markets. We expect overall portfolio occupancy to pick back up by the end of the year. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 3.6%. Let’s turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 16. As you know, we executed a forward equity offering in mid-May to permanently finance the European portfolio acquisition. The underwriters also exercised their overallotment option in full, so we expect to receive total net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements. In the interest of time, I won’t dwell on the mechanics today, but I would like to point out that we have included a Slide here of Page 16 that does provide some detail on the mechanics of the forward sale agreements for those who may be interested. When we close the portfolio acquisition in early July, we initially funded the purchase with a drawdown on our line of credit in an effort to match sources and uses, which we have attempted to layout for you on Page 17. In addition to the proceeds from the equity offering, we expected to close on the portfolio sale as well the Paris option property. In terms of timing for the uses, the preferred equity is not reviewable and the mortgage debt is not pre-payable until later this summer. Consequently, we expect to settle all or substantially all of the forward sale agreements by the end of the third quarter as we fund the additional use of the capital laid out here on Page 17. Remember that we can flex line of credit up or down at any time, but the forward sale agreement is a one-way drawdown. Finally, on Page 18, we provided a recap of our 2016 capital markets activity on the right as well as the pro forma impact from the equity offering and the European portfolio acquisition on the left hand side. As you can see we are keeping our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities consistent with our financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Dan, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Yes, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the rent question. You talked about positive releasing spreads and the mark-to-market across the portfolio rising. Can you talk a little bit about the trends in rents you’re seeing in your markets and given essentially rising occupancies across most portfolios and very high pre-leasing rates amongst the development this out there?
Matthew Miszewski: Yes, Jordan, it’s Matt Miszewski. Thanks for the question. In keeping in alignment with what Andy have stated in his opening remarks and especially in our core markets but more broadly as well we see stable to slightly improving rates, which also happen to be coupled with some of the great work that Jarrett’s team is involved we’ve been focused on cost containment in design and construction. So that we expect as the programs that we’re developing right now move forward to have even better performance from a pricing perspective. As our ecosystem development work that’s underway right now starts to take hold. The pre-leasing rates that in these markets similarly look good. Internationally in particular rates look fairly strong. So strength in Chicago, in Ashburn, in Dallas and in Singapore which is great given the new facility that we just launched.
Jordan Sadler: So it sounds like you are trying to, I mean, rates are stable now, but you are trying to dry them a little bit with some of the new programs. I guess as a follow-up, A, if you guys could characterize the funnel, it sounds like while this quarter was not the most robust in terms of total leasing volume, it sounds like there is a significant pipeline behind it. July was big. How would you characterize the funnel? Since you’re being selective, how would you characterize the funnel in terms of high margin versus lower margin opportunities?
William Stein: Great question Jordan and really since before the acquisition of Telx but really with the acquisition of Telx and working closely with that team we’ve been focused on making sure that the funnel is not just full, but it’s full of the right opportunities in the right target accounts. Given our targeted focus on SMACC continuing, social mobile, analytics cloud and content, but especially inside that cloud and social verticals our funnel has been slightly - it has slightly improving margins in it currently and I do say currently because its pipeline and we have to close, but we’re pretty happy that we’ve been able to slightly expand the margin inside the funnel as we start to work together with multiple products. In addition but we’ve been working together very, very closely with multiple clouds - large cloud service providers to make sure that we can match value for value going forward given their demand and given our capacity and given the pipeline, the pipeline margins this would give the pipeline margins for the rest of this fiscal year and moving into Q1 of 2017 potentially better outcome.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkin, is your line on mute?
Jonathan Atkin: Sorry about that. So I was interested the remaining milestones that you have perhaps on the operations side. You talked about integrating the sales force and retiring the brand, but what remains to be done with the Telx integration as well as what would be some of the initial milestones as you look at the European assets that you just acquired?
Andrew Power: Thanks, Jonathan, this is Andy. In terms of remaining milestones I would say unifying the brand under one brand across the Company is a big one, one global sales force is another big one that is going on, both of those going on really right now. Remaining milestones other than, obviously, meeting or exceeding our underwriting targets probably be more back of the house oriented in terms of accounting systems that will eventually be fully united and kind of HRIS systems. I think in terms of facing the customer and driving more revenue, the two that we mentioned on this call are the biggest that are kind of nearing the end zone. On the European portfolio acquisition, quite frankly its early days, we are delighted to receive approval from the commission and ultimately closing the acquisition what is I guess a handful of days or weeks ago. We think we got a really talented team along with some very attractive assets coming on board. We have onboarded some consulting help to kind of help us simulate the 130 team members and assets with our existing franchise in Europe. So we probably have more to post you on that integration coming next earnings call, but just a handful of weeks of post closings, so far so good.
Jonathan Atkin: And then my second question or follow-up would be just on Telx and progress on some of the West Coast assets. If I look at your supplemental and kind of at the property level, it seems like it’s been fairly slow initial process in seeing increasing utilization there. So I just wondered if you had any commentary on how that’s progressing.
William Stein: It may have not flow through to our supplemental because until a commencement happens on a lease, it won’t show up in a utilization stat and some of those buildings are kind of portions of our building, so you can’t always see it transparently. We have seen some traction increase not on the East Coast, but also the West Coast. I’m not sure that’s kind of coastal specific, I think it’s more a testament to onboarding more QBRs and we have several on-ramp that newly joined the Company. And they’ve, quite frankly, the new QBRs have driven a lot of new logos and customers which is what I would say attributed to Telx’s successor in the quarter which was certainly backend loaded more towards June and the beginning of the quarter and then that success is certainly spilled over in the month of July.
Operator: And our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich: Thank you. Hey, guys. You kind of touch on this already, but I’m just curious how long do you to think it’s going to take to integrate fully the recent Equinix deal and then also along with that, does that kind of limit your ability to do other acquisitions or do you feel like you still have capacity to do other deals?
Andrew Power: Maybe just to rehash Lukas on the first part then I’ll hand it back to Bill and Scott on other deals. I mean quite frankly, we’re fortunate very similarly to our Telx acquisition in buying a very strategic and complimentary collection of assets and team members. In Europe, previously our position was much more anchored around our scale leasing and more campus oriented products. What we’ve closed on with the eight assets and that team is prized assets in the Dockland of London or the size parker Amsterdam or actually in Frankfurt it works very well with the land we purchased and a sales force oriented towards selling that small footprint, higher price point, colocation and interconnection oriented offering. So that’s what makes this one a little bit easier, is that there is no expense synergies being sought here. We actually want to put additional resources to support the sales force. It’s very complementary with the existing team over there. They’ll be moving into our office on Gracechurch Street within the month where we had a little space to fit the corporate team. And so I don’t have a date to fill, but I think this one could actually integrate more efficiently or more timely than Telx. And I’ll turn it back over to Bill and Scott to handle the back half of your question.
William Stein: Hey, Lukas. So as Andy said, actually I feel like we’re further along on the equity assets than Telx at the same time just because of the nature of the acquisition, so I think it should take less time. So looking at the M&A environment, there are certainly quite a few opportunities out there. I think that been written about. And Scott and his team are constantly scanning landscape and looking at those opportunities and we will see what happens. Scott, do you want to add anything to that.
Scott Peterson: Yes. I would agree we’re focused on integration. We want to be good stewards of our shareholder capital. I think one of the great aspects of these two acquisitions is these platforms give us a lot of flexibility. We can grow the platforms organically. We could grow through M&A, but we have a lot of flexibility and that allows us remain disciplined in our future M&A activity.
Lukas Hartwich: Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you. I wanted to start with the leasing numbers, the $15 million in the quarter. Would you characterize that more a function, and it being lower than what you’ve been doing, which you characterize that more a function of you’re not chasing the deals that are out there because you think that the returns don’t meet your criteria? Did you not necessarily have capacity in the markets where some of the bigger deals were being won this particular quarter? Or is it that you actually are bidding and you’re losing out perhaps to others? And then I guess just a follow-up to that, in your prepared remarks, Bill, you mentioned that you don’t think that the cloud demand has crested yet and I guess that ties into some of the color that Matt gave in the first as it relates to the funnel and how you think you could see some strong demand I guess in the back half of this year and then into the first quarter and that could give higher margin. I was wondering if you can just give a little bit more specificity around what areas or what gives you the confidence that you guys will actually be involved with some of the cloud demand in the back half of the year? Thanks.
William Stein: Thanks for the question and thanks for fitting five questions into one question.
Colby Synesael: That’s a south-side skill.
William Stein: Yes. You had south-side got that skill. That’s right. So I would certainly characterize it as you did. I was not pleased with what I call below average scale product signings in the quarter. We do think that the pace was due to a couple of things that you mentioned, but also the normal lumpiness that’s become part of our business especially given the new hyper-scale demand that’s out there. But also as you said a more selective approach to making sure that we land the right mix of customers at the maximum - to maximize the long-term value that we think we have inside of our ecosystem. So this means, as you said one of the potential reasons for that number is our continued commitment to a disciplined approach to our underwriting criteria and focusing really on top tier markets and not focusing on tertiary markets where some customers may have a desire to go and then maintaining a disciplined underwriting and pricing regimen to protect long-term value. And on your second question, really the overall demand remains strong. It’s evident by the July that we’ve had so far in both sections of our global business as well as the healthy pipeline that I talked about which has the potential for margin expansion as we move on. We do think that we’re on track now to resume normal levels in the second half across all parts of the business in 2016. Specifically though with regard to your question about demand and cloud demand remaining strong especially where we are in our global markets where we operate. It’s important to remember that that cloud business is still one of the fastest growing segments landing in our industry and from analysts from right scale all the way through to Gartner they all tend to agree that we are actually in the early innings of this new cloud ecosystem breaking out. We are also starting to see the green shoots. We’re seeing mass adoption of a diversity of cloud players not just the major cloud players and early adopters that are out there which we think and to get your last question. We think we’re uniquely situated to be able to land. We do believe that we’re the only Company in this space that is very focused on providing great scale solutions for folks who need scale solutions including those cloud service providers, but also providing colocation right next to it at a latency that can’t be beat as well as the security that comes with the power of private networking or interconnection products. So we really think that the secular demand drivers in the cloud industry are continuing to push them and we are uniquely situated to be able to address it.
Colby Synesael: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Petersen: Great. Thank you. I guess just to follow-up on the leasing volumes, I mean, I know you can certainly have bad quarters. But this is essentially three quarters in a row where your volumes have been below some of your wholesale peers. I’ll just name them, like DuPont and CyrusOne. And so I guess given your comments on focusing on profitability over velocity, I guess that it kind of begs the question if the achievable profitability or the yields on these facilities have declined permanently and you guys just need to move your rents down to compete better.
Andrew Power: Sure. Let me timing this is Andy. Since matching dress and some of these already. So a couple topics one timing why I’d always love to have a better fiscal second quarter rather have a better deal on July 1, then a less attractive deal on the June 30. So I think you saw a little bit of that with the volume of sign that just got signed the first few days or weeks of the month of July. And just to put a little more meat on the bone that’s going from a diversity of different types of customers. It’s included hyper-scale top three cloud providers, a sizable chunk from other cloud providers that aren’t in the top three and then another chunk from the rest of what we call smack of the digital economy or IT services or other transaction verticals. So we’re seeing that our demand signings in the second quarter and July from diverse growing customer sets. The other thing I think that to draws the distinction, it is not just about pricing the profitability to we’re really focused on driving the long-term growth in the cash flow and attractiveness in value of our assets our campuses and our gateways with a diversity of different customers versus some of our peers who may be more focused on being in non-core market to us or doing a full build to suit with one customer in one shot. So we always want more exposure and more signings at the right rates from the top cloud providers but we’re focused on collective portfolio and drove that cash flow and value our assets.
Matthew Miszewski: And Jon just to give you a little bit of color. While we had a good quarter with regard to those top cloud service providers still 37% of the revenue we closed year-to-date has come from other cloud service providers. So we have a diversity of cloud exposure including 50 new logos that were landed year-to-date inside the smack verticals. So we’re fairly happy with that diversity.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay, and then just thank you for that. And then just kind of an unrelated question. On the guidance, I’m just trying to reconcile the $0.10 increase in the quarter. Obviously closing the EquiCiti assets, I would think, is what is driving the underlying increase. You also have cash rent growth. Now you’re expecting it to be positive rather than flat so all these kind of positive moves and yet I don’t see any change to top-line revenue. Help me kind of understand why we are not seeing anything increment there?
William Stein: Sure. So the breakdown on the $0.10 is really kind of a third, a third, a third story. The first third is kind of outperformance which we’ve already mentioned topline G&A, OpEx. That we kind of got in the bag from the performance in the quarter. The second, third is kind of flow through from that operational performance into the back half of the year and the last third is due to the big question. Overall net accretion from the act the - buy the European portfolio acquisition and the funding with the asset sales and the equity and also the repayment of the debt and preferred. So the third, a third, a third, a third, the first two-third operational related the last third more or more accretion from our most recent investment. On the topline the two things what’s kind of held us back from kind of nudging that up at this time, one was the - we are going to lose some revenue when we sell our fully leased property at St. Denis here fairly shortly. And two we do have some FX headwinds in the top revenue line item which or heads when it comes down to core FFO per share gains but on that top line of our guidance going to use the growth.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead
Vincent Chao: Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to the Equinix asset acquisitions. You made a point of pointing out the number of employees that you picked up there, including 15 sales professionals. I’m just wondering at this point, have all the key players been sort of locked down in terms of them staying or is there still risk of some of those guys leaving the platform?
William Stein: Hey, Vince. The key guys are intending to stay through the balance of the year. And we’re working on contracts for them that will tie them up beyond that.
Andrew Power: I would add is that this particular team really of their own volition went into this process along with these data assets to kind of essentially at the EU request set up a standalone business that could stand on its own if it had to. So talented individuals across multiple departments coming together with the strong leaders and quite fortunately landed in our hands. We’re the complimentary buyer no synergies expected, so very little overlap of any and we are able to kind of - we think the combination of our European portfolio plus data assets and teams, one plus one we feel is greater than two there.
Vincent Chao: Okay, yes. Thanks for that, and then just going back to some of the pricing commentary that we’ve been talking about today, and just looking at some of the data that you provide across the supplemental that might point to improving pricing, I’m looking at sort of the development yields that you’re expecting are up a little bit, I think, from last quarter. I don’t know if that is mix or not, but then the cash spread commentary also would point to maybe a little bit better market pricing. I’m just curious what kind of market price improvement are you expecting for this year and maybe next year if you have that?
Andrew Power: You know, I quite frankly we’re fairly cautious when it comes to kind of a going out too far in terms of future rank growth here. I could say at the larger end of the scale, the biggest buyers they are buying bulk and taking on numerous megawatts have the greatest pricing power and their rates are certainly flat. They’re not seeing any type of rent spike. If you walk down to the other side of the spectrum and look at our smallest footprint colocation, I think you can look at the cash release and spreads which is up now 5% for the second quarter and it was a pretty sizable this quarter actually amount of leases - just in terms of colocation that rolled up, so we were able to roll these customers up 5%. And they are able to generate some pricing power. Between those two goalposts its very market and customer episodic.
Operator: And the next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman: Hi, guys. If we look at page 16 of the supplemental, the NAV, the components of NAV, and we look at the first section which is the cash NOI by property type, it looks like there is some significant movements between the business segments. And I’m just wondering if that was just a change in reporting or if there’s something going on with either the revenues or the margins impacting each business, specifically with colo non-tech and then leased Internet gateway coming down pretty significantly about 16%, 18% quarter-over-quarter?
Andrew Power: Manny, I am trying to flip to get that Page and are following this financial supplemental. I think the only - I think we may be more accurately mapping towards the NOI buckets this quarter than previously. I’m not aware of a dramatic change quarter-over-quarter.
Emmanuel Korchman: That’s fine. We call follow-up offline on that one.
Scott Peterson: Sorry about that.
Emmanuel Korchman: No, that’s all right. The other question I had for you, if you look at sort of the very, very short lease to commencement timing in this quarter, which certainly different than we have seen in the past, does that give you any concern that you’re not filling the backlog? And if we look at the July 30, excuse me, the post June 30 leasing that you spoke about, is that more similar to the four to six to seven month commencement or is that also kind of here now, take now sort of lease up?
Andrew Power: I think the short number is just a smaller sample size that actually closed during the quarter. So I think you can get back to the previous bars on what the signs in July in the rest of the quarter. So I mean, we like the short side to commencement because the cash flow comes quicker, right versus kind of the leaving something that you have to build and come online in a year to two years, but I don’t think one and a half months is definitely an anomaly.
William Stein: Manny, it was a disproportionate focus on market ready inventory that we were still clearing out, so I’ll agree with Andy that while I would love the 1.5 to stick a little bit. You should expect to see revert to the norm coming up especially given July.
Operator: And the next question comes from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. In terms of the large, megawatt, multi-megawatt cloud signings we’ve seen this year, I’m curious to hear your thoughts on how competitive those bids are, what factors are going into those who are landing these deals, and I can appreciate kind of the diversity of your leasing mix here and the lumpiness of those signings, but it does appear that the rates you’re signing are substantially above where we’re hearing those other deals getting done. I am curious to just kind of hear your thoughts on the competitive environment behind those larger deals?
William Stein: Yes. Thanks, Matthew. So the competitive environment is I would characterize it as strong for especially what we turn the hyper-scale opportunities that are out there about 3.5 megawatts and above. And as you know we’re certainly not new to the cloud service provider environment. We continue to get our fair share each and every quarter, but most importantly our focus on is on getting them at the right returns for Digital Realty, so we stay very focused on that. With the competitive bids, it does put a certain amount of power in these cloud service providers hands and we find that the closeness that we have with a number of them and extending to all of them as we move forward gives us the ability to have that value for value conversation that I referenced earlier. So we know that they have a high degree of value on things like inventory availability and large scale inventory availability as well as connectivity to colocation facility. And as we unearth those opportunities with cloud service providers they see the value, they match the value and it allows us to not just go to the lowest price, but to go to the best value for Digital Realty. And so that’s really been our focus and it’s going to continue to be.
Matthew Heinz: Okay. Thanks. And just one more as a follow-up on the guidance, I’m wondering what you are assuming for revenue contribution and EBITDA this year from the EquitCiti transaction, and I guess with the revenue, again, with that number not moving, are you assuming that there’s just offset there from some portfolio sales and FX? Just a little deeper on the revenue guide if you would please?
Andrew Power: Hey, Matt. Could you hear that answer to that last question?
Matthew Heinz: I couldn’t hear it at all. We can follow-up offline.
Andrew Power: So in terms of the underwriting the second part of your question we’re still believe in our underwriting of the 13 times EBITDA that we announced when we made the acquisition announcement last May. So nothing’s changed in terms of outlook there and that’s what’s included in our revised guidance for 2016. In terms of revenue it’s really about the gain from a partially a period on the pre-portfolio has been offset by FX headwinds and revenue loss associated with the safety knee asset. And also the portfolio assets that we’ve now closed on. So both of those disposed, we lose some revenue in the back half of the year and we have some ethics headwinds offsetting other revenue gains from the European portfolio. How that one do.
Matthew Heinz: That works just fine. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess two questions. Most have been asked and answered. First, Andy, maybe you could be a little bit more precise in terms of timing of the equity distribution from a share count perspective. Is it fair to assume, then, you’ll issue for modeling purposes, the shares at September 30? Is that the way we should think about it in sort of going through and coming out with our FFO numbers? And then I guess my second question, I will come back actually for that if you could help me first?
Andrew Power: Sure. So the whole reason with the timing is really just the moving parts on the sources and uses and we didn’t have 100% clarity when we were very able to close out for us to dispose and we think the safety need dispose will close shortly but it could be at the beginning of August could be at the end of August and we can repay that preferred debt till late summer anyways. So what we did is we closed on the revolver short-term we used revolver closing the acquisition short-term. And then when all the dust settles on all these other uses of capital. We plan to pull down all if not all or substantial all of the equity which is 14.3 million shares including the over a lot option that was exercised. Probably I want say maybe probably before September 30 maybe the beginning of September is my guess when all the dust settles here?
Jonathan Schildkraut: Okay. That’s helpful. And then you know you said during your prepared comments, and Matt actually said in answering Colby’s question that you guys were very selective in your choosing of customers and so I just wanted to know exactly what that meant. Does that mean that you’re not taking the same customers as some of the other guys who are taking these hyper scale deals or that - I’m not sure what that meant?
Andrew Power: I think just to clarify and I will let Matt clarify as well had some a counter. I don’t think that we have lots of great customers over 2000 customers now could in our most recent acquisition. I don’t think we’re choosing customers that we don’t want to do business with and I regard I think all of our customers are great and we want to continued more business and grow our customer base. I think it’s making sure we pick our spots on the right opportunities. So buildings on our campus or within are gateways that we can fill with the diversity of different take and small cloud service providers other parts of our smack vertical, IT service providers, corporate enterprise that all want to thrive and continue the growth space and there. We find that is a better opportunity to land versus it on the core market or outside the core market especially not going after a kind of one big swath of leasing slash capital and almost like single tenant build to suit opportunities. We think the former versus a lot us more attractive to what we put our capital.
Matthew Miszewski: And in Jonathan just real quick. I mean there’s that there are a couple of places where we are being more selective moving forward. As you know from the most recent Investor Day our focus on serving enterprise customers through the channel is certainly one of those cases, which actually makes the terms that that those organizations except a little bit easier on us and make the economics a little bit better for us as well as for the end customers down the road. The second piece is that the ecosystem development that we’re undergoing right now will really drive who we pursue in terms of end target customers. We’ve moved to a new account targeting solution that allows us to hit not just the top cloud service providers, not just the massive cloud service providers but really about 500 targeted accounts that we can focus on and then also focus on the channel. So that’s the targeting that I was really referring to. And the final piece is we do continue to have a great strategy of building up incredible campuses. And so we want to make sure that we have multi data center campus facility and so we need to attract those types of customers and I’ll let Jarrett.
Jarrett Appleby: Yes. I think partnering up with the partner in Alliance Group there’s a couple unique things. One having colocation now on the campus in Ashburn and Richardson next to the leading cloud service providers is high value we’re seeing severely wins in that. We do need that service exchange that provides those new connectivity options. And the second is we’re getting multi-site deals in the ecosystems because we’ve expanded our cage capability in many of the buildings that we own that Telx is in and that’s now bringing more magnets in who bring their customer base in with them. So those are a big push that will have from our product and delivery. And then finally with the new land we have acquired we’re now using our new design and can design and delivery capability. Now in Greenfield campuses at even larger scale and so you’re seeing that next generation of product in places like Ashburn and Dallas.
Operator: And our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on a clarification. Given the EquitCiti asset probably is a little bit lower margin that the core business and it’s staying in guidance, what gave you the confidence to raise up the guidance range for adjusted EBITDA to 56 to the 58?
Andrew Power: Hey, Richard this is Andy. Even with the absorption of - you’re correct lower margin than existing digital. Based on the outperformance we’ve seen on the EBITDA side or expense side year-to-date and what we’re trending for the remainder of the year. We think we’re going to be able to absorb that portfolio and continue to maintain - I should say deliver slightly higher than previously disclosed EBITDA margin. There is a little bit of an order of magnitude going on here with the portfolio being $900 million and relative to digital size.
Richard Choe: Makes sense. And then for the development CapEx guidance, it’s been very light for the past few quarters. It seems like it really would have to accelerate to even get to the low end, let alone midpoint or high end. Is that the right way to think about that?
Andrew Power: On the development CapEx spend. I think you’re right. We’re probably if you look to those two goal posts we’re probably close to the low end than the high end. But I won’t put it out of reach yet. But I would say we’re probably guide into a little bit on that spend towards the low end.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sumit Sharma of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma: Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the four assets you sold. Just trying to get a sense of whether these were non-core or more on the opportunistic side of things given the low 6 cap rate. Any color you could provide would be really helpful?
Scott Peterson: Yes. Scott here. Yes, it’s fair to determine or to call them non-core, St. Louis is a non-core secondary market, that asset was better placed in the hands of somebody pursuing that strategy. And then the two Northern Virginia assets, well that is a core market; those assets would not be considered core assets to our ongoing strategy.
Sumit Sharma: Okay. Fair enough. And in terms of the SS NOI guidance phase, the 2.5 or 3.5 on constant currency basis to 5, assuming there’s 3% escalators on all of your rents, I guess there has to be somewhere in there that just seems pretty significant asking rent hike around the 10% range. Just trying to get a sense of what kind of asking rents are you seeing and who is driving that kind of thing?
Andrew Power: Sure. I would say - so our bumps are 2% to 3%, but not all 3% just to be clear. So I think the reason we really changed increased our same capital cash NOI growth. We’re doing a little bit better on the retention. Doing a little bit better on a cash mark-to-market then from a quarter ago and that kind of translates into that kind of a 3 to 3.5 constant currency growth rate. You are not - that space and there’s a pretty demonstrative footnote at the top does not have the Telx colocation, mark-to-market really running through it, as we want to really reflect the true chain capital stabilized portfolio, so you’re not getting the 5% plus mark-to-markets like we’re seeing on the colo side yet. Next year we’ll be in that pool, but right now this is just really retention and modest mark-to-market from the - are more of our scale leases expiring and for those and those 2% to 3% rate bumps and then managing the OpEx prudently.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for any closing remarks.
William Stein: Thank you, Dan. I’d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our second quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 19. We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we further advanced our global footprint with the European portfolio acquisition. We also delivered solid current period financial results. We beat the Street by $0.04 with better than expected results above and below the NOI line. We also delivered outsized AFFO per share growth during the quarter. The quality of our earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. We raised guidance by $0.10 with an improving outlook for most of our key metrics and solid progress towards our three-year target of 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering that coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 index. In conclusion, I’d like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us and have a great summer.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter, the second of the four guiding principles that we laid out at our Investor Day last October and is shown here on page two of our earnings presentation. I'm very pleased to announce that we signed a multi-megawatt hangar lease with a hyper-scale cloud service provider in Osaka, totally pre-leasing phase one of our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year. We also announced that we established a foothold in Germany with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt. We have begun the local entitlement process and we expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand. As you may recall, Germany and Japan have been our top two target markets. And we're very pleased with our progress during the first quarter, particularly in a manner that is consistent with our overarching objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns. We also delivered solid current period financial results. Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks but the out-performance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on page two achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share. As we have explained, we have made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services. Nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive sales force necessary to target corporate enterprise directly. We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. Our Partners and Alliances program continued to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability Services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership, as it highlights our strategy of targeting enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners' best-in-class services. We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our Partners and Alliances program and we have added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program. In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on the national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned at our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway and we expect to close within the next several months. Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see, from the charts on page three, current construction activity represented by the green bars is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas, and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on page four. First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top tier national markets with high visibility on demand and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single-digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% leased. These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of two times to three times the level of current supply. Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these three markets over the last 12 months and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of development projects upon delivery. And now let's turn to the macro environment on page five. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days, although, the rate of growth still remains subdued. Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation, or the price of oil and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have the good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy as well as the broader IT industry. Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more; CIOs, Chief Information Officers, are looking to stretch their IT dollar further, narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing of corporate IT function is being embraced as a more efficient model. The rapid growth of cloud adoption is reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies' IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting, and cloud data centers, while one-third of IT staff are expected to be employees of the third party service providers. Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017. These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute note footprint to meet those demands. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large scale requirements on a global basis. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on page seven. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split roughly 50%-50% between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $38 million of cash EBITDA during the first quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than planned on all fronts. And we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. Over the past 90 days, the Telx team has been focused on a few key areas within the business. First is our customers, where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet gateways. Second is cash flow where we've been focused on the development of a commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems; we are in the process of integrating systems between the two organizations which will include a combined customer portal. With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasized the continued development of targeted vertical and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% up-tick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter. In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet gateways and areas such as content, wireless, and mobility services, undersea cable systems, and many other verticals that drive connectivity growth. We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the Faster (11:54) and AquaComms cable systems last year and we plan to announce the signing of an additional underseas cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer our customer base continued diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities. With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power, and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual rate increases from our colocation customers while within their term and we're working to consolidate licensee contractual agreements across our data center platforms. With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms, but we want to be sure that we deliver a seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems' landscape. We're making solid headway and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters. Finally, we recognize that a Customer Portal is one of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our over 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over four years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue as well as functionality allowing customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system, Marketplace, will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base with new entrants seeking the benefit from this developing ecosystem. We hope many of you will be able to attend Marketplace Live in New York City on September 22 where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page eight. We signed new leases totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter and over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was eight months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signing and commencements was five months, in line with our customary activity. As shown on page nine, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on page nine that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog. Turning to renewal leasing activity on page 10, we signed a little over $50 million of lease renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was up 2% with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals, weighed down a bit by a modest cash rent roll-down on a relatively small sample size of PBB renewals during the first quarter. As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter which will likely result in a cash rent roll-down during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash re-leasing spreads in the second half of the year and for the full year we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. Turning to our financial results on page 11, we reported 1Q 2016 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several of the initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, $0.01 was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio and another $0.01 was due to Telx outperformance during the quarter; $0.02 were due to lower than expected overhead. And lastly, interest expense was $0.03 lighter than expected due primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the Eurobond in April. AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the (17:50) FFO line along with further reductions in straight line rental revenue. Recurring CapEx was also down significantly, although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year. As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we have been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well at the property level, and we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points, from 0% to 3% to 1% to 4%, or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant currency basis. Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the Eurobond, both came in tighter than expected and we have revised our financing assumptions to reflect the actual capital raised to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year. FX represented roughly 100 basis points to 150 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown here on page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently stronger compared to the 2015 average sterling exchange rate, and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural Eurobond offering in early April. We raised €600 million, further enhanced our international hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar denominated net asset exposure to less than 10%. Finally, I'd like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage. In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially. Same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%. I'd also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016, as if our leases with Telx were still in place, given that Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet gateways that comprised a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than two years, and upsize the term loan facilities by 550 $million, including $300 million of seven-year paper. As you can see from the chart on page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural €600 million bond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2.625% was the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within one-basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark eight-year mid-swaps rate and needless to say, we were pleased with the execution. We presented the pro forma impact of the Euro bond issuance here on page 14 of the presentation, and as you can see the eight-year term fit perfectly in the one open slot in our debt maturity ladder in 2024. Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. In addition, as you can see from the co-op box on the left hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years, two full years longer than the weighted average maturity as of the end of 1Q 2015. Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is proven financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well-positioned for new investment opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Our first question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question was regarding the hyper-scale cloud lease, I guess you announced one that sounds like it will commence sometime later next year in Osaka, but just curious overall, the trend has been for pretty significant leasing across the board amongst your peers. You guys had an above average quarter relative to the last couple of quarters, but this is not – we haven't really seen a spike in overall leasing volume from you guys. Yet you do have some availability and obviously a sizable global footprint. Can you talk about what you're seeing on a hyper-scale cloud requirement side if there is more to do there or what have you?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yes, hey, Jordan, it's Matt, and thanks for the question. In with regard to the quarter, of course, my team, my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around $40 million kind of as you mentioned, not to mention the welcome revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talk about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyper-scale cloud game. In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the one deal that was an anchor in Osaka, we have done more deals in Q1 with hyper-scale cloud providers as well. And we have been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully and during that time period as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various, not just one, but various hyper-scale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarterly leasing activity. So, for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top three cloud service providers, about an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top three, and then a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of social, mobile, analytic, cloud, and content accounts. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly wins here in the U.S. we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets. Not simply in Japan, in London as well which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center, read peers, may not have a dominant presence. And the final piece of my response would be that, my team, as you know, remains intensely committed to strong leasing fundamentals beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyper-scale demand.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, in terms of capital, I see leverage ticking up to 5.3 times debt to EBITDA and at the same time we've seen some of your smaller peers cap the equity market, given sort of the performance of the stocks and sort of the strong fundamentals seen in your sector. So, how are you guys thinking about equity here?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jordan, it's Andy. So the tick-up was 5.2 times to 5.3 times, but I think I got the gist of your question. So our funding strategy for the year remains the same, the base case is to fund our development with our retained capital proceeds from our asset sales and our debt raises, which are largely finished now. With that funding strategy, we see our leverage throughout each and every quarter of the year between that targeted 5 times to 5.5 times net debt to EBITDA, so right around target levels. In addition right now we have less than $100 million on the revolver. Now, if the facts change and if we see an opportunistic investment opportunity, we will certainly look to issue equity similar to we've done in the past.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Atkin at RBC.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. So I was interested in Japan and Germany and what you were doing staffing wise, whether it's sales operations or other as you have obviously done leasing in one market and are going to be developing in another?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. With regard to both Japan and Frankfurt, as you know, we have got an EMEA team as well as an Asia Pacific team and in Asia Pacific as we announced last quarter, we brought on a new Managing Director in Ted Higase to be able to help us make sure that we hit that market extremely well. His background in Japan will coincidently or maybe not so coincidentally help us out a great deal in making sure that the Asia Pacific sales team has a head start and being able to hit the demand in Japan. Similarly in Europe, Wendy Will is our Managing Director for the EMEA team and has the ability to help that team hit new markets including the new markets that we see in Germany. We've got a sufficient staff and leadership employees in EMEA from a sales and sales operations perspective to be able to hit that demand quickly and we have been monitoring the demand pipeline for Germany for quite some time and we've got a significant buildup pipeline that we are ready to clear.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then on the topic of Germany, I think there was a big German bank that was in your top 20 customer list that I don't see this time around, so I was wondering given that situation, the more broadly, if there's any, commentary on churn and customers that are coming in and out of that top 20 list?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Jon, this is Andy. So that change in the customer list, you saw a German bank disappear and you saw HP Enterprises gain some exposure on our top customer list. So essentially that institution transferred over to HP and is essentially outsourcing via that route.
Operator: The next question is from Colby Synesael at Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Great. Thank you. If I'm reading your disclosures properly, it looks like about $7 million of the leasing tied to TKF was tied to power enhancements. And I was hoping if you could talk about that a little bit, maybe what markets and if you had to do anything from an investment perspective to enable that and are those types of opportunities pretty prevalent in the business? And then I actually just had a fairly high level question maybe more of an educational one for everybody on the call. Can you remind us what's happening with the GICS code change later this year and what if any impact you could see that having on DLR as a stock? Thanks.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yes, thanks and great question. And there was a good deal of leasing in particular in one of our markets in the Central region, one of our great campuses in Chicago, where it was power – we'll call it power enhancements, but basically driving additional density into the floor space that's already taken by an individual customer. We think these are fantastic wins for us. From an economic perspective, they're fantastic for us, from a power perspective, they are very good for us, even from a relationship with utilities that we do business with, it increases the utilization of the power that's committed by those individual utilities and we do see density plays continue to play out throughout our portfolio where we can increase the stickiness of those individual customers in our facilities by bringing them additional power. It's also a great signal that our customers are doing well. In this case, this customer's doing extremely well and is taking power at a rate that we didn't anticipate, but it actually ended up helping a great deal.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Colby, on your second question, and by far no one in this room is an expert on that topic, but essentially, the REIT sub-segment on financial exchanges is coming someone out of the shadows of being grouped with other financial services companies, such as the big banks and will be a standalone component of the indexes. There has been a lot of research reports out and market chatter with the thesis being that there'll be additional focus, attention and we hope capital inflows into REITs in general and especially in the Digital Realty stock.
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Chao at Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hey, guys, just one follow-up on just – maybe a pricing question here. If you take out the $7 million of power expansion, it still seems like the base rents are going up a little bit here per square foot. Just curious if there's anything to read into that of if it's just quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, or it does seem like last few quarters we've seen a steady increase here?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Vin, it's Andy. I think you're just seeing some of the power usage may be inflating it a little bit. I don't think we've seen any rent spikes in any particular market. We think our rents are still running healthy and support our development yields of the 10.5% to 12.5%. We see rents on a comparable basis kind of staying flat to having very modest increases right now.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just another question on the pipeline, the development pipeline, I think it's ended total active development pipeline just under $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. Where do you think that'll stabilize out? I mean, will this grow to $1.5 billion at some point or is there some limit on how much you'd grow that to? And then just on the yields that you're showing on that page, they seem like they're down from last quarter. I was just curious to get some commentary on that.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So, Vin, the guidance yields are roughly 10.5% to 12.5%. It's really just a function of when you bring on new projects, how leased they are and if the initial yields are a little lower, it depends on the market. But all in all, we see the yields kind of still with our bogey. In terms of the total size of pipeline, we haven't seen anything right now that's going to have a massive shift or increase in our pipeline. We still have that consistent amount of annual spend. The one point I would clarify though is, while we have $540 million of remaining spend for these projects, some of this is pre-leased, over half of it actually, and some of it is speculative. We're actually only contractually committed to finish roughly $380 million of that, so if the music did stop and there was oversupply delivered to any market, that would represent like 0.3 turns of debt to EBITDA, so our balance sheet leverage would still be in check. And as I mentioned before, we have $1.9 billion of availability on our revolver, so no crisis would ensue.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Petersen at Jefferies.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Oh, great, thank you. So, I just wanted to follow up on the hyper-scale lease that you guys signed. And I'm just curious what these conversations are like with these cloud guys. Obviously, you and your peers have been signing a lot of leases. So, I'm just curious when you sit down in meetings with them, is there so much demand that they're just scrambling to try to get as much space as they can or are these more strategic expansions, just trying to get into new markets and the business will grow into it? Just trying to get a sense of whether it is just one big wave, or whether this is just to meet the current demand out there and that's going to continue?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yes, I think it is a little bit of a combination of both of those. And it depends on which one of the hyper-scale providers we're talking to and how far along they're in their planned execution and then what type of visibility they have into their own demand. And that really is a little bit different obviously from cloud service provider to cloud service provider. A number of them have had advance plans and it meets with their advanced planning. A number of them have seen a radical shift in terms of the demand coming to them and so in their hot markets which happen to line up with some of our hot markets, they want to occupy as much space and power as they can because they know that they will burn through it and utilize it. So, it really does depend. I would say about half and half amongst the cloud providers in terms of the current large amounts of deployments that they're going through to hit their current set of demands, but also to make sure that they understand they can cover demand that they historically might have missed because they didn't have inventory in market.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: And I guess as my follow-up in terms of the decision they're making to lease space rather than build it themselves, obviously some of these guys like Amazon and Microsoft have the scale to do it themselves and they do. Is the reason that they're doing more leasing just because they need the space and you guys already have entitled space, so it's just easier or is there a strategic reason that they would want to be in a third-party leased facility?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yes, there's a few of them and you can see that a number of these folks have actually done some of the builds themselves in the past. I would say part of that past activity was because of slow changes to the multitenant data center environment to adjust to their needs. I think over the past six months they have been satisfied that multitenant data center providers like us have the ability to hit their needs and their capital is better spent focusing on the strategic imperatives that they have in front of them. So while they may have hit a gap with their own builds, they all have sort of come to the realization that leasing is something that they need to not just explore but execute on. Jarrett...?
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Yes, and just to build on the architecture trends, we talked about multi-cloud and hybrid cloud. It's really important for these cloud service providers to have colocation and interconnection on the campus as well. So I think this is a trend that you're seeing, a value proposition that we can, that they LAN their compute engine and support the cloud, but then enterprises and partners can deliver private clouding connectivity right next door and that's a great value proposition.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Choe at JPMorgan.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Following up on that question, now that you've signed (40:08) in Japan, how should we think about the lease up rate going forward? And I guess along with that, in Germany, do you need an anchor tenant or is demand strong enough where you can kind of move ahead and the sales force is there and everything is kind of set there, demand wise to move ahead with that one?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. Hi, this is Scott. Good questions on that. Japan, that represents phase one and that's 100% preleased with that anchor tenant. So, future development there would be subject to additional market demand. Germany, we want to develop in conjunction with market demand, although there's a pretty strong demonstrated pipeline of demand in that market. So, I think we would feel a little more comfortable pushing forward a little more aggressively there.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And I guess as a follow-up, there wasn't much leasing activity in Europe. Is that mainly due to a lack of inventory in that region?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. So, as you know, there's a different set of demand drivers inside that European market and you sort of nailed it on the head. In the places where we see the most amount of demand, we found ourselves out of enough inventory to satisfy that demand. So, in particular, in Amsterdam and in London, where we are currently swinging shovels or swinging hammers or a combination of both – I don't know if you're supposed to swing a shovel – but it depends on what you're doing I guess. But we are satisfying that problem in London and Amsterdam; the same thing in Frankfurt, where we did have demonstrated demand, but obviously we didn't have a presence there as well.
Operator: The next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to revisit the leasing results again, and I guess just trying to figure out, if you view the current run rate of about 70 to 80 megawatts annually is translating to an acceptable level of organic growth in the scale business? Or if maybe there's an elevated tightening of your underwriting standards that we should think about?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: So, in terms of the leasing results, what we do every year and as part of the process of making sure that we understand what our commitments are for the year, we have a very specific leasing plan that we publish and work to and we're pretty satisfied with the leasing plan that we have in front of us right now. And we're pretty satisfied that we can hit the goals that we've set out, both internally and the goals that we've set externally.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: And Matt, this is Andy speaking. So, the underwriting and returns piece of the equation really – mostly applies to bringing on new supply, where we have to build either buy land or build from the ground up. We've got a giant portfolio with pockets of vacancy throughout different markets, where it's not – whether the deal mix are underwriting hurdle, it's about marketing, finding demand and landing in locations. So, that settle the – underwriting is not always the governor for whether a lease lands or not.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, can you just give us some color on the 100 basis point increase in guidance for same-capital NOI? Is that being partially driven by the G&A improvement and kind of how does that reconcile against the lower pre-stabilized yield, is that factored in at all?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So, those are probably separate parts of our P&L, so same-store capital for NOI is not really pick up new development contributions. Reasons for same-store or our view of increased optimism on same-store drove the results in the first quarter and what we've seen going into the second quarter. I think that's both on the top line and the bottom line. You mentioned the bottom line is really – on a NOI basis, it's better operations at the property level. So, I think if you look through our P&L, especially in the same-store side of it, most of our expenses were flat or potentially down in some categories. So, we're running the properties more efficiently. And then on the top line, we did have some mark-to-market outcomes that were a little bit better than we planned, which is driving some of the increase in the same-store cash NOI growth.
Operator: The next question is from Manny Korchman at Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks, guys. If we switch back to the Japan lease for a second, if we just think about the timing there, where they're not going to be occupying until essentially I guess early 2018 at this point touching by your development schedule, how did they think about the capacity that they need? And can we balance that against your comments about not building spec there. Do you think that you could sort of amplify the amount of leasing you could do, if you had the spec – product that are given unlikely inventory?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. So, hey, Manny, in terms of, just to clarify, actually I think the Japan lease will commence in late 2017. But, it's a good question, in terms of, is the demand that we're seeing not just with that particular and I assume your question applies to more than just the Japan deal and applies across the board with these types of deals that we're seeing. And how do the customers think about what their takes will be? And how do we respond to those? We've got a really good process actually in place to understand the production capabilities that we have and how those production capabilities match up to what our customers really need, I'll talk about what our customers need. Then I'll turn it over to Jarrett to talk about the production capabilities that we have. In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets, in each of these buildings, in each of these facilities. That usually comes in the shape of at least one, what we used to call pod, but one scale oriented pod, sometimes two-scale oriented pods that they need in short order. One is generally the size that they need upfront, and then they need to have visibility, so that they're not going to outgrow their needs, and they're not going to outgrow the co-lo needs that they know their customers are going to need in the hybrid cloud environment. And I'll have Jarrett answer the rest of the question.
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. And I think, Manny, to build on what we just said, I think we talked about at Investor Day, the new agile product that we're rolling out globally. Once we really design two options, the power dense option that you're starting to see and the base option, which is the agility for the client. As well as once we have the shell up, we then can deliver pods, as Matt was talking about, every three months to four months. So, it gives us a lot more agility as we see demand in that market. And so, I think when you pair that, you can sell into a market and meet different customer needs on that timeline.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Maybe a question for Andy. So, Andy, if I look at slide 11 of the deck, I guess that's a walkover from consensus to actual. Maybe two questions related to that, if you were to make that left-most column not consensus, but where your expectations were, would the steps sort of be the same, so did you outperform your own expectations as well? And then secondly, how much of this was the timing shift and how much of it is going to impact the rest of the year as sort of more one-time in 1Q?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Sure, Manny, this is Andy. I think that's your third question, but we're going to give you a pass today, because I like you so much. So, the $1.35 was roughly around our internal projections, so we're right in line, so everyone trying to – kind of these step functions kind of mirror what our internal results look like. I would say most of these are flow through to the rest of the year, so Digital Realty NOI, Telx EBITDA. G&A, there may be some timing elements to it. Part of that's non-comp related travel consulting, fees like that. So, if people exceed budgets in subsequent quarters, they're essentially using a budget, they didn't use in the first quarter. And then the lower interest expense, I mean that's a product of two things, the timing of when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises. The one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far right bar, and times it by four to get our full-year number. We do have some items that will reduce that full-year number and offset – are increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of datacenters that we have under contract and to sell, hopefully, in next month or so. That'll obviously be dilutive out of the gate when you sell $120 million-ish of assets that are income producing. And then the second item is, we basically had the revolver balance at $600 million or $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million Eurobond. Subsequent to quarter end – and that was a fixed-rate eight-year piece of paper, which is obviously good for the balance sheet, locks in long-dated FX hedged debt, but is not as low as floating rate revolver debt.
Operator: The next question is from (sic) Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Just call me Jeff. Listen, thank you for taking the questions. So, I guess, I asked almost the same question last quarter, but I'm still very interested, and really understand about the progress to keep getting another quarter under the belt of having both Telx and also sort of large campus datacenters and the interplay there, particularly in driving the cloud enterprise ecosystem. So, I'd love to get a little perspective on how that's coming along. And I guess as a sort of sub-question there, Jarrett gave some good color I think in an earlier response about why the hyper-scale guys are interested in your assets, given the ability to drive that connectivity there as well. But, I'd be interested I guess sort of on the opposite side as to hear about the enterprises coming into connect with the scale cloud guys. And you did call out the $7.5 million of incremental interconnection fee that you were able to book off of Telx this quarter. And it would be good to get some perspectives, I don't know what it was in the fourth quarter or what it might have looked like a year ago, but is this a number that was in acceleration, in line et cetera. Thank you.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, (sic) Jonathan, this is Andy. I'll take the first part, and then I'll open it up to the team to answer. The Telx update integration, what you call it, we're making very good progress, as you can see from the numbers in the Investor Presentation. We're on track and it has to exceed our expectations from our initial underwriting. As previously mentioned on prior call about our investor committee improving Telx expansion under our Ashburn campus, we've now started the pre-sale activity and we should have the doors open there, come September I think you can expect some additional new market expansion done full – throughout the remainder of the year. On the West Coast, well, we've been fortunate enough to sign a subsea cable, which we think will enhance our Telx – the attractiveness of our Telx footprint and our entire footprint in that market. We're also looking – we're expanding our footprint in Atlanta, where we've been very successful at 56 Marietta. So far so good, as it relates to Telx. Just not to jump around, but from our interconnection revenue line item, we're tracking year-over-year on just that revenue component, north of 10%, I think it was close to 11%; and then quarter-over-quarter, I think it's well about 2%ish, just for interconnection revenue. And then, I'll turn it over to the team to answer your middle question.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Hey, (sic) Jonathan, Amy, whatever your name is today, really quick on the first part of your question, hopefully to give you a little color on what Andy said and some pretty concrete examples of where we see the combination really coming together quite impressively. We've been to a number of events where we bring both teams together to address customers. I would say it started very actively with PTC, we've got ITW coming up and we've been at a number of events in between. And what's interesting is the reaction from our customers has been absolutely fantastic. So, not only have they thanked us for coming together, for giving them in essence, one throat to choke for all of their scale, co-lo, cross connect and other services' needs. But we've seen a number of them actually start to change their own individual organization structure to come to us in the same way that we are now coming to them all in one. So, we've seen – I've now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider make a decision to consolidate their network folks with their datacenter folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So, I don't know – I'm not claiming credit, if that's because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, that Telx and large campus together. Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turned it over to me for, which is why hyper-scale is coming into Digital Realty, in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually. One is, first of all, we get hyper-scale, we've been doing hyper-scale before someone truly turned it hyper-scale, we've been doing large deployments and we've figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So, these folks are comfortable, that we know what we're doing and that we've got the size and scale, no pun intended to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute-node needs. But they also know that their customers' needs more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through one datacenter, five datacenters throughout the world. They also need to have co-location availability, so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put in the public cloud, cannot – maybe put into a private cloud, we have to put into their enterprise class datacenter and then they need connectivity to bring them all together. We just came from our client advisory board and several of them came to us and said, we love the idea that we can now get this at one organization. They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IT transactions that they have in front of them and we are able to act as that vehicle would takes that complexity away. I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platform-as-a-service offerings. And they are very interested in being involved with the company that has now 1,600 customers, many of them IT service providers, many of them providing the service component, they are putting together into the applications of delivering into the future and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can.
Operator: The next question is from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I'm looking at your top tenants roster and I compared it to where you were in the fourth quarter and you obviously did quite a bit of leasing with your top 20 tenants between the level threes and the AT&T's and Verizon's, et cetera. I guess I'm curious what percentage of your leasing is existing customers versus new ones at this point?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: I can tell you the stat from the first quarter – and the first quarter results from existing are upwards of 93% coming from our existing client base.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. The second question comes on the development pipeline side; it comes from page 34 of your supplemental. Again, the development yield, I guess, on the current pipeline is 10.3%; last quarter, it was 11.2%. And I recognize I think part of that decline, I'm guessing, is you've got Osaka in there for the first time. I assume that's a lower yield, just given interest rates in Japan, you're willing to develop that at a lower yield, I'd be looking for you to A, confirm that? But B, when I look at the development yields in the U.S. and Europe those also came down a little bit. So I'm just curious, if there's some commentary on the development yields? And then the last part of the development question, the cost went up $10 million in Singapore, and you delayed it a quarter, if you just comment on that one?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Ross, this is Andy. So, you're right, I think the main driver's Osaka bringing down the yield. The other element, I would say is, if you bridge between the last quarter and this quarter, and I think we highlighted in one of our slides, we did deliver, I believe, 13.2 megawatts across Dallas, Chicago, Northern Virginia that was pretty well leased at an attractive yield. And we rolled on some – really the last phases of our Northern Virginia project before we have to move to our next land – and some other new phases in Chicago and Dallas, which obviously are less well leased. And we include our underwriting estimate in this table until leasing actually comes in. And we typically outperform our underwriting, when we hit the leasing, you'll potentially see these yields go up. And then the other question was, Singapore timing...
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: And cost.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: ...and cost. Maybe FX rates would be a driver there; I think we're either at budget or under budget there. I know we have the ribbon-cutting ceremony in May or June.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, the ribbon-cutting's the first week of June for Singapore. We did stage it – first, we have some marketing efforts over there – but it is the second quarter and it's still scheduled for June.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Ross, my guess is FX related on the cost side, but we'll follow-up just to check.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I was just hoping to follow up on the Telx run rate on the EBITDA. I guess I'm looking at the number from the deck and on a run rate basis it seems like you guys are running a bit ahead, maybe 5% ahead, of the $148 million. Can you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes or how we should be thinking about how EBITDA flows from Telx during the year?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Jordan. So, as a reminder, that top row was our initial underwriting when we announced the transaction back in the middle of July, the key and repeated number, $148 million plus of cash EBITDA. We are, I would say, ahead of plan for just the first quarter. Some of that beat was on the expense side that may have been a little seasonal and timing related, the timing for the annual SKO, or sales kick-off and marketing and sales initiatives around that event, actually moved. Last year it was in the first quarter; we actually pulled it forward and did in December this past year. So, again, that's probably not a number you can necessarily just annualize to get the run rate. We are ramping additional resources on the sales and marketing front there, but all-in-all we're making good progress on the revenue and the EBITDA line item and feel like we're on track to meet or exceed our underwriting estimates.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then separately, just in the partners and alliances program, can you maybe just give us a sense, how do you get – how are you confident in that program and the potential of that program or what gives you confidence, should I say – as opposed to the other route of sort of bolstering or building out the sales platform like some of your competitors have?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. Thanks, Jordan. First of all, Bill and Andy won't let me build out the sales force to address that potential demand and I am happily compliant with not building it out. And just to be clear, right, it was – it clearly is a differentiator between us and other folks in this industry. So, it was not that we didn't have some trepidation in making the decision to address a large segment of the potential revenue in what amounts to an entirely different way for us as a company. So, that was not without personal risk on my side, but also just a little bit of risk on our side, but it's a great question. How do we feel confident that it's going – two main components make me feel confident – and the first, it always starts with our customers. I think during the last earnings call we had just come from a meeting with one of our top five customers, and the reception from us having a conversation with those C-level folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass leads back and forth and being true partners, gives me a great deal of confidence. And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, especially in my particular world. And so, the guys this year said, in the first quarter have already generated $40.1 million in pipeline inside G&A to date. Now, obviously we do not close all of that pipeline and we're starting small and learning, make sure we get it right and we are growing the program as we move it forward; added another program to the reseller partnership program this particular quarter. We'll continue doing that with some of our key partners moving forward. But nothing gives me peace of mind like having $40 million in pipe in a brand new program.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. So just on Telx, when you made the announcement, you talked about some of the underutilized capacity out on the West Coast and it looks like you made some progress in Seattle if I'm reading the portfolio detail correctly, but less so in Santa Clara, and maybe just more generally, can you comment on where you're seeing success more versus less in the acquired assets. And then, the other question I wanted to ask was just on recurring CapEx, and I think Andy mentioned it's going to pick up in the latter part of the year. What's driving that? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jonathan, it's Andy. So, we're seeing, I would say, increases in our occupancy utilization pretty much across the board. I'd say from a utilization standpoint, we're kind on track with our plan moving into the 70%s now. And I didn't mention we had some wins that signed that I mentioned for the undersea cable actually hasn't flowed through the utilization just yet ,and actually will probably be something that's more attractive to draw (65:29) customers to that location. I know we see a lot of demand pointed at our Telx location in Santa Clara. And we continue to see tremendous success, be it at Cermak or 56 Marietta in Atlanta, or the New York City Trifecta. So I can't tell you one asset is pulling far, far ahead in terms of percent change from another, so it's been kind of fairly broad-based. And then your second question was about CapEx, I think it's really just timing related, as you can see, from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last three line items before our AFFO, they sum less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commission and compensation for the quarter. But if you multiply that by four that's like a – just a $100-ish million of recurring CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance table North of $145 million for the full year. So, I think it's just a function of timing and didn't want anyone to think that that lower number could be truly run rated throughout the rest of the year.
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: And hey, Jonathan, to give you a little more color on the West Coast activity. We've really integrated the efforts of the West Coast team that we have had historically at Digital with the West Coast team, especially on the business solutions side with the Telx Group and a number of the properties that we've looking at, end up having enough contiguous space to be attractive to the digital traditional sales methodology. Now the challenge with that is the Telx sales methodology has a tighter turn, a quicker return, and a faster rate of adoption. The larger deals that we see going up against the Santa Clara facility, as well as the Seattle facility, as well as the Portland facility that we have simply larger deals take a little bit longer for us to close. But the cooperation is working exactly as planned.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for closing remarks.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Amy. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our first quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 15. First, we made significant progress towards extending our global footprint to our top two target markets with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt and the signing of an anchor lease on our first project in Japan. We also made headway towards a strategic objective of achieving operating efficiencies to drive accelerating growth in cash flow per share. And we delivered first quarter results well ahead of our own forecast and $0.07 ahead of consensus. We raised guidance by $0.075 at the midpoint on the strength of the beat in the first quarter. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the success of refinancing of our global credit facilities in January and the completion of our inaugural Eurobond offering in early April. In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you that at May REIT in June.
Operator: This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John J. Stewart - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future financial and other results, including 2016 guidance and the underlying assumptions.

Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin on page two of our presentation, by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity, we expect to provide to shareholders. In terms of our capital allocation decisions, that means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of pre-leasing and building only into markets, where we have high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital, and we decline deals that do not provide us sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom-line on a per share basis. In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders, it means delivering consistent, uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow, and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate. Let's turn now to our platform on page three. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions, such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to serve as enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. In early December, we announced the colocation resale alliance with AT&T, as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM Software. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum. And that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total. Through threes strategic initiatives, we have on-boarded some new target customers, such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business, while simultaneously leveraging a broader collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015, as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model. Turning now to capital recycling on page four. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property had previously been held for redevelopment, but market conditions were unlikely to justify construction anytime soon and we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on. Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot, at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset. We are now also under contract on the National four-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies, and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets and this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties where one off assets that no longer fit our connected campus strategy. We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land parcel in Ashburn, less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudoun County. It will support the development of approximately two million square feet and the build-out of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. We also established a foothold in Germany, a long-time target market with the acquisition of a six-acre parcel in Frankfurt during fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a three building campus, totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year, subject to market demand. Moving on to market fundamentals on page five. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content along with financial and IT services. We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyperscale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business. Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets. But suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts. Over the past two years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition. And now, let's turn to the macro environment on page six. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation, or even the price of oil, although the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP. It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on page seven. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004. And the great financial crisis was no exception. Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements, along with a prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance. In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing writ large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end-users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well capitalized tech companies and the cloud platforms are among their fastest growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx, here on page nine. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel and we are well on our way to integrating the two platforms. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year period. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016 and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets. Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators, and content suppliers. The total number of cross-connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000 and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunities for cross-fertilization. We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx would be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main, along with turning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways. I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month, and the build-out and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 111 8th Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build-out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn campus. We expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to plant the Telx flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including a recent signing by a top SMACC customer in a new location within the portfolio for that customer. In summary, while the integration mission is not yet full accomplished, we are pleased with the progress and performance to-date. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago. The weighted average lag between signings to commencements were 4.5 months; and as shown on page 11, the backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first-half of this year. Turning to page 12. The average cash re-leasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash flow down on a much smaller sample size of Turn-Key renewals. For the full-year of 2016, we expect re-leasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high-single-digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix and from time-to-time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we have reached an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. Turning to our financial results on page 13, we reported 4Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.38 above the high-end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including a few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and $0.01 or so for early achievement on our expense synergy plan; roughly a $0.01 for lower is specific operating expenses; and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little later than we had expected. FX represented roughly 150 basis points to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top line to the bottom line. As shown on page 14, and we expect this to persist and perhaps some drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So, only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. We are well hedged, with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million Euro bond, which would further enhance our natural balance sheet hedged and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%. Furthermore, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposed us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world, which represents a key competitive advantage. We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates, and commodities here on page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, shown here on page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer term trend, however, also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we have instilled over the past two years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape. Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net non-cash rent adjustments, including straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent non-cash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these two line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016. This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015, but does not get you all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes our long-term leases with third-party landlords. In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a non- cash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016, but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reason, why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO. And also, they are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 60 bps sequentially, primarily due to a PBB move-out in Phoenix. Same-capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same-capital cash NOI growth in 2016, which is net of the foreign currency headwinds. The 2016 forecast comes with the major caveat, however, Telx greatly complicates the composition of our same-store pool, since they were previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio. So, carving them out of the same-store pool would result in a much smaller sample size. At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same-capital results for 2016, as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same-capital results should be taken with a grain of salt. Telx had a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously reflected space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now, however, this space is shown on a look-through basis, reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. The look-through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx's lower utilization and a better lease-up potential with that space. Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than two years, and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tender within the bank loan market with a $300 million seven-year term loan. The facilities were well oversubscribed and we'd like to thank our entire bank group for their support. I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million a five-year and seven-year term loans, which was put to bed with this refinancing. As shown on page 17, the refinancing clearly – effectively clears up the left-hand side of the maturity schedule, we have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020, with well-laddered debt maturities thereafter. In addition, fully rate debt now represents less than 15% of total debt outstanding, and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity. We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends, and we expect to realize up to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales. Consequently, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2 times as of year-end and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5 times target throughout 2016, with a balance sheet positioned for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is regarding leasing and the overall environment. Maybe Bill or Matt, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of the hyperscale cloud players and some of these larger requirements that Bill, you described in your commentary as lumpy and hard to predict. We see some of your competitors landing some very large transactions during the fourth quarter and post-quarter end and just curious what you're seeing in terms of that? Is it harder to compete? Do you expect to see more of it? That would be great.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Thanks, Jordan. This is Matt. Yeah, I think Bill nailed it in his opening remarks and good focus on the hyperscale activity, because those requirements really sort of form the foundation of what the demand was in Q4 and is and will be as we move forward in 2016. We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating, but we do have to keep an eye on the hyperscale requirements and the lumpy nature of those requirements. We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15-year term in Q4, and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then perhaps as a follow-up, you mentioned the total number of cross-connects in the portfolio. Did you mention or could you tell us how many were added in the quarter and maybe anything that might be embedded in guidance as it relates to interconnection?
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Hey, Jordan. It's Jarrett. We are tracking our cross-connect growth consistent with the colocation pull-through. As Matt indicated, that incremental interconnection business, the connectivity, we gave you some guidance on what that incremental $8 million was that contributed to the sales. And we're continuing to evaluate and roll out more details on the interconnection business. But, as Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we're very excited because it's very complementary, it's a great add-on and it's fundamental to the connected campus to drive those connectivity solutions.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys. So, your 2016 revenue target for Telx, I guess, implies about 7.5% growth off of the 4Q run rate, but if I take the 4Q bookings you reported from Telx of about $13 million for interconnect and base rent, I guess that implies, alone, about a 4% increase off of that run rate, so it just seems pretty conservative there. I'm just kind of wondering what sort of incremental leasing assumptions you have embedded in there or should we just take that as – the $385 million-plus as sort of the low-end of the guide and you probably expect to come in above that?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Matt. This is Andy. So, I mean that the signings number, obviously, as you know, don't all come in the first day and kind of roll into the next period. So, it's not a direct correlation. I think we feel good on the guidance or the numbers that we laid out for Telx from a revenue and an EBITDA perspective, and it's going to be a combination of leasing up some of the unutilized space and selling incremental cross-connects and getting flow through on the revenue contribution.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I mean, how quickly do – I'm assuming that interconnect bookings probably commence quite a bit faster than your typical four month or five-month lag on normal scale bookings. Can you just comment on book-to-bill?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So, colo, space and power could be a month to two months for deployment; interconnection would be overnight.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkin, your line is open for questions. Okay. We'll move on to the next question of Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Great job with the last name there. So, I have two questions. The first is with a bunch of your current customers, CenturyLink, AT&T, Rackspace, all being in, what we'll call interesting positions, CenturyLink and AT&T looking to potentially sell some of the facilities to which you are the underlying landlord, and then Rackspace, depending on one's opinion, is doing okay as a company. Obviously, going through change in their own business model; has a lot of space that's being not utilized. How comfortable are you right now with the exposure you have to these customers right now? And is there anything that you're doing to prevent or anything you can do to prevent any risk with these customers as you go forward? Then my second question, the $43 million of new leases including the interconnects, based on your guidance that you have now for 2016, are you expecting that number to remain relatively stable through the course of the year or would you expect that – or is that assumed – or do you assume that in your guidance that that ramps even further as we go into 2016? Thanks.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll take the second one first. I mean, I think we thought that the signings from a scale and a colo and interconnection point of view was pretty good performance, and we see that run rate kind of continuing throughout the year, maybe a little bit of increase, as it relates to the colo and the interconnection piece. And then going back to your first question and I'll let others on the team jump in. I mean, holistically, the best way is obviously to mitigate this are through diversification of your customers, your locations, your leases, maturities. We're always in constant dialog with our customers, making sure we understand their business and where it's going and trying to help them with their space needs. I don't think there is anything on the horizon right now, either with a Rackspace, AT&T or a CenturyLink, where they're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints. I think some of the noise you're seeing in the market or on the news rags is more about folks, who some of them, excluding probably Rackspace, focusing on their core businesses and selling non-core businesses.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. Hey, Colby. It's Matt. And just to pile on a little bit to that answer. It's really quite the opposite, in fact, in some of the names that you mentioned, we saw upticks not just in last year's leasing, but also in the pipeline moving forward to 2016. Important to remember that these customers, especially the customers that you mentioned that are on our top 20 list, these folks are flexing into new opportunities, moving from a capital-heavy to a capital-light perspective, and flexing towards focusing on their core objectives. And the great part for us is that, we've got long-term leases in place with these particular customers, but we also have incredible relationships, and we've developed strong partnerships over all of 2014 and 2015, so that we know exactly what direction they're moving in and how they can use our facilities to benefit from that.
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: And Colby, one final point from a legal standpoint, many of these leases require our consent in order to be signed.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Hey, everyone. Just want to go back to some of the sources and uses. I just want to make sure I got this straight. So, on the $1.5 billion of debt, at the midpoint, I think that, Andy, you said that included the $550 million on the term loan, the upsize, but just curious, you also mentioned $500 million Euro bond potential. But given the disruption that we're seeing in the markets today, is that something that could be done today or do we have to see things calm down before that could actually even get off the ground? I mean, I know it's a mid-2016 guide, but just curious what the conditions are today?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Vin. You were correct in your first statement, so, of the $1.5 billion, $550 million was done in the first week or second week of the year, when we closed our bank facility, and that was incremental five-year and seven-year term loan. The next leg of it, or just under $1 billion, could be a potential $500 million Euro bond. This would be – we've been to the Sterling bond market now twice and obviously, been to the U.S. dollar bond market many, many times. This will be our first entry to the Euro bond market, it really aligns well with our investments on the continent over there. We've done some pre-work in terms of meeting with different folks over there and fixed-income investors. It's really opportunistic, so as you can see from our debt maturity schedule, it's really would be capital that would term out a portion of our revolver balance, that's pretty far out there in general. So, we're kind of playing it day by day and we want to make sure there is a stable and receptive market to go to, so you'll probably see us re-engage and looking at that even harder in the coming months.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then my second question, sticking with sources on the disposition side. It sounds like the four-data center asset portfolio, you expect to be, I guess well – I thought I heard in the first half, but end of first half of this year, but we have seen a fair amount of disruption in some of the CMBS markets and that kind of thing. Not that, that's a big factor for data centers, but just curious if that's having an impact on sales expectations? I know there's no financing contingencies, but just in terms of buyer pools and that kind of thing?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: So, we're quite fortunate that Scott and his team got going on this and worked diligently, really ahead of the game here. So, as you notice, we sold one property before the end of the year; we sold another one just beginning of the year. And in this portfolio, that you mentioned, is under contract without a financing contingency. So, I think, we got ahead of some of the supply coming to the market, in terms of data center assets. And I think we've got a good buyer for these assets and realistically, I think that, that would be roughly 75% of our – the $200 million or so in our guidance. So, we're pretty much through with the bulk of our DSBOs.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Just thinking about the commencements, I thought last call, you guys had talked about the commencement timing sort of turning back to more normal, I don't know what we'll call it, six-months sort of timeframe were actually lower now at 4.5 months. Is that just depending on the pool or the mix of the leases or is that where we should expect things to sort of remain going forward?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Manny, you're saying the time from signing to commencement?
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I just want to make sure, we heard you correct.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Matt, do you want comment?
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. So, hey, Manny it's Matt. I would still expect that the normalization will come out at that six month level. Remember the impact that Telx hit inside the quarter and that certainly had an impact on the 4.5 months
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sorry, just so I understand that wouldn't the impact get greater as sort of you do more with Telx, so why would that – why would Telx be sort of a factor now and not in the future?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: So, Telx, Manny, has a shorter time to commencement, that goes back to, maybe I think it was Matt's question, as he asked about. I said one month to two months from when they signed to take the space.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And keep in mind, Manny, that when you say, the question about whether Telx will normalize to 4.5 months across the entire year in 2016. There is also these hyperscale environments that may extend that period a little bit. So, we do still feel that six months is the accurate timeframe.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. And then, just if we think about the returns you get on one of those large cloud deal versus sort of your overall return targets or guidance, where would those two lie? Is it 200 basis point gap? Is it 400 basis points? Just, if you could help us think about that?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: On the large, hyperscale cloud deals that we've signed to-date, including the one, in the last quarter. They were, well, within our 10% to 12% range. Now, they're obviously closer to the lower end of that range, but they still kind of met our overall hurdles.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on New Jersey. You did say that, I think, most markets are tightening. You were blowing out of – or you've gotten out of one of your assets here in New Jersey. Just can you maybe talk about conditions there and sort of your appetite looking forward? And then as a follow-up, just maybe discussion a little bit about markets that are seeing a little bit too much supply right now or not much demand?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Jordan, thanks for jumping back into the queue. We like the position that we have in New Jersey. There is an interesting transition happening that continues to have the growth that we have in the financial services, which – what we established ourselves in the New Jersey. But with the addition of Telx, in particular, our focus on content and cloud in that particular market is starting to add to the pipeline in a way that we hadn't seen before. So, I'm hoping that the pipeline is developing right now, will allow us to get to that good balance between supply and demand in New Jersey.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just markets where you're not seeing the strengths right now that you're a little bit more concerning?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, to go through strength of the markets. And as you know, Jordan, I look at that from a forward-looking pipeline perspective. We continue to see strength in Northern Virginia, incredible strength in Chicago, especially over the past few quarters. And in Dallas, continued support in Singapore, especially with Sing 11 (42:40), the new property coming online and maybe partially due to China demand moving over from the Mainland into the rest of Asia-Pacific. And then some continued strength coming out of London in the social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content markets. We do have a significant amount of those market ready, but more importantly, shell available inside New Jersey; and as I said, I'm looking that as an opportunity for us. And then we've identified a number of strategic assets where we've had opportunities to lease in the past and we've increased our marketing focus on those markets, so I'm hoping that our increased marketing focus will have a very positive effect, not just in those particularly strategic assets, but in our cash position as well.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jordan, just to add one thing. Going back to, I think your first question, I don't think we hit the nail on the head for what you were looking for. The cross-connects at Telx were over 55,000 just by itself, so Digital contributes about 5,000 to get over 60,000 combined. And on a year-over-year basis, that was about 7% growth in cross-connects on Telx standalone.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jordan, adding to the list of weak markets or weaker markets, you could probably put Houston on that list. And I think Phoenix is on the bubble.
Operator: Our next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. In terms of the interconnection revenue growth, should we see that ramping through the year? And is it going to be something that's more back-end loaded or the revenue is coming in right away? That's the first question.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: So, I just quoted you growth on actual cross-connects about 7%, I believe, the year-over-year rate growth is kind of closer to 8%, so it's combined pretty strong growth. I'm not sure, it's going ramp above that combined rate growth volume kind of in the mid to the high-teens, so I'm not sure that I can – I have a good read on the quarterly guidance, but we do see strong growth in terms of volume growth in the 7% range and rate growth are in the 8% range.
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: And just to add on that, couple of things. We're now in a position to leverage the Telx product capability, on the Digital side, to monetize that at a higher level than we've done in the past. And we're now mining the data to who's connected to whom really to leverage the interconnection business and start scaling that and that will take a little bit of time, but it's definitely the SMACC focus that we're taking and the networking and the cloud providers are definitely interconnection-rich, as you see in the industry.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And just adding to that, Richard, I'd like to answer your question, so we're all going to jump in. In terms of timing, in particular, the revenue optimization procedure that Jarrett just described, we're expecting that to start to take effect at the end of 2016 into 2017.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, there's a decent amount of runway for growth on the interconnection side? It seems like it's just starting.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for circling back to me. I just had a couple of follow-ups. The first is coming back to Telx. I was wondering if you could share the churn assumptions embedded in your 2016 revenue target, or at least just remind me what the historical range has been there? And then secondly, regarding the AT&T agreement with IBM to manage its cloud and hosting services, I'm curious if that has any bearing on your relationship with either customer and if that partnership includes the management of AT&T's NetBond offering?
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Sure. We're not giving guidance on the churn, but I'd say we're pretty much assuming in our projections that it was in line with historical averages. I don't want to give you all percentage, (47:11) but I thought it was like 0.6%, so relatively low. And then on your second question, I don't know if Matt, you would...
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. I'll be happy to answer that, Matthew. So, in the two agreements that you mentioned, the AT&T agreement, the IBM agreement. The AT&T agreement contains two main components and one of them is fairly far along; that's the reseller portion of that agreement. That has been significant and we've actually done joint trainings with our sales forces at our sales kickoffs and through – on multiple continents. And so, the progress being made on the AT&T side is fantastic. And the progress on the IBM side is incredibly promising. We have a unique situation with IBM where we happen to have the core compute nodes located on our campuses. We happen to have colocation space and colocation experts in Telx right next to those core compute nodes. And we have the magic of Telx's interconnection as well as a number of products that are in the funnel to bring to market in the future to provide our customers with the ability to securely and privately connect at lower than 1.5 milliseconds, which is incredibly important for them, and we think that we are one if not the only folks who can provide that environment for our customers. One small thing to clear up, NetBond is the second part of the AT&T agreement that we have; we don't manage NetBond as part of that process, but we do have a partnership with them, so that they can land NetBond assets on our connected campuses.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. So, I was wondering of the non-SMACC verticals, if you had to choose maybe two or three that are showing promise for potentially outsized growth, what would they be? And then on the JV front, there's a couple of assets where you have a partial stake and I wondered if you had any thoughts of securing full economic and operating control of any of them? Thank you.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jonathan, thanks for getting back on the call. We certainly don't like to pick amongst the non-SMACC verticals, because we're very big fans of the SMACC verticals. But in particular, financial services for us, and to go one click deeper, financial technology, we think is one of the places that holds a lot of promise, not just for large scale deployments on our scale team, but colocation requirements on our colocation team and then multiple points of connectivity. It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about, where these fintech companies have to connect to other providers, have to connect to other institutions and have to connect to consumers, so fintech within finserv is one of the exciting places that we found. The Internet enterprises is another one of the verticals that we really like to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals, but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities. So, some of the both – the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures creates for us an incredible opportunity. When one of our great customers decides to split into two large companies, sometimes we get double the opportunity. And I know I wasn't supposed to talk about anything inside SMACC, but we think the mobile vertical for us is one that's incredibly ready for us to continue to exploit, and with the expertise of Telx now on-board, we're well situated to be able to do that.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jonathan, on the JV front, really not much for me to report there; we have several great partners from different types of capital sources. There is no real activity underway there.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, Andy, just a quick follow-up for you. The $0.03 of G&A outperformance, I guess you would call it, that you show on slide 13 of the presentation, what specifically drove that much G&A savings versus where you expect it to be?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I mean really the outperformance was just based on our internal estimates that kind of drove our underlying guidance. I'm not sure there's a one decisive thing that kind of calls out over any of the others, and I'm not sure all (51:42) that can be normalized into the go-forward projections either. It was a handful of things that kind of – going into a quarter where we acquired a company, went through integration, we definitely didn't think we'd come up light on the G&A front with overlapping teams in the midst of reorganizations, but we did it a little bit better than expected.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, it's actually Ross Nussbaum here with John Hodulik. A couple questions, guys. Obviously, the tone here, I think, has been pretty positive, but I guess my question is occupancy was down almost 200 bps year-over-year in 2015; it slid a little in Q4. You're guiding to kind of flattish for 2016 for the same capital portfolio. So I guess my question is, why isn't the occupancy rate of the core business trending higher given all the positive commentary I'm hearing here?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I think, basically we're looking at the occupancy going into the year, Ross, and seeing we have some renewals, we have some space that we've been seeing from coming back to us in the form of some PBB space, that was either dark space as a consequence of a former telco merger, there are some silver linings in that, because we're seeing some of our cloud service providers really engaging around taking that space. And we are just being conservative on our occupancy forecast throughout the year.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up, if I could, your stock has obviously done quite well over the last four months or so. How does your, I guess, positive shift in your equity cost to capital here influence, how you think about additional acquisitions, and in particular, looking at, say, things like the Verizon or the CenturyLink portfolios? How do you think about cost to capital versus acquisitions and has that changed from the commentary, I guess, you had last fall, when you did the Telx deal and said you were just focused on integration?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Just let me go back to your first question. Because I think, I might have missed a piece of it. Just to make sure, we're all on the same page, the decrease in the total portfolio's occupancy by a 140 bps or so, as of this quarter, that was due to look through on Telx. So, 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q 2015, and when then, we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their four-walls, that was a step down there. So, I just want to make sure, we didn't miss-communicate on that front. Going back to cost of capital, the base plan, which we put out on our guidance, roughly seven weeks ago had sourcing usage plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from DSBO proceeds and CapEx below our 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA; while at the same time, funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline, that's the base case plan, it doesn't require equity. I think you could expect us to follow our past track record, if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large scale increase in our development from landing a hyperscale deal or some M&A or other acquisition, we look to go the capital markets to keep our levered stats in line and equity is – time again been a part of that.
Operator: And our next question will be a follow-up from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: That response to that last question just begged me to ask one more. Obviously, there's a lot of speculation on whether or not you'll be interested in doing M&A this year or whether – wait to do something perhaps later on. As it relates to the Telx acquisition and now that integration, is there a point where you will feel more comfortable doing a deal or is that time now? Just help us give some perspective on the timing on when you think you'd be ready to handle a fairly large transaction, considering everything else that's going on inside the company?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Colby. It's Bill. So, I think – and Andy said this in his remarks, but we think we've made really good progress there, on the Telx integration, we've obviously retained the talent that we thought was critical to retain. We have over $15 million of synergies there, coming into this year, which is great and we've established a joint go-to-market plan, and we've moved inventory from various Digital locations to Telx, both 365 Main, we're going to do that at 111 8th. And we've approved in our investment committee, the Telx side of Ashburn campus. So, all that's great. We're laying revenue synergies groundwork here for 2016, and we expect to realize that in 2017 and beyond. I mean, I think what should be clear to you is, this is really a continuum. There is no clear point in time when you can say, hey, green light, we're ready. We make progress every day. We actually has a leadership team, we review that progress once a week on Monday, and there is work to be done. But at the same time, we're open to look at other investment opportunities, other M&A opportunities and the criteria is what we've said from the very beginning, getting back to Ross's question, we wanted to be strategic and we wanted to be accretive. And of course, we'll finance it in a prudent manner, keeping the leverage neutral.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing comments.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on page 18 of the deck. First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx and what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year one and it was prudently financed. We reported fourth quarter results that were well ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn-off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth and cash flow is accelerating and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth and AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel in Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a longstanding target. Last, but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004 and we remained committed to delivering superior risk adjusted total returns to our shareholders. Finally, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplement package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. So let's begin on page two of our presentation by recapping the guidepost for our strategic plan that we laid out, Investor Day in Ashburn just a few weeks ago. Number one is achieving superior returns. We've always taken an investment management approach to our business and we remain focused on achieving the highest possible risk-adjusted returns at the asset level. This is entirely consistent with our emphasis on driving improved return on invested capital. And I'm pleased to report that we picked up another 10 basis points during the third quarter, bringing the total improvement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to 130 basis points. That's a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. Next is capital allocation. We believe that we've established a respectable capital allocation track record and we plan to build on that success. In contrast to the past 18 months, we expect to be committing capital to expand over the intermediate term. We intend to expand on our existing campuses, expand in existing markets, and grow opportunistically in new markets all subject to the caveat that prospective investments must be accretive to our shareholders. We also intend to expand our product offerings. We are adapting our data center design to offer our customers a more agile solution. And Telx enables us to significantly enhance our colocation and interconnection offerings. Finally, operating efficiencies. We are keenly focused on running this business as efficiently as possible. This includes emphasizing investment on our campus environments where we can achieve significant economies of scale. We are also focused on process improvement and leveraging technology to streamline day-to-day functions. As we identify opportunities, we expect to realize significant benefits from these initiatives over the next several years. Let's turn the page to Telx. I'll begin by giving you a brief update on integration. Matt Mercier, who many of you know, led the first phase of our integration efforts through the closing of the transaction. Matt and his team led our efforts to formalize the combined organizational structure, define key business risks and objectives, identify bottom-up expense synergies while ensuring we maintain sales velocity and operational integrity, and he's done a great job for us. For that matter, the entire finance and accounting and investment teams did a great job, successfully raising almost $2 billion of capital in three separate transactions, along with underwriting and closing the transaction. The next phase of our integration efforts will be led by Chief Information Officer, Michael Henry. Michael has worked on many large acquisitions, most recently at Ericsson. His program is designed to ensure that we deliver the value we expect from the Telx acquisition, including product rationalization, go-to-market alignment and the overall customer experience. I should also add that we recently brought on an interim Head of HR, whose organizational leadership experience includes helping to guide American Airlines through its $11 billion merger with US Airways. I think it's safe to say that we will benefit from Cindy's perspective during this transformational event for our company. As you may recall, we've identified $15 million of expected cost synergies and we expect substantially all of these synergies to be realized in 2016. I know that you're all eager to see guidance including Telx and to learn more about the potential revenue synergies and how soon we can roll Telx out across our global campus network. In our view, it's far more important to get this right than to get it right now. With that said, let me outline our priorities for you in broad brushstrokes. The first order of business will be leasing up the existing vacancy within the Telx portfolio. It may not be sexy, but it drops straight to the bottom line. The next opportunity will be to turn over to Telx the pockets of inventory within our gateway buildings where they already operate. This includes space like the property management office that we previously kept at 111 8th Avenue. The next step will be to have Telx take over our existing colocation business, notably including properties like 365 Main in San Francisco, which we believe Telx will be able to operate very effectively. Next, we will turn to our domestic campus environments and look to build out a colocation and interconnection product offering on those campuses, notably including Ashburn, Dallas and Chicago. International expansion will be the final phase. Planning for each of these initiatives is already underway, although revenue synergies are likely to be realized beyond 2016. Moving on to capital recycling. We don't have much to report beyond what Scott covered at our Investor Day three weeks ago. As he said, we have seven properties on the market, shown here on page four. We expect to receive upwards of $150 million in proceeds from these properties and we expect our capital recycling program to be substantially complete by the time we report fourth quarter results. We will remain patient, however, and we will continue to close when our value-added efforts and market conditions enable us to achieve the best execution for our shareholders. Moving on to market fundamentals. As you can see here on page five, our recent leasing activity has been concentrated in our campus markets and with our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content along with financial and IT services. In addition, strategically expanding our Global Alliance program is a top priority as we invest significant resources to develop a program of world-class partners who help our clients deploy their mission-critical IT workloads and Digital Realty facilities. We are pleased to announce that during the third quarter, ClearSky Data and CompuCom became Global Alliance Partners joining our existing Technology Alliance Partners Program, including AWS, NaviSite, Rackspace, SoftLayer, Unitas Global and VMware. On a panel at a recent investor conference, I made the observation that data center demand is stronger today than it's ever been in our 11-year history as a public company. I think you've seen that momentum reflected in the recent leasing activity reported by our publicly traded data center peers and you may have also seen that we essentially hit the high end of the range for our upwardly revised speculative leasing target for the full year. Here's an interesting data point to demonstrate what I mean. Within the past five weeks, we have ordered 23 generators and have allocated 15 to projects scheduled for delivery over the next six months. Throughout the course of 2015 we've allocated between three to eight per month, so this represents a dramatic uptick in our level of delivery. Along similar lines, I am very pleased to report that earlier this week we went hard on the acquisition of a land parcel in Ashburn in close proximity to our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining Greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudoun County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet in the build-out of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. Turning to supply on page six. The big picture conclusion here is that most markets remain roughly in equilibrium and continue to gradually tighten. New supply in Northern Virginia ticked up during the third quarter, but we remain very comfortable with the leasing velocity in that market. We continue to closely match our new starts with customer demand and we continue to enjoy great success at healthy returns in Northern Virginia. Sublease availability in Silicon Valley continued to contract during the third quarter. Our view is that Silicon Valley has tightened considerably, consistent with third-party market commentary. Finally, let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. Global economic growth has clearly decelerated over the past 90 days and monetary policy remains very accommodative. In addition, much has been written recently about a potential slowdown in the tech sector. From where we sit, however, the rumors of the tech-wreck coming back to the future have been greatly exaggerated. For starters, cloud businesses appear to be some of the fastest-growing segments within the established, publicly-traded tech companies. In terms of a slowdown in the IPO market, it is certainly not uncommon to see a disconnect between public and private real estate market pricing. REITs periodically traded wide premiums or discounts to the underlying value of their portfolios and it doesn't seem unreasonable for private market valuations for tech companies to occasionally decouple from public market pricing. Valuation aside, however, one key difference is between the years 2015 and 2000 is that companies driving the Bay Area economy today have very legitimate business models, are generating significant cash flow and the drivers of the digital economy landing in our portfolio generally have very solid balance sheets with lots of cash and little or no debt. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our own financial strength.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Bill. As we pre-announced at our Investor Day, and as shown here on page nine, we signed new leases representing just under $33 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for over 70% of our lease signings during the quarter. Existing customers represented over 85% of our third quarter leasing activity and we added 16 new logos in the quarter bringing the full year to a total of 51 new logos. On page 10 you can see the weighted average lag between signings and commencement tick backup to 5.4 months during the quarter from the record low of 2.5 months in the second quarter. This was primarily due to limit a remaining finished inventory on the shelves. Going forward, you should expect to see this measure hover around the historical average of about six months. Turning to page 11, cash releasing spreads were positive across property types for the third quarter. In-place rents on the lion's share of our leases are now below market although we do still have several remaining above market leases notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix and individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we have reached an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by market rent growth along with the steady progress we have made cycling through peak finished lease expirations. Turning to our financial results on page 12, we reported 3Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.32, $0.05 ahead of consensus. The outperformance during the quarter was driven by a combination of a few items including a large property tax refund in the west region. This refund maybe one-time in nature, but it reflects the operational excellence of our proactive portfolio management approach. In addition, the current year contribution from speculative leasing was ahead of plan, foreign currency translation represented a bit less of a headwind than expected and we did get a slight benefit from delayed timing on asset sales. I would also like to point out the continued improvement in AFFO per share growth, specifically the non-cash straight-line rent and FAS 141 adjustments, both continue to trend down and our recurring CapEx spend was also down significantly this quarter. The lower recurring CapEx during the quarter is partially explained by seasonality, but in general, these trends reflect the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past year and a half as well as consistently improving data center market fundamentals. Please note that the AFFO includes $11 million of Telx transaction costs. Excluding these transaction costs, AFFO would have been $1.10 per share and our payout ratio would have been below 80%. The bottom-line is the quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. In addition, FX continues to represent roughly a 300 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top-line to the bottom-line as shown on page 13. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising 2015 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. The upwardly revised range represents roughly 4% growth at the midpoint on our as reported basis and approximately 7% on a constant currency basis. I should point out here that our bottom-line FFO per share forecast includes the expected contribution from Telx, whereas the individual substance underlying the guidance reflects standalone results for Digital Realty only. Please keep in mind that the Telx transaction just closed in early October. We are comfortable raising guidance while absorbing Telx into our financial forecast. We expect to give formal 2016 guidance early next year, at which point we'll provide greater visibility on the impact of Telx on our combined operating performance metrics. In the meantime, I can confirm that we still expect Telx to be roughly 1% accretive to core FFO per share in 2016, and roughly 3% accretive to AFFO per share. In terms of Digital Realty's third quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy declined 90 basis points to 93.9%. As we stated for the past several quarters, the occupancy drive during the quarter was anticipated and we do expect occupancy to bounce back and finish up slightly by the end of the year. The occupancy decline was due to a few known power-based building move-outs, which impacted our tenant retention during the quarter as well, but I'd like to take a moment to provide some additional color on these non-renewables. In our experience, data center customers have a high propensity to renew unless their core business undergoes a material change and provided they've taken occupancy for their space. The two largest non-renewals during the quarter have both been targets of M&A activity and neither had occupied the space for years. In addition, a significant portion of the space that was technically not renewed has either been a re-lease to sub-tenants or is currently under LOI to be re-leased. Also shown on page 13, same-capital cash NOI was up 2.2% in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, same-capital's cash NOI would have been up 4.5%. For the full year, we continue to expect organic growth to trend to the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but towards the lower end of the range on an as reported basis. I'm pleased to report that we are on the cusp of a happy ending to the Net Data Centers bankruptcy. As you may be aware, Net Data Centers completed sales of East Coast operations last week, clearing the path to emerge from bankruptcy. Net Data Centers has elected to assume all of their leases with us in downtown Los Angeles and El Segundo with no change to the in-place rents. They've remained current with us on all post-petition obligations throughout bankruptcy, and the only amount outstanding is roughly $1 million of pre-petition rent, which we have fully reserved. We expect to collect on the pre-petition receivable and reversed the reserve during the fourth quarter, which should represent upside of approximately $0.01 per share. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we had begun the process of recasting about $3 billion of global credit facilities. I'm pleased to report that we have over $4.9 billion of commitments to the credit facilities today, including more than $300 million of commitments for a new seven-year term loan. We expect to tighten pricing and lower the cap rate used to value our portfolio for calculating total leverage and unsecured leverage under the loan covenants. As shown on page 14, we expect to extend the maturity for the line of credit and the five-year term loan out from 2018 to 2021, and the new seven-year term loan would be scheduled to mature in 2023. We anticipate closing these facilities early next year. As you can see from the left hand side of the page, pro forma for the recast credit facilities, we have very modest debt maturities through 2019 with no more than $200 million coming due in any of the next four years. In 2020 and beyond, maturities should likewise be manageable with a well-laddered schedule. I would also like to note that we reached a milestone during the third quarter, with $1 billion of annualized adjusted EBITDA. Leverage dipped below five times as of September 30th, although we have since issued additional debt to finance the closing of the Telx transaction. Nonetheless, we expect to end the year below our target leverage of 5.5 times with the balance sheet positioned for growth. In summary, we just capped off another very busy, but very successful, quarter and we are focused on maintaining our current momentum through the end of this year and into 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. My question is regarding production and general leasing. So volume, which you disclosed to us at the time of the Investor Day and we've obviously received over the past couple of quarters, has obviously reflected a little bit of a lighter inventory as you guys have aimed to lease it up and do more profitable deals. But I guess, as you're integrating Telx, and I know it's early days, I'm curious about what a realistic leasing or production number may look like on a go-forward basis relative to legacy Digital.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Thanks for the question, Jordan. This is Matt Miszewski. So, we would anticipate – and we're in the midst of actually baking the sales plan numbers for 2016, but we would anticipate similar results to what we've seen on a quarterly basis for the core DLR facilities and product sets with a slight uptick depending upon which region we're talking about and then a slight uptick with regard to the combination with the Telx inventory that's out there.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. But you wouldn't yet venture a guess in terms of what sort of growth, either top-line or on a quarterly basis, we should anticipate from a...
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: No, I wouldn't expect that.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: I wouldn't hazard a guess. And we'll make those comments in the next quarterly results.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Jordan, the plan is to have an announcement shortly after the first of the year where we will lay out the guidance for next year. That will include the assumptions for Telx as well as Digital.
Operator: The next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could talk us through how you're contemplating positioning the existing mid-market or colocation business as you think about consolidating Telx. There's clearly a meaningful pricing difference in that area versus where Telx space is being sold. And I'm just curious, as you contemplate your go-to-market for next year, how that product is going to be positioned with customers.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Thanks, Matthew. Actually, it's a fantastic combination of the resources that we have currently in place in terms of the mid-market attack that we've been under for the last few years. And if you think about the new product set, it's okay to think about it in the following way as we get these definitions out into the market. The Telx facilities that we have and the Telx products that we have really satisfy a very concrete set of defined products fitting into that 0 to 300 kilowatt range, and then they have specific service levels that are attached to them. If you think about the mid-market approach, the sweet spot for the traditional mid-market team in Digital Realty has been between that 300 kilowatt space and 1 megawatt space for our clients. We're certainly in the middle of doing a branding exercise, but right now we've got a major product that we've had historically, called the Scale product, at about 1 megawatt and above. If you think about that 300 kilowatt to 1 megawatt space as a mini-scale as opposed – we're not finished with that particular product definition yet, but mini-scale or mini-wholesale, you'd be on the right track. So we'll be able to take advantage of the mid-market team that we fielded for the last year and a half, as well as a traditional Scale team that I have and the Telx team will fit right perfectly inside of our portfolio.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then just one for Andy, if I may. Talking about the increase in the signed to commencement lag up around five months, and I guess the expectation that we kind of stay at that level. You had been talking about an improvement in that area driving improvement in the straight line rent, in the pass-through to AFFO. As we think about our model, should we expect any change in that area going forward from the higher commencement lag?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Matt. So we ground that stat down as low as probably possible from a business perspective at 2.5 months. And it's really a product – you usually have to have a finished data center to go from a sign to commencement in that timetable. I think the more natural spot for that is closer to six months. I think you're going to see our straight line rents are non-cash and 141 suffering right around where they are today. I think the other more meaningful part of that is not giving ramps upon commencement, meaning customers take over 100% of their space the day they commence their lease versus staggered commencements which results in a straight line rent adjustment and a gap between the cash and the gap. And we're continuing to push that and that echoes back to the underwriting discipline that's been instilled here over 1.5 years. So I don't think that stat's going to be changed based on this time to commencement.
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good evening. Hey, Bill recognizing that the ink isn't dry yet on the Telx deal and you've got another one to chop there, but interactions out there with other dance partner. Any thoughts on what you might do next?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: What we're going to do next is integrate Telx. And I just want to repeat what I said in the remarks, Bill. Our highest priority is to successfully integrate this $1.9 billion investment. And so the focus is for the next two months on achieving the operating synergies and then rolling out through 2016, the revenue synergies. As far as additional inorganic growth, the criteria is as we've always stated, or as we've stated at least for the last 18 months which is to say we want anything we do to be strategic and complementary, and to be financially accretive as well as prudently financed. Yes...
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I was going to say given the recovery in the stock price, the valuation there, does that change at all your thought process on uses of capital?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: No. It doesn't. I mean if you think about Digital's history, we've been an acquirer of real estate and a developer of real estate. This is really our first major acquisition of an operating platform and we want to make sure that we do this right.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. And just add to that Bill, Scott here. We do keep tabs on everything that's going on in the marketplace and we're abreast of everything. But we don't want to lose sight of what our target is right now and that's getting Telx integrated properly and growing it within our platform.
Operator: The next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. You mentioned the plan to commit capital and grow in new markets. Could you comment on the need to build out the sales force in certain markets post the Telx acquisition? What's the rough magnitude that we're talking about there and what's the potential timing?
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Vance. This is Jarrett. We are in the process of reviewing their full pipeline and the customer. They've a healthy funnel in place. We will ramp up some level of resource and some market caps we've identified. But I think it's in the magnitude of five to 10 people, and to continue to grow. And again, you traditionally see some level of folks churn in your sales organization. So, I don't see any significant sales investment. All the underwriting was really consistent with what we did as part of the acquisition and the diligence we did.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And Vance, across the whole sales force, we do expect to see some interesting dynamics where the efficiency of each one of the assets that we have on both of the sales teams would be able to enhanced by the mere existence of multiple products. So we're excited about that and that does deaden the need for us to hire additional staff.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great color and then for my follow-up. Could you bring is right up to date on dispositions. How many are under negotiation, how many under contract and then what's the timing for bringing them through to fruition?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. I think the disposition program will be largely done by the end of the year here. We currently have one under contract that's going to close soon and we're negotiating a contract for others right now and then we've got a couple others that we are working on, just some value-add better sales outcomes projects on and so we hope to make some good progress on that shortly.
Operator: And the next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. So, a quick question on Telx, and as you think about potentially growing that platform outside the U.S. into Europe, and I wondered your interest level in purchasing divested assets not platforms, but individual assets in case anything were to become available as a result of the pending merger going on over there between Equinix and Telecity. And then, on the different data center design that you talked about, if you could just sort of give us your updated thoughts on what the implications are on yields that you hope to achieve in cost to develop as a result of the new design? Thank you.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah sure. So the first part is European assets – individual assets that may come for sale. We've got a long consistent history of acquiring assets like that; certainly keeping our eyes open and see anything that may come about as a result of that pending merger. We also are looking at some select individual assets out there as well. You know obviously, we try to maintain all of our principles as it relates to that, whether it's with respect to individual assets. We want them to represent good value to our shareholders and they have to be assets that fit well within our existing platform or portfolio, but to that extent, we'll keep an eye on everything that becomes available there.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And Jonathan on part two in terms of the new design, I think there's two components. One, we did see an opportunity to really open up more opportunities. So the first thing was more agility to drive service levels and innovate the product. So in terms of the return profile, I think we're just looking that we'll cover more of the market, particularly in the M+1 design or the different SLAs associated with that product and the yield implications. And it also gives us ability to serve and not strand power for denser power solutions for those verticals and social, mobile, analytic, cloud and content. But again, our goal is to provide that high value to our clients and sell at the market rate which is what we're really focused on is serving those clients at the market rates.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. As we start to factor Telx into our model, I was hoping you can give us an update on what Telx's third quarter revenue EBITDA were, so we can start to think about that correctly? And then also, you did lower your, I guess, NAREIT-Defined definition of FFO. Obviously there're some puts and takes there from the Telx transaction, but I was wondering if you could just walk us through what happened there and how that should perhaps change as we go into 2016? Thanks.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey Colby, it's Andy here. So we literally closed the transaction October 9th, so we've gotten preliminary read-outs on the numbers, but obviously we haven't had our team go through and scrub all the financials and get to a comfort level and we want to tell the public markets where we're coming out. Preliminary view is that that they're on track from a revenue and EBITDA standpoint. Nothing is changing with our expectations for underwriting for 2016 or pacing. We did commence literally in conjunction with the closing, we commenced the execution of our synergy plan. We had a handful of executives depart on that day. We entered into transitional agreements with a handful of executives throughout the end of the year roughly and we've commenced on the rest of the expense plan which is expected to be done with and deliver on those synergies before the end of the year. That leads me to your second question. NAREIT definition doesn't add back the transaction expenses. So we will have transaction expenses associated with Telx and including severance they'll run through the P&L in the fourth quarter.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: And do you expect those costs to be done as we go into the first quarter, or could there be a little bit of bleeding into the first quarter as you relate to those things as well?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I think most of them will be done in the fourth quarter, the large majority of it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hey Bill, just want to go back to your comment about the demand being as strong as you've ever seen it, you mentioned the generator example. But I was just curious your development CapEx guidance did come down relative to prior. Just curious if you could provide some commentary on what was driving that? And then I have a follow-up.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I mean, that's basically timing, Vin. The generators are a leading indicator and we would fully expect that the CapEx guidance will increase next year.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So...
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: This is Andy, just before you ask your second question. It's just a timing thing when you release shelves, when you spend the money to construct. So we basically release the shelf a little bit later, so the bulk of dollars are going to bleed into the next year versus this fiscal year.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. By that, do you mean so if it was $750 million to $850 million before, if you have a similar level for next year, does that mean we'll be sort of in the $1 billion-ish range just to make up for some of the timing?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I think it'll be closer to the high end of what we've put out in Investor Day, plus or minus $50 million.
Operator: And the next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks. Actually just wanted to pick up on development spending for next year. Obviously, it sounds like you guys are going to be more aggressive in terms of committing capital to expand, but to do that, does that mean you're going to increase the amount of spec development in the pipeline?
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I don't think so. I mean we're signing a lot of leases right now for space that doesn't exist. So I think you're going to see a decent amount of pre-leasing percentage on everything that we develop next year.
Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC: Okay great. And then, just one point on guidance that I'm a little bit confused about. So in terms of the long-term debt issuance, you're still saying $500 million to $1 billion. I know you did $500 million in June and then another $950 million which I assume gets put in with Telx, not part of this guidance. I'm just trying to figure out between now and the end of the year. Are we still expecting another debt deal?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: So the table on page 10, all of the assumptions from the slightly positive renewals down to timing on the debt, are all standalone, do not include Telx at all. So you don't see $1.9 billion acquisition, you don't see the $250 million preferred, you don't see the $740 million of equity or nor the $950 million of bonds. We are factoring the impact of Telx in our end results here. So we really think we'll achieve this core FFO per share including Telx for two-and-a-half months in the results. But the financings do not include it. We've completed $500 million of debt this year with a green bond. We're still evaluating the potential Eurobond before the end of the year. Now there's only so many weeks to the end of the year, so that may roll into next year.
Operator: And the next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Andy, if I look at your – sort of combining two pieces, your revised guidance as well as the walk to consensus, the $0.05 beat, I would think that the FX would probably replicate itself again in the fourth quarter. So was just curious why the top end guidance is going up less than the $0.05 that you beat by in the quarter, especially with FX repeating again.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Manny, the reason it's not up higher is that we're factoring a couple of cents, maybe up to $0.05, of potential dilution from Telx for the fourth quarter. That's not for 2016. Remember, we literally closed on 9th. Our assumptions for Telx 2016 include synergies being executed. We're working through that plan, but those individuals are still on the books. We have not consolidated our office space and haven't achieved some of those expense synergies. And it does include some of the underwritten growth, so there is some dilution, a couple pennies from Telx that brings down that high end. Does that make sense?
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sure. And then if I turn back to the commentary on commencement timing. Does that mean that you're going to have less take-up of the pre-stabilized space as you develop more new space and that's why you're going to six months? Or is it just that new space magnitude-wise is just so much bigger than the stabilized space or the pre-stabilized space that will be leasing?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I hope we don't have less take-up of the pre-stabilized stuff. That stuff's already standing there, so it should be easier to attack from a leasing standpoint. And we're very focused on that in our sales discussions in our investment committee. I'm just saying that 2.5 months was a very low time from sign to commencement and feels like from looking at the business over longer time period when you don't have lots of standing finished inventory, six months is a closer amount to a regular time period. I think Matt wants to jump in and give more color as well.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah, Manny, thanks for asking a question to Andy that made him give me a cursed look. Our focus on the pre-stabilized space remains intent and I would say laser-focused as we've been saying around the table. And the history of the folks in my organization are such that that pre-stabilized space has become a pretty profitable target for us, so we're going to keep focused on it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC: (43:02) in the prepared remarks, but could you give us a sense – you know what is out there that might be over market that's still in the portfolio that might need to be marked down, maybe magnitude or just some sense as to that. And then I'd like to circle back to a question I had asked last quarter and just sort of get an update. But you guys have the opportunity to host the big cloud platforms from a large footprint perspective, but also really drive connections within the campus environment to the enterprises, obviously something enhanced through Telx. But I'm just wondering in terms of seeing the demand for enterprise to cloud, cloud to enterprise, seeing that develop, if you have any update or perspective on where we are in the cycle. Thanks.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: So, Jonathan, I think your phone might have been on mute for the first second when you chatted, so maybe just make sure we answer your full question. On the mark-to-market piece, two examples are Northern New Jersey, where we obviously have a heavy concentration of financial services. A lot of activity that would happen on the backs of the financial crisis where there was a very tight supply market and we delivered and signed pretty great leases. And in that tight market, some of those leases have rolled down historically and there's onesie, twosies in that market to come. Another example is in Phoenix, off the top of my head, where we bought a portfolio. And when we bought the portfolio at the time, it had an above-market lease. We underwrote that, we factored that into what we paid the seller of that portfolio. And there's a lease or two in that market from that portfolio acquisition that will come through in the next year or two and roll down.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And, Jonathan, this is Matt. The answer to your question on big cloud platforms and driving connections, that's exactly the strategy that we've been looking at executing before the Telx acquisition, but the Telx acquisition just makes it that much more crisp. We've been having conversations – Jarrett and I have been having conversations with most of our major customers and all of the major cloud providers in the space. And very specifically, we've started to see an interest on their side to not just land the large cloud compute loads in our facility, which we've become expert at, but also making sure that there's available colocation space right next to that at extremely low latency and providing some direct connect facilities so that they can connect securely as well as with low latency. So we're seeing increased demand, not just for the large cloud workloads to continue to land in our space, but to have those enterprise clients land right next to them in colocation space. In fact, I'm proud to announce that just late last night we were able to land another major cloud provider in our Chicago facility and that conversations have begun on just that structure.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: And just to build on that, Jonathan, I think what's really unique I think the industry is out there a lot with these cloud on-ramps and providers who are really going after the enterprise are providing cloud or managed services. What makes us really unique and different is our focus on the foundation and partners for the Scale. And we're seeing larger enterprises deploy right next to the compute engines and directly connect. So that is very much a unique pattern which makes us very compatible with partners who are focusing on the enterprise side of the business.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Bill, if you could, you mentioned the last five week statistic where you've ordered significant number of generators. Could you expound on that a little bit?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: We've only ordered the generators, Jordan, because we have clear visibility into the demand, which is to say that Matt's team has been busy signing leases, a decent amount of which has occurred at the end of the quarter so it's October business rather than September business.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. That's fair. But it sounds like essentially it's correlated or related to a spike in leasing activity.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Perfectly correlated.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then we've danced around the mark-to-market a little bit. But do you have a sense for what the mark-to-market looks like for next year? I know Andy just laid out the Phoenix one that could expire or mature in the next year or two. But if you're looking at the portfolio for next year, does it look like a positive mark overall or is it flat? How should we think about that?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Jordan, so we're still going through budgets for next year to give you the most up-to-date data. We're looking at the numbers, it looks like it's around flat across the entire portfolio. We're trying to push it into the positive territory. But these one-off exceptions which have reasons to it, not due to anything other than being a site of preference (48:43) or something we underwrote that are driving the down piece of it. So you're going to get a full picture when we put out our guidance at the beginning of next year.
Operator: The next question will come from Will Clayton of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks for the question, guys. I was just wondering, as you work through the four-stage strategic priority list on Telx, how should we think about the timeline capital intensity profiles and margin impacts of these different stages? And what are the targets or metrics that we should use to kind of hold people accountable for executing on strategic objectives?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Will. This is Andy. So out of the gates what we said before and what we continue to plan to deliver is essentially $148 million of EBITDA from the 20 Telx locations; $15 million of expense synergies, $10 million of it roughly flowing to the P&L. We expect to meet or outperform at all those metrics. Capital intensity, recurring CapEx associated with that 2016 plan is 20%-ish of that EBITDA. There's a little bit more of expansion CapEx outside of that. But obviously the expansion CapEx will have a massive EBITDA contribution in 2016. Anything beyond that we view as a revenue synergy, which we're putting and doing a lot of work towards and continue to develop throughout 2016; and we think it will be a small contributor to 2016. And those are the examples that we've outlined before and some of which on this call, be it bringing Telx to Ashburn domestically, expanding their presence in some of our Internet gateways, tethering in certain assets, or eventually bringing the Telx product of colocation or connection to our international campuses such as a Singapore or a London. But I would say that's a more – we'll be doing a whole lot of work on that in the next 12 months to 18 months. But I don't think you'll see a ton of capital intensity or a ton of EBITDA contribution during that time period.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah, Will. Scott here. To help you out a little on that, if you look at the different stages of the priorities, they go from an ease of execution, but if you also look at them they go from a higher initial gross margin business and a lower capital intensity. So I think you see the initial stages will have better impact than the more capital-intensive, longer lifecycle later stages. So that's a good way to think about it.
Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And I was just wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about what you are noticing in terms of industry fundamentals today. You seem to have sustained momentum in leasing volumes. But also on the pricing side, where do you see prices on new leases and renewals over the next four or five quarters? And then how do you think about that relative to current levels?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. Thanks, Will. In terms of the industry fundamentals, of course, it is, as a real estate business, region by region specific, but we see the industry fundamentals as strong and growing in certain accounts. If you go back to the slide where Bill highlighted our focus on the SMACC accounts and the SMACC portfolio, we continue to see an increasing amount of interest in our facilities from the social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content providers, which suggests that there is a great deal of strength in the industry that we're going after to address. The second piece is, if you think about the shift that we talked about at Analyst Day and the conversations that we've had, if you look at the historic approach that we've had in going after enterprises directly and the shift to go after those enterprises indirectly, that gives us the ability to have lower cost of sale and take advantage of the core competencies we have to hit the high-growth, high-potential SMACC workloads. In terms of pricing – and I am going to turn it over to Jarrett in a little bit – but in terms of pricing, I continue to see that the discipline that we're exerting in our piece of the industry and the rest of the discipline that the industry has with regard to supply is having a positive effect on pricing.
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: And just with the contract vehicles and the pricing, what's really interesting is you sell frequently – in this quarter it was 85% of our sales came from existing customers. We are adding 1,000 new customers that we can now sell a full suite of products. So I think both sales organizations are very excited to sell colo, connectivity and Scale; and we have to take advantage of that with the assets that we have as a combined company.
Operator: And at this time, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our third quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 16. First and foremost, we picked up another 10 basis points of improvement in our ROIC during the third quarter, bringing the total improvement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to 130 basis points. I would also like to point out that the 10 basis point improvement during the third quarter excludes the one-time property tax refund; and the 130 basis points since year-end 2013 likewise excludes the impairment charge we booked during the fourth quarter of 2014. These items would've added another 10 basis points each to the total. As you know, we recently closed on the acquisition of Telx, which we believe will be a truly transformational transaction for our company. We beat third quarter consensus estimates by $0.05 and we raised guidance for core FFO per share from the prior range of $5.05 to $5.15, up to $5.12 to $5.18. In short, we continue to execute on our top priorities. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter, many of whom have been working around the clock on the Telx acquisition and integration. That concludes our third quarter call. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I'm happy to report that Digital just completed another solid quarter, marked by strong execution against our core strategic objectives. I'd like to begin, as usual, with "The Way Forward" slide on page two of our earnings deck. We continued to make progress towards our top priority of driving improved return on invested capital. And we achieved a 20-basis-point pickup during the second quarter, building upon the 100-basis-point improvement we delivered over the previous five quarters. In terms of recycling capital, we realized a $77 million gain from the sale of one non-core property, and we are in active negotiations on several others. Scott Peterson will provide additional detail. As you know, we've put a great deal of effort into stabilizing the business and derisking the development pipeline over the past year and a half. With respect to inventory management, we have reduced our finished inventory by nearly half since our Investor Day in November 2013. And our $630 million pipeline of active data center development projects is over 80% pre-leased at stabilized cash yields, just below the high end of our 10% to 12% target range. From the current position, we believe we are in solid footing to pivot towards the next phases of growth for Digital Realty, particularly with the recent addition of several key executive-level hires, notably, including Andy Power, Jarrett Appleby and Michael Henry. I'm very pleased with the progress that the entire Digital team has made on each of the strategic objectives spelled out here. But today, I'd like to focus, and I'm sure most of you will too, on the red call-out box highlighting innovative product offerings, colocation and ecosystem initiatives. As you are all aware, just two weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Telx, a leading national provider of colocation and interconnection data center solutions for $1.9 billion. We believe Telx fits squarely within the box in terms of our strategic priorities, and that is product offerings and geographic footprint are highly complementary to our current portfolio. Page three really highlights the complementary nature of the transaction. Our existing business consists primarily of meeting the large footprint data center space and power requirements of creditworthy customers. Telx's colocation business is very similar, but in smaller increments to a far greater number of customers. Over time and in select environments, if a critical mass of customer concentration is achieved, an ecosystem may blossom, which is the necessary precursor to the interconnection business or the exchange of traffic within a data center. As indicated by the bubbles on the right-hand column, interconnection represents nearly half of Telx's top line and has grown at a very healthy rate. It's important to understand here that by combining our businesses, we are creating an even more differentiated business model, with a strong, large footprint business and a solid, rapidly-growing colocation business within a truly interconnected network. In essence, we are widening and deepening the economic moat between ourselves and our competitors. There are significant barriers to growing our portfolio of either a global large footprint platform or a colocation and interconnection business, but with all three under the same roof, we believe that the sum of the parts will truly be greater than the whole. In addition, the properties that make up the physical infrastructure are almost entirely owned by Digital. This makes future growth that much more significant since we control our own real estate and the residual value from incremental growth opportunities accrues to us rather than a third-party landlord. In the long run, we believe this will further set us apart from our competitors in terms of products and services offered. Now turning to slide four, we have consistently stated that our key acquisition criteria are focused on investments that are strategic and complementary to our existing business and also financially accretive and prudently financed. We believe Telx checks all of those boxes. This deal makes strategic sense for several reasons: First, Telx is a leading colocation and interconnection business that is extremely complementary to our existing platform and is concentrated in top tier markets in the U.S. In addition, this deal allows us to obtain a robust and extremely difficult-to-replicate interconnection ecosystem in one fell swoop. The combination also sets the stage for future upside from cost synergies, significant revenue synergies and embedded growth potential from expanding Telx's offering across our global portfolio and leasing up Telx's underutilized properties in our own backyard on the West Coast. And finally, we expect to achieve these benefits while enhancing our standalone growth trajectory and funding the transaction in a manner consistent with our leverage targets. Our core competency remains providing space and power to our existing customer base. This acquisition allows us to broaden the range of customers and provide even more choice on an open carrier-neutral platform. The transaction will not fundamentally alter our relationship with our customers. But what it will do is provide them a one-stop shop where they pick and choose from the entire range of data center solutions that best fit their needs. That open platform is extremely compelling. We are focused on serving the needs of our entire customer base from enterprise customers to strategic channel partners and managed service providers who sell through to corporate enterprise IT requirements. We have a unique opportunity to provide an open environment that gives our customers a choice of varying levels of redundancy, footprint size and connectivity options. While this acquisition expands our product offering, we will, of course, remain true to our real estate roots. And we are keenly focused on maximizing the return on our existing asset base. We expect to drive higher returns on every square foot, on every kilowatt in our portfolio, by augmenting our existing product offering with a wider array of size, power and redundancy requirements and by bringing core interconnection networking capabilities to our data center campus environments around the world. In some instances, this will mean partnering with customers to enable their managed services, thereby monetizing the tremendous value of our global footprint with minimal incremental costs. Our ability to do so is unique among data center providers. We will provide a full review of how we see Telx fitting into our strategy going forward at our Investor Day in Aspen now scheduled for October 6. I look forward to seeing you all there. And now, I'll pass the call over to our Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson, for a deeper dive on our underwriting of the Telx acquisition.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Thank you, Bill. Picking up here on page five, I'd like to first highlight the attractive growth profile of this business. As you can see from this chart in the upper left quadrant, the top line has grown at over 20% compound annual growth rate and the interconnection business has grown even faster. The drivers have been volume growth along with pricing power as reflected in the charts on the bottom half of the page. We view the interconnection business as high growth and highly desirable with high barriers to entry. Top-line growth has also historically translated to growth in cash flow as demonstrated by the core EBITDA time series in the upper right quadrant. I'd like to pause for a moment to focus on the absolute numbers in this chart and to clarify a few points here. For starters, I can tell you that we underwrote projected EBITDA of $148 million in 2016, which represents 11% growth from the $133 million run rate core EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter. I would like to point out that core EBITDA excludes $22 million of non-cash deferred rent expense paid to third-party landlords in 2016. The rent that Telx previously paid to Digital will be an intercompany elimination going forward. We do intend to run Telx as a standalone line of business reporting to Jarrett Appleby. We also underwrote $15 million of cost synergies, primarily redundant corporate overhead, of which $10 million runs through the P&L and $5 million represents capitalized compensation costs. It is important to note that our $148 million of projected 2016 EBITDA does not include any cost synergies. We also have not factored any revenue synergies into our near-term underwriting expectations, although we believe the longer-term revenue synergies could be quite meaningful. The EBITDA multiple is in the eye of the beholder, but since the transaction is expected to close late this year, we view 2016 as the most appropriate time period, and on that basis, the transaction represents a multiple of a little less than 13 times. Taking synergies into account, the EBITDA multiple would be right around 12 times. The next slide on page six has received quite a bit of attention. And I would like to clarify several points. This is intended to be an illustration of the embedded growth potential from leasing existing built colocation inventory and improving utilization rates at underutilized properties. It is not meant to tie to our 2016 EBITDA projection. The concept behind this is simply raising the utilization rates for properties below 70% up to 70%, and properties below 80% up to 80% utilized, while leaving those above constant. The potential incremental revenue from reaching 70% and 80% utilization has been revised from $47 million and $75 million respectively to the $37 million and $65 million you see here on page six. I would also like to point out that the properties shown here represent a subset of the Telx portfolio. If you tally up the number of properties shown in white at the bottom of the bars, you should arrive at 15 out of a total of 20. The utilization rate for all 15 of these properties is less than 80%. In fact, the average utilization for the 15 properties shown here is 57%. Consequently, reaching 70% utilization would represent 1,300 basis points of lease-up on this subset and reaching 80% utilization would represent 2,300 basis points of lease-up. In term of our underwriting the $148 million of projected 2016 EBITDA, we've been discussing contemplates lease-up of the overall portfolio utilization rate from a current 68% to a little less than 79%. Of course, that includes the five properties that are above 80% utilized and represents approximately 37,000 square feet of new leasing. The corresponding utilization rate on the subset of these 15 properties would be between 75% and 80%, when excluding the impact of potential expansion at these facilities. Said differently, our 2016 underwriting essentially contemplates that we will achieve some but not all of the embedded growth potential represented on this slide. I would like to be clear about the corresponding capital investment. Reaching 70% utilization requires a capital investment of approximately $15 million, and reaching 80% would require an additional $25 million. Our 2016 underwriting includes roughly $45 million of expansion capital, which includes some CapEx to create additional inventory. Separately, we have underwritten a little over $30 million of recurring capital spend in 2016, which we would deduct from FFO to arrive at AFFO and which represents roughly 20% of EBITDA. I would like to point out that a significant portion represents capitalized leasing costs rather than physical maintenance CapEx. The final point I'd like to make on this slide is to note that the empty sellable square footage within the Telx portfolio is somewhat analogous to a development pipeline in traditional real estate terms and really represents their finished inventory. If you zero in on 60 Hudson, you will see that it represents most of the lease-up opportunity in the table on the right and you can see from the bar chart, it is currently 49% leased. However, almost all of the vacancy at 60 Hudson reflects expansion space taken down in January of this year. Prior to taking down that expansion space, 60 Hudson was 85% utilized. Turning to the geographic overlap on page seven, Telx is headquartered in New York and has a very strong presence on the East Coast with leaseholds in three highly strategic Internet Gateway buildings in Lower Manhattan. Telx has a direct lease with the owner of 111 8th Avenue, the third largest building in Manhattan and one of the key Internet hubs on the East Coast. Digital also has a leasehold interest in 111 8th Avenue, and Telx in turn subleases a portion of this space from us. In addition, we recently moved out of the property management office we kept at 111 8th Avenue, freeing up 3,000 square feet of prime inventory, which we expect the Telx sales force will be eager to begin market upon closing. Based on Telx pricing of 111 8th Avenue, this represents a potential $3 million to $4 million of incremental EBITDA. Just to be clear, however, this is not included in the $148 million of EBITDA we had projected in 2016, although to be fair, neither is the $4 million of capital that would be required to build out this space. Finally, as you can see from the summary performance statistics on the left-hand side of the page, the three West Coast properties are less than 50% leased. We see significant embedded growth potential from these underutilized properties in our backyard on the West Coast. In addition to the upside from lease-up, we see significant opportunity to roll out the Telx platform across our global portfolio, particularly in our campus environment. As you can see from the overlapping logos at the top of page eight, Telx has an existing presence in our campuses in Chicago, Dallas, New York and Silicon Valley. The overlap speaks to the complementary nature of the transaction, but the campus environments in Ashburn, London and Singapore, where you don't see a Telx logo, represent the most promising value proposition from the combination of the two platforms. Turning to page nine, echoing Bill's points about our real estate roots and this deal being the best fit for Digital Realty, as you know, Telx leases 11 of its 20 properties from us. In addition, Telx owns the two properties pictured here on this page. As a result, we will own outright over half of the real estate in this portfolio. The mix of owned versus leased real estate compares quite favorably relative to most other colocation businesses, and the overlap of Telx's footprint within the envelope of our buildings should help mitigate integration risk, especially relative to the underwriting risk of the unknown in a typical arm's length transaction. The customer data on the next page clearly demonstrate that Telx has effectively achieved a robust interconnection ecosystem within its portfolio. Telx is a well-diversified customer base with over 1,250 customers of whom more than 80% are connectivity-centric from within the telecom, cloud and IT verticals. In addition, while Telx's customer contracts tend to be shorter duration than our traditional lease terms, the stickiness of the customer base is highlighted by the average customer relationship of over nine years. Page 11 underscores the strategic fit by demonstrating the impact of the transaction on our existing book of business. We have publicly articulated a goal of doubling the top-line contribution from our colocation business and the Telx transaction accomplishes this objective. The combination of Digital Realty's global, large foot data center platform with Telx's robust colocation business will open avenues of growth for well over 1,000 combined customers worldwide. As outlined on page 12, the new combined entity will have enhanced scale, a diversified product mix and a stronger growth profile. Pro forma enterprise value is expected to be approximately $17 billion, and the business mix will be a little over three-quarters large footprint data center, 14% colocation, and 9% interconnection. Turning briefly to capital recycling, we closed on the previously announced sale of 833 Chestnut Street for $161 million or $228 per square foot at a 5.8% cap rate on 2015 budgeted cash NOI. The sales generated net proceeds of approximately $150 million and we recognized a $77 million gain in the second quarter. We also brought a portfolio of five non-core data centers to market during the second quarter and we have recently begun fielding initial bids. We are actively marketing an additional three assets for sale, which are currently in various stages of negotiation. We also signed a key long-term lease renewal with a single tenant in a non-core office building during the second quarter and we will likely begin marketing this property for sale at year end if the tenant does not exercise its six-month purchase option. We also acquired a redevelopment project in Singapore for $45 million. Construction on the redevelopment project is already underway and we expect to deliver the first three Turn-Key Flex data center suites by early next year. Finally, we also acquired a small land parcel in Melbourne adjacent to our existing park for approximately $2 million, although future development on this site will be subject to market conditions. We continue to believe that minimizing speculative development risk translates to healthier data center fundamentals and better returns for our shareholders. However, we are also mindful of our customers' growth needs and we are proactively investing to support their growth, particularly on our campus environments in core markets. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to provide an update on the current data center leasing environment.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Thank you, Scott. As shown on page 14, we signed new leases representing a little over $37 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for over 80% of our second quarter lease signings. Existing customers represented just over 90% of our second quarter leasing activity, and we added 16 new logos in the quarter, bringing the full-year total to 35. Our colocation segment contributed $3.7 million or 10% of our second quarter leasing activity. This was at the low end of the segment's recent quarterly run rate, largely reflecting the success we have had supporting the growth of existing colocation customers and some larger footprint requirements of greater than 300 kilowatts. You may recall that earlier this year, we revised our definition of colocation to less than 300 kilowatts, to better align our sales force with our customers. We haven't traditionally called out colocation re-leasing spreads in our earnings, but it is worth noting that the mark-to-market on colo renewal leases was up 10% on a cash basis during the quarter, and re-leasing spreads were positive on over 90% of the colocation deals we executed during the second quarter. We commenced leases totaling $65 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, a record high for lease commencements. The backlog came down by roughly $30 million as a result from $104 million last quarter to $73 million currently, which you can see reflected in the chart on the top half of page 15. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements also reached a record during the second quarter at 2.5 months, as shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page. Turning to page 16, cash re-leasing spreads were positive on Turn-Key as well as Powered Base Building renewals during the second quarter. We still have a few above-market leases scattered throughout the portfolio, but the overall mark-to-market continues to steadily improve as market rents are on the upswing and we are gradually cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. We leased a total of 21 megawatts during the second quarter, more than offsetting deliveries and explorations and generating 3 megawatts of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool. As Bill mentioned and as you can see from the chart on page 17, the finished inventory balance is down by nearly half since our last Investor Day in November 2013. We remain keenly focused on maximizing the utilization of our existing asset base, but we are also taking steps to be in position to support our customers' future growth requirements, particularly on campus environments in core markets. In addition to our land bank, our investment in shelf space enables us to move quickly in response to demand and meet our customers' needs. Turning now to supply on Page 18, the positive net absorption we have registered in our own portfolio has been mirrored in most major markets. As you can see, Houston is the only major market that registered any meaningful uptick in new supply over the last 90 days. As you may recall, we have limited exposure to Houston at less than 2% of total NOI. In contrast, Dallas and Phoenix, where we do have a more meaningful presence, both tightened noticeably during the second quarter. Face rates have yet to register significant improvement, but the supply situation remains rational in virtually all major markets. Data center demand remains robust, concession packages are firming and net effective leasing economics are continuing to trend in the landlord's direction. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Matt. We reported 2Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.30, $0.05 ahead of consensus estimates. The outperformance during the quarter was driven by a combination of several factors including: $0.02 from successful property tax appeal in the Central Region and the reversal of a property tax accrual due to the lapse of a statute of limitations in the West Region, $0.02 from the early commencement of several large leases upon completion of all landlord obligations and transfer to tenant control during the second quarter, and roughly $0.01 from delayed timing of property operating expenses, asset sales and a somewhat lighter foreign currency headwind. As shown on the next page, however, FX represented roughly a 300 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top line to the bottom line. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy improved 140 basis points sequentially to 93.5% and same-capital occupancy ticked up 10 basis points sequentially to 94.8%. As a reminder, we do expect portfolio occupancy to dip in the third quarter due to a couple of known Powered Base Building move-outs in the Bay Area, before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. As Matt noted in his remarks, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for both Turn-Key and Powered Base Building renewals during the second quarter. We've revised our full year forecast from slightly negative to slightly positive and we are encouraged by the gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio. As shown on page 20, same-capital cash NOI was up 2.8% in the second quarter, squarely in the middle of our 2% to 4% guidance range. However, it is worth pointing out that on a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would be up 5.5%. For the full year, we now expect organic growth to trend towards the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but towards the lower end of the range on an as-reported basis. I would point out that Net Data Centers, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, is a tenant at two of our properties in LA. They remain current on all post-petition obligations and have until September 21 to accept or reject their leases with us or to request an extension of this deadline. While Net Data Centers is still in the process of evaluating its options in future operations, we remain comfortable with our position. Turning now to the balance sheet on page 21, debt-to-EBITDA stood at five times at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and roughly a half turn below our 5.5 times target. As you know, we executed a forward equity offering the week before last to fund a portion of the Telx acquisition. Upon fiscal settlement, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $685 million. I would like to take just a moment to discuss the forward sales agreements. In the interest of time, I won't dwell on mechanics here, but I would like to point out that we have included a slide here on Page 22 that does provide some detail on the mechanics for those who may be interested. I would also like to reiterate that the public offering was executed by forward sales agreements for deal structure purposes. Acquiring Telx at the REIT level rather than the operating partnership level was the most efficient structure. And we were able to facilitate that structure by selling common stock through forward sale agreements. It's also worth noting that the public offering has occurred, that we've locked-in the pricing at $68 per share and net proceeds approximately $685 million, subject only to adjustments for interest and dividends paid and the forward structure does not represent an overhang on our stock. Several of the underwriters borrowed the stock from securities lenders to sell to the equity offering participants. And when the forward sale agreements are physically settled, those underwriters will simply deliver proceeds to the company in exchange for newly issued shares. To be clear, the newly issued shares will not be issued to the public. The shares will be issued to the participating underwriters who will then return the shares to the securities lenders from whom they were borrowed in connection with the public offering. Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to briefly address guidance as well as the financial impact of the Telx transaction which we expect to close later this year. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising core FFO per share guidance by $0.02. A portion of the beat during the quarter is essentially timing-related, particularly asset sales which we still expect to execute and property operating expenses, which we still expect to incur. Similarly, the property tax reversals during the second quarter were one-time in nature. In addition, G&A is trending higher than we previously expected. We also upped the long-term debt issuance assumption in our guidance from roughly $300 million to $700 million, up to $500 million to $1 billion. While we will incur additional capital carry costs, which will depress earnings in the short run, we believe it is proven to lock in long-term capital, particularly in a rising rate environment. I would also like to point out that our guidance remains standalone for Digital-only and does not include any financial impact from Telx. With regard to Telx, we tend to round out our financing for the transaction with a combination of preferred equity and bonds. We expect the Telx acquisition to be roughly 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 and roughly 3% accretive to AFFO per share. We realize we've run long today. So, we'll save Bill's closing remarks for the end of the call. And we'll now open up the lines to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. So I guess this is my first question, Bill, you mentioned the additional uptick in ROIC by 20 basis points after last quarter's more sizeable gain, which means we're probably pushing double-digits now. How should we think about the upside going forward and do you think this metric might plateau a bit from here?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think we're actually in the low 9%s with that. We were at 8% and I think we're now at – if my math is right in my head, about 9.2% – 9.5%. John's giving me the 9.5% sign here.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, pushing 10%.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Pushing 10%. That's right. And obviously, we think that the Telx deal will be [audio skip] (33:31) for the long haul.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as my follow-up, I think there was mention of cycling through the peak vintage expirations now. Could you add any granularity there around the vintage of leases rolling off these days, how many are from the recession era and how might that play into the mark-to-mark pricing strength that you expect going forward?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: We would have to get back to you with that precise data. We don't have that right at hand.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Slide 18 gives an interesting overview of the supply dynamic – supply-demand dynamic. And I wondered if you could qualitatively round out the picture of how you would characterize Europe as well as Asia-Pac. And then my follow-up is just related to the CapEx that you talked about associated with filling up the Telx inventory, the $15 million and the $25 million, I didn't quite understand what that consists of. Is that sales CapEx, meaning cabinets and cages or were there other factors in there? Thank you.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: So, thanks Jonathan for the question. In terms of supply and demand dynamics in Europe and APAC, we're looking at supply and demand dynamics that are roughly equivalent to the report out that we gave last quarter in terms of the supply. The supply characteristics in London remain in balance for us. And we feel that we've got sufficient supply for us to hit the demand on both our Crawley campus in terms of land bank that we've got, as well as shell that we've got available to us in our Woking campus, as well. We continue to have significant supply available to us in land bank in Amsterdam in Europe. And in Asia-Pacific, as Scott mentioned, we recently closed on an acquisition in Asia-Pacific in Singapore, so we continue to have a considerable amount of supply to hit the needs for the demand in that region, as well.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: And then on the CapEx side, Jonathan, yeah, that consists of cabinets, cages, installation expenses and commissions (36:08) those sorts of things.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen - Jefferies: Great, thank you. I wanted to ask about the development pipeline, the size of it's down about $100ish million from where it was last quarter. Just curious about the conscious decision ahead of the Telx acquisition, just trying to kind of save capital, or whether that's you guys being more conservative than just a lack of opportunities for new development.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey John, this is Andy Power. I can speak to that a little bit. I don't think this was anything about saving capital. We kind of looked at funding the Telx acquisition on to itself and have laid out now the equity done and we'll look to go do preferred and bonds in the latter half of the year. Sitting on the Investment Committee over the last three months as a new participant, I think it's just been very focused on getting the timing of our investment as lined up as close to our – where we see demand. I don't think there was a purpose kind of preservation or capital there.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yes, Jonathan, this is Matt. In terms of development pipeline that we've got, you'll notice that we've got about 80% pre-leased in terms of developments that are happening, and we've experienced a great amount of participation in terms of reacting to demand with our just-in-time development. So we think that's working well in our favor.
Jon Petersen - Jefferies: Okay. And then in terms of Telx, I'm kind of curious about the mechanics of integrating that portfolio with, I guess, some of your colocation properties is what makes the most sense. So I guess you could use maybe like 365 Main St as an example. I assume you'll be taking the Telx brand and infrastructure into a facility like that. And so, l guess, the process of doing that and realizing the revenue synergies, is it just buying dark fiber between that and the Telx facility? I'm just kind of – if you could just kind of explain how you go about integrating the Telx platform, kind of maybe you can quantify what the revenue synergies might be.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: So, first of all, a great question. First of all, we're treating it as a line of business, both as an asset or a campus, tethered into our campuses, taking their interconnection hub and connecting it to our data center campuses. And because of the prior relationship as they were a client of ours, we have that already set up in most of the markets out there. So our first stage is connecting that. The second is we've looked at the assets as a combined entity, as a line of business for the product. So for colocation and interconnection products, we want to integrate that, all our legacy colocation properties into the portfolio and productize it. And then we're going to leverage the product expertise they have in colocation and go to market around that and the interconnection and networking services. So the first step is give them basically our capability, integrate it, and then we want to launch it as we were saying on a worldwide basis in the major markets where we can add colocation to their portfolio.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: All right. Good evening, thanks for taking the questions and also thanks for all of that additional disclosure on Telx in the presentation today. It was very helpful. I'd like to ask just about the progress really with your sort of top customers, certainly noticed that the top 20 customer list moved quite a bit, but really saw a lot of progress with some big names here, IBM, which has been sort of continued success story for you, but also LinkedIn and Oracle. I was wondering if you might provide some additional color as to what's going on with some of those big customers. Thanks.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah, Jonathan, this is Matt. Thanks so much for the question. And my team in particular looks at moving amongst those top 20 with great interest as well. We're thrilled to have IBM at the top of the list and, in particular, with regard to the workloads that we're landing with them. I talked a little bit in my prepared statements about the continued persistence of the SMACC-oriented workloads and movement amongst the top 20 is really sort of testament to the ability of Digital's great operational team to be able to provide solutions that match the needs of those SMACC workloads. IBM is a great example of that. A good deal of those workloads happen to be soft layer-oriented public cloud. Oracle also was very happy to break itself into the top 20 this quarter with their public cloud offerings as well. And on the social side, we continued to expand our presence with LinkedIn. What's great about these particular types of clients, Jonathan, is not that we get one-time wins with them, but they have a tendency to be repeat hitters and continue to grow with us, not just in one location, but in all of our portfolio assets throughout the world. So it's a great win for Digital.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Great. And as a follow-up, I'd love for you to maybe give us a little sense as to how we could connect some of the big cloud players you have in terms of the Digital portfolio of customers into the Telx business. You know, one of the numbers that really jumped out was sort of the very limited penetration Telx has to-date in terms of the cloud vertical for their revenue base. I think it was 8%. So I'd be interested to hear how you can match up sort of the Telx asset and value proposition with some of the core customers that you have in your base.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah, Jonathan. Great. It really was sort of, again, testament to the combination of these two organizations making a heck of a lot of sense. Our ability to connect the cloud workloads that we've got in terms of IC core with Telx interconnectivity is absolutely incredible. So if you look at the number, the number of customers that we'll now be able to work together with, over 1,200 customers, to take from Telx's facilities, connect them into our cloud workload, it sort of reminds folks of several of the things I've said on a number of the past earnings calls, which is the hybrid cloud environment and connecting those cloud instances with enterprises is the magic that Digital can bring. And now Digital can bring it faster and better with the combination of Telx.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: And just a bit on two concrete examples of that. If you take their network strength, Jonathan, in markets like Ashburn and Dallas, where we traditionally have folks connecting through other locations into our sites, we're going to go directly and offer that product directly into our sites into the cloud compute engines. So you get the power of what we have in power and compute engines directly connecting into our sites.
Operator: The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Two, if I may. So like Jonathan, just really appreciate the information you guys provided on Telx. Very helpful. I guess, to that point, seems like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit to simply increase the utilization rates within Telx's current facilities and then, perhaps, leveraging off of some of DLR's facilities in those same markets. But when do you think you'd be ready to actually expand the Telx presence internationally? It seems like that's a really big opportunity when you could actually bring it into some of the markets that you're already in, in areas like Europe and in Asia. And then my second question, just more to the guidance. I was wondering if you could just talk about the pacing of speculative leasing. I see that it obviously increased another $10 million in terms of what you're able to write off in the second quarter. But how does that compare to what your expectations were going into this year? Thanks.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Colby, I'll take the first one on global expansion. We are looking to expand globally really in early 2016. Some of the markets that we outlined there as Phase I, London and Singapore and Dublin, are low-hanging fruit for us. And we're doing development projects in other markets. In every single data center campus now, we're building our colocation and interconnection capabilities. So you'll see that expansion start in 2016.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. And, Colby, just really quick on your second one and I'll turn it over to Andy, too. Recall that we raised guidance on leasing last quarter, and we feel real good about the remainder of the year.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Not much more to add to that, Colby. We're on track.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Good evening, guys. Maybe to elaborate a little bit on the sales cycle, I think if I was reading through the release right, two and a half months maybe was the average commencement time between signings and actual commencement. So, I don't know if that was a mix issue or you're just seeing kind of greater demand coming through faster? Any color would be helpful.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. Dave, so in terms – we've had a focus on reducing the gap from book-to-bill for some time. And we certainly think we've gotten to a sweet spot. I think that the 2.5-months gap is a little bit of a mix of customers in this particular quarter. I wouldn't suggest that the 2.5 months will stay that way ongoing, but we should be in a sweet spot in that 2.5-month to three-month range.
Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe Andy or Bill, maybe talk a little bit about leverage and the idea of – I know you issued the equity, but not taking leverage down a little further using the growth profile of Telx here as an excuse to maybe delever and move a little faster on that side of the equation. So thoughts about the asset sale plan and leverage overall would be helpful.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Dave, this is Andy speaking. We feel quite comfortable now that we've got the $700 million approximately of equity off, pro forma for the Telx acquisition, which will likely close later in the year, we are below our 5.5 times target. Based on some of the things we've already said, we do think we're buying a very attractive business with some embedded growth in it. So it spurs some of the EBITDA which will bring us down, as well. But we think the balance sheet remains positioned for growth pro forma for the equity we just raised.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to go back to the accretion that you talk about for Telx, the 1% on FFO, 3% for AFFO. I just wanted to clarify because you talked about a lot of different ways you can check value here, but do those numbers include any of the synergies you talked about on the cost side, the $15 million, and that presumably doesn't include the revenue synergies, but just wanted to clarify on the cost side.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Vin. The synergies that we've underwritten, the 1% and 3% to FFO and AFFO respectively, they include roughly $15 million of expense synergies, of which roughly $10 million flows through our P&L. The other $5 million is really the capitalized items. They do not include any revenue synergies. While we think the revenue synergies could be quite significant as we've already discussed, we have not included them in our underwriting for 2016 financial impact.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the sales force at Telx there, and I know there is going to be some folks leaving at the sort of the executive level. But since the deal has been announced, have you had discussions with some of the key sales guys there and have any sense about what the, you know, turnover might look like as a result of the deal?
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: This is Jarrett, they're a highly qualified team. They're very focused on their community, you know, 95% of it is in five vertical segments. Matt and I are totally aligned on, you know, going after and retaining the top talent and they seem very interested. We're going to give them a heck of a lot to sell. It's going to be a global platform and leveraging the relationships of 1,250 customers now worldwide and also giving them capabilities that only Digital can bring in that community. So, I think the leverage of the two is very, very [audio skip] (48:58).
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. Vin, we've had a great relationship, as you know, with Telx as one of our major customers and with the leadership over there being so ingrained with ours over here, we had a great relationship in the past and we look forward to continuing that relationship a little more directly in the future.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, thank you. Bill, one for you on this deal being a sizeable M&A transaction, particularly, the largest transaction you're overseeing since you're sitting in the CEO chair. It's easy to see the success we're seeing in the colocation and interconnection businesses in particular, and how sort of layering that up over the DLR platform would make sense intuitively. But you're also buying from a private equity smart seller, if you will. And my question is really how do you mitigate the downside? I mean, I want to straight-line the growth here up into the right, like everybody else. But I also want to understand how do you mitigate the downside risk in sort of the near-term to intermediate-term?
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Well, that was obviously all part of the underwriting process. One of the things we looked at was the churn that Telx had. And it was – their customers are incredibly sticky at roughly 0.6%. And the average life of their customers is over nine years. So, while the contract duration is short compared to ours, their customers do stay with them, and that was an important piece of our underwriting in terms of looking at potential downside. We've also – I mean, Matt mentioned that the re-leasing spreads on our colo business were up 10% this last quarter, and that gives us some encouragement as well in terms of how to underwrite the rents on this business. We'd underwrite them as up 10%, I think we underwrote them – I'm looking at Scott here, probably flat. But – he's nodding. But the point is, we're seeing a lot of demand in the colo business and pressure on rents.
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: And I think I would add to that, at a 68.5% utilization rate, all we have to do to protect the downside is maintain that. We have an awful lot of potential growth if we just fill up the space that's already built and available.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. And Jordan, we see our customers coming to us with a multiplicity of demands and now we're able to hit them together. So, I know it's been said before in M&A transactions, but combination of Telx and Digital is better together. We think that the value we are able to hit as one organization will increase the value to our customers and that we'll capture that value here at Digital.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just as a follow-up to that, in terms of reporting structure, I think I heard that Jarrett, you'd be heading up the, I don't know, if with the integration or just heading up sort of the Telx within Digital. But does that include the sales effort or is that going to be managed by Matt?
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, that will include the sales effort. Matt and I are coordinating how to support global accounts. He's got some tremendous relationships. We're working through that process right now. But it is a line of business, and we want to build out the product, keep a focus on those clients and keep serving them, and I think bringing in additional assets into that portfolio capability.
Operator: The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good evening guys. Scott, I think when we were going through the slide deck, you had mentioned that the numbers on page six had come down from when you had previously given them. Was there a specific driver that would bring those potential incremental revenue numbers down?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: No, nothing changed. It was in the heat of pulling everything together quickly, there was an error in the sheet, and so it was just – it was a mistake in the numbers.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then maybe more broadly on strategy, how do you manage the challenge of now offering extremely similar product to what a lot of your customers are offering, sort of a different position than this company has ever been in before?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Well, first, in terms of commitment, we are really focused on serving many of the same clients. We're very focused on the service provider community and strategic channel partners. What we didn't want to do is pivot our company in a heavy enterprise direct focus. So, we've aligned with Matt and the Telx team on really selling through and supporting their strategic channel partnerships. Colocation is very complementary to support the ecosystem, and folks need smaller footprint, so we needed the product and service capability there. But you won't see us getting in the line of business like others, moving into the managed service phase and competing with our customers.
Operator: Your next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Is all of Telx's earnings going to be considered good REIT income, and are you planning on pursuing a private letter ruling to confirm what your beliefs are?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Ross, this is Andy. So, Telx has roughly 49% or 47% from colocation, equal parts from interconnection. The colocation is clear good REIT income, as is the interconnection, and we already have a private letter ruling for the interconnection. There's a small percentage of income, really fees paid on the installations that represents a couple percentages of the revenue that will have housing our TRS and offset by expenses at the TRS to minimize any tax leakage.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to confirm the financing. Your revised guidance in your supplemental talks about a $500 million to $1 billion unsecured debt deal in the second half of this year. Is that independent of the additional what, call it, upwards of $1 billion of bonds you were going to issue to help finance Telx?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So the page in our supplemental, that far right column, that is Digital-only, it has no capital or operating assumptions related to Telx. So essentially, we decided to increase our guidance by roughly $250 million at the midpoint. That incremental debt raised will be used to repay our revolver and hence we'll have a lower revolver balance and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt by the end of the year. As it relates to Telx, separate from what's on the page, the plan is the same. We've completed the roughly $700 million of equity that will close concurrent with the closing of the acquisition. The remainder will be funded with a combination of preferred equity and investment grade bonds.
Operator: The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Hi, guys. I don't know if I missed this in any of the disclosures you've already released. But for 111 8th Ave, are you able to share the terms of Telx's lease or leases with Google? How much remaining term do you have? How do you view your process of retaining that space long term?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: I don't think we have that in the disclosure, but I believe with extensions in 111 8th Ave, it's roughly 10 years remaining.
John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. Have you guys spoken to Google even for your own space, do they seem amenable to renewing those leases or is that a 10-year life there?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: We haven't gone out and try to extend it as part of this process. We made sure we're good from an assumption basis. As we move closer to that expiration, we'll obviously have to evaluate that with Google. And I think Matt has something....
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yes. So Jon, we had had some conversations with Google when they had an interest in expanding their presence inside Manhattan. They've done that in an alternative way, so they may be a little bit more open to the conversation than they were, say, a year and a half ago.
Operator: And the next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to a previous question. But I'm interested in how you're thinking about the, I guess, the – how leverageable the existing Telx sales force is, as we think about expanding the focus to other Digital markets and how we should think about any sort of incremental sales investments there? And then second, maybe for Matt, I'm wondering if you could just talk about what the initial customer response has been to the Telx announcement and any kind of initial impact that's had on the pipeline so far, I guess, if at all. Thanks.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah, happy to answer both of those, Stephen, and if Jarrett's got some extra color, he'd be happy to add that as well. Interesting, inside the sales force at Telx, while they've been primarily a domestic organization right now, they do have an awful lot of sellers with international experience. So, we're excited about that because our intention is to take the incredible assets that Telx has and expand them, expand them internationally. And so, it's good to have some more talent. The second thing is that their vertically oriented sales force is not a regionally – only a regionally experienced sales force, so we'll be able to take that vertical experience and apply it across multiple regions both in North America as well as worldwide. Customer reaction has been fantastic. And in fact we're trying hard to keep everyone calm as we're getting towards the actual closing of the deal because people are interested in having lots and lots of conversations that we're not having until the deal closes, but I can tell you that the customer response has been fantastic.
Operator: Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Bill, maybe we can follow up on the ROIC question from earlier. So, you're running at around, lets call it, 9% for phrase in (59:56) numbers, you're buying Telx at a 12 times or 13 times multiple. And I think your comment was that ROIC would actually go up on that? Maybe I'm just confused somewhere, but it doesn't seem like the math works.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey Manny, this is Andy. I can jump in and help on this. So, we're at 9.3% kind of our NOI, our cash NOI over our total gross investment book value, at first quarter, 9.5% second quarter, that's NOI, not EBITDA. When you look at our underwritten EBITDA, which we've kind of put out there of $148 million and you add back the G&A which you can get from looking at the pro forma that was in our filed 8-K, we see that investment closer to, I think, definitely north of where that 9.5%, so we see it slightly accretive to our existing return on investment. But, again, the other piece of it is we're not buying the stabilized portfolio as well, like when we deliver a development at 10% to 12%, and it's pretty much fully leased. We're buying a business which still have embedded growth and additional cash and upside to continue to grow that return on investment from the initial 20 assets in the portfolio.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks, Andy.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: That makes sense?
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): It does. Matt, just a quick question for you on backlog. So looks like you've had the numbers in 2016 and 2017 come down. Were those just commencing earlier? Why would the backlog numbers, especially in 2017, come down at this point in time?
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Manny, this is Andy again. I'm getting a lot of points (1:01:38) handed off to me today, maybe this is my – because this is my first call. We had some – as part of the script, we had some early commencements. I think two tenants took – we've completed space, finished all of our landlord1 work, and we handed over the space and they took over possession early.
Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: But I still love you, Manny.
Operator: The next question will come from Will Clayton of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could run us through the puts and takes of the Telx EBITDA margin and where you see the most incremental cost synergies being unlocked and how we can think about that margin as you subsequently scale the business. And then I have one more after that.
Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. This is Andy. So, I think the best place to start -- you can look at our pro forma that has the incremental EBITDA or you can take the core EBITDA from the 8-K and divide it by the revenue start. Obviously, on paper, the margin is going to look better because part of leases associated with their space to us get eliminated upon the transaction closing. I think we have to think about increments to it. First piece is the underwriting expense synergies, $10 million of the $15 million will flow through the P&L, so that will obviously be incremental margin enhancement off the bat. We're underwriting to deliver those for a full-year 2016 impact, so we'll work through our execution on achieving that through the end of the year and have that in place for a full year by – come December. And then on top of that, I think that there will be pretty high flow-through revenue contribution as we lease up what we see as an underutilized portfolio that has a significant amount of recently delivered space, and also as we kind of put to work some of Digital's talented team assisting on some of the West Coast assets as well. I don't have a number for you right there because we really – we haven't, in our underwriting, put a firm revenue synergy, but I think that will have a contribution to the margin as well.
Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you for that color. And my second question was, can you provide some commentary surrounding the pace and the success of the capital recycling program to date? And more specifically, how we should think about the impact of capital recycling in the second half of 2015 versus 2016?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: So, I think the pace has been on target. It's been a little slower in some areas because we've pursued some value-add opportunities on a number of these projects, which are now coming to fruition; we've seen a lot of benefit on that. The Kato Road building that we leased up 100% is a good example of that. And the lease extension that we just signed for the single-tenant office building is another great example of that. So, it's taken a little longer, but I think the benefit to our shareholders has been very significant. I think what you'll probably see is that the remainder of the assets will largely be executed by the end of the year from the sales perspective.
Operator: And our final question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Thanks. To the extent that you guys looked at Telx on an asset-by-asset basis, are you able to share what kind of cap rate or EBITDA multiple you assigned to the portfolio's key assets, specifically 56 Marietta Street, 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue?
Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. We didn't really look at it. I mean, we do look at it on an asset-by-asset basis, but we don't really do a full valuation on an asset-by-asset basis. We do projections, rollups for every asset in terms of generating our revenue and EBITDA projects. But we didn't really do a full analysis on each one. I will tell you on Marietta, though, we did spend a little time thinking of what the potential value of that asset might be. And you can get a very interesting array of outcomes on that, and some of which are quite impressive, to be honest with you. And hey, Jon, by the way, I want to get back to you on the 111 8th Avenue lease for Telx. It has an expiration date of 2022 with two five-year renewal options on it. So that takes you out to 2032 there.
John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.
William Stein - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our second quarter 2015 highlights, as highlighted on page 23 of the deck. First and foremost, we picked up another 20 basis points of sequential improvement in our return on invested capital, following the 100 basis points we've delivered over the past five quarters. We tightened the commencement lag from 3.7 months in the first quarter to an exceptional two and a half months. The balance sheet remains positioned for growth with debt-to-EBITDA at five times. We beat the second quarter consensus estimates by $0.05, and we raised 2015 core FFO per share guidance from $5.03 to $5.13 range to $5.05 to $5.15. Finally, we made the exciting announcement entering into an agreement to acquire Telx, a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enabling services. In short, we continue to consistently execute on our top priorities that we set forth early last year and have since updated as the way forward for our company in 2015. We believe we have a unique and competitive footprint that can be leveraged further to the benefit of our shareholders. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter. Once again, I'd like to remind all of you to mark October 6 on your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day. Thank you all for taking the time to participate in today's call. That concludes our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had a solid first quarter, and I would like to begin today by providing an update on the progress that we've made towards our strategic priorities, which you can see laid out on The Way Forward slide on page two in the accompanying presentation. First and foremost, we achieved a 40 basis point sequential improvement in our return on invested capital during the first quarter. This was driven primarily by the burn-off of straight-line rent and consistent lease-up of development projects. This comes on the heels of the 60 basis point improvement that we achieved for the full year in 2014. Given the size of our asset base, we believe that this is a truly remarkable achievement. I should point out that we have likely realized the bulk of the improvement that we expect to recognize this year in the first quarter, and this measure is likely to plateau for the balance of the year. You can be assured, however, that we are not content to rest on our laurels, and we will continue to strive to optimize the return on our asset base and drive greater profitability on every square foot in our portfolio. Of course Scott Peterson will provide greater detail on our capital recycling initiatives in his remarks, but we achieved solid execution on asset sales at very favorable pricing, harvesting capital to fund significantly higher-yielding investments in our development pipeline and enhancing the quality of our portfolio in the process. We now have realized $95 million of gain on three asset sales so far this year. As we stated last quarter, we expect gains on non-core assets sales to more than offset the impairment charges we took last year. And we are well on our way to the tipping point. I'm proud of the job that Scott and his team are doing. The execution of our capital recycling strategy is clearly resulting in steady progress towards our objectives. Shifting gears now to our customers business. It has become clear that the cloud is revolutionizing the delivery of IT across the corporate world. As you know, the corporate enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base, and cloud service providers find our portfolio to be highly desirable, in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. As you've heard me say on previous calls, the attraction is mutual. And our global footprint, high-quality product and proven operating track record represent significant competitive advantages for landing the intersection of cloud and enterprise within our global portfolio. We're also adapting our product offering to accommodate diverse IT workloads, incorporating hybrid clouds and value-added vertical solutions. We aim to deliver what our customers want on a global basis, where they want it and add a value in line with their needs. We are making steady progress and we look forward to continuing to update you as we deliver a more agile deployment method. Moving on to inventory management, as you know, we have made significant headway leasing up our finished inventory and improving the risk profile of our development pipeline in the process. We have reduced our finished inventory balance by 40% since our Investor Day in November 2013. And our active datacenter construction projects, which are expected to deliver stabilized cash yields in double-digits, are currently better than 80% pre-leased. Based on the current positioning of our existing inventory and the strength of our sales pipeline, we are moving forward with new investment in key markets in a disciplined manner. During the first quarter, we began construction on 12 megawatts across Silicon Valley, Chicago, northern Virginia and Dallas. These projects were 52% leased at quarter-end, but now are 90% leased one month later. We are tracking strong demand from new and existing customers in each of these markets and we are confident in our ability to lease up incremental capacity at attractive returns. Turning now to our human capital, as most of you are well aware, we have further strengthened our existing senior management team with three key hires over the past few weeks. As mentioned earlier, Andy Power is our new CFO. We have worked with Andy for more than a decade and we look forward to leveraging his capital markets expertise and relationships in the financial community to support our longer-term growth, while prudently managing our balance sheet. In addition, Jarrett Appleby and Michael Henry recently joined the company as our new Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer respectively. We believe that Jarrett will ensure significant alignment between corporate strategy and operations, while enhancing our ability to deliver the most efficient and effective solutions to our customers. We expect Michael to facilitate the use of information and technology to unlock more value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders. We are confident that new hires of this caliber will serve to deepen our bench and strengthen our culture. With a tailwind of improving datacenter fundamentals at our back and these crucial leadership pieces in place, our entire management team is laser-focused on delivering upon our strategic objectives. With that in mind, let me pause here for a moment to ask that all of you mark your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day on September 15. At that time, we will be prepared to unveil a comprehensive strategic plan which will go beyond the initial objectives that we outlined for you last year. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results. Matt?
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: Thank you, Bill. We reported first quarter 2015 core FFO per share of $1.27, $0.03 ahead of consensus estimates and ahead of our own expectations. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by timing of asset sales as well as repairs and maintenance expense. On a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share was down a little less than 1% from $1.28 in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, however, core FFO per share would have been up a little over 2%. As a reminder, roughly three-fourths of our portfolio is concentrated in the U.S. and we are exposed to non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the pound and euro, on the remaining one-fourth of our portfolio. As I'm sure you're all aware, the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably during the first quarter and our reported earnings were impacted by currency translation swings as shown on page three of the presentation. The strong dollar shaved approximately 250 basis points off the year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and same-capital cash NOI. At the bottom line, FX represents a 300 basis point drag on our year-over-year growth in core FFO per share in both the first quarter as well as full-year forecast. It is worth recalling that we manage currency risk by issuing locally-denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. We are well hedged with less than 15% of net assets denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. In addition, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it enables us to satisfy the international datacenter requirements of global enterprises and cloud service providers, which represents a key competitive advantage. Turning now to page four, you can see the $0.05 impact from the additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the first quarter, represented by the red block. This additional currency headwind has been almost entirely offset by later closing on asset sales than initially projected. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising our core FFO per share guidance by $0.03, entirely due to an increase to our sales plan. The narrowing of the gap to 3.7 months between the signing and commencement date on first quarter leasing, along with a strong start to the second quarter, have already enabled us to hit nearly two-thirds of our initial target for incremental revenue from speculative leasing. Consequently, we are raising the incremental revenue target by an additional $5 million, which accounts for the $0.03 raise to core FFO per share guidance. Incidentally, we have also added two new rows to our guidance table to more clearly spell out the progression of incremental revenue from speculative leasing. We're also introducing core FFO per share guidance on a constant currency basis of $5.18 to $5.28, which represents year-over-year growth of 4.5% to 6.5%. Investment activity will always be a wild card, but going forward, we expect our sustainable growth rate to look more like constant currency guidance than as reported. Turning now to operating performance, same-capital occupancy was in line with previous quarters at 93.4% and we have had success backfilling the very modest vacancy uptick from the first quarter. The total portfolio occupancy decline was anticipated and was flagged on our fourth quarter earnings call. We commented last quarter that we have several known move-outs in 2015 and we expected portfolio occupancy to dip in the first quarter and again in the third quarter before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. The primary driver of the first quarter occupancy decline was a non-tech lease expiration at 1900 South Price Road in Phoenix, which was underwritten at acquisition as a redevelopment project with the expectation that this tenant would vacate when its lease expired. Our cost basis in this property is a little over $100 per square foot and the expiring rent was $13 per square foot. This asset is adjacent to our 2121 South Price Road property and we will continue to monitor market conditions to determine when it may be appropriate to start the next phase on our Phoenix campus. Shifting gears to leasing activity. Cash rents on renewal leases signed during the first quarter rolled down 3% on a cash basis, but rolled up 10% on a GAAP basis. Matt Miszewski will cover releasing spreads in greater detail in his remarks. Same-capital cash NOI was up just 0.6% during the first quarter. As shown on page three of the presentation, FX represented a 250 basis point headwind. And on a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI growth would have been a little over 3%. The same-capital growth rate was also negatively impacted another 80 basis points by a reserve related to pre-petition rent for Net Data Centers, a tenant at two of our properties in L.A. which filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter. Since filing for bankruptcy, the tenant has remained current on all post-petition scheduled base rent obligations and we received May rent yesterday. For the full year, we now expect same-capital cash NOI growth to trend toward the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but toward the lower end of the range on an as-reported basis. Incidentally, we have revised our 2015 mark-to-market guidance from slightly positive to slightly negative on a cash basis. However, this is entirely due to the early renewal of an above-market 2016 lease expiration and not due to any erosion in market rents. To the contrary, we see modest improvement in face rates and meaningful improvement in net effective rents. As you can see on page five, we believe our balance sheet stacks up favorably relative to a Blue Chip peer group. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.0 times as of the end of the first quarter, half a turn below our target of 5.5 times. Proceeds from asset sales received since quarter-end have been used to further pay down debt. We could conceivably take leverage up to six times in a pinch with a clear plan to bring it back down to 5.5. Based on our existing cash flow stream, levering up by one turn would create nearly $1 billion of borrowing capacity. Of course as we continue to grow EBITDA, the incremental cash flow creates additional borrowing capacity as well. We recently gave notice of our intent to redeem later this month the $375 million of 4.5% bonds scheduled to mature in July. We continue to believe the current interest rate environment represents an attractive opportunity to lock in longer-term capital at historically low rates. We will look to opportunistically tap the fixed income market to continue to term out debt in a prudent manner and we will evaluate U.S. as well as non-U.S. currency issuance. Turning now to the chart on page six, the pronounced drop in straight-line rent is one of the key highlights from this quarter's results. The steady downward trend in non-cash rental revenue is a direct reflection of the revamping of our sales compensation program and a more disciplined lease underwriting standards over the last year. We have not traditionally provided guidance on straight-line rent, but the average analyst estimate is approximately $75 million for the full year. We do expect a modest uptick in the quarterly run rate from the $13 million we recognized during the first quarter, but we expect straight-line rent for the full year to come in around $55 million to $60 million, well below the average analyst estimate. This will clearly have a positive impact on AFFO. The CapEx deductions in our AFFO reconciliation are also down from the fourth quarter. I would like to remind everyone of the more stringent classification of the property level CapEx we announced last quarter. I won't go into the ins and outs of the changes in classification, but for ease of reference, we have provided here on page seven the same detailed explanation we included in the deck last quarter when the change was originally announced. The bottom line is that while there's some movement in terms of geography, the change in presentation does not have a material impact on our 2014 AFFO calculation. And the primary drivers of the improvement in AFFO in the first quarter of 2015 includes lower leasing volume and the previously mentioned burn-off of straight-line rent. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to provide an update on the current datacenter leasing environment.
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Thank you, Matt. As shown on page eight of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling approximately $21 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter. We've stated for the past several quarters that there was a distinct possibility the rationalization of our available inventory, coupled with tighter lease underwriting discipline, might impact leasing velocity at some point in the future. That clearly happened in the first quarter. However, we have also maintained that our focus on profitable growth would translate to improved net effective leasing economics, highly targeted capital deployment and better overall returns for our shareholders. That prediction was also borne out in our first quarter results. As Matt noted in his comments and as you can see from the chart at the bottom of page nine, the weighted average lag between signings and commencements was less than four months in the first quarter. In addition, the average return on our first quarter leasing activity hit the high end of our 10% to 12% return expectations and was over 100 basis points better than the average for the full year of 2014. This is a reflection of both our tighter underwriting discipline and overall improved inventory management as well as the continued firming of datacenter supply and demand fundamentals. I'm also pleased to report that the second quarter is off to a strong start and we signed another $16 million in the month of April, bringing the year-to-date total to $37 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our mid-market segment contributed $3.8 million to the first quarter signing volume, which represented 18% of our total leasing activity. This is roughly in line with the recent trend, although the contribution this quarter was at the low end of the $4 million to $8 million range we have come to expect from this segment. I should pause here to point out that we revised our definition of colocation to less than 300 kilowatts to better align our sales force with our customers. As a result, you will see an increase of a little over $20 million in colocation revenue from last quarter's supplemental to the current quarter. Clearly, this is not how we intended to reach our stated objective of doubling the size of this business from 4% to 8% of revenues within a three-year timeframe. We will continue to update you on the progress towards this goal, and we are frankly a bit behind schedule. The mid-market segment has been punching above its weight, but the rest of the pie is much bigger and is also growing. The mid-market segment accounted for most, but not all of the 22 new logos we added year-to-date. We also welcomed a large new financial services customer to the fold during the first quarter. Our business mix was slightly skewed as a result, and social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for a little less than half of our first quarter 2015 leasing activity compared to 75% for the full year in 2014. New customers represented 35% of our first quarter lease signings and existing customers accounted for the remaining 65%. Turning now to page 10, the cash mark-to-market on datacenter lease renewals turned negative for the quarter as the positive cash releasing spreads on Powered Base Building renewals were more than offset by a big turnkey roll down. The primary driver of the negative turnkey mark was an early renewal of a 2016 expiration. On our third quarter call, we flagged a handful of 2016 rollovers in Northern New Jersey as the worst remaining above-market lease expirations within our portfolio. The early renewal we executed during the first quarter enables us to address a significant chunk of that 2016 Northern New Jersey rollover. You can see from the inset chart here on page 10 that while the current year expected turnkey cash releasing spread drops from negative 2% to negative 6%, the expected 2016 mark-to-market improves from negative 12% to negative 2%. This early renewal was with a large and growing customer for an additional five years beyond the 2016 expiration. There is no change to the in-place rent prior to the original expiration date and the transaction did not require any tenant improvements. While we would certainly prefer to see all of our leases roll up at expiration, this is a positive overall outcome and a testament to the strength of our long-standing customer relationships. We leased a total of 11 megawatts during the first quarter, roughly one-third of which was finished inventory although it was offset by deliveries and expirations, so the finished inventory balance ticked up slightly to 25 megawatts. Nonetheless, the balance is still down 40% since our Investor Day in November 2013. Turning now to supply, as you can see here on page 12, we saw some additional positive net absorption in the Silicon Valley market during the first quarter. You can see represented on the chart here some modest new construction underway in the Chicago market over the last 90 days, but on balance, market conditions are generally in equilibrium. The current supply environment remains rational and broadly supportive of continued gradual improvement in datacenter fundamentals. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives.
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Thank you, Matt. As Bill alluded to in his comments, we are achieving solid execution on our capital recycling initiative. We've closed on the sale of three non-core assets so far this year, totaling over $205 million and generating gains on sale of approximately $95 million. The weighted average cap rate on the two income-producing properties was 5.7%. Last quarter, we announced the sale of 100 Quannapowitt, a non-datacenter property in suburban Boston, to a regional investor for $184 per square foot at a 5% cap rate. This sale generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million and we recognized a $10 million gain on the sale during the first quarter. We also sold a vacant former datacenter in Southern California to an industrial developer for $14 million or $206 per square foot. This sale generated net proceeds of approximately $14 million and we recognized an $8 million gain in the first quarter. Last week, we closed on the sale of 833 Chestnut, a high-rise building in Center City, Philadelphia, for $161 million or $228 per square foot at an 8.5% cap rate on our 2015 contractual cash NOI. The sale is expected to generate net proceeds of approximately $150 million and we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $77 million in the second quarter. A portion of this property had been built out as datacenter, but the bulk of the tenancy was healthcare-related, a reflection of a vibrant university research and hospital cluster in the immediately surrounding area. The building was marketed for sale as a medical office building and the buyer was a leading healthcare REIT. Proceeds from these asset sales have initially been used to pay down the balance on our line of credit, but will ultimately be redeployed into our core business, primarily funding our development pipeline. We expect to earn stabilized cash yields in the 10% to 12% range on our development projects which we believe represents a very attractive spread relative to the exit cap – cap rates on our asset sales. In addition to the three non-core properties we have sold to date, we are actively marketing three assets for sale and we expect to bring another five to market as a portfolio package during the second quarter. The rest of the properties targeted for sale are currently undergoing various value-add efforts. We believe this approach will result in better proceeds for our investors, which is the primary objective of our capital recycling program. And now, I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for his closing remarks.
Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Scott. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our first quarter 2015 highlights as outlined here on page 14. First and foremost, we picked up another 40 basis points of improvement in our return on invested capital followed by the 60 basis point improvement we delivered in 2014. We achieved favorable execution on our capital recycling program with the sale of three non-core assets, realizing approximately $95 million of gain on sale and generating $190 million of net proceeds, which we expect to redeploy at attractive spreads. I also want to point out here that the cap rate on 833 Chestnut was 5.8%. I believe Scott said 8.5%. So...
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Oh, did I? Sorry about that.
Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer: The balance sheet remains positioned for growth with debt to EBITDA at five times. We beat first quarter consensus estimates by $0.03 and we raised 2015 core FFO per share guidance by $0.03 based on the strength of our leasing pipeline. And finally, with the remaining critical pieces now in place, the entire senior leadership team is laser-focused on execution. In short, we continue to consistently execute on our top priorities that we set forth early last year and have since updated as the way forward for our company in 2015. We believe that we have a unique, competitive footprint that can be leveraged further to the benefit of our shareholders. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter. Once again, I'd like to remind you all to mark September 15 on your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day. And now, we will be pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thanks. I think you mentioned a few reasons for the reduced lag between signing and commencement, which is great to see. But the press release seems to suggest that it's the robust demand and the shrinking supply as part of the reason. And I want to make sure I understand that element of it. Is it that better supply and demand dynamic gets tenants to commence faster because of the competition for that space? Or is it really the other factors that you mentioned that are driving the shorter time interval there?
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Hey, Vance. I believe that you got it right. Primarily, the demand and supply characteristics are driving folks to do a few things, first of all, to make commitments a little bit earlier than they had before, but also to make sure that they're deploying those ideas in a faster way as well. So that reduced supply and that increased demand that our customers are feeling across the datacenter industry is really helping to reduce that lag.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then for my follow-up, on the 833 Chestnut sold post the quarter, I understand that it was non-core. But do you have a feel for how much of the upside from the building was left on the table? In other words, the 5.8% cap rate based on this year's expected NOI, was it your impression that those numbers were going to grow in 2016 and beyond given the vibrant nature of that market as you describe it?
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: It would grow a little bit in 2016, there's some free rent that's going to burn off, so you have contractual bumps in all of that. There'd been a big expansion from the hospital there which really took up the bulk of the vacant space here, so there's a little bit of upside left there, but really to a large extent, the building was pretty well stabilized.
Operator: The next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about M&A, there's been quite a few transactions happening in this space. Earlier comments that were made seems like you guys are looking to grow your colocation business even faster. As you indicated, you feel like you're a little bit behind. So just kind of curious whether M&A is a solution to this? Or whether you still think you can build it organically to hit your target?
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. As you can imagine, we see all the transactions that are out in the marketplace and we look at and evaluate all of them. We try to judge them by their strategic fit and value to our company as well as whether they represent an attractive investment for our shareholders. We'll continue to judge all future opportunities that way. And certainly, we'll look at every M&A opportunity that's out in the marketplace.
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And Tayo, this is Matt. So in terms of whether we see the growth on the colocation product in inorganic or organic, we see a significant amount of potential organic growth, and so that certainly frees the rest of the company up to make smart decisions on the M&A front.
Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just one follow-up on that point, I mean I assume you guys saw all the transactions that have happened or are going to be happening. Is there anything thematically that made any of those – that made all those acquisitions unattractive to you? Was it really pricing, was it really the product mix?
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. I think generally, if you look at the transactions that have occurred to date, they haven't had a great strategic fit, and we can look at Cervalis as one. It was concentrated in the Northeast, had a lot of financial services customers there, both of which we have a great deal of exposure to between the geographic exposure in our portfolio as well as financial services firms, so it didn't really represent a strategic opportunity for us.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation and available capacity. I know that during, Bill, your prepared remarks and Matt, yours as well, you talked a little bit about inventory. I think you mentioned 25 megawatts of available capacity. But you also mentioned that you had built out or were in the process of building 12 megawatts in four markets, which you identified for us last quarter as markets that you'd be willing to speculatively put capital into, Silicon Valley, Chicago, northern Virginia and Dallas, and that now, 90% of that capacity was leased. So maybe if you could just kind of bring us up to date on your willingness to add speculative capacity to certain markets. And with, I guess, 1.2 megawatts of available capacity from the construction pipeline in those four markets, maybe some perspective on those four markets in particular. Thanks.
Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Jonathan. We try to stay ahead of demand in the markets where we have great visibility on demand. And so, I think you can see us adding a new shell in Northern Virginia. In fact that's under construction right now. We have a site in Singapore as well. It's a redevelopment site. And that will hopefully be delivered by the end of this year or early next year. And so we, as I said, we have good visibility and – because of the partnership that we have with our clients and we try to match their demand around the world.
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And, Jonathan, in the other core markets, we see continued demand, but the uptick of space and demand in Dublin in particular, as well as Amsterdam in Western Europe, become interesting targets but the four that we named really are the priorities with Singapore coming up right up behind it.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Great. I guess as a follow-up, I'm going to ask a different question, but is there a special dividend coming given all the gains on the asset sales? Thanks.
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: Yeah. Hi, Jonathan. This is Matt. I mean we'll evaluate the dividend as we move through the year. But right now, we're not projecting any special dividend at this time. And we'll evaluate it once we get a little through the year and some of the additional dispositions come to fruition.
Operator: The next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. When I look at the first quarter GAAP new lease revenue signings, call it $20ish million, I know you cited that you had an increased focus on return on invested capital. But is that really any different than the focus that you had in, call it, the second half of last year when you were doing, call it, almost double that leasing activity? So I guess I'm just sort of wondering, did anything change in terms of getting even more conservative? Or did everything that you've been sort of working toward the last year start really sort of clicking in a bit more in the first quarter?
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Thanks, Ross. You made the room laugh because I'm the only liberal in the entire organization, so I'm hoping that it didn't tip to being more conservative. In essence, the question you're asking is, is there something that's different in the fundamentals, are the fundamentals potentially weakening? I really and truly believe that that's not true. You saw some of that conviction come through in the revenue-based beat and raise that we put out, but even more importantly, the discipline – the conservative nature of the discipline we do now have has led us to close deals when they're right for Digital Realty and not simply right for the calendar. And so, I'm thrilled that in April we were able to close an additional $16 million in GAAP, bringing the total around $37 million. And I am actually looking at my phone because there's an additional $2 million in GAAP that's in processing right now. So April was another sign that there is significant strength and that strength continues in the market. In addition, I was comfortable, as comfortable as I can be, raising guidance on our incremental revenue from speculative leasing based upon the progress that the team has made to date as well as that shortened lag time between signings and commencements, getting it down to about 3.7 is impressive. I'm thrilled to say that so far in Q1, we've improved that lag number even better. In addition, we've got some better visibility into the year, so I'm able to make that commitment and be comfortable raising guidance on incremental revenue because of that visibility. So the team has been – would I like the Q1 new lease signings number to have been stronger? Certainly. But the team has been successful in shrinking inventory, having 100 basis points improvement on return on invested capital for Q1 as opposed to 2014, and continuing to burn off the old incentives program and lowering straight-line rent I think are some great metrics that show some strength in this industry.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to talk a little more about colo versus wholesale, and I don't want to take – steal the thunder from your Investor Day this fall, but it smells a little like, Bill, you're thinking about making a significant strategic shift here in moving the company away from being sort of a more traditional plain vanilla wholesale player into a datacenter company that's a little more, I'll call it, vertically diversified, if you will, am I going too far that it smells like this is a pretty big strategic change you're thinking about?
Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Well I mean we haven't been 100% wholesale for a while, not since we bought 365 Main. We've had a retail component to the mix, and so I wouldn't say that there's a revolution underway in the strategy. I think there could be an evolution in our strategy. Jarrett Appleby has joined us because he clearly has some deep expertise in that area. And I would expect that we'll be able to generate some additional revenue from new products and services sold to the existing footprint as well as new customers.
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And, Ross, I think it's important to – there's a couple of dynamics that may look to be shifting. The difference in colo and wholesale is one of the shifts to pay attention to, but the new delivery methodology that we're embracing will enable new vertically-oriented solution sets and differentiated IT workloads to land inside our current facilities and inside any of our brand-new facilities with a lot more ease.
Operator: And the next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. We've been hearing more about customers coming in with a wider range of redundancy requirements, which is kind of driving greater variability in base rates and making pricing comparisons a little more difficult. I'm wondering just how much of this you're seeing within your customer base? And how it might be impacting underwriting or perhaps how you look at risk-adjusted returns?
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. So, Matthew, we have seen a number of different requirements come from our customers. Generally, when they talk about them, they'll talk about them in business terms. But the core behind it will be a difference in resiliency that in the past, we haven't necessarily been able to hit. Currently and in the future, we now will be able to hit because – not because of a new product, but because we're deploying an entirely different method as we move forward. So that new deployment methodology will allow us to satisfy our customers' needs with regard to resiliency, whether it be 2N, which is a fantastic business that we have and a fantastic business that we will have going forward, whether it be N+1 on certain components or even in the rare case, that it'll be an N componentry organization that we need to address. The flexibility of our new deployment methodology will allow us to do that. Now there will be some adoption timing, right, so we'd need to build out in this new way and deploy in this new way. We expect the impact to start showing up in the fourth quarter of this year and in early 2016. But it will really enable Digital to finally globally deliver what our clients want, where they want it at a value in line with their needs. And as Bill said in his comments, this is really designed to accommodate these diverse IT workloads that people are now trying to locate with different resiliency requirements, incorporate hybrid cloud in the planning as well as to allow us to address some value-added vertical solutions that we're going to be able to bring to market. So really, this provides the openness and agility that our clients have been asking from us in order to accelerate their growth. So we're really just focused on meeting customer needs.
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Matthew, if I can add to that from an underwriting perspective. We are highly focused on the different requirements that our customers will ask us, particularly you see this a lot in build-to-suits, whether that's increase redundancy or lower redundancy. And we're very focused on – do we have to amortize specialized improvements over the leased term or do we have to expect that we're going to have some capital expenditures at the end of the lease term to raise the quality level of the facility. So we're very focused on it and include it in our underwriting.
Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious if currency volatility is at all impacting your investment decisions in terms of overseas development? And I guess whether we might see an acceleration in European or Asia Pac expenditures to kind of take advantage of the stronger dollar?
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: Yeah. I mean this is Matt. In terms of the currency volatility, I mean, that's what, like we mentioned in the remarks, we're able to hedge our investments in any currency that we've deployed and we'll continue to do that, so we're looking primarily for the best investment return we can because we know that we'll be able to hedge that investment properly throughout the world as we've demonstrated, being 83% plus hedged on all our foreign assets today. So we, again, we look at it from where we can deploy capital and get the best return and because we know that we'll be able to hedge that investment properly and reduce the risk accordingly.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I wanted to go back to the M&A discussion a little bit. There was a reference in the response I think by you, Scott, regarding strategic fit. And I guess I'm curious, as we think about potential investment opportunities going forward, M&A or otherwise, are you guys focused more on product and/or geographic diversity and sort of strategic changes to the portfolio? Or would it be more like the DLR we knew from years past where these were sort of bolt-on accretive acquisitions?
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. There are kind of two answers to that. So I think if you were looking at a more horizontal integration where we bought another datacenter provider that it could be a lot easier to view that as a bolt-on acquisition that might be more financially oriented, although we have to be very careful given the current valuations in the market that we're underwriting the assets that we're getting accurately and keeping in mind all the potential risks that are associated there. I think if you're looking at something that might be considered more vertical, then the discussion focuses initially a lot more on the strategy. And I think if you look at a lot of the trades that have occurred in the market, they've been regionally concentrated, maybe secondary markets, don't necessarily integrate well in our geographic portfolio or their specific assets may not match up as well. In addition to that, you look a lot at the platform and the people that are running it and how attractive are they to your organization and how well would they integrate. Lattices would be a good example of one; great asset, fits geographically, like the company, all the senior leadership team was going to leave and really didn't get a platform with that. And so, I think when you look – everyone's been a little bit different when you look at them, but there hasn't been a really great fit in those sorts of companies that have come to market. And so, it's been more of that than really a valuation argument so far.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. As a follow-up, I guess, for Bill, I mean, how important is accretion today in an investment opportunity given sort of where you are positioned today or how you may want to be positioned as you look at opportunities? Does it have to be FFO accretive? Or how should we be thinking about it?
Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer: We certainly have a strong preference for investments being FFO accretive. We obviously would look at efficiencies that could be achieved, both on the operating side and the capital side, but we do believe that any investment we make for our shareholders should be accretive.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi, guys. Just want to go back to the conversation about some of the more flexible deployments that you're going to be offering in the future here. So I think there was an expectation of some product being available in the third quarter. Just curious if there's anything that you can share with us in terms of demand for that product, if there's any marketing going on yet in terms of what you're going to be offering the market and just how that's being received.
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah, Vince, so a couple of things. We did business requirements gathering on the front side of what I won't call product development, but is a new deployment methodology that we have. So we met with our customers early to figure out if there was a significant amount of revenue on the table that we were missing. And we're clearly satisfied that there was and that there would be a good product market fit for the new solutions that we're bringing to market. So we did that on the front side. And then as we deploy, similar to in software, there's a big of an agile method that we've done in order to get some proof of concepts out, some early thinking on what that design could be. That's what you heard us reference in terms of potential 3Q availability of what we would call internally a new methodology. You're going to see some of that new product hit the market before the end of the year, and then you should see sufficient amounts of it at Q4 and then moving into 2016.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And just going back to the M&A conversation, so we talked Lattices, Cervalis and why maybe those didn't fit strategically. Just curious, Telx is out there, potentially exploring options. Can you talk about the strategic fit there and how that might or might not fit?
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. I think – well, you don't know anything more about the Telx opportunity than we do. There's an article that's been written. There's nothing out there right now to address directly. I think it's reasonable to assume that there's some compelling strategic rationale around that. But beyond that, it's impossible to make any other further comments until there's something to look at.
Operator: Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Matt, maybe just – so that I'm understanding this correctly, you guys did $21 million of leasing in the quarter. But if I look at your backlog commencement schedule, it looks like a lot of that is going to be commencing in 2016 and 2017, and I was wondering how you reconcile that to the 3.7 months average commencement timing?
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: I don't – I mean, I don't think that's – we'll have to go through the details of the backlog because things shift. But like you said, the – since the average lag is 3.7 months, the majority of that leasing in the first quarter we expect to commence this year. And again, that's why we've increased the sales guidance for the year and is what's contributing to our raise in core AFFO guidance as well.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then to switch topics back to 365 Main for a second, the actual 365 Main asset looks like it's been losing occupancy for the last three years. Is there something happening there that's underlying that vacancy increase? Or is something else going on?
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: So 365 Main – first, 365 is a more of a pure play in the colocation market than we have anywhere else in our portfolio, and so there certainly is churn management that they have to do there, that we don't have to do elsewhere. We've also been very happy to see expansions coming in from the existing client base that we have at 365. And then the last piece is that with the installation of AMS-IX and eventually other Open-IX initiatives, we fully expect 365 will be able to take advantage of the new connectivity options that we have there and the new open infrastructure that we have, which will allow for new providers, new content providers that had historically not located within that facility to be able to install inside 365. So we think that while it's a little bit different than our traditional properties, we've got a pretty good plan and we're working that plan pretty well.
Operator: The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I guess first on the dispositions, I appreciate with the cap rate information; we could buy back into it. But I was hoping you could tell us how much core FFO is associated with the properties that you're selling? And then you mentioned, I guess earlier on, John, about softball questions for Jarrett. And I guess I'd throw one out there. And I was wondering, Jarrett, based on where you've worked historically, or at least previously, what are some of the low-hanging-fruit opportunities you see with DLR in terms of transitioning their colocation strategy perhaps a little bit aggressively? Matt mentioned during his comments that they're a little bit behind schedule. Just curious if you see anything that you think could put them back on schedule? Thanks.
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: Yeah. So in terms of the dispositions we've closed to date, that's impacting core FFO around $0.04 for the year, $0.04 to $0.05 in – so that's the impact for this year. And then in terms of full-year impact for what we expect to sell in terms of our total capital plan, it's around $0.07, but that obviously depends on the ultimate timing of the sales of the rest of those properties in that disposition plan.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is that an annualized number – the $0.07, I'm sorry, is that an annualized number of $0.07? Or is that based on the timing you guys have already assumed in your own guidance?
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: Yeah. That's the fiscal year 2015 impact, so it reflects the timing of the sale.
Operator: Our next question...
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Hey, Colby...
Operator: I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I was just going to answer Colby's question, operator. In terms of the second part, just week three into the journey with Digital, one is from a culture side, I think the solutions are evolving. But in the theme of hockey season, go where the puck is going. I've been looking at Digital for quite a long time. And in terms of this opportunity, I'm pleasantly surprised with where the future of particularly the cloud, compute and service providers are going and where they live. So if you look at the Digital Realty campuses, these are really enabling hybrid cloud. And I think there's some great opportunities for connectivity options. I just was on a wonderful tour for the grand opening with Rackspace in the UK and seeing the capabilities there. I hope to apply the knowledge I've had over the last seven years in this space in terms of really driving some of the product engine around the solutions that we have and taking great advantage of the team we have here and the assets. So we'll definitely be working on that this summer as a team and talk about it at Analyst Day.
Operator: The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. It looks like you guys reduced your earn-out contingency on the Centrum portfolio by roughly $45 million in the quarter. Can you explain why this change was so large? And more generally, how has the Centrum portfolio performed the past few years relative to your underwriting?
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: Yeah. Sure, John. I'd be happy to address that. The answer's a little longer than I think you're going to hope for. It really has to do with the structure of the original deal, the accounting treatment of the earn-out. And then finally, I can address the asset performance. But when we acquired the Centrum portfolio, a central component of that was we only paid for the income-producing portions of the portfolio. And so, we paid a multiple based on the EBITDA that was in place. So essentially we got all of the vacant space for free. So a big part of the negotiation was well, how do we come up with a value for the vacant space? And we arrived at this earn-out methodology, which had a three-year tail on it. And there was a calculation as to how we might pay for that additional space as it was leased. So the good part about that is you actually get all that vacant space for free. And now that that earn-out period is expiring in July, whatever hasn't been leased at that point is going to be ours for really zero basis on that within the construct of the deal. From an accounting perspective, we have to have a reserve for the earn-out. So you have to be conservative in the way you run those calculations. And you calculate your reserve based on leasing all of the space. So we had to assume that it all got leased. Well, at this point with it burning off in July, there's no reasonable expectation of any additional events that would give rise to an earn-out payment. So as a result, we were able to unwind that reserve. As it relates to the asset performance, it's performing better than when we acquired it. It's performing better than underwriting. And so we're extremely happy with the performance of it both to date and in the future.
John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, can you speak to supply/demand dynamics in London and your key European markets more broadly?
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: Yeah. So John, the supply and demand characteristics in London are roughly in equilibrium right now, so we're happy with the pricing position that we've got in London. Of course we just launched the Rackspace, as Jarrett mentioned in his comments. We just launched the Rackspace piece in Crawley, UK and we do have some available dirt there as well. Across the rest of Continental Europe, we see consistency with the comments that I just made with regard to supply and demand in the UK, with sufficient balance within Amsterdam, as well within France where we have a small amount of market-ready inventory left. And then a little bit of a distortion in parts of Germany where there is a little bit of excess demand and not exactly enough supply to satisfy the market dynamics there. When you push out to the edge, components of the datacenter industry, there may be a little bit of distortion out towards the edge simply because we – the datacenter industry in Europe as well as the datacenter industry in the United States haven't focused on that over the past decade, but I would expect that picture to clear up in the next five years.
Operator: Our next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I'm wondering if you can maybe help us think through the shape of the year from an FFO standpoint just as you look at what your leasing pipeline looks like, the churn that you talked about in third quarter and the more extended timeline on some of the asset divestitures. And then second, just a quick follow-up on Telx; I'm wondering if you can maybe just comment on how you view any potential risk to that relationship if that asset were to fall in someone else's hands. Thanks.
Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance: Yeah. So this is Matt. In terms of the FFO outlook for the year, I mean yeah, as we noted, we overachieved on even our expectations for the first quarter. And as we noted, a lot of that was due to disposition timing as well as some timing on repairs and maintenance. So as that pushes out as evidenced by 833 Chestnut, which sold in the second quarter, along with some catch-up on some R&M that wasn't spent in the first quarter, we're looking at the second quarter as well as some additional G&A that usually comes as a result of some of the board grants that are issued and vest immediately and that usually happens annually in the second quarter. We're expecting a slight downtick in the second quarter and then sort of a hockey stick from there as all the backlog leasing kicks in and the rest of the speculative leasing that we expect to – expect to sign commences. So we're looking at accelerated back half of the year.
Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing: And, Stephen, with regard to your question about what that shape of the pipeline looks like, we can give you advanced look of shape of the pipeline in our Large Enterprise segment and the square footage – it seems that just about once a year, I update this, the square footage existing in the pipeline for Large Enterprise sales remains roughly equivalent to what it was about 12 months ago. But we did of course add additional streams of income, including the mid-market attack and colo products. So we see some potential improvement, especially over Q1 as we move forward. That visibility was part of what allowed us to beat and raise. And then the last piece is that with some of Jarrett's involvement, we've been able to uncover and unlock certain additional cash performance that should help us to increase revenue per square foot in the existing portfolio that we have. So the shape – if this was the State of the Union, I would say the State of the Union is strong.
Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer: And on the last point, first of all, Stephen, I'd like to compliment you on getting three questions in on your one question there. But the last one on Telx, we don't view that somebody else acquiring them poses a significant risk. That relationship and economics are governed under contracts and we view that as being an extension of the status quo.
Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. The Digital Realty first quarter 2015 earnings conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Questions will be strictly limited to one plus a follow-up and if you have additional questions, please feel free to jump back into the queue. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.
Bill Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us. We had a very good year in 2014 and I would like to begin today by providing a quick update on the steady progress we've made towards our 2014 strategic initiatives shown here on page 2 of our presentation. First and foremost, we made significant headway leasing up our existing inventory during the fourth quarter. The improved utilization of our existing asset base has contributed directly to a meaningful uptick in our return on invested capital, which is up 60 basis points over the last year. Given the size of our asset base, this is a remarkable turnaround. Scott Peterson will provide greater detail on our capital recycling initiatives in his remarks, but we have completed our comprehensive portfolio review and have identified assets that no longer fit with our strategy or investment criteria. As disclosed in our press release, we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter on three underperforming properties to write them down to their estimated fair market value at year end. As we stated last quarter, the bucket of non-core assets includes some winners and these three properties are clearly the losers. But on balance, we continue to expect to recognize gains at least on par with any impairment charges or losses. We began marketing for sale the first few non-core assets late last year. During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of one small investment and subsequent to year-end, we closed on the sale of a non-data center building in suburban Boston. We have clear line of sight to reaching the low end of the range for our dispositions guidance and we remain pleased by the execution we're achieving on the sale of our non-core assets. The implementation of our capital recycling strategy is resulting in steady progress towards our objectives. The global alliances program concluded a successful year in terms of adding demand to our sales team's funnel. The channel program alone added $3 million of mid-market opportunities in the latter part of the year. In addition to expanding our global cloud marketplace to include a broader array of cloud service providers, we have also expanded our cloud connect product to include services from partners such as Zayo to enable our clients to immediately connect their hybrid cloud. We saw the first orders for this new product within weeks after rolling it out. We're also seeing demonstrable demand from our alliance partners to leverage their sales force against the Digital Realty product offering. As you know, the enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base and cloud service providers find our portfolio to be highly desirable in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. But this attraction is mutual and our global footprint, our scale and our cost structure represent significant competitive advantages for landing the intersection of cloud and enterprise within our global portfolio. Moving on to inventory management. We pulled in the reins considerably on speculative development in 2014. As mentioned, we've made good headway leasing up our finished inventory and as our stockpile has dwindled, the risk profile of our development pipeline has decreased. As you can see from the development life cycle schedule on page 34 of our supplemental, our active data center construction projects are currently 83% pre-leased. Given our position of relative strength, we're comfortable today building out small increments of capacity without a signed lease in a handful of select markets where we have clear visibility on demand, primarily Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago and Singapore. Turning now to our human capital. As previously announced, Jim Smith and David Schermacher will switch roles effective March 1. This rotation provides an opportunity for the further development of both of these talented executives. I also believe that the new roles will play to their respective strengths. I expect Jim Smith, whom many of you know, to excel in a more customer-facing role. Conversely, no one in the organization is better situated to understand our clients' evolving technical specifications than David Schermacher, the current head of our technical operations group. Our traditional Turn-Key design has served us well, but there's no reason we can't endeavor to improve upon our existing product offering and potentially reach an even broader addressable market. Neither Jim nor David will be married to existing processes or cost structures and both will bring a fresh perspective to their new responsibilities. I'm incredibly optimistic that each will be able to unlock significant value for our shareholders. Likewise, I'm pleased to announce that Krupal Raval, whom many of you also know, has been appointed to the post of Senior Vice President of Finance for the Asia-Pac region, effectively functioning as our regional CFO. He began his new role in Singapore on January 1 and has already begun to have a positive impact. Finally, let's turn to the macro outlook laid out on page 3 of the presentation. Rough three fourths of our portfolio is concentrated in the U.S. and the domestic economy remains a relative bright spot on the global landscape. Clearly, the drop in the price of oil and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar are the most significant macroeconomic developments since our last call. In short, while GDP growth is beneficial to IT spending, data center demand drivers are secular in nature and demand continues to significantly outpace GDP growth. The positive net absorption we have registered within our portfolio has been mirrored at the sector supply level and landlord leasing economics are consistently improving. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives.
Scott Peterson: Thank you, Bill. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of a small investment we made a little less than two years ago in a developer of data centers in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. We invested approximately $17 million and the sale generated net proceeds of roughly $32 million. Given our comparatively short holding period, we generated an unlevered IRR just over 50% on this investment and recognized a $15 million gain on sale in the fourth quarter. Since this was a gain on investment, rather than a gain on the sale of previously depreciated real estate, the gain is included in NAREIT defined FFO although we have backed it out in our presentation of core FFO. In the execution of our capital recycling program, our team has been focused on maximizing proceeds for shareholders. We've allocated two investment professionals who typically work on acquisitions to oversee this process. On our third quarter earnings call, we announced that we had identified an initial pool of nine assets for disposition. Of these nine properties, one has been sold, two are in advanced contract negotiations, one property was 100% vacant when identified, but our team now has it fully leased and it will be marketed within the next few weeks. The remaining five properties are undergoing similar value-add efforts which we believe will result in better proceeds for our investors. During the fourth quarter, we determined to bring an additional eight properties to market. Once our business plan changed from hold to sell, three of these properties no longer cleared the impairment accounting recoverability test and we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write these three properties down to their estimated fair market value as of December 31. While conditions are always subject to change, we do not expect our capital recycling program to result in any additional impairment charges at this time. Of these next eight properties, five will be brought to market in the coming quarter, two need some additional leasing and the final property will likely be sold to a user if they continue to pursue it. We closed on the sale of our first non-core asset, a non-data center property in suburban Boston, subsequent to year-end. We sold this property to a regional investor for $184 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million and we expect to recognize a $9 million gain in the first quarter. We reported last quarter that leasing activity on non-core properties had picked up considerably over the preceding 90 days. I'm pleased to report that we were able to finalize signatures on several key leases during the fourth quarter. You may have noted from our supplemental disclosure package that recurring capital expenditures were up significantly in the fourth quarter. This was almost entirely due to leasing costs on these -- on the two leases at two non-core, non-data center properties, one in the Mid-Atlantic and one in the Bay area. These two leases represent approximately $4.5 million of annual NOI and the average lease term was over 10 years. This leasing activity should generate significantly greater proceeds for our shareholders from the sale of these two non-core properties. And now for a real-time update on data center leasing dynamics, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski.
Matt Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As shown on page 4 of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling approximately $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Mid-market revenue accounted for over 10% of our leasing activity and this marks the fifth consecutive quarter that our mid-market segment has delivered a consistent contribution of between $4 million and $8 million. This segment has had the intended effect of smoothing out some of the traditional lumpiness in our quarterly leasing activity and we're making steady progress towards our goal of doubling the size of this business from 4% to 8% of revenues within a three-year time frame. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content were the major drivers of our leasing activity throughout 2014 and the fourth quarter was no exception. These workloads accounted for nearly 75% of our fourth quarter lease signings. In addition, existing customers accounted for nearly 90% of our lease signings again in the fourth quarter, but we also added 21 new logos in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 100. Turning now to page 5. Cash rents on renewal leases were positive on average with a slight roll-down on Turn-Key leasing offset by positive cash re-leasing spreads on power based building renewals. The chart on page 6 puts our full year lease volume in perspective. And while Turn-Key rates shown here at the bottom of the chart can be skewed by geographic mix in any given quarter, the full year results clearly tell the tale of a market rent trough in 2013, followed by the beginning of a recovery in 2014. In addition to leases signed, lease commencements were likewise healthy. In fact, 2014 was a record year for lease commencements. The weighted average lag between signing and commencement held steady at five and a half months and has settled consistently in the six month range for the past six quarters. We leased a total of 20 megawatts during the fourth quarter, almost half of which was finished inventory. And we generated 9 megawatts of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool during the fourth quarter. As you can see here on page 7, we have made steady progress towards our objective of leasing up existing inventory. Most notably, we shrank the finished inventory balance in Phoenix by 4 megawatts during the fourth quarter. We now have just 2 megawatts of inventory remaining in Phoenix, a dramatic reduction from 11 megawatts as of our Investor Day in November 2013. At the portfolio level, we now have 23 megawatts of finished inventory remaining, down 45% since Investor Day. Going forward, it is entirely possible that the reduction in our stockpile of available inventory coupled with tighter lease underwriting discipline may impact leasing velocity in future periods. However, we remain confident that our focus on profitable growth is translating to improved net effective leasing economics and better returns for our shareholders. Turning now to supply on page 8. You can see graphically here what we mean when we talk about the rationalization of supply in the data center industry. We have consolidated the third quarter supply snapshot on the same page as the fourth quarter, which visually highlights the sharp reduction in availability within the Northern Virginia market. The absorption of sublease space in Northern Virginia has been well-documented, but sublease availability in Silicon Valley came down a bit during the fourth quarter as well. A portion of this was the block in our Santa Clara portfolio, which we alluded to on our second quarter call. We successfully negotiated a lease termination fee from the existing Internet enterprise tenant and we were able to immediately re-lease the space to a cloud service provider. The existing lease was a power based building structure, but the space had been highly improved by the former tenant and we were able to re-lease it at Turn-Key rates. We will have to invest some of our own capital, but we expect to generate a very attractive return for our shareholders on this transaction. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results.
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Matt. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Digital Realty celebrated its 10th anniversary as a public Company. So I'd like to start here on page 9 and take this opportunity to recap the track record we've established. Over the last 10 years, DLR has generated annualized total returns of 22%. This is the single best performance in the REIT universe over this time frame and represents over 1400 basis points of annual outperformance relative to the RMS. We have generated mid-teens compound annual growth in both dividends and FFO per share from 2005 to 2014. We have also generated positive growth in both dividends and FFO per share every single year. As represented in the chart on the top left of page 10, Citi Investment Research recently published a report titled Don't Forget About Those Dividends and identified Digital Realty as having generated the second highest compound annual growth in dividends per share within the REIT industry over a seven and nine year period. Perhaps even more importantly, this growth has been achieved with a low volatility. We're one of only 10 REITs among the 140 constituents within the RMZ to have increased the dividend each and every year since 2005. This is a track record that we believe warrants a Blue Chip valuation rather than the discount by almost any measure as shown on page 11, at which we trade relative to the REIT universe. Similarly, moving on to page 12, we believe our balance sheet stacks up favorably relative to a Blue Chip peer group. It's worth noting here that debt to EBITDA improved another 2/10 of a turn in the fourth quarter to 4.8 times. I would also like to point out a change to the balance sheet presentation as of December 31, 2014. Five assets have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet related to our disposition program as Scott discussed. While we're in various stages of the disposition process on a broader group of assets, these five were the only ones to meet the requirement to be classified as held for sale as of year-end. The accounting treatment is to collapse the net book value of these assets and liabilities of the properties held for sale into their own lines on the balance sheet. Divestitures aside, our investment grade credit ratings are supported by the diversification of our customer base as well as our geographic footprint. As shown on page 13, our exposure to the current hot spots is manageable. We do have exposure to net data centers, formerly known as Net2EZ. However, we believe their operation at our El Segundo data center less than two miles from their headquarter is significantly cash flow positive. In addition, Net2EZ represents less than 1% of our total revenue. We have judiciously avoided exposure to Bitcoin mining credit. So we do not expect to see any impact to our customer base or rent role from the drop in the price of Bitcoin. We view the energy sector as attractive in the long run and we have identified it as an underpenetrated target vertical. Oil patch customers currently represent less than 2% of our total revenue stream. However, though we have limited exposure in the near term. Similarly, we like the Houston market in the long run, but there's little doubt that the regional economy will be negatively impacted from the drop in the price of oil. Our exposure is limited, with less than 1.5% of our portfolio concentrated in Houston. In terms of oil, the direct impact on our cost structure from a $10 swing in the price of a barrel of oil is considerably less than a penny per share. Moving on to foreign currency. As Bill mentioned in his remarks, the U.S. represents roughly three fourths of our portfolio. We're exposed to non-U.S. dollar currencies on the remaining one fourth of our portfolio. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of reported earnings, however, we're exposed to currency translation swings, primarily in the pound and euro. We indicated in early January that foreign currency translation was expected to represent an earnings headwind of a little over 1% and the dollar has strengthened further since then, particularly against the Euro. It is important to keep in mind that while having a global portfolio exposes us to currency risk, it also enables us to satisfy the international data center requirements of global enterprises and cloud providers, which is a key competitive advantage. We remain comfortable reiterating core FFO per share guidance within a range of $5 to $5.10. However, if the dollar continues to strengthen and if we prove unable to collect rent from Net2EZ for the remainder of the year, then we would likely be trending towards the low end of the range. It is also worth noting that we expect the quarterly distribution of core FFO to be back end weighted, with the split roughly 48 to 52 between the run rate in the first half and the latter half of the year. Moving on to operating performance. Portfolio occupancy ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially to 93.2%, the third consecutive improvement in occupancy. We do have several known move-outs in 2015, however, primarily power based building expirations on the West Coast. And we expect portfolio occupancy to dip in the first quarter and again in the third, before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. Our leasing activity's off to a good start in 2015 and we have whittled the incremental revenue from speculative leasing embedded within our forecast down from $25 million to $30 million in early January to $20 million to $25 million as we speak. This progress is one of the primary variables that gives us comfort reiterating guidance despite the foreign currency headwinds. I would now like to take a moment to highlight some of the further disclosure enhancements we've made this quarter, as detailed on page 14. First of all, we have broken out construction in progress and land held for development on the face of the balance sheet. Second, we have provided new net effective rent disclosure on the leasing activity pages in the supplemental. Third, we have disclosed IT load by property for the first time in the supplemental. Although please be sure to note we have presented IT load only for Turn-Key and colocation data centers, not for power based building footprint. Fourth, we have also slightly rearranged our joint venture schedule to make it easier to arrive at cash NOI. Fifth, per NAREIT's request, we have included FFO guidance under the NAREIT definition in addition to our measure of core FFO. And finally, beginning in 2015, we will present a more stringent classification of property level CapEx. The puts and takes of our prospective CapEx reporting are laid out on page 15 of the presentation. The upshot is that we will strip out all property level capitalized expenditures from the enhancements and other non-recurring CapEx category, which will then be comprised solely of capital spending on our network fiber initiatives and software development costs, primarily our DCIM or data center infrastructure management solution. This category previously included approximately $25 million of capital spending that has been deemed to be either discretionary in nature or related to non-core properties and has been cut out of the budget all together. Roughly $40 million consisted of infrequent expenditures for capitalized replacements and upgrades which for all intents and purposes amounts to property level spending that should be classified as recurring CapEx. Conversely, recurring CapEx previously included approximately $25 million of first generation leasing costs which should be classified as development spending. Taking a step back, it's important to note that we're not making any changes in accounting policy. These costs have always been and will continue to be capitalized to the basis of their respective building. We're simply adopting a more conservative approach in terms of the categories of capital spending that we deduct from FFO to arrive at AFFO. We hope that you find these disclosure enhancements to be helpful. We aim to continuously improve the transparency of our financial disclosures and as always we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our 2014 highlights as outlined here on page 16. We leased a total of 67 megawatts last year, including 28 megawatts of finished inventory and we reduced the finished inventory balance by 20 megawatts. We improved our return on invested capital by 60 basis points. That does not include the benefit of impairments, by the way, which boosts ROIC by another 10 basis points. We reversed the declining occupancy trend and finished the year up 60 basis points on the heels of three consecutive quarterly upticks. Same capital cash NOI grew 4% and we reached $1 billion of NOI. We put up 7% growth in adjusted EBITDA, 6% growth in FFO and 4% growth in FFO -- in core FFO, despite terming out over $850 million of long-term capital and selling or contributing properties that generated over $20 million of NOI. We further de-leverred the balance sheet and brought debt to EBITDA down from 5.4 times to 4.8 times. We closed out the year with a $0.03 beat in the first quarter and finally, we delivered a 41.6% total return to our shareholders, outperforming the REIT index by 1100 basis points. In short, 2014 was a very good year in terms of consistent execution on the strategic initiatives that we laid out early last year. We have work yet to be done, however and we will continue to update you on these objectives. In addition, we will look forward to sharing with you our top priorities for 2015 on our first quarter call. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who are responsible for delivering the success we achieved in 2014. And now, we will be pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut: The results look pretty solid here and I thought the commentary about renewal pricing in the fourth quarter was very positive. I think it was up 6% on a cash basis. But when I take a look at your November deck and your expectations for GAAP and cash rent renewal rates for the full year, it seems like the full year numbers came in a little bit lighter than you were anticipating in November. I was wondering if you might walk us through some of the puts and takes as we look at that presentation versus what happened at the end of the year. Thanks.
Matt Mercier: We continue to see market rents improving long-term and all of that is driven really by a more rational supply level as we walked through in the deck in the introductory remarks. We've talked over last year and during the last presentation about some of our above market leases. The majority of those -- important to remember, the majority of those above market leases have now been resolved. We expect in 2015 that those renewals will roughly be flat. It's important to remember and we want to make sure we talk about this, that some -- there are some above market lease exposure that we do have in 2016. But if you look back at FY14, it was down about 0.9% and in Q4 was up about 0.3%. So we expect that the market rent improvements over 2015 -- in 2015 will help to mitigate our exposure and that goes back to our belief that the fundamentals in the industry are truly improving.
Jonathan Schildkraut: And as a follow-up then, just to confirm, looking at your guidance from the beginning of January to now, in both cases you guys are talking about positive rent roles on a cash basis. So you continue to be somewhat positively disposed to spot rate pricing. Wondering if you've seen any change in the marketplace between then and now, about six weeks' time period. Thanks.
Matt Mercier: In terms of January to now, I don't think we've seen any fundamental changes. We continue to see the fundamentals improving and we expect a slight improvement over the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. Related to that last point, I just wondered about spot pricing and on a like for like basis, are there any differing trends that you're seeing by region for similarly sized requirements, say six months ago, 12 months ago, versus right now? And then on the mid-market growth, I wondered how much of that growth that you quantified came from new logos.
Matt Mercier: We do see some regional performance dynamics, stability in Northern Virginia, moderate to or slight to moderate improvement in Chicago and in Dallas. And in Asia-Pac, we see strong cash indications that our investment in Asia-Pacific in particular in Singapore and Hong Kong continue to have an upward trend for us. We see that stability. I think in my opening comments, I made some remarks about both the amount of revenue that we see from existing and repeat customers, seems to be relatively stable around 90% from quarterly -- in terms of quarterly performance. And then we did add 100 new logos last year, which we think is a good coupling of growth from our existing client base and then new logos coming primarily from our mid-market efforts.
Jonathan Atkin: Right. And then the tenant type, there's a pie chart at the bottom of page 13 of the presentation and I just wondered, is there any particular vertical or type of tenant that you would see yourselves indexing more towards in the future?
Matt Mercier: Yes. So we try to think about it in terms of workloads for us and in workloads I covered a little bit about smack workloads. I do get entertained by the guys around the table here today using the word smack, but it's social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content. We continue to see a significant amount of additions from each of those workloads. We do have a vertical focus as well. When you talk about the areas where we're incredibly strong and dominant, financial services continues to be one of those great verticals for us, both across the large enterprise space but also starting to pop up a little bit more in the mid-market space as well. And then traditionally our IT Telco and cloud verticals remain extremely strong. You did hear a little bit of a mention of oil and gas in the preparatory remarks and energy all up. We consider ourselves to be underpenetrated in that vertical, but some of the activities and macroeconomic effects that are happening right now will tend to tip some of those folks to think a little bit differently about their data center deployment. And we would certainly expect that they would look at a provider like us as a way to resolve some of those interests. And then healthcare, I would consider an underpenetrated vertical for us as well. And in healthcare we've seen a significant uptick last year and that continues again in Q1 this year. One of the verticals, our intention is to go after more penetration through our partner activity is the public sector vertical, which I've got a personal interest in. We've got some fantastic partners including Carpathia that is just one of the partners that we intend to go to market through to help us over-penetrate that vertical.
Operator: The next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson: Could you give us your views on the recent Telecity merger announcement in Europe and whether that has any effect on your European strategy? Were you thinking of stepping up your European colocation presence there and might this news open any doors in that regard? Or do you see yourself as more conservative when it comes to any type of expansion or the evolution of this strategy in Europe?
Scott Peterson: Yes, Vance, this is Scott. My first comment will be regarding the announcement. We clearly -- we track all the public and private companies in our industry and we're going to continue to monitor this closely. Clearly, consolidation is appropriate as our industry evolves. I'm not sure if anybody wants to handle -- I don't think we're really thinking this is going to change our strategy and our penetration in that region at this time.
Vance Edelson: And then as my quick follow-up, with the pendulum swinging some between build to order, which you mentioned a few months ago you had transitioned to and now you're comfortable building out in small increments I think you said without a signed lease and in certain markets, is the pendulum going to swing more in that direction do you think in that more cities could become attractive for speculative builds? Or do you think this is just a near term opportunity and build to order becomes more dominant again going forward?
Scott Peterson: I think that given our abilities to shorten up the delivery time frames that build to order will continue to be a very significant part of our portfolio. But having said that, we're constantly evaluating markets for speculative development potential and as Bill said right now, there are a handful of markets that are appropriate. If you were you to track that over time, you would see that it has changed and evolved over the past several years. So we continue to revisit that on a regular basis and we look at the supply and demand and investment potential in these markets. A we will make determinations as to where speculative development is appropriate based on our evaluation of those opportunities.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Just wanted to go back to the question on the same capital growth, 4%. I think that was expected to be more like 4.5% to 5.5% as of last quarter. Just curious, is that mostly just FX headwinds that caused you to miss on that front, or was there something else going on? And just as a corollary, since the dollar has strengthened some more, there might be some puts and takes on other line items in the guidance, but does that suggest that you're tracking towards the lower end of the range for same capital growth for 2015?
Scott Peterson: So in terms of 2014, we're obviously pleased with our 4% growth in same capital cash NOI. There was a little bit of FX headwind in the fourth quarter as well as some additional unanticipated expenses, primarily some non-routine generator maintenance at some of our properties in the same capital pool that contributed to the -- to missing what we had expected. But again, we're pleased with the 4% growth for 2014. In terms of 2015, we do conservatively budget and forecast for currency. We typically have a little buffer between where rates are when we go through our process and take a little haircut off of that. I would say at this point we're still comfortable with that range. But as we said overall, in terms of all the guidance metrics that if rates continue to deteriorate, that would obviously have an impact and push us down towards the lower end of the range.
Vincent Chao: Just going back to the disposition, I think last quarter the first nine assets, first bucket was talked about in the $260 million range. I think that was potentially to be sold in the fourth quarter. Just curious, should we be thinking about that $260 million on top of the current guidance for 2015 of $175 million to $400 million or is that just blend into the $175 million to $400 million for 2015?
Scott Peterson: It fits in that number, the $175 million to $400 million.
Operator: And the next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Just in regards to the leasing activity during the quarter, just a lot of it was non-technical space. Just curious what exactly that was.
Matt Miszewski: The non-technical space was primarily office space and I think we covered a little bit of the detail of that in the introductory remarks.
Matt Mercier: Scott talked about that related to the -- sorry, this is Matt, the other Matt. Scott talked about that related to some of the assets that are on our disposition list. So that relates to some leasing we did at some of the non-core, non-data center assets and related to some of the recurring capital that was talked about as well.
Operator: And next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Just two related -- a question and a follow-up. So as relates to the product innovation and connectivity, I was wondering if you can just give us an update on your current thinking there, perhaps what's evolved in terms of how you're thinking about building out that product set. And then the second question, a follow-up to that, as it relates to the mid-market success, I was wondering if you could talk about what particular locations you're seeing the most success with that right now. Thanks.
Bill Stein: This is Bill. We clearly had very good success for what is known as our 2N product which is our current offering and that's demonstrated by the very strong leasing results we've had this past year. But we also continue to evaluate the best ways that we can provide solutions to our customers' needs. And as needs change, we remain committed to partnering and providing the best solutions possible to meeting those needs. So to sum it up, we would see -- I think what we're going to have two products out there, where one would -- actually, we could have a range of products, but we're going to have our traditional 2N product. We will be designing something that provides the flexibility to offer different levels of redundancy.
Colby Synesael: And that would be through a partner?
Matt Miszewski: Part of your question was I think regarding cloud and connectivity, the ecosystem products that we continue to work very closely on. I would say that you will see a heightened focus in 2015 on cloud connectivity products, both products that we manage directly as well as products that are managed by some of our fantastic partners that I mentioned as we move forward. And then our ecosystem and our Open-IX initiatives continue to be well underway and are seeing a great deal of success. And we now landed open Internet exchange operations on both coasts. In fact, in the 365 main in the most recent installations in 365 main, we've now connected 17 customers directly, 14 of them are in provisioning rights now and nine are pending agreements. And these are the names you would expect, Netflix and the like. So while we talk about that Open-IX initiative being long-term, we're starting to see the rhythm really pick up. And then Bill and I talk on a regular occasion with folks who provide advanced services such as remote peering and that's really an option that could help to accelerate or speed up that transition. So we're thrilled to see further adoption of our ecosystem products, Open-IX initiatives that we do through partners and then we will see some additional products moving forward. To get to your mid-market question, there's a couple of answers to that. But our best performance from a regional perspective is currently coming out of our West Coast team and I know they're listening to the call, so hopefully they just cheered downstairs a little bit. But the West Coast team is doing a pretty good job of performance. In terms of where that is landing, we're seeing a little bit of a mixture of landing places, both in the west, but also our fantastic asset management portfolio and sales teams in the Northeast have been doing a continual great job in the Boston and surrounding markets as well.
Operator: Next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Question regarding the recent consolidation that we've seen. So interaction in Telecity and Latisys recently, thoughts on the future, any uptick? This uptick in consolidation, do you think we will see a little bit of a land grab here? Do you think we will see further consolidation across the space as folks look to maintain or increase market share?
Matt Miszewski: We obviously looked at lattices. I think what you will see, what I think you're going to see is a fair amount of private companies that come to market. The public companies have some unique factors. And those factors are basically multiple related and cultural related. And you really I think need to have both to make it work and so it makes it really hard to predict what's going to happen on the public front. But I do think that with the stock price is recovering in the public sector, you're likely to see more private portfolios come to market and the public companies would have bids for those assets. Scott, do you have anything to add?
Scott Peterson: I think that's spot-on. I think as you see the industry evolve, you see companies trying to expand their product and service offerings for their customers as well as their geographic footprint. So I think you will see that and I don't know if that would qualify so much as a land grab, if you will, but I think it's trying to be a more integrated solution offering to their customers. And I think it's probably, as I said of before, I think it's a reasonable thing to expect as this industry continues to evolve.
Matt Mercier: Jordan, I think you've got unanimity amongst the senior leadership team here at Digital, that we look at everything that happens in the industry, but there's two driving components. There has to be strategic fit. If there's strategic fit, it's something good to look at. But then the economics have to make sense for everybody as well and I don't think we've seen that alignment yet.
Bill Stein: Said differently, we're not going to do a deal just to get bigger. There has be a strategic rationale for it as well.
Jordan Sadler: Along those same lines, Bill, strategically you spent 2014 taking up inventory successfully, leasing quite a bit of it, improving the return on invested capital. What do you foresee and what's the strategic plan for the balance sheet going forward? Do you stay the course on the inventory which seems to be getting a little thinner, or do you build out a little bit more speculatively? I'm just noticing the CapEx guidance, the spending guidance for development is pretty flattish year-over-year.
Matt Miszewski: Well, we tried to address that earlier. I did in my remarks. But we plan to add some speculative inventory in our high demand markets and those markets are Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago and Singapore. So we will take speculative risk there as long as we have clear visibility on the demand.
Scott Peterson: And remember, right, 23 megawatts of finished inventory really represents about 5% of the total IT load that we've got out there. We made progress leasing it up last year. I think we're going to continue steadily making that progress and meeting the expectations that Bill helped set for these.
Operator: The next question will come from Jon Petersen of MLV and Company. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen: I was hoping to get a little more color on your Southwest Mexico investment, redIT I believe is the firm you were invested in. If you guys were able to get a 50% IRR over an 18 month time period, curious why you would sell at this point. I assume it's a desire to simplify, but with returns that well, just curious to get more color on why you stepped away from that investment,. Also if you have any other investments in small data center companies like that you're looking to sell.
Scott Peterson: I think our only regret on that is we didn't have a lot more money invested in it. It was just a unique investment. It was a great way for us to get exposure and access to that market. As it turned out, a strategic buyer showed up with a compelling bid and it was really one -- we weren't really in a controlling position on that. It was one that was really hard to refuse. Hard to argue with taking a profit like that.
Bill Stein: And RedIt was a company that we had sold consulting services to. That was really how we got in the door in the first place there.
Jon Petersen: And then just a follow-up. I believe on the call you mentioned that in the first quarter and third quarter you expect occupancy to dip down due to power based leases. Curious if you can quantify a little more how large those leases are and what condition the data centers will be in as power based leases and what you will do in terms of re-leasing. Will you convert them into Turn-Key?
Matt Mercier: One of the assets in particular is downtown San Francisco CBG asset that we're looking at a couple different alternatives for that property. The other one is also outside of San Francisco, CBD and it's a property that we've had history of taking back shelf space which it will be when the tenant expires converting it to Turn-Key and leasing it successfully. So I know that's the likely action plan for those -- the majority of that space that we've talked about. I think in terms of hit to occupancy, I'm quoting off memory here, but I believe it's roughly 15 basis points for each of those, 0.15% for each of those spaces.
Operator: Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup.
Emmanuel Korchman: If we focus on the impairments for a second, looks like a couple of them you had completed redevelopments in 2011, 2012. One of them looked like a data center. What went downhill there that you got to a point where you had to take impairments on them even if you are selling them?
Matt Mercier: I think it was one where it was just part of an overly exuberant development program at the time and in those markets probably had fairly -- well, they did have fairly thin demand at the time. And so it was probably one of those projects that we wish we could have a mulligan on.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then forgive me if I missed, but did you give a revised backlog number since you don't provide a commencement schedule anymore in the presentation?
Bill Stein: No, we don't have a revised backlog number.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz: So appreciate some of the new slides you gave us around historical return metrics, valuations versus broader REIT universe. But I'm just thinking given the recent lift in public data center peer multiples, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on where we stand now relative to private market multiples and how those spreads might be changing or influencing how you think about the outlook for external growth activity once the efficiency initiatives have run their course.
Scott Peterson: A part of it gets back to what we said is we're always looking at opportunities and we try to evaluate them by is there a strategic fit, does it do something for our Company, but just as importantly does it do something for our shareholders. There have not been a lot of, as you know, a lot of big private market transactions over the last couple of years. Most of them have gone public. I think the valuations have trended pretty closely between private and public right now, which creates a little bit of friction as it relates to trying to do accretive transactions. Will that change in the future? I have a feeling there will be some changes there. But with public market valuations being so readily accessible, the private market guys look to that to value their portfolio. And they don't really want to leave a lot on the table for the acquiring Company and their shareholders.
Matt Mercier: And sorry, just to follow up on the question that Manny had. If you look at page 7 in the presentation, the backlog we have right now is $108 million.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: I was just looking at your top 20 customers and there seemed to be some notable movements amongst those customers. I thought most surprising was to see Facebook jump up into the top five, especially since we've seen them do some subleasing in some other facilities. I was wondering if there was any incremental color you could offer around movements in the top 20 customers. Thanks.
Matt Miszewski: Sure. So we're always happy to see Facebook move up inside our top 20 list. We've had a historical fantastic relationship and that relationship continued in 2014, especially in Q1 in 2014. So in particular, we also are very solid behind the demand that that particular set of transactions has behind it. So we're very satisfied that their take in 2014 with us is a very long-term relationship in a market that is growing even faster from a social media perspective than is the U.S. market. Other notable moves, of course we've expanded our exposure to IBM as part of their SoftLayer acquisition. And we welcome that continued movement and that continued relationship across the whole organization. We were lucky enough to have a great relationship with SoftLayer as they started out and as they grew and as they were acquired we were able to strengthen our relationship with an existing client at IBM and now we're happy to rank them currently number two in the list. But the rapid growth is how we say rapid, so number one might be at risk in a little bit. But we're thrilled to have them amongst the movers and shakers in the top 20.
Bill Stein: Let me add to that. Let me add to that too, Jonathan. If you look at the IBM in particular, they're now in 16 locations with us around the world and that's something we're particularly proud of. I think next quarter you will see additional movement on this list and possibly some new customers of moving onto this and moving up pretty quickly.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: Bill, I want to go back to the M&A discussion briefly. The INXN Telecity deal, our T&T guys think that would have been a great addition for your Company and a great position you to compete against Equinix. Maybe a negative for them. You said you looked at it. I'm just wondering what caused you not to pursue it or did you pursue it but you lost out financially or it's just not the right time for your Company to pursue something like that?
Bill Stein: First of all, Bill, this was really an off-market deal. So neither one of these companies was marketed to the broader data center universe. And if you think back on where we came from last year, it's only recently that our stock price has recovered and give us currency. We've been really focused on the five goals that I laid out last year and we've obviously made very good progress against that. But I think it's fair to say that while we've tracked really both companies, we felt that we weren't ready to take something on like that at that time.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes, so I was interested in the exposure to Houston and the oil and gas sector and are those 1.3 and 1.9%, are they mutually exclusive or is there some overlap there? And in particular, I think in a more fundamental level I'm just interested are you being cautious when you put that exposure on your slide or are there concrete signs and customer behavior that are leading you to take a more cautious stance?
Matt Miszewski: So to address the first, there is overlap between those two as you can imagine. There's a number of parties in oil and gas that are located in Houston. Those are, as of 12/31, that is our exposure to both those sectors as laid out. I don't think there's anything else to add on top of that.
Scott Peterson: I think that Jonathan, the interesting part of our corporate strategy of diversification of the client base is something that shines here that we're not overexposed to any particular industry when they go through tough times for their own industry. But as I was stating, woe be me to suggest that under penetration in a vertical is a good thing, but under penetration in this case could potentially lead to opportunities. So we certainly hope that the reduction in the price of oil allows some of the folks in the Houston area to reconsider some of the deployments they are thinking about making or some of the deployments they have made, especially if they're looking at the renewals. And they look at a data center operator that could provide them with a much lower total cost of ownership with their data center facility.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Additional question. Bill, just was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Board's mindset and how they're thinking about the replacement for the CFO role, specifically what they're looking for and if there's a sense of timing of how soon that could happen.
Bill Stein: Sure. Well, we've engaged a search firm and they've generated an initial list of candidates. So we're considering both internal and external candidates. I think we have very strong candidates in both categories. In terms of background, my bias here is to find someone who is experienced in capital intensive industries because of the need to have sophistication in terms of balance sheet management. And I think real estate would clearly give you that. And I think Telco and some networking would do that as well. The advantage of real estate is that not only do you get balance sheet management expertise, but you also get hopefully connections or contacts with institutional investors in the real estate community. In terms of timing, suffice to say that I hope this will be done in less time than it took to find the CEO. I would expect that since we're running the process here that that's what will happen. And I don't know that that we will have a new CFO by the time of the next call, but it would certainly be nice if we could from where I stand.
Tayo Okusanya: Just one quick other minor question from me. More of a numbers question with the same store NOI for the quarter, just a couple of big moves on the operating expense side especially with property taxes coming down so much. I just wanted to understand that a little bit better.
Matt Mercier: We continually look at our portfolio and find where we can work to get the properties reassessed. And we had expected to achieve a number of lower reassessments for properties in our same -- in the same capital pool. We didn't hit all of them but we got the majority of them and that's what's driving the decline in property taxes over the prior year.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to follow up on the M&A discussion a little bit within the market. You mentioned I think, Bill, in response that you would look to do something that was more strategic. You wouldn't look just to get bigger. I'm curious how you would define strategic, if that would be by vertical or product or more geography.
Bill Stein: Really any of the above. So new markets, new products, new services, vertical expertise as well.
Scott Peterson: Jordan, as a follow-up, Jordan, we spent a fair amount of time looking at the lattices deal and we were short listed on that and had great respect for the team there and the Company. But it was one where the pricing was going to a point where it really wasn't going to be very compelling for our shareholders. And as a result, we weren't the most aggressive bidder on that.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. What we can take away from what seems like a hard look at the lattices deal is as opposed to last year when you weren't necessarily ready and you were more focused internally, today given the recovery in the stock and the currency, et cetera and in the portfolio and the ops, that you are more ready relative to last year?
Bill Stein: That's right.
Scott Peterson: Yes. I would agree with that. I think we always evaluate an opportunity based on how well it fits within our strategy, how well it fits within our current portfolio, what it does to enhance our company and our growth prospects and just as importantly is it a compelling investment for our shareholders.
Operator: The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman. Bill, your talk about Telecity interaction, you talked about where your stock was last year and your desire not to get involved given your cost of capital. Given UK takeover rules and it's a nonbinding deal, that wouldn't preclude you from getting involved at this point, right, if you have the confidence in where your stock is and your cost of capital?
Bill Stein: That's true.
Michael Bilerman: So is that something that would be on the table post?
Bill Stein: Michael, as I said we're going to continue to monitor this transaction as it evolves very closely.
Michael Bilerman: And then just in terms of the backlog, I thought you said page 7 but I'm looking at page 7 and that's absorption of finished inventory.
Matt Mercier: I misspoke. It isn't in the deck. It is $108 million as of the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Trent Trujillo of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross Nussbaum: It's Ross Nussbaum here. Sorry, I'm on the cell phone. The impairments that you took in the quarter, are those three assets, assets that are included in the held for sale bucket or were these re-evaluated separate from that?
Matt Mercier: They're in the held for sale bucket, that's what ultimately, I'm sorry.
Matt Miszewski: This is Matt. They are not part of the held for sale. Held for sale basically in order to qualify, we do the impairment analysis essentially as one of the first step. Held for sale usually comes along when you're much further along in the process and you've hired a listing broker and you have all your marketing materials. And so those three assets are not part of the held for sale pool.
Ross Nussbaum: But it sounds like you're contemplating closing of those later in the year.
Scott Peterson: Yes, they've been identified as properties for disposition they don't meet the technical qualification of held for sale, but they are on the list of assets to be disposed of this year.
Operator: And our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Sorry. I didn't realize it was only two and then you go. The question I wanted to ask was continuing a little bit on the impairment. You talked in relation to a question before that the impairments was because you are going to sell the assets so you have to go down and see what the value is relative to what you were carrying them were. Manny asked about one of the assets, you said we wish we could have taken a mulligan on that one, we wouldn't have made the investments that we did. Have you guys gone through -- and I know impairment accounting is very different than NAV or asset value accounting, but I'm just curious if you have done a full analysis? And I know you guys have presented your NAV before, taking the NOI and just putting a cap rate on it, but I'm curious whether you've actually gone through and said well, let's value each asset as if we were going to sell it to be able to tease out whether there's any other issues like these three assets that would be in the portfolio on a mark-to-market sale basis versus a cap rate analysis on current NOI.
Scott Peterson: What we have done is we took all of the non-core, non-data center assets and we took any of the ones that we might qualify or characterize as underperforming or at risk of underperforming, because maybe short-term nature of leases, as well as any property or project that was going to require significant capital investment over the coming years. And we evaluated each one of those for its current investment potential to identify which ones we think we might have issues with, whether it is to sell them or we might have valuation issues. So yes, we did. We have gone through all that. What we haven't done to balance all that out is we didn't go and then do a fair evaluation of properties like in Chicago where we bought that with $14 million of NOI and now what, do we have $72 million of NOI there. We probably created $600 million, $700 million of value there. I would say on balance if we did that fairly, the winners would vastly swamp any of the marginal players in that.
Michael Bilerman: And the effective cap rate on current NOI for those three assets would be what?
Scott Peterson: It would be below our current implied cap rate in our portfolio, quite a bit.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. The Digital Realty fourth quarter and full year 2014 results conference call has now ended. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Arthur William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us. I'd like to start today by providing a quick update on the progress that we've made toward the strategic initiatives we laid out 6 months ago. These are highlighted on Page 2 of our presentation. First, we made continued headway on leasing up our existing inventory during the third quarter. We have, likewise, made steady progress towards our top priority of driving improved return on invested capital, which is up 30 basis points over the last year. With respect to our capital recycling initiative, we took the first tangible steps towards pruning the portfolio to narrow our focus on the core. We also closed a significant turnkey data center joint venture transaction during the third quarter. Our capital recycling program is designed to refocus our geographic footprint and enhance the consistency of our product quality. This program will set the stage for a faster, more sustainable pace of growth in 2016 and beyond even if it does create somewhat of a headwind to earnings growth next year. If we have to choose between long-term value creation or near-term growth in FFO per share, we will choose the former. We plan to exit several secondary markets, but we've also identified a handful of select global markets, notably in Germany and Japan, where our customers would like us to have a presence. We plan to enter these markets with our customers over time. Scott Peterson will cover our capital recycling efforts in his remarks. But suffice to say that we believe capital is precious, and at current pricing, we view the equity embedded within our existing portfolio as a better source of capital than the public equity capital markets. In addition to refining our focus, we expect our capital recycling initiative will also drive tighter utilization of our asset base and will, likewise, contribute to improvement in our overall return on invested capital. Turning to our Global Alliances Program. We recently announced a joint marketing alliance with VMware and agreement with Carpathia to make our respective product offerings directly available to each other's sellers. In addition, we're in the process of significantly expanding the number of cloud service providers participating in our global cloud marketplace. Our enterprise customer base is accelerating their adoption of the hybrid cloud model. Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable our customers' needs by facilitating direct access to large and growing cloud service provider network within our portfolio. Existing customers accounted for almost 90% of our third quarter lease signings, but we have also added nearly 80 new logos year-to-date. These have included multiple instances of cloud production for a global software powerhouse currently servicing over 400,000 customers and one of the world's largest enterprise software providers currently serving clients in over 130 countries by supporting their cloud platform. Moving on to inventory management. As discussed, we are committed to a much more disciplined approach with respect to development risk going forward. We have primarily transitioned to a build-to-order inventory management program. As you can see from the development life cycle schedule on Page 30 of our sup [ph], our active data center construction projects are now 86% pre-leased. With progress against these initiatives in mind, I'd like to take a moment to share with you why I believe we have such a durable business. For starters, we have a world-class roster of customers with excellent credit. These customers tend to sign relatively long-term leases. They typically make a significant investment of their own capital within our facilities, and as a result, they have a high propensity to renew their leases at expiration. Our top 50 customers account for roughly 70% of our NOI. This level of concentration allows for diversification, but it also tips the 80/20 principle scale, contributing to a comparatively low cost of sale and a less operationally intensive business model. These attributes underscore the stability of our cash flow stream, which has earned us the lowest cost of capital in the sector, supported by the residual value of our real estate. We've also been able to attract and retain a base of incredibly talented and hardworking employees from around the world, whose skills and dedication would be nearly impossible to replicate by any competitor and thus represents an important source of competitive advantage. In short, we are confident in our competitive position. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we plan to strengthen our position by driving greater profitability per unit through our existing footprint. In addition to emphasizing asset utilization, we aim to drive additional revenue through capturing a greater share of customer wallet via product diversification, exploiting opportunities for open and paid peering and driving the pairing of cloud service providers with our large enterprise clients. Finally, let's turn to the macro outlook laid out on Page 3 of the presentation. As you are surely aware, geopolitical uncertainty has risen over the last several months, while the outlook for global GDP growth has slipped a bit. In contrast, the U.S. economy has remained relatively resilient, although growth has been modest. Data center demand is not directly linked to the price of oil or to U.S. payrolls but is secular in nature and is growing faster than GDP. In addition, supply is being consistently absorbed at the sector level, and we expect continued gradual improvement in data center fundamentals. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives.
Scott E. Peterson: Thank you, Bill. As shown here on Page 4, we closed a $187.6 million joint venture during the third quarter with Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT for a turnkey data center located in Ashburn, Virginia. We sold an 80% interest to Griffin Capital, and we retained a 20% interest in the joint venture. We will continue to manage the property and receive management fees. The transaction valued the property at a 7.05% cap rate or $20,600 per kilowatt. We're pleased with this transaction, as it provides meaningful price discovery for turnkey data centers and establishes a new capital partner relationship. On last quarter's call, we indicated we would begin marketing non-core assets for sale shortly after Labor Day. We have identified an initial pool of 9 properties for disposition. As detailed in our press release, we brought 5 of these assets to market, and we booked a $13 million impairment charge during the third quarter to write down 2 of those assets to their estimated fair market value. Leasing activity at the 4 remaining properties has picked up considerably over the past 90 days, and we are in the process of finalizing some new leases, which has affected the timing of bringing these properties to market. However, this should increase the value of these properties and maximize proceeds to our shareholders. In addition, several of these assets were encumbered by CMBS debt, which has -- which was paid off in September. These 9 assets represent roughly the first 1/3 of the properties under evaluation for the capital recycling program, which comprises roughly 5% to 10% of the portfolio. This initial portfolio has some winners and some losers but on balance, we expect to recognize a gain well in excess of any impairment charges or losses. We have been encouraged by the early indications of interest we have received, and we expect our capital recycling program will contribute to our objectives of narrowing our strategic focus, funding future capital requirements and driving improved return on invested capital. I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to discuss our current leasing momentum.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As you can see here on Page 5, we signed new leases totaling over $31 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter. Our recent leasing activity has been remarkably consistent. You may recall that the $47 million we reported in the first quarter included a $12 million direct lease with a formal subtenant at a Powered Base Building in Santa Clara. Excluding that one lease, we have signed between $30 million and $35 million every quarter this year. Colocation revenue accounted for over 15% of our leasing activity, again, this quarter. Our mid-market segment has delivered a consistent contribution of between $4 million and $6 million in each of the past 3 quarters. This segment is representative of the steady pace we are seeing across our sales platform but has also been partially responsible for smoothing out some of the traditional lumpiness in our quarterly leasing activity just as we expected. Turning now to Page 6. Cloud, content and social media had been the major drivers of our recent leasing activity and accounted for nearly 75% of our lease signings in the third quarter. We believe this demand represents a secular trend rather than a onetime thrill, and we believe we are still in the very early innings. Cash rents on renewal leases rolled down by 6% as shown on Page 7. The primary driver was a large lease with a financial services tenant in Northern Virginia that was signed at peak rent, which we have highlighted on the last several calls. Needless to say, releasing spreads on Powered Base Building renewals remained quite healthy. The face rates on Turn-Key Flex leases signed shown here at the bottom of Page 8 were lower than last quarter albeit due to market mix, reflecting a concentration of activity in lower-cost North American market, primarily Ashburn, Virginia. On a like-for-like basis, face rates were flat to up slightly, and returns are right in line with our expectations. In addition, net effective leasing economics continue to steadily improve. This improvement reflects the gradual recovery in data center fundamentals as well as the behavior changes driven by our new sales compensation program and tighter underwriting discipline as a function of our revamped investment review process. These trends are indirectly reflected in tenant credit quality. Fully 60% of our third quarter leasing activity was with investment-grade credits. We also turned down several large potential deals with exceptionally strong credit tenants during the third quarter due to terms that did not meet our underwriting criteria, both economics as well as noneconomic. We believe our disciplined approach will lead to better returns for shareholders in the long run. In addition to leases signed, lease commencements were likewise stable. As you can see from the chart at the bottom right of Page 9, the weighted average lag between signing and commencement ticked down to 5.5 months and has settled consistently in the 6-month range. We leased a total 14 megawatts during the third quarter, 6 of which were finished inventory. We placed several megawatts in service during the third quarter, and we did get back 2 megawatts in Phoenix from a tenant that was in holdover status as of June 30 that we discussed on the second quarter call. The bottom line is that we generated 1 megawatt of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool during the third quarter. As you can see here on Page 10, we have made steady progress towards our objective of leasing up existing inventories since our Investor Day last November. Incidentally, these numbers are as of September 30. We've absorbed 2 additional megawatts since the end of the third quarter. Despite the space we got back in Phoenix during the third quarter, our historical data center tenant retention track record has been quite strong. As shown on Page 11, we have traditionally retained 84% of data center lease expiries. Leasing non-data center space has not been our forte and is part of the reason we are moving to rationalize our portfolio. That said, we have very recently been able to generate some positive leasing momentum at several of our non-data center properties. The incremental NOI should drive greater proceeds from non-core asset sales than anticipated just a short while ago. Turning now to supply on Pages 12 and 13. It's interesting to see that available inventories shrank a bit in both the highly scrutinized Northern Virginia market as well as Silicon Valley, whereas we saw a modest uptick in Chicago and in Phoenix over the past 90 days. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to talk you through our financial results. Matt?
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Matt. As Scott mentioned, we closed a $187.6 million turnkey joint venture during the third quarter, and proceeds were used to pay down $130 million of CMBS debt at 5.65%. Debt to EBITDA improved 1/10 of a turn to 5x, as you can see here on Page 14. We still have a U.S. dollar bond offering contemplated in our guidance for later this year. As shown here on Page 15 of the presentation, our credit spreads have tightened considerably over the course of the year, and we believe the current interest rate environment is attractive. We also believe it is prudent balance sheet management to finance long-lived assets with long-term capital, and we expect to tap the corporate bond market either later this year or early next year. Turning now to operating performance. Portfolio occupancy ticked up 20 basis points, the second consecutive improvement in occupancy. We expect to finish the year at or slightly above the current level of 93%. As Matt indicated in his presentation, cash releasing spreads were negative in the third quarter, driven by the large roll-down in Northern Virginia. We are not out of the rental rate roll-down woods quite yet, but we have worked our way through the worst of the above-market lease expirations within our portfolio with a few notable exceptions, particularly in 2016 rollovers in Northern New Jersey. As market rents continue to improve and as we address the remaining roll-downs, the mark-to-market should begin to approach 0 and turn consistently positive over the next couple of years. Same-capital cash NOI growth was 5.9% for the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance range, and we've raised our organic growth forecast for the full year by 50 basis points to between 4.5% to 5.5%. We've also whittled down the incremental revenue from speculative leasing embedded within our forecast to a very manageable 0 to $5 million for the remainder of the year. We've lowered our CapEx guidance for development spending by approximately 5% at the midpoint. We have the ability to self-fund our near-term capital requirements with proceeds from asset sales, and we currently have no plans to revisit the public equity market anytime soon. At the bottom line, we've raised the low end of the guidance range for 2014 core FFO per share by $0.05. The upward revision to our bottom line forecast while tightening our budget for development spending speaks directly to our renewed underwriting discipline and emphasis on return on invested capital. Later this year, we will celebrate our 10th anniversary as a public company. As you can see from the charts here on Page 16 of the presentation, we've generated positive year-over-year growth in both dividends and FFO per share every single year of our public company existence, including the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we expect 2015 will be no different. Bottom line growth will likely be modest next year, and organic growth will be the primary driver as external growth will be muted due to asset sales. We will also face a tough comp in the first quarter due to the $850 million long-term capital raised in March and April of this year. We will provide formal guidance in January, but we expect to generate core FFO per share growth next year in the low single digits. And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill.
Arthur William Stein: Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up by recapping the highlights from our third quarter results as outlined here on Page 17. We signed over $31 million of new leasing during the third quarter, including a $5 million mid-market contribution. We leased nearly 6 megawatts of finished inventory with 1 megawatt of positive net absorption. We registered a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in occupancy. We delivered 5.9% same-capital cash NOI growth and raised our organic growth forecast for the full year by 50 basis points. Our third quarter core FFO per share beat consensus by $0.02. And finally, we raised the low end of the range for 2014 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. We believe these results demonstrate consistent execution on our strategic objectives. Our approach to capital recycling and disciplined leasing standards also demonstrate our renewed focus on generating long-term shareholder value in everything that we do. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and I would like to thank our outstanding global team of employees without whose contributions, these results would not be possible. And now we are pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vance Edelson at Morgan Stanley.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to give you a chance to discuss outsourcing more. You mentioned that existing customers drove 90% of the growth, but you also added the 80 new logos. Is outsourcing still on the rise and that's what's supporting the 90% figure? And similarly, are the 80 new logos a sign that those companies are perhaps outsourcing for the first time?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. Thanks for the question, Vance. We do see outsourcing to be a continued trend that we discussed with our customers on an ongoing basis, and we really see it in both of the segments that you identified. Existing customers, especially our large enterprise existing customers, continue to be on the road for outsourcing their IT as well as their business processes, and we're there to support them. Maybe surprisingly, the new logos that we signed in both the large enterprise segment as well as the mid-market segment have a similar interest in outsourcing maybe for different reasons. The mid-market companies simply don't want to get started behind an operationally expensive set of processes, and our large enterprise customers have found a need to preserve some of their capital and to invest in strategic initiatives. But for both of these segments, outsourcing remains incredibly important for Digital Realty.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then as a related follow-up, could you describe the momentum that the mid-market segment has? It seems like a relatively new initiative and yet the new leases signed seem to have leveled off to some extent. Is that something we can expect to see growing in the coming quarters?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. We see -- we're very pleased with the progress that we've seen in the mid-market since we announced its -- announced the initiative last year. We've seen that team really step up and consistently generate now between $4 million and $6 million in revenues over the past several quarters and a very large quarter in revenue production in Q4 of last year. So we couldn't be happier. Really, if you keep in mind that we basically grew a business that was producing between $1 million and $2 million of quarterly revenue, now we've increased that to $4 million to $6 million participation. So we're extremely excited about the progress that the mid-market team is making and the mid-market sales team combined with the operational team that supports that set of products.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes. So kind of a related question to the previous one. The connectivity initiative, whether standard connection at your own sites or OPEN-IX, I wonder if you have an update on that. And then the colocation segments, as distinct from the mid-market initiative, it looks your colo rental rates increased, and I wonder what drove that. Was that deal size or geographic mix? And then another kind of observation, it looks like the Turn-Key rent dropped in Asia-Pac, and I wondered what drove that?
Matthew J. Miszewski: You managed to get a lot of questions in one question, but we'll try to address all of them. First of all, the connectivity initiative -- in terms of the connectivity initiative, we're extremely pleased with the progress that the operational team has made, and we moved the product ownership under the sales and marketing umbrella over this past quarter, 1.5 quarters as well. Connectivity has -- the network ecosystem project under connectivity, as you know, started in Europe and has moved its way throughout the United States. We've connected up major data centers in campuses within the United States, and we're in the process of doing the same thing in Asia Pacific. And so we're pleased to announce that we not only have completed most of that process but that we're starting to see the results as well. We measure the results of many of the partnerships that we do by the amount of GAAP rental revenue that they're able to influence. And the network ecosystem, in and of itself to date, has already influenced over $39 million of GAAP signings to date. Probably more important to that is that the network ecosystem really underlies our customers' desire to tap into the power of the hybrid cloud. This gets to the dual magnet metaphor that uses Bill uses from time to time when he talks about cloud service providers that exist within our data centers, in large numbers, the large portion of our revenue and how that attracts the large enterprises that are coming to our data centers and those large enterprises that we have also attracting additional cloud service providers. By combining that combination of great customers with the network ecosystem that we now have deployed, as well as the global cloud marketplace that we're looking to expand this fiscal year, it's important to realize that this is really the connectivity that was missing to enable the hybrid cloud for our customers. So we're extremely excited about that. I'm glad that you called out the colocation product and rental rates, in particular, for that individual product and that -- it's important to remember that, that product actually goes across multiple segments. So we do sell colocation into the mid-market segment as well as into the enterprise segment. And the increase in rental rates, I think, you've identified it already, really goes around the deal sizes that we landed within the quarter as well as the geographic diversity. Markets rates are different for colocation -- the colocation product in multiple markets, and we happen to be either lucky or smart enough to have landed them in the right markets this quarter. We'll see a slight bump in the rental rates. Was the third -- the third question, I believe, was on the TKF rental rates. Is that correct?
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Correct.
Matthew J. Miszewski: So in particular, in Asia Pac, I think your question sort of focused in on the TKF rental rate numbers in Asia Pacific, and we did have -- we had to call out that we did have one large deal that we secured in Hong Kong, which we view as a onetime event, was a very strategic partner. We went into that deal for very specific reasons between the 2 partners, in particular, to open up some market opportunities that were closed off to us before. We believe we successfully completed that set of transactions and that this one lease is really a onetime event. It really highlights that we're able to make strategic decisions in concert with our greatest partners and our greatest customers throughout the world.
Operator: The next question is from Ross Nussbaum from UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you talk a little about your weighted average lease term? I noticed in the quarter, it was down to 6.3 years from 6.8 last quarter. Just maybe talk a little bit about why that number shifted so notably from Q2 to Q3.
Matthew J. Miszewski: So Ross, thanks for the question. The shorter lease terms, we need to understand in a context of the duration of those leases that are being signed as well as understanding that obviously it's an average. So we're still seeing some good lease terms come in. And -- but I understand that we're comfortable signing shorter-term leases in the marketplace where we really believe that the fundamentals inside that marketplace are improving, especially at the time of potential expiration. Also important for everyone to remember that our retention rates remain high. So we are comfortable with this shorter initial term. It's also become a little bit of a trend in the marketplace for folks who initially say they want a smaller term to actually go ahead and take their additional option earlier in that process. So maybe a tip box in terms of procurement, but we're seeing those people renew early in some cases or do must-takes early in some cases as well. In essence, what all this signals is that the fundamentals in this market are improving.
Arthur William Stein: Ross, let me add to that, that we also see the same company that are doing shorter-term leases, putting significant investment into the premises even though they might be doing a 5-year lease.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: As a follow-up, not really much related, but what is -- what should we all expect, Bill, on the timing for the, I guess, full CEO announcement. Is that happening before NAREIT, before year-end? What can you tell us at this point?
Arthur William Stein: So Ross, we have bet here internally as to which question it would be, but...
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm surprised to think we...
Matthew J. Miszewski: I am also.
Arthur William Stein: So we have heard that question before. The answer to the question is that we fully expect that it will be before year-end. That's what we've said, really, since the transition was announced last March. And as we also indicated, the board back then and still is comfortable with the current leadership that's in place, but the focus remains finding the right candidate and that is unquestionably the priority. Fortunately, in the interim, the stock has performed well. We're up over 40% since March. We've outperformed the RMZ by 2,000 basis points, and we remain focused on executing our strategic vision. And thank you for the question.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut at Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great. I guess, my first question is really about sort of your view on the global market. You guys have a great success in Asia Pac, and at a recent conference, your fastest-growing customer talked about going to dozens of new countries in the next few years. So I was just wondering what your perspective was in terms of expanding your footprint globally beyond the markets that you're currently operating in.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So Jonathan, we do. And I think as Bill said in his initial statements, we will certainly look at new opportunities with our great customers in tow. But important to also understand that our -- one of our focuses -- one of our strategic focuses within sales and marketing is targeting at the beginning as well as targeting expansion with companies that have a stated desire or already active in global expansion that matches our existing portfolio, where we happen to have existing inventory or shell available. So that alignment by us to sort of generating demand across companies that have a desire to grow globally matches our current footprint in terms of what we have existing inventory in pretty darn well. We also happen to find out that those customers stay with us longer. They're happy to give us longer lease terms, and they're much more easy to satisfy in terms of customers because their value expectation is aligned very well with the value that we provide. I think Bill mentioned in his opening statements 2 geographies that were of interest. Maybe I'll turn it over to Bill to see if he wants to talk a little bit more about future potential expansion.
Arthur William Stein: And Jonathan, so I've mentioned Germany and Japan. But in addition, I mean, we -- if we have a -- I'm sure we both know the customer you're talking about. But if we have a strong customer that wants us to go to a certain market, and in this particular case, this customer is, they lease multiple megs from us at one time. So if we can get comfortable with the demand in that market, and we can get comfortable with other risks, so currency risk, political risk, we can structure ample lease term to mitigate risk. And we have a customer that's taking a significant percentage of a building, then we are -- will be more willing to look into a new market.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: That makes a lot of sense. Just as my follow-up question, are there any markets that you're concerned with? There's a recent report out that the big 4 markets in Asia Pac are going to see something like a 40% inventory increase over the next 12 to 24 months. Are there any markets that you're concerned about in terms of inventory?
Arthur William Stein: We haven't seen that in Asia at this point. We're seeing really good absorption in our 2 Australian markets. And in Singapore, we're basically full. And Hong Kong is filling rapidly, too. So we haven't seen the evidence of that. We -- there had been commentary about excess supply in North American markets in Silicon Valley and Virginia, in particular. But once again there, we've seen significant absorption of our inventory. In fact, we can't even keep up in Northern Virginia. I think basically, the difference to maybe the type of product that we're delivering to the market, and we do provide the 2-end solution, a dedicated infrastructure. And I suspect that if there's commentary about excess supply, it's probably the share in infrastructure product.
Matthew J. Miszewski: That's an important distinction, Jonathan, that Bill is making. As I look at our 12-month future pipeline, I see a good dominant part of that being the customers that regularly buy the dedicated solution from us here at Digital. That doesn't foreclose us from making sure we truly understand the customers' needs in the 4 big markets in Asia Pacific. But as opposed to our competition who is testing the waters, we've got a proven product that we're able to deploy and have successfully deployed over the past 5 years. We certainly will look at continuing to do that and then exploit any future opportunities that we see.
Arthur William Stein: Thank you, Jonathan. Just to point out, in Hong Kong and Singapore, in particular, land is tight. So it really is hard to get sites there. I know there's one of our competitors is bringing on a site January 1, but I think that's really the only one that we'd be concerned about in Singapore.
Operator: The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to echo Jonathan's comments on great execution during the quarter. First question, Bill, you did discuss in your commentary about turning down quite a few deals with larger tenants because you weren't happy with the economics or the terms or what have you. Could you just kind of give us a sense of what some of those type of deals were that you turned down? And if whether you would have actually accepted those kind of deals a year to 2 years ago.
Arthur William Stein: Well, I don't know that those deals would have existed a couple of years ago. But the -- I think that my biggest objection to these deals was the customer's attempt to transfer what I thought were the customer's business risks to us for a standard of conduct within the data center's four walls that was quite low, a simple negligence as opposed to gross negligence or willful misconduct. So what I'm referring to is indemnity clauses for basically mistakes or omissions inside a data center by the operator, what the right standard of conduct is. And we've held to a standard of willful misconduct, and we do not indemnify for consequential damages. And in this case, we have customers that are looking for a lower standard and a broader scope of indemnity.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So if it wasn't the case of the pricing on the deals or anything like that, it was more along some of the operational risks you would have to take if you actually accepted these deals.
Arthur William Stein: Yes. Not so much, that's why I made the comment in my remarks about being focused on long-term value creation. And these were deals that would have been very beneficial to short-term FFO growth. But at the end of the day, we're focused on residual value as well and what types of risk we might be creating for the long term.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Great. And then just my second question, excluding the financial clients this quarter, could you give us a sense of what GAAP, as well as cash mark-to-market, would have looked like, excluding that large roll-down?
Matt Mercier: Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. I don't think we have that breakout at our fingertips, but we can follow up at a later date.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just want to go back to the non-core dispositions with the 9 assets currently in market, guidance goes up to $400 million for the year in terms of the range. Just trying to get a sense of over the balance of this year as well as '15. I guess, the 9 represents about 1/3 of the non-core that you've identified. I mean, how much of that non-core do you think could go between now and the end of next year?
Matthew J. Miszewski: In the first group that we have, that will all likely transact between now and the end of this year in January, and that total volume's about $260 million in proceeds on that. And we expect to add -- I'll give you a little more information there. We think that will go at an average cap rate, overall, of about a little over a 6 cap rate on that. We then have 3 other -- then we have 2 other groupings of properties that we're looking at. The next grouping is a group of 6 assets that are more, rather than being non-core, these are more non-core data center assets. And we're going through the valuation process of those right now. So it's a little early to give you any indication. But we'd expect that the ones of those we do bring to market would be brought to market first quarter.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on the internal growth side, you obviously raised the same-capital outlook by 50 basis points. In past presentations, you've talked about sort of an ongoing business model that talks about sort of 4% to 5% growth. I guess, is there any reason to think that 2015 should stray significantly from what we saw here in 2014 and sort of relative to that longer-term outlook?
Arthur William Stein: Yes. I mean, as we -- Vincent, as we said, we'll give specifics on 2015 guidance later this year, and we'll -- at that time, we'll break down all those components as we have -- as we've done the last several quarters, but we're not at a point where we can provide that detail at this time. But we'll definitely have it when we give formal guidance later this year.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I think you touched on a little bit sort of post-quarter end leasing but curious more in terms of the seasonality that the portfolios historically experienced in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. Are you still expecting, maybe for Matt or for Bill, the same sort of historical seasonality? Or would that -- should that pick up in the fourth quarter? Or has that been somewhat muted as well by the mid-market strategy?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So the seasonality is interesting, given the launch last year of the mid-market strategy. In general, we're pleased with our sales and marketing team, Jordan being able to generate consistent results that are in line with our plan. We consider quarters like this to be successful quarters when they meet the plan. And you touched on one of the drivers, which, of course, is the mid-market initiative, which, if you remember, seems like way back. It wasn't that long ago when we announced the initiative. Part of the purpose of it was to smooth out the revenue lumpiness that came from the large enterprise segment. And I think we've been fairly successful at doing that. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of wiping out the lumpiness of the large enterprise segment is the perceived seasonality of the past may look a little less certain, and so we need to get a little -- a few more quarters under our belts before we can identify what the true seasonality is, given the new set of products and new set of markets that we're addressing. We do think that our -- the seasonality will reflect customer demand, which have relatively unique drivers. So inside an individual vertical, for instance, financial services, I'm having 2 sets of conversations, one with a company that has a large deployment that needs to go live in the first half of next year, and we're having that conversation. We'll strike a deal this quarter. And the other one, who wants to start the conversation in Q2 but will deliver the actual project in Q4. So unfortunately, seasonality is also at the call of our customers' internal calendars.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. I guess, as a follow-up, maybe for Scott, on pricing and cap [ph] achieved. Obviously, the joint venture helped us sort of shed some light on pricing this quarter. I'm curious, do you think pricing achieved on this transaction is somewhat representative overall of the portfolio of assets, sort of excluding the platform value, especially, obviously, as it relates to Turn-Key?
Scott E. Peterson: Yes. Yes, just remember data centers are kind of complicated, but we happen to like this comp very much. This is a good cap rate, 7.05%. But also when you keep that in light of the price per foot and the price per kilowatt that this traded at, I think this is a very good comp. And it shows that the private demand and pricing continues to grow for these assets, and we're also very happy with these access to another source of capital for our program.
Operator: The next question come from Matthew Heinz at Stifel.
Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I'm interested to hear more about the Global Alliances Program, realizing it's still very early in the process. But I guess, just hoping to understand how receptive existing customers have been to these offerings, particularly within the enterprise segment and then maybe the balance of engagement between mid-market versus wholesale customers. And then as a follow-on to that, I'm hoping you could just collaborate on sort of how you view the cloud marketplace initiative, I suppose, in terms of whether you see it as a value enhancement to the existing service and connectivity offerings. Or is it more of an up-sell opportunity with sort of longer-term implications around ARPU?
Matthew J. Miszewski: So in terms of the Global Alliances Program, the program, when combined directly with the network initiative, has influenced an awful lot of the deals that are out there. But what's interesting is -- what we're trying to enable is something that we're not unfamiliar with. When we -- Scott started in this industry 10 to 12 years ago, we became a carrier-controlled data center provider because of our customers' perceived challenges with network operator-owned data centers. And so that shift in market dynamics allowed us to bring carrier-neutral data centers to the fray and allowed us to capture that market opportunity. We're seeing something similar here, and it sort of will answer both of your questions. The Global Alliances that we're striking are meant to give optionality to our customers that they're asking for. The wider array of that optionality is what we need to provide as data center providers. So that no matter what direction our customers want to go to enable their hybrid cloud ambition, they can do it within Digital Realty property. And so again, as I stated earlier on the hybrid cloud question, what we do here allows our customers to truly connect their services to data centers that they might have inside other Digital Realty data centers, but also they can connect to cloud providers outside of that venue, and they can connect to cloud providers that are not within Digital's own network services. So our network service partners can now securely connect those enterprise clients to all of their assets as well as to internal private clouds, and so what we're seeing is something very similar to the process that we came into a few years ago. So now instead of it being carrier neutrality, it really is cloud service provider neutrality, and part of our partnership efforts or Global Alliances efforts is to make sure that we're able to bring the right cloud service providers to the foray. That worked this quarter in VMWare as well as in Carpathia. Our providers that our customer said they wanted to connect to more directly within Digital's data centers, we're being able to provide that sort of connectivity to them, and we see that as the end in and of itself. If you think about the global cloud marketplace as well as the rest of the partnership ecosystem as an amenity that is now necessary in a modern data center as we move our customers from wanting simply to store data in a data center to want to actively exchange data within a data center and within multiple data centers, that's really the key that we're trying to provide to those customers.
Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And then just very quickly, is there -- do you see any potential for a special distribution of the gains from the joint venture?
Arthur William Stein: So our board meets next week, and the board sets the dividend. So it's something that we're looking at. Basically, the trade-off is going to be a pullback of the first quarter dividend or special dividend, and we haven't decided on that. And even if we had decided on it, we wouldn't jump ahead of the board.
Operator: The next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: If I look at your lease rollover schedule, it looks like you still have a fair amount of PBB leasing to do this year, and those rates are well above average. Was wondering if you can give us some insight as to what that is and how that's going to get addressed.
Matt Mercier: Manny, it's Matt. Actually, that -- the vast majority that's already been released is actually renewal -- or a re-lease we signed back in the first quarter, and it's going to roll, I think, slightly either flat or slightly up on a cash basis. So that is -- that's already taken care of.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And great, and then maybe you can help me get one other piece of disclosure. On the market-by-market disclosure, it looks like the megawatts went up in Northern Virginia, but the rentable square footage to occupancy and the lease square footage all came down. I realize that, that might be tied to the most recent JV. But I was just wondering how those could go in different directions.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. I mean, we'll have to -- I don't know. Obviously, as you know, Northern Virginia is probably one of our most active markets in terms of development. So I'm sure it has to do with the development activity that we're bringing online as well as the joint venture that came out. I don't have the specifics, but I'm sure it has something to do with those 2 interplays.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Douglas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's obviously been a while since we've seen Digital acquire in the space, and I'm wondering if you could maybe comment on how you're thinking about consolidation now, given the strength in your stock this year and maybe some of the criteria you look for in a target. And then second, you touched a little bit on the macro outlook, and I'm wondering if you could comment specifically on the leasing environment you're seeing in Europe and also maybe FX impact you saw in 3Q and expect for 4Q.
Scott E. Peterson: Yes. Stephen, it's Scott. To answer that, we're always in the market looking at M&A opportunities, and we keep abreast of everything, whether it's kind of near term or long term out there. There hasn't been anything very compelling lately. I think our primary focus is always how are we adding value to our shareholders when we look at these. I think there are many opportunities that we look at, which would give us the chance to get only larger and not better or more profitable for our shareholders. So I think our first and foremost goal on all those is to do something that's going to be compelling for our shareholders. And off late, we haven't really seen anything that fits that bill. But we are always -- we're always looking at opportunities, and we'll always pursue those to the extent we think we can do something positive.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. And so on the lease, we'll do this in 3 parts, Stephen. On the leasing side in Europe, without divulging the large enterprise software maker's name, we did see some great activity with what we call a potential franchise account happening within continental Europe this quarter. And probably more important, as I look forward in the next 2 quarters as well as the 12 months looking forward, we see a very healthy pipeline for the properties that we currently have in Europe as well as some of the properties that we have looked to develop in the past.
Matt Mercier: Yes. And this is the other Matt. We -- on the FX issue, we're about 80% hedged in terms of our FX exposure, so it takes a pretty material movement to have a meaningful impact on our bottom line. If rates had remained unchanged versus last quarter, our FFO in Q3 would have been about $0.005 higher. And I think that speaks to the advantage of being an investment grade rated since it allows -- we can fund in multiple currencies, and as you know, we raised a pretty large sterling deal earlier this year, a long-term bond. And overall, I think we've raised over $1 billion in sterling since in the public market. So this goes to show what having a strong balance sheet can do for you in terms of hedging your risks.
Arthur William Stein: And Stephen, let me just sort of pile on here. The -- if we were to find an acquisition that were attractive, public equity is now no longer our only source of equity, as we now have a -- of what I think is fairly reliable source of private capital as well for deals of that type.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session and concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

A. William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, we outlined our strategic vision for the company and the initiatives that we’re pursuing to advance that vision. Today, I’d like to provide an update on the progress that we’ve made over the last 120 days, beginning here on Page 2 of our presentation. We’ve stated that driving improved return on invested capital through the lease-up of existing inventory is our top priority. I am pleased to announce that we leased 9 megawatts of existing inventory during the second quarter. We’ve reduced our finished inventory balance by over 25% since Investor Day last November. This enhanced asset utilization has boosted our ROIC by over 20 basis points so far this year. We’re also well underway on a rigorous evaluation of the entire portfolio. This process is designed to identify non-strategic and underperforming assets that can be harvested to narrow our focus on the core. We expect our capital recycling initiative will likewise have a meaningfully positive impact on overall return on invested capital. We expect to conclude this exercise over the summer and bring the first set of properties to market immediately after Labor Day. Scott Peterson will have more to say about our efforts on this front during his remarks.  In early June, we announced our global cloud marketplace, a solution that makes our customers public, private and hybrid cloud services, easily accessible to our entire global customer base. We believe that partnering with our customers is the best way to provide our enterprise customers with a differentiated offering and to create value. The global cloud marketplace will enable Digital Realty clients to instantly provision on demand, burstable cloud services from trusted cloud providers such as IBM SoftLayer, Internap, Interoute, GoGrid, and SingleHop. And program is still on its infancy, but demand for the offering has been strong and we expect to see healthy adoption as awareness grows. I’d like to pause here for a moment and explain why the concept behind the cloud marketplace is so important for our future direction. A year and a half ago, at the Citi Conference in Florida, Michael Bilerman stepped out of character for a moment and served me up a softball. He asked what aspect of our story was most underappreciated by investors? I responded that it was our global footprint and our enterprise customer base. That was true then, but it’s even more applicable today. Modern cloud providers cater to small and medium-size businesses, but they all aspire to penetrate the enterprise marketplace. The enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base. They already populate our data centers around the world. Our recent leasing activity has been heavily skewed to cloud service providers, in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. Enterprise customers in turn are attracted by the ability to easily and securely connect to multiple areas of their hybrid cloud. Both sets of customers choose to grow on our platform, in part because of the presence of other. The final catalyst connecting our incredible enterprise customer base to the cloud service providers they now need to grow is the deployment of our global network ecosystem. This mutual attraction and our interconnected global portfolio essentially act as a wide mode that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. No one else has the footprint and the cost structure to effectively service the enterprise customer on a global basis. The competitive advantage of this network effect is analogous to a network-dense data center but on a global portfolio scale rather than a single building. This premise will be borne out over time by the ability to attract new enterprise logos, as well as new cloud service providers, the ability to retain these customers and the growth of their existing footprints within our portfolio. Back to current results. Our mid-market segment turned in another solid performance this quarter. The investments we’ve made in upgrading connectivity and expanding the amenities that we offer are enhancing RPO to retail customers. As you can see from our press release, we’ve raised guidance for our capital spending plans over the balance of the year. Over 90% of this additional capital commitment is due to incremental leasing activity. This match between leasing and funding is exactly what we aim to achieve with the build-to-order inventory management strategy that we outlined last quarter. Unleashing intellectual capital is something of a soft initiative. So let me give you some tangible examples. For starters, our General Counsel, Josh Mills’ responsibilities had been expanded to include environmental fairs and corporate real estate. Sustainability has been important issue for data centers, given the sector’s energy footprint and Josh will be sphere hitting our efforts on this front. John Sarcus who many of you met at various conferences and investor events has recently been named Colocation general manager, in addition to his responsibilities leading our connectivity initiative. Scott Peterson’s promotion to Chief Investment Officer has arguably had the most immediate impact. He and his team are restructuring the investment review process to ensure consistency across disciplines and regions. Essentially, any deal that requires commitment of incremental capital is now brought before the investment committee. This process is imposing tighter discipline on capital allocation decisions and promoting appropriate behavior from the sales team, as well as the broker channels. It also delayed two quarter end leasing transactions, which has traditionally been the window when customers were able to extract the most favorable terms. One of these deals has come back to us and appears likely to close on terms that we proposed. This underwriting discipline may impact leasing velocity in future periods, particularly, as we continue to riddle down our stockpile of available inventory. However, we are confident that this approach is translating to improved net effective leasing economics and better returns for our shareholders. Looking forward and turning now to page 3 of the presentation, we see robust demand for the premium data center solutions we offer, providing peace of mind to our customers and enabling them to focus on their core business. The macro backdrop appears relatively benign despite the reason rise in geopolitical uncertainty. Data center fundamentals are gradually improving, as excess supply is being consistently absorbed. We are taking a much more disciplined approach to inventory management. And we see more rationale behavior for many other industry participants as well. Consequently, we are cautiously optimistic that data center fundamentals will continue to improve underpinning acceptable risk-adjusted returns, as well as the stability of our cash flows. And now, I’d like to turn the floor over to Scott to provide an update on our capital recycling initiatives.
Scott E. Peterson:  Thank you, Bill. As mentioned in the last quarter, the investment team is undertaking a wholesale analysis of every single property in our portfolio. This analysis is well underway and should be complete later this year. The first phase of the project targeted a group of high priority properties consisting primarily of non-core assets, data center properties in non-core markets, underperformers and at-risk properties. As a result of this analysis, we expect to prune the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio in order to refine our strategic focus, fund future capital requirements and improve return on invested capital. As Bill mentioned, we plan to start bringing these properties to market after Labor Day. During the second quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of a small single tenant building to the user for approximately $42 million, generating a gain on sale of approximately $16 million and realizing a levered IRR in the low teens. While the cap rate was at the high end of our expected disposition range, it is not a very relevant metric in this instance as there are only 18 months left on the lease term. We did explore several options for the property and determined we could generate a better return on our capital elsewhere. I’d now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to discuss our recent leasing activity.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As shown page 5 of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling over $35 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter. The first half of the year tends to be seasonally slow. The consistency of our recent leasing momentum is readily apparent from a comparison of our year-to-date leasing activity, relative to the first half of any previous year. Keep in mind that the $47 million we reported in the first quarter included a $12 million direct lease with the former subtenant at a Powered-Base Building in Santa Clara. Excluding this lease, our second quarter leasing velocity was right on top of the first quarter and both quarters progressed according to plan. This positive momentum has carried through to the month of July and the third quarter is off to a strong start as well. Colocation revenue accounted for over 15% of our second quarter leasing activity. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that our mid-market segment has delivered a contribution within a range for $4 million to $8 million. The purchase in context, is helpful to realize that prior to the third quarter of 2013, this segment typically generated between $1 million and $2 million per quarter. Cloud, content and social media were the drivers once again accounting for over three-forth of our second quarter leasing activity. Existing customers represented more than 80% of our second quarter lease signings, but the new team has also added 60 new logos year-to-date. Cash rents on renewal leases rolled out by mid-single digits as shown on page six. The large lease with the financial services tenant in Northern Virginia that was signed at Pageant and that we highlighted on the last call was finally renewed in July. The rent roll down 11% on a cash basis, a bit better than the 15% to 20% roll down we guided towards previously. This renewal was not reflected in our second quarter leasing statistics, but will obviously leave a mark in the third quarter although it has been fully baked into our guidance. It’s important to note that this transaction was also expanded to include one part in Dallas, as well as the fourth part in Ashburn. Base rates on Turn-Key Flex leases signed were lower than last quarter entirely due to market mix, reflecting a concentration of activity in lower cost, lower rent in North American markets including Dallas, Ashburn and Phoenix. On a like-for-like basis, base rents were flat to up slightly. More importantly, concessions are abating. This improvement reflects our retool sales compensation program, and the revamped investment review process, as well as gradually improving data center fundamentals. Turn-Key leasing costs were elevated in the second quarter driven primarily by one large 15-year lease. Adjusting for term on a per square foot per year of lease turn basis, the second quarter leasing cost terms are significantly diverged from the norm. Turning now to lease duration on page eight, lease terms are admittedly shorter on core location leasing and as Bill mentioned, last quarter we are comparable going a bit shorter in a rising rental rate environment. The average turn on leases signed during the second quarter was over seven years. This is true whether the second quarter leasing activity is weighted by square feet or by rent. The weighted average remaining lease term across the entire portfolio is half year shorter, we did by rent rather than square feet, but it’s still well over six years. The duration of our average lease term supports the stability of our cash flow stream and strengthens our cost of capital advantage. In addition to signings lease commencements were also respectable. As you can see from the chart at the bottom right of page nine, the weighted average lag between signing and commencement and stuff from six to seven months. This lag is entirely due to future delivery of committed space and is not indicative of either free rents or an elongation of the sales cycle. The team reached a total of 17 megawatts during the second quarter of which 9 or a little more than half came from our finished inventory balance. To put this in contact, the historical average mix of existing inventory as a present of total leasing has been one-third of the total. We started new clouds in Ashburn and in Hong Kong this quarter and the net absorption of finished inventory was 4.5 megawatts. As Bill mentioned during his remarks, and as you can see here on page 10, we have reduced our finished inventory balance by over 25%, since the Investor Day last November. The positive net absorption in Phoenix over that timeframe is particularly encouraging. It was also encouraging to see this positive net absorption translate to a 70 basis point improvement in overall portfolio occupancy. Following several quarters of declines, due to the move out of various non-data center tenants along with the delivery of the inventory that we are now absorbing. We did have one tenant occupying 2 megawatts in Phoenix, that was in whole over started as of June 30 and is expected to move out in the third quarter. We have a very healthy demand funnel in Phoenix however, and we expect overall portfolio occupancy to continue to improve in the second half. Turning now to supply on pages 11 and 12, the available inventory in Northern Virginia has actually come down by a few megawatts over the past 90 days. While new construction is underway in Texas. I’d like to point out, that these charts reflect total market supply and do not differentiate between shared back plain facilities and our dedicated infrastructure product. We believe that much of this available supply is not directly competitive with our offering. As a case in point, we have a very healthy demand funnel in both Northern Virginia and Dallas, and we can scarcely keep any inventory on the shelf in either market. The uptick in sublease space in Santa Clara resides within our portfolio. We received notice from an internet enterprise that represents approximately 1% of NOI that they intend submit approximately 10 megawatts they occupy in Santa Clara. Their leases expired in 2016 and 2019 and the in place rent is well below market. We are working with the client on it solution, and do have interest in the space from multiple perspective customers. With that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier, to talk you through our financial results. Matt?
Matthew Mercier: Thank you, Matt. Most of the balance sheet activity occurred prior through our last earnings call, but several significant events took place during the second quarter. In mid-April, our exchangeable debentures are exchanged for common equity, which improved debt to EBITDA by 0.3 turns. We also raised an additional $63.5 million in April under reopening of the 7 and 3H Series H preferred and partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option, including the sterling bond offering and the original Series H issuance that closed in the first quarter. This brings our year-to-date total of long-term capital ratio approximately $900 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable reflecting our improved operating performance As shown here on page 14 of the presentation, the bond market has taken note and our credit spreads have tightened considerably over the past several months, and have also our performed the re-BBB benchmark, most notably since S&P revised its outlook. Turning now to operating performance, as Matt alluded to in his remarks, portfolio occupancy ticked up 70 basis points. The first sequential occupancy gain in the past six quarters. We’ve also raised guidance for the year-end portfolio occupancy by 75 basis points at the mid-point on the strength of the second quarter rebound. As Matt indicated in his presentation, cash releasing spreads were positive across product types in the second quarter. Although, the large roll down in Northern Virginia was signed in July, it will have an impact on our third quarter leasing statistics. Same capital cash NOI growth was 5.8% for the second quarter, above the high end of our forecast. The year-to-date number is squarely within the 4% to 5% guidance range. I’d also like to address our guidance for incremental revenues remaining to be recognized in 2014 from speculative leasing, which shows the reduction from $10 million to $15 million last quarter to $5 million to $10 million this quarter. As of mid-July, we have already achieved the full speculative leasing target that was embedded in our prior guidance. We are not resting on laurels for the rest of the year, however, we’ve raised the bar by an additional $5 million to $10 million of current year revenue we expect to recognize from leases that have not yet been signed. We’ve also raised CapEx guidance for development spending and capitalize leasing cost by approximately 15% at the mid-point. However, as Bill mentioned in his remarks, over 90% of this additional capital commitment is related to incremental leasing activity. We expect to fund near term capital requirements with proceeds from asset sale and joint ventures. We currently have no plans to revisit the equity market any time soon. At the bottom line, we’ve raised core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Our improved outlook is entirely organic. We’ve actually reduced our acquisitions guidance by half. We’ve also introduced disposition guidance for the first time and we do expect a couple of pennies per share of dilution on a combination of assets sales and joint venture contributions in the second half of the year. To recap the highlights for the quarter, as advertised here on page 16, we signed over $35 million of new leasing during the second quarter, including a $5.7 million mid-market contribution. Released 9 megawatts of existing inventory with 4.5 megawatts of positive net absorption. We achieved our full-year speculative leasing target. We’ve registered an uptick in occupancy for the first time in a year and half. We generated positive cash releasing spreads across the product types. We delivered 5.8% same capital cash NOI growth. S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable. Our second quarter core FFO per share consensus by a $1. And finally, we raised 2014 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point. We are quite pleased with our second quarter financial results. And as most people here at Digital know I am fairly hard to please. And now, we’ll be pleased to open up the call and take your question. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance H. Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank a lot. So as you look to bring the first set of properties to market after Labor Day, maybe if you could just provide an update on the money flows in the data center world. Who the potential buyers might be? I think in the recent past, you've mentioned seeing pension and other money looking to invest. Any updates there on demand or even cap rates? Will it be more users looking to buy? And any appearance of sovereign wealth money yet?
Scott E. Peterson: Yes. Vance it’s Scott Peterson here. It’s a little soon to say, but as far as the buyers we’re seeing a lot of – we’re seeing demand on the buy side to be pretty robust in the private markets. I think we’ll find on the non-core assets, I think we’ll find traditional buyers for those types for assets that will be interested in them, the data center buyers will be a mix and the non-core markets will be a mix of maybe value add as well as traditional stabilized asset buyers, and then for some of the underperformers I think we’ll see probably more the value add type buyers there, there might be private equity backed, but that’s kind of really speculation at this point, what I can say is we’re getting numerous phone calls from potential buyers out there that are very interested in looking at anything that we’re interested in selling.
Vance H. Edelson – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, that’s helpful. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned geopolitical risk. Could you expand on that a bit? Where you think there might be potential risk? And perhaps while you’re at it, just walk us through Europe – do Germany, France, and the UK remain strong? Any updates on demand in Asia? Do the inventory shortages continue there? Just kind of walk us around the globe in terms of strength and weaknesses?
A. William Stein:  So London is very strong for us Vance, in fact we’re in the process of running out of inventory there. We’re bringing a project online in Dublin and we would expect the demand there to come mostly from this side of the pond. We have very little inventory in Paris I think less than half a plot and we’re considering Amsterdam, but we’re not going to – we have a site in Amsterdam, a land site but we won’t be building there unless we have a pre-lease situation. Asia-Pac is also a very strong; Singapore, we could be out of inventory in Singapore by the end of next quarter. And I think in Hong Kong it’s a good possibility we’ll be out at the end of this year. So we’re looking for additional sites both in Singapore and Hong Kong and leasing in Australia has been steady both in Melbourne and Sydney.
Matt Miszewski: Vance, this is Matt Miszewski and given my political background apparently I get to answer the geopolitical risk questions. I don’t see any impact to us on the geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, or in Central, and Eastern Europe. It is important though to understand that privacy concerns of the European Union and the non-Union countries that are inside Europe does have a bit of an impact on operations of datacenters through continental Europe as well as the islands. That actually ends up being a demand driver for some of our key customers including some very large cloud providers who are taking a deployment strategy to eliminate the data sovereignty risk that other providers have. So we’re happy to see folks adjust for data sovereignty requirements within EMEA. As Bill said, we see the Asia demand on the demand side extremely strong and we don’t see any geopolitical risk throughout our Asia-Pac portfolio.
Operator:  And our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi this is Rob for Jonathan. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the increasingly solutions based sales approach under match guidance and how the strategies evolving in terms of the sales team and the recession by customers. And secondly regarding the launch of the global market place can you talk a little bit about take rates or how those services have been adopted with new customers or with new leasing and the impact on pricing.
Matt Miszewski:  Happy to Rob, your first question is about the solution based sales approach and we continue to see this evolve in the best of possible situations where we are getting closer to our customers and really starting to approach the customer base from their point of view as opposed to from our point of view. We did need to make some fundamental adjustments to the sales force including the compensation plan adjustments that we made this past year before we went after the more advanced selling process in terms of solution selling, but now we see solution architecture as part of what we do inside the sales force as well as inside the small marketing team that I have on my team. If you think about the basics of this instead of us simply providing fantastic technical solutions for customers that we create here in San Francisco or in London or in Singapore, now we do this in partnership with our customers by sitting down with them talking to them about what their needs are and then making sure that our products and our solutions sit and meet their needs. One of the things we found out when we started this solution based process was that we did need things like the global cloud marketplace. And so the conversation that we are having with our customers are leading us to do things that make them more sticky inside all of our properties. The global cloud marketplace is one of this; the global network ecosystem is another one. And this has been successful we started as you know we started in Europe; we finished the North America rollout and the Asia Pacific rollout is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. When we finish that rollout, our network ecosystem will feature connectivity to over 1,000 available networks across the world. The last piece I will talk about in terms of this solution approach is our Open-IX initiative, not our Open-IX initiative, but the communities Open-IX initiative, is really starting to take off. We’ve of course landed at the Amsterdam internet exchange inside our New York – one of our New York facilities as well as landed them into one of our Western Coast facilities and we are talking to four more providers right now. As you can see as we’ve taken this approach and we’ve led this approach in terms of solution based selling, you can start to see the data center industry itself start to transform from storage to a more affordable way for our customers to exchange data, which is truly the value that they see inside data centers today.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Anything about take rates? Or any sort of – can you quantify any of that related to new leasing activity or anything?
Matt Miszewski: Yes. So when we announced the global cloud marketplace in June, we announced it early and we’re in the early innings of the consideration of the GCM, what we’ve also noticed is that there is an awful lot, we’re learning more than we thought we would learn initially. And that learning is that there is an awful lot of demand for global cloud marketplace that we didn’t anticipate. So we’re starting to see not just cloud marketplace that we’ve launched, but individual cloud marketplaces that are starting to come up in the conversation that we have with both our partners, as well as our customers. So I think the take rate question is a little bit too soon right now. We’ve just operationally launched the facility and we’re filling it up with partners today. and once we start to see, I mean we start to actively market that solution, I think you’re going to start to see the uptake increase. And so we should be able to give some updates on that on next call.
Operator: And our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on just the economics around some of the deals that were signed this quarter, specifically Page 17 of the supplemental. If you just kind of take a look at leasing costs of square foot, it’s gone up quite a bit that many leverage lease term is filled roughly about the same for a lot of your new leasing activities. So I’m just a little bit curious about why the higher leasing costs and what may be going on and we got to higher negotiating with tenants that’s resulting in this?
A. William Stein: Tayo, that was one long-term deal in the quarter that drove an external commission that was quite substantially. So the leasing costs were based on that land commission, not TIs. And we don’t see this as a trend. I think importantly, we’re still seeing ROICs including TIs and LCs hitting our target range of 10% to 12%. And the comp plan that we put in place at the beginning of the year as we think is proving these leasing economics.
Matt Miszewski: Yes. Tayo, this is Matt when we start to look at the total leasing costs across the quarter of course, we dug in a little bit deeper as the guys who launched the new comp plan, I wanted to make sure we’re having the demonstrative effects that we anticipated we would. And as I said in my opening statements, we’ve seen the rent abatements go away and lease ramps shorten, we’ve also seen TIs in our world start to decrease when we do quarter-to-quarter comparisons, it is a significant decrease especially across the GKF products.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies LLC: I think we took up that large tenant what would be you know what the number would have been for the quarter in regards to leasing cost per square foot on that when tenant?
A. William Stein:  I don’t know that I have that data immediately in front of me, but I’d be happy to provide that right after the call.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you guys talk a little bit about the lease expirations for the remainder of the year I see you got 5.4% of your rent roll expiring at about 190 bucks per foot can you just give us a little bit of color on what you think the retention rate is going to be on that? I know you talk about that one I think was that one leasing in Phoenix but beyond that what you expect the retention to be?
Matt Miszewski:  Yes, this is Matt. We actually showed in terms of rent what we expect to expire over the balance of the year. It's on the NOI, NOI step up chart as part of the presentation is a $5 million that's included so of what expire we expect about $5 million and annual base rent not to renew as of today.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Okay, that’s helpful. And then Bill, can you give us an update on where things stand with the CEO search overall in the timing thereof? Thanks.
A. William Stein: Ross, we are happy to. I mean as I said on the last call the board, our board is comfortable with the leadership that’s in place. I think that comfort has been validated by what I would say has improved employee, customer and investor confidence both on the equity side and the fixed income side. I think it’s interesting to note that since the change in leadership we’ve recovered almost $2 billion of market cap for our shareholders. So the board continues to be focused on sourcing the right candidate for the job, but nevertheless the timing is still expected to be this year and meanwhile this team is focused on executing the strategic vision, which we played out to be optimizing the return on portfolio recycling capital and unleashing the intellectual capital of the firm.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Hello good afternoon everyone. Just want to go back to the new lease pricing in the US which dropped down to 130 per square foot I know a lot of that was attributed to the particular markets in the U.S., which are lower-priced in general. Just curious those three markets what percentage of within those three was all of it?
A. William Stein:  So Vin, The drop as you said, the drop in rates is all market. North America, I think from North America perspective quarter-to-quarter in the first quarter 44% I think of our TKF GAAP rents came from Toronto while in second quarter 48% came from Dallas and Phoenix. It’s actually give you an idea of a rough makeup in the North America since globally in Q1, we had some very large deals in APAC and EMEA about 62% of rents coming in across APAC and EMEA in the first quarter and again that comes back to North America in the second quarter about 75% of the rents.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.:  Great, okay. And then, I’m sorry, you also mentioned, I think Northern Virginia being a fairly big part of the mix this quarter, what was that percentage of leases?
A. William Stein:  Yes, so in Northern Virginia was – there was sizable lease in the quarter and I’m just going to back into that number I’ve got to get that number for you. And I don’t have in front of me.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: You mentioned the quarterly same capital growth NOI growth was 5.8% was exceeded expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about what the upside was relative to the expectations and the implied guidance at the midpoint suggests some slowing from the 5.8% that we saw here in the second quarter just curious if that's really what you're expecting us to see or maybe your trending towards the higher end of that range?
A. William Stein: Yes, I mean it’s obviously that’s just one quarter comparison. I think that’s why we also stated with the year-to-date growth was which is clearly in the middle of where we’re guiding and right now we are comfortable that with the year-to-date it reflects clearly accurately where we expect to be coming end of the year.
Scott E. Peterson:  And Vin, just to get back to you on Northern Virginia Q2 it’s about 10%.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Steve T. Sakwa – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Thanks, I guess good evening at this point or good afternoon. Just two questions, I guess on the Turn-Key joint venture Bill, what exactly or the goals if you want to get out of that. Is it too kind of established pricing and kind of core markets for yourself? Is it to eliminate some of the smaller markets that your end or markets really have one or two assets, I guess what’s the immediate goal of that joint venture?
A. William Stein:  There are two goals, Steve. The first is I think it’s prudent for any company to diversify its capital sources. And so we clearly have access to public and private debt and access to public common debt and preferred this we believe will give us access to reliable source of private capital. In addition, we expect this will provide some transparency on private market valuations from a sophisticated investor for our Turn-Key product. And we think that’s important as well particularly for the any devaluation of the analyst community and our investors.
Steve T. Sakwa – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC:  But I guess from a market perspective where you looking to kind of proven in the Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Chicago are you looking the kind of sell maybe in the Boston, and in the St. Louis where you have one, two assets and maybe those markets on quite a score.
Scott E. Peterson:  At this point the BOEs when we proven the non-core markets that will be throughout right sale. The joint venture would be in core markets really want to retain an interest and retain management of the asset. And each joint venture – this joint venture is being structured in the similar way to the prudential joint venture with retained 20% interest as management and property management fees as well as promote on cash flow in back end.
Operator: The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Bejjani – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Hey, guys is that kind of $20 million or so quarterly G&A run rate is that fully incorporating the mid market sale teams up or how much further do you see this growing?
Matt Miszewski:  Yes, the G&A numbers do have baked into them, the entire mid market sales additions, so we’ve completed that process from a mid market perspectives, across G&A in total we do anticipate that we’ll see a mild increase this year that also important to remember that this is already baked into guidance. And I would like to point out as the head of sales and marketing that additional cost in my area always result in higher revenue. So we continue to see great steady progress on our strategic plan.
John Bejjani – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great, thanks and just one quick follow-up on the Turn-Key JV, you guys have been talking about this for a better part of the year at this points, is there anything you can show on the status there and what’s the delay, let’s call delay at this point.
A. William Stein:  John I’m not sure that I’d say there is a delay, we’ve taken out multiple counter parties, we have identified one counter party, terms have been negotiated, and now that you have the process of sourcing debt as well and all the conditions that are associated with the debt arrangement. So I think we’re making good progress and I think perhaps there was a bit of delay earlier in the year, as we were looking at generating capital from asset sales. But now, we’ve more or less side the asset sale program and have a sense for the sequence there. And we have a view as to how the joint venture would fit into that program.
Operator: The next question will come from Jon Peterson of MLV & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Petersen – MLV & Co: Great. Thank you. Just a quick question on the guidance (indiscernible), but in terms of dispositions obviously that have pretty wide range I know you said you are going to give more details after Labor Day, but on the cap rate the ranges from 0% to 12%. I was hoping you guys kind of elaborate on what to expect, obviously 0% assets to negative cash flow. I’m just curious what percent of 0 to 400 would kind of fall in that bucket. I guess how do I think about that really wide range and what you guys see it realistically following now that?
Scott E. Peterson:  Yes. I apologies for the wide range as you can imagine it's kind of tough to try to ballpark that it's a little early in the process to nail it down. But I think it's reasonable to expect that the average cap rates for the dispositions will be below our employee portfolio cap rate. Is that helps.
Jonathan Petersen – MLV & Co: Okay. All right, that’s fair. And then go ahead.
A. William Stein:  No, that’s okay.
Jonathan Petersen – MLV & Co: Okay. And then in terms of debt maturity is just hoping for an update you got about $130 million of secured debt maturing I think alone in November of this year and $375 million of unsecured notes in July of next year. Just what can we kind of expect in terms of how you guys plan to refinance that debt?
Matt Miszewski:  Yes, sure. This is Matt. Over the balance of this year, our thinking is we’ll effectively repay most of the secured debt that's maturing through our revolver. We do have in our guidance and additional capital raise and additional U.S. bond late in the year that you can say effectively would be part of that refinancing. And then in terms of next year, we are still putting together our capital plan, but I would think we given our rates are today in terms of the large the first bond maturing we have mid-next year that we should be able to refinance that on the longer-term at effectively the same cost. So basically take out of five-year paper with ten-year money. So we feel very confident about our ability to fund the business through 2015 at this point.
Scott E. Peterson:  We’ll be generating a liquidity through asset sales as well as the joint venture we talked about, which will not only – it’ll pay down debt as well as keep leverage in line.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Thanks. Just wanted to comeback to demand that’s driving sort of the optimism for data center fundamentals that Bill I think you’re referenced in your prepared remarks. Sequentially supply seems to be up a little bit overall with Dallas and Houston up to Silicon Valley up really offset by little bit of decline in Northern Virginia. What can you tell us about what you’re seeing in the demand side particularly, domestically?
A. William Stein:  I’m sure Jordan, well first of all we are constricting our supply and we see supply constricting from others as well. And demand is remained strong impact that might even be stronger than it was six to twelve months ago. So based on that I think, we think market rates will inflect. And then within our own portfolio we’re seeing a positive cash market-to-market in 2015. Well I think it’s important to note here, but there is definite difference between product offerings Matt mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And by that I’m referring to share versus dedicated and we are seeing significant demand for our dedicated to end product and what would call national markets as well as the other markets while we have finished inventory. And that really lead to start conclusion that fundamentals are improving at least for our product.
Matt Miszewski: And Jordan as you think about the shared back claim versus the dedicated infrastructure. You do not have to search long for approved points, right, largely reported over supply in Northern Virginia but I can't keep the two and dedicated solution that we have there on the shelf same situation in Dallas. So you don’t need to search long and hard to find the approved points that dedicated offering that we have is different and therefore that supply is constricted.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.:  Okay, and then just maybe as a follow-up given sort of the increase in the development spending guidance surrounding sort of this optimism around demand of fundamentals and the significant recovery in the share price that we talked about. How do you feel about raising equity here given sort of where you are in the leverage spectrum positioning the balance sheet for 2015.
Matt Miszewski:  Yes, this is Matt, Jordan I think we said in our prepared remarks with some of the capital recycling initiatives that we have in our way. We don’t currently have any plans to sell equity, we've got a plan for the year that fully funds all of the capital needs that we have keep it inline with the covenants and relevant leverage ratio’s that we like to operate within particular in light of our upward revised stability outlook from S&P. So as of today, we don’t have any plans in guidance to issue any equity.
A. William Stein: And let me Jordan, I mean while the stock has done well, we still think it’s trading on a discount NAV. and we also are looking at significant what we think is a significant growth in NAV due to improving fundamentals, inventory absorption and that’s a value accretion through our development program. So we don’t think it makes sense to sell equity at this level.
Operator:  The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Jason Bilerman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Yes. It’s actually Michael Bilerman with Manny in. Bill, you got a pretty good memory from a year and a half ago. I’m curious on the distribution program, the 0 to 400. Is that all encompassing for this review that you did, I think Scott talked about 5% to 10% of the portfolio, which I think would be greater than 0 to 400 in this, they’re are really low valued assets. So I’m just curious sort of how big that portfolio is and whether you want to – you’re instead after Labor Day, assuming not all the stuff will come in at that point. So can you just sort of give a little bit more color surrounding it?
A. William Stein:  Yes, sure. I think the first part of the question. I kind of lost track here for a minute there, but we planned to initiate the program after Labor Day. So obviously, assets will bring it out. from that point, we’re not going to hit the market with every asset that we intend to – that we have slated for dispositions at that point. And then I think the question was about the size…
Michael Jason Bilerman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: You said 5% to 10%, which to me like greater than zero to 400 million. So I didn’t know whether the basket of assets is identified to eventually look what it was in excess of 400 million.
A. William Stein: Yes. So the basket of the high priority assets is in excess of that, and we’re still finalizing which ones that we’re actually going to be taken the market right after Labor Day. 
Scott E. Peterson: Hey, Michael. let me follow up though, the zero to 400 million are assets that will be sold this year that does not represent 5% to 10% of the portfolio that is slated per sale, that’s just – that sequencing and timing, that’s what would be sold this year.
Michael Jason Bilerman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Right. So what I’m trying to get a picture of is, how I assume you’re going to continue this program to next year, as you said, you want to sell 5% to 10%. how big of a disposition plan to envision happening over the next 12 months to 18 months? We will be talking that 1.5 billion of assets – 2 billion of assets.
Scott E. Peterson:  I mean what I’ve seen Michael, would say 600 million of proceeds roughly.
A. William Stein: Yes. That’s pretty close and that’s probably over the course of the next eight or nine months.
Michael Jason Bilerman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question will be a follow-up from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies LLC:  Just a quick follow-up Page 16 when I take a look at the same-store results, just kind of curious from an OpEx perspective, fairly large increases in utilities and other property operating expenses repair the maintenance and things like that, just kind of curious on why the big year-over-year bond is number one and what we should expect kind of going forward in regards to our run rate?
Matt Miszewski:  Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. There’s a couple of things, I mean some of the – some of that was as we expected in sort of including guidances, as part of our guidance we gave on margin, some of that is seasonal initiatives for preventative maintenance, to mainly just as a matter of timing. and additionally, as we’ve been rolling out some of the data center services and the ecosystem features that’s what’s driving some of that increase, which again, is all baked into the guidance that we provided. and we expect to be within the margins that we laid out as part of that guidance come in the end of the year.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies LLC: Okay, all right. 
Matt Miszewski: Thank you.
Operator:  And the next question will be a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Steve T. Sakwa – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC:  Thanks guys. I think that’s my second question, I guess maybe for Matt, as you guys have thought about kind of the lease-up potential that it takes for an asset to get from kind of starting point to stabilization. I know that number had kind of got extended out almost 12 quarters and just given the leasing environment that you’re seeing today and that seven months I guess number that you’ve talked about from a tenant signing to sort of taking occupancy. Do you think that 12-quarter stabilization period has shrunk, or is in the process of shrinking and so what do you think the right number is today?
Matt Miszewski: Yes. great question, Steve, I do think that the number is shrinking and what I’m looking for in the data is a pattern I can sort of solidify myself to give you some guidance as to what I think the new number is. There’s a number of things that go into that equation, the gap from signing to deployment is certainly one of those pieces, but the other correction that we made in the sales process helps to speed some of that up as well. So I would anticipate that we would be able to get to a more crisp number, as to what it takes for us to get fully stabilize on a building over the next few quarters. but it is improving, if I can give you a trend guidance, it’s certainly improving.
A. William Stein:  Steve, that might vary market by market though. So Northern Virginia is pretty brisk at this point and Dallas is brisk, Richardson. As Matt said, we can keep the inventory on the shelf. We built the shelf. we finished the data center and it will be fully leased within 12 months.
Matt Miszewski: And Steve, with the focus of new discipline that we have here you can expect that our focus will remain on increasing that ROIC by leasing existing inventory, but also leasing into the markets that are similarly hot that Bill just described. So you should see, like I said, I think you should see market-to-market differentiation, but you should see a constriction of that time to stabilization.
Steve T. Sakwa – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC:  Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hey, we just are confusing. it’s Manny here with Michael. I had a quick follow-up on the dispositions. Would you ever consider selling some of those pre-stabilized assets to both help the ROIC, maybe bringing some incremental proceeds and just sort of move that along especially ones that have been on that schedule for a while now?
Matt Miszewski: Yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I think that you’ll see that some of that’s around the – are in the list of high priority candidates.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: And then when you said Matt, earlier $600 million of proceeds, did you mean $600 million gross or net?
Matt Miszewski: There are gross proceeds. I think maybe, in this probably net of sales expenses on that, but pretty close.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Got it. thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. The Digital Realty 2014 second quarter earnings conference call has now concluded. We thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Arthur William Stein: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you, all of those who are joining us. I'd like to begin today by outlining our strategic vision for the company. We strive to enable our customers to build their future growth here, Digital Realty data centers around the world. We see IT as rapidly evolving from a cost center to a revenue generator. Corporate executives are widely coming to view data as a strategic asset. Data storage is a less critical function than the traffic and exchange of information. Against this backdrop, we believe proximity to major metropolitan areas such as London, New York, San Francisco and Singapore will take on renewed importance, not just for ultra-low latency applications, but for delivery of all matter of content to the broadest population bases with the deepest penetration of smartphones and connected devices. We are building a vibrant ecosystem that will enable our customers to exchange and transmit their data to myriad ultimate destinations as quickly and as efficiently as possible. If we are successful at facilitating our customer's future growth, we will also be successful at maximizing the value of our 4-data-center portfolio, and creating meaningful value for shareholders in the process. Our global footprint is a key differentiating factor. Over 90% of the business that we signed in the first quarter was with existing customers. And no one in the industry can match our ability to facilitate customer growth on a global scale. We produce high-quality data center solutions, and our cloud and network-based partnerships are nurturing an ecosystem that will likewise lead to product differentiation. This vision dovetails perfectly with our #1 objective of optimizing the return on our portfolio for driving improved return on invested capital through the lease-up of existing inventory. Matt Miszewski will have more to say regarding our progress on this front in his commentary. We are also undertaking a review of precisely which properties constitute our core portfolio. We believe capital recycling represents prudent real estate portfolio management. You can reasonably expect to see us cull the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio over the next several years. We expect to prune legacy, non-data-center assets, non-core markets and a handful of underperforming assets. Subject to our board's approval, proceeds will be used to shrink our capital structure on a leverage-neutral basis, which is to say, a portion of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt and a portion may be used to buy back stock, so long as we believe that the public market value of our portfolio is trading at a meaningful discount to its private market value. We will also continue to explore additional joint venture opportunities, which may serve to provide greater transparency on the private market value of our Turn-Key properties, in addition to the Powered Base Buildings that seeded the joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors last September. Our private capital initiative may also serve to demonstrate the significant value our development platform has created. Going forward, however, we are adopting a very disciplined approach in terms of taking on speculative development risk. For example, we now have the ability to deliver a data center pod in 12 to 16 weeks. So we no longer see the need to stockpile finished inventory, and we plan to transition to a build-to-order inventory program. Having a lease in hand before we build will enable us to reduce our risk profile, commit capital only for projects that meet our return thresholds, know our returns with certainty, and avoid accepting subpar returns under pressure. We offer a premium product and our ideal customer fully appreciates the value proposition that Digital Realty provides. This discipline will likely cause us to pass on some deals. But we believe it will lead to a healthier industry dynamic, better returns for our shareholders and a better match between the product that we offer and the customer base that appropriately values our offering. In addition to discipline, however, we must be vigilant about meeting our customer's needs. We cannot just offer them any color Model T they want so long as it's black. We must pay careful attention to the market's evolving product configuration requirements and be sure that we are equipped to provide the product that our customers [indiscernible]. Finally, we aim to implement some subtle shifts in our corporate culture. First and foremost, we will place renewed emphasis on serving customers in addition to managing properties. In our business, customer focus and value creation cannot be separated. Increased attention to our customers' business needs and technological evolution will enable us to anticipate changes, market dynamics, as well as technological shifts, and allow us to continue to match our product to market requirements, ultimately increasing the value of our portfolio. We've also entered a new era of candid dialogue with all constituents, including shareholders, as evidenced by the recent steps we've taken towards improving our disclosure. We have assembled an incredibly talented team of professionals. It is my mission to unleash the intellectual capital and creative energies of this reservoir of talent. One recent announcement that exemplifies both our efforts to unleash intellectual capital as well as our commitment to driving improved return on invested capital was Scott Peterson's promotion to Chief Investment Officer. Having closed some $6 billion in data center acquisitions, Scott is clearly one of the sector's most accomplished investors. But more importantly, he is also, in my opinion, one of the most astute. I could not be more pleased by Scott's well-deserved promotion. And now, I would like to turn the floor over to him to provide further detail on our capital allocation strategy going forward.
Scott E. Peterson: Thank you, Bill. Over the past several weeks, we have begun to evaluate every single property in our portfolio as the initial step in an assessment of our long-term performance potential. The results of this analysis will help prioritize capital allocations, decisions -- capital allocation decisions, focus individual asset strategies, and will also help identify potential disposition candidates. The preliminary conclusions of this analysis are that we have a substantial portfolio and it isn't going to turn on a dime. Improving our return on invested capital will be measured in basis points and it will be achieved over time. The only investment activity we closed during the first quarter was the contribution of a fully-leased data center for our existing joint venture with the fund managed by Prudential Real Estate Investor. This property is located in New Jersey and is fully-leased to a AA-rated financial services tenant with over 9 years of remaining lease term. It was contributed to the joint venture at a 7.1% cap rate, fully loaded for all closing costs and debt prepayment penalties. In early April, we sold a small single-tenant building to the user for approximately $42 million. We expect to book a gain on the sale of approximately $16 million in the second quarter. The only notable third-party transaction during the first quarter was Amerimar's acquisition of 401 North Broad, an Internet gateway in downtown Philadelphia. This property reportedly traded at a high 7s going-in cap rate, which does not include an estimated $70 million of projected CapEx, which would put the cap rate solidly in the 5% range. This transaction was fairly complicated to underwrite given its age, prior use and ownership structure, and we believe it will be a fair comp for these types of assets. The common theme among each of these transactions is that data centers continue to become more widely accepted as a mainstream asset class and a liquid private market is developing for these properties. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to shed some light on the demand curve and growth prospects data center investors are currently underwriting.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As shown on Page 4 of our presentation, we signed leases totaling nearly $47 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $12 million direct lease with a former subtenant of a Powered Base Building in Santa Clara. The first quarter is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, and the fact that we were able to generate a third consecutive quarter of robust leasing velocity suggests that the business is gathering momentum. We signed over $4 million of co-location revenue on the heels of a $7.7 million contribution in the fourth quarter of last year. And I am becoming increasingly optimistic that our mid-market segment should be able to deliver results within this range on a consistent basis. Cloud applications have been a major driver of our recent leasing activity, and the first quarter was no exception. In addition, we also saw healthy demand from mobile, content and social media. We leased 5 megawatts of finished inventories during the quarter, but the ending balance was essentially unchanged from year end due to new inventory coming online and a Turn-Key tenant move-out in Los Angeles. We had another strong month in April, however, and have several committed deals that should enable us to make a further dent in our finished inventory balance during the second quarter. The polar vortex did not have a pronounced effect on our operation, but we did have one large cloud requirement in Toronto that was touch-and-go to close by March 31 due to weather-related local government office closures. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow was able to stop the Digital sales team. And we closed that deal in the quarter. And I'm very proud of what the entire team has been able to accomplish together. As you can see from the numbers at the bottom of Page 5, base rates for Turn-Key Flex leases signed were higher than they have been for some time. We do see pricing as generally stable to slightly improving, but the big number in the first quarter was primarily a function of market mix, reflecting higher rates at Asia Pac, which represented fully 30% of our leasing activity this quarter. The chart on Page 6 is likewise indicative of stable to slightly improving pricing. Cash rents on renewal leases were positive, albeit just fairly, for Turn-Key as well as PBB, and GAAP re-leasing spreads were up by double digits across the board. In addition to signings, lease commencements were also quite healthy. And as you can see from the chart at the bottom right of Page 7, the weighted average GAAP between signing and commencement remains reasonable at just over 6 months. I'd like to pause here to highlight 2 data points related to the desired behavior incentivized by the new sales compensation program we rolled out at the start of this year. First, the book-to-bill cycle has stabilized at 6 months, with over 90% of the deals we've signed so far this fiscal year commencing within 12 months. Second, we have already seen market reduction in tenant improvement allowances, as well as rent grants and abatements, without any increase in comparable commissions. Now one quarter does not a trend make, but early indications are encouraging that the revamped sales compensation plan is already beginning to have its intended effect. Moving on to Page 8. The key takeaway here is that the big blue bar called 4Q '14 contractual NOI is up by over $20 million since just last quarter, entirely due to leases signed in the first 90 days of the year. At a cap rate with a 7% handle, that represents around $2 per share of NAV. Turning now to supply. The biggest change in the last 90 days is that all 24 megawatts of the shadow sublease space in Northern Virginia has been confirmed as available, up from 13 megawatts reflected on this chart last quarter. They have a very healthy demand funnel in Northern Virginia and very limited exposure. But the large block of sublease space, in addition to several recently announced competitive starts, could potentially pressure pricing in this market. We believe our solutions should be somewhat insulated, hence, most of the available inventory is shared infrastructure product in contrast to our dedicated infrastructure offering. But we will be keeping a watchful eye on the supply-and-demand dynamics in Ashburn. I should point out that we do have a large lease in Northern Virginia with a financial services tenant that was signed at peak rent and is expected to roll down in the second quarter, which will clearly have an impact on our leasings, but has been fully baked into our guidance. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier, to take us through the rest of the variables affecting our financial results. Matt?
Matt Mercier: Thank you, Matt. We had quite an active start to the year on the capital-raising front. During the first quarter, we tapped the preferred equity market for the first time in almost a year. The issuance was met with solid demand and we were able to upsize the offerings and ultimately raise gross proceeds of $365 million. We were also able to price at 7 3/8%, well below the range we had guided to previously. We also executed our second sterling bond offering, which closed in early April, raising gross proceeds of $500 million, 9.5-year paper at 4.75%, at the bottom end of the pricing range in our prior guidance. Interest rate environment remains benign for the time being, and we are pleased to have turned out the substantial majority of our short-term floating rate exposure at what we perceive to be very favorable economics. Matching with the redemption of our exchangeable debentures, $261 million of the debentures were exchanged to common equity mid-April, which had the effect of reducing debt-to-EBITDA by 0.3 turns. Credit metrics, shown here on Page 11, are pro forma for the following: first, the redemption and exchange of the exchangeable debentures; second, the sterling bond offering; third, asset sale that Scott mentioned; finally, the additional $65 million of preferred equity we raised under the reopening partial exercise with the greenshoe on the Series H, all of which closed subsequent to the end of the quarter. You can see here, pro forma for those adjustments, net debt to adjusted EBITDA dropped 5x. Fixed charge coverage remains above 3x. With annualized adjusted EBITDA of over $900 million, we have more than $450 million of borrowing capacity while maintaining leverage below 5.5x. We do not expect to raise common equity on this year's remaining capital [indiscernible]. Asset sales may also be a potential source of capital. Our guidance contemplates an additional dollar-denominated debt issuance, which could be either a dollar bond offering or a term loan. However, the timing has likely been pushed back from mid-year towards the year end, given the larger-than-expected preferred equity offerings, as well as the prospects of potential proceeds from asset sales. Turning now to earnings. We reported first quarter core FFO per share of $1.28, or $0.10 above consensus. Roughly half of the analyst estimates and consensus appeared to reflect the severance charge for a former CEO and the other half do not. On an apples-to-apples basis, core FFO per share would likely have been $0.05 above consensus. As Bill indicated on our last earnings call, the timing and execution of our financing activities, as well as the incremental revenue expected from speculative leasing represented the primary wildcard in our 2014 forecast. We are pleased to report we have made considerable progress on both fronts, having raised $865 million of capital previously discussed, and having reduced volumes of speculative leasings contemplated in our guidance by 50%. As a result, we have raised core FFO per share guidance to $4.80 to $4.90 a share. Solid leasing activity to date has largely derisked the low end of the range, but potential future asset sales and joint ventures represent additional wildcards. But I'd also like to point out a few items to begin to bridge your own forecasts from our 1Q annualized core FFO per share to the 2Q through 4Q quarterly run rate applied at the midpoint of our range. First, as shown on Page 12, 5.9% blended coupons on the $865 million long-term capital we raised year-to-date is almost exactly 425 basis points higher than the all-in cost of our line of credit. 425 basis points on $865 million equals $37 million, or just about $0.07 a share per quarter, as shown on the chart. Second, joint venture contributions, the asset sale and the effect of 1Q expirations will be dilutive to the tune of $0.02 per quarter. Finally, operating expenses and overhead are both expected to pick up over the course of the year, which will reduce the run rate by another $0.01 per quarter. The upshot is that the core quarterly run rate is roughly $1.18 to $1.19 per share, essentially in line with the midpoint of the revised core FFO per share guidance range of $4.80 to $4.90 we've provided in the press release. Shifting gears to operational performance. Our tenant retention was uncharacteristically low this quarter due primarily to a PBB move-out in Minneapolis, and occupancy slipped again as a result. However, we expect occupancy to begin to improve going forward. I would like to highlight 2 new variables with the assumptions underlying guidance that speak to our view of internal growth prospects going forward. The first is we are projecting portfolio occupancy at year end of 92% to 93%. Second, same-capital cash NOI growth of 4% to 5%. This concludes today's prepared remarks. I would like -- I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator. We are pleased to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: My first question has to do with -- obviously, you touched on the retention rate and the occupancy as being connected. A question I have relative to the leasing statistics was across the board on both new and renewal leases, the terms or the lease length appear to be significantly shorter. Can you give us a little bit of background on maybe the composition that drove the shorter terms?
Arthur William Stein: So we think that we are living in an improving fundamental environment. So we're actually quite comfortable living with shorter lease terms. In the first quarter, we did have a number of leases with lower-than-average lease terms. But it really varies. So the current pipeline has leases that are also quite a bit longer than what you saw on the first quarter. And our mid-market initiative is designed to even out some of that lumpiness. I just want to remind you that the first quarter is our third consecutive quarter of strong leasing volume. And we saw very stable pricing in the quarter. And in addition, we saw very encouraging results from mid-market initiative, which as Matt said, we're expecting $4 million to $7 million a quarter of mid-market revenues. So to sum up, we think the first quarter demonstrates the continued strength of the overall demand environment.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Great. And then, my follow-up question, Bill, is just relative to your comment on increasingly looking at future joint ventures. Does the company have any outline as to the scope and the nature of those joint ventures? Or is it early days still?
Arthur William Stein: Well, it's still early days. We do have a potential joint venture on Turn-Key assets. We're evaluating that right now in the context of the larger capital recycling initiative. And we are looking at potentially using joint venture capital to fund our growth initiatives in Asia Pac.
Operator: Our next question is from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Terrific. So the press release refers to pricing being, I think, it said generally stable to slightly improving, and you mentioned the strength in Asia Pac. But if you could provide us more pricing color by region, including around the U.S., are there any particular standout markets, good or bad, right now?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. Thanks for the question. The pricing differential, and we did talk about sort of the standout piece and with the good deal of the Q1 leasing being in Asia Pac, and certainly is significant that the pricing in Asia Pac remains strong. We do see relatively stable pricing throughout the U.S. with some small pockets of potential increased pricing power in areas like New York metro, and I would say stabilized pricing power in the places where most of our new deals are landing, including Ashburn, Dallas and Chicago.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then, for my follow-up, which is related, just regarding the supply by region that you provided back at the Investor Day. Are you prepared with any stats? Could you update on -- us on that in terms of excess supply? The number of quarters of supply by region? Or can you just give us a feel directionally for how much that's improved?
Matthew J. Miszewski: So certainly, I'd be happy to refer to some of the trends that we've seen in the first quarter, as well as sort of an update to where we are in -- from Investor Day. And I did make mention during my prepared remarks about Northern Virginia certainly as a standout area that has got some reported strength in terms of the supply that's out there. And I do want to make sure that we color this the correct way. The supply announcements that happened in Northern Virginia were primarily what we refer to as shared infrastructure supply as opposed to our dedicated infrastructure supply that we have in that same market. So the industry does need to mature to the point that it takes into account some of these product differentiations. But across the board, we certainly did see an increase in supply. As I just mentioned, in terms of pricing, we are not seeing the macroeconomic event that would suggest there would be pricing pressure in that market for us, as our pricing ability in Northern Virginia remains relatively strong. I believe, at Investor Day, we discussed a little bit about Silicon Valley supply as well. And all of these things need to be taken as a whole. Supply, of course, exists in Silicon Valley. And there were some announcements that would suggest additional supply. But we have seen, on our side, in my team, a demand curve that's actually shifting up and to the right. And so, that demand characteristic matches up with the supply that we currently have in that particular environment, which by the end of this half will be small to nonexistent.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great. Yes. Just, first of all, it's another great quarter of leasing. And I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of either verticals or applications that you're seeing the demand come out of? And I guess, as a sub-question to that, just wondering how much of your leasing comes through an RFP process versus sort of an outgoing calling effort?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Happy to talk a little bit more about the leasing success and the vertical orientation, some of the leasing. We saw significant movement in terms of social media, the cloud being sort of a dominant part of the last 3 quarters of our progress, as well as some movement and some positive movements in terms of mobile applications, as well as content delivery. We believe that the progress in each of those areas in Q1 is indicative of the health of our ecosystem as we move forward. Each one of those has been identified as drivers of data center demand. But as we see us landing and capturing that demand, we think that bodes well for us.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great. And in terms of the RFPs?
Matthew J. Miszewski: So, yes, it's very interesting. I think we commented that 90% of our Q1 deals came from repeat customers of ours. And when we see repeat customers of ours, oftentimes, more than likely, we see those deals before they go out officially to RFP. So we see a good mixture of RFP-related demand, but we also, because of the relationships and the long-term relationships that we've had with our customers and the performance of our operational staff, we actually have a tendency to get some first looks prior to RFPs being released, then we have the ability to capture that demand pretty well.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great. I don't know if I'm going to break some rules here, but I was wondering if you guys might tell us a little bit about how you're interconnected data center effort is going. And what kind of demand you saw for the bandwidth between your facilities?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. As you know, we are a big advocate of the digital ecosystem and that was -- the respect that I had for that process was based upon the promise of the digital ecosystem. During the first quarter, I got to see -- I was lucky enough to see the promise of that ecosystem now start to deliver itself in terms of actual results. And so -- and this was maybe a little less obvious in the prepared remarks that we had earlier. But we do believe that there's a shift happening in the data center market that used to focus on data storage as the highest-placed value, and now really focuses on the exchange of information as part of that value. When we started the digital ecosystem -- network ecosystem process, we had done it as a way to increase deal liquidity and to increase the size of those deals as they come out. We did see in Q1 some direct revenues that actually came out of that effort as well. So we're pretty happy to see the outcome be both direct and indirect to our bottom line.
Operator: Our next question is from Charles Croson in Barclays.
Charles Croson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Charles, standing in for Ross. So in terms of this retail push and taking that into context with the shifting to a more build-to-suit model, how does that work? Because I imagine that you're not building out an entire data center anymore for a few retail-based tenants. Can you kind of tease out how that all works?
Arthur William Stein: So the buy-to-order, if you will, is really more targeted at the enterprise market. And the middle market would still require that inventory be available. So that tends to be absorbed very quickly after signing.
Charles Croson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And, Bill, I apologize if you had mentioned this at the start of the call. I got on a little late. Do you have any updates in terms of the CEO search in terms of timeline, a potential short list of candidates?
Arthur William Stein: Sure. Well, the update is that the search has started. So a recruiting firm has been retained and the expectation is that the process will be concluded some time in 2014. But in the meantime, the board and the Chairman of the Board, in particular, has indicated that he's confident with the current leadership that's in place. And the board is really focused on finding the right candidate versus rushing to find the candidate in an arbitrary period of time.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. Bill, maybe a follow-up on the last question. For the CEO search process, I mean, can you maybe talk about what criteria, if any, have been identified for that "right candidate?" And then, second question, maybe one for Scott. Just wondering if you can comment on where your visibility is on some of the asset sales as part of the capital recycling program. And maybe, what the potential magnitude of that could be this year?
Arthur William Stein: Stephen, the criteria is really what you would expect for the CEO of any public company, and particularly one that's in the data center space. So it's an individual that is experienced in data centers, ideally, specifically, real estate, as a subset, technology and finance. But let me -- I want to reiterate here though that the company is really focused right now on pursuing its strategic vision during this interim period. And that represents optimizing our return on portfolio, recycling our capital, as Scott will speak to, and unleashing the intellectual capital of the organization.
Scott E. Peterson: Part of the visibility on the asset sales, it's a little early in the process to speak to specifics on that. So we probably will have a better idea of some of the order of magnitude maybe in the next call. The general plan, though, is that we will sell the non-data center assets, the non-core markets, underperforming assets and evaluate the potential underperforming assets. And as Bill stated earlier, we'd expect to cull the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio over the next few years.
Operator: Our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just want to go back to the comments regarding sort of the more customer-centric focus today, which I think is definitely the right direction. In the past, the focus has been more on sort of standardization of processes and some of the scale benefits through the development program when you were -- was a bigger part of the story. I was just curious how you guys balance the benefits of that scale and standardization versus sort of more customized -- custom service-oriented solutions and maybe possibly more customized data centers.
Arthur William Stein: Sure, Vincent. So we think that it's possible to do both. So we basically build in blocks or modules. I think you've probably seen our presentations where you see how we build electrical rooms in Dallas, and it's been trucked up to our data center sites. So really, I think the issue is the level of redundancy that a particular customer might need. And we can adjust that through the assembly process, still maintain the cost efficiencies that we've achieved.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And maybe just a follow-on to that question. I mean, as the industry continues to evolve and change, you guys talked about the supply in Northern Virginia being mostly shared infrastructure versus dedicated. I mean, are you seeing that sentiment change at all in terms of is there -- is the pool of folks that really just want dedicated versus shared as big as it has ever been? Or are you starting to see some of that barrier come down as people get more comfortable with the overall outsourced model?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes, that's a great question. And I would say that I certainly came in as a newcomer to the industry this last year with some of those same types of questions. I'd say that the past 3 quarters of very solid, dedicated infrastructure revenue that we produced is a pretty good testament to a strong and growing market out there for that particular type of product. But as Bill said, we can't keep our eyes closed to particularly new customer demands that are out there. We need to be open to that. And I think that the secret sauce moving forward is truly sort of getting the pieces that we have traditionally provided, that our customers have paid us for over the years. And coupling that together with what some of our partners provide to provide solutions that they're seeking in a new environment. And when we can do that, we find that the value that they're seeking matches well the value that we provide. And that's what we're going to try to do moving forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Bill, in order to avoid maybe a surprise next quarter, you already alluded to a lease with a financial services tenant that was going to roll down. Maybe, you could give us the magnitude of that roll-down. And how many more such leases that would be material we might see over the next year or so?
Arthur William Stein: Sure. Firstly, I want to emphasize, Bill, that rolldown is in our guidance. So there shouldn't be any surprise from that standpoint. And the -- we expect that rents could roll down in the 15% to 20% range for that lease.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Anything more over the course of the year that you think is going to pop up of that magnitude?
Arthur William Stein: No.
Operator: Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes. I just have 2 questions. The first one being the 4% same-store cash NOI growth that you're projecting for the year. I'm just -- if you give a little bit more color on how you roll up to that number, because your occupancy, you're going to gain somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points. The mark-to-markets are probably going to be flat to modestly positive. I'm just kind of struggling a little bit how to kind of roll on that up to a 4% kind of same-store cash NOI growth number.
Matt Mercier: Yes, Tayo, this is Matt. Good question. So we've got 2.5% to 3% basically coming from -- we're talking about cash NOI growth. So we got 2.5% to 3% coming from just embedded rent bumps. And we've got probably 60 to 80 basis points from some of the expirations that we've talked about. And then, we also have another 2.5% to 3% coming from free rents of ramps that are burning off from the embedded portfolio, as well with some additional staggered lease commencements that were part of leasing we've done over the last year.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Got it, okay. That is helpful. And then, the second question is, one of your peers mentioned that they were actively working through the Facebook sublease in Santa Clara. Just kind of wondering, at this point, if you guys are doing anything with Facebook and where kind of things stand?
Arthur William Stein: Scott?
Scott E. Peterson: We don't make comments about individual customers, but we've enjoyed a great deal of success with Facebook, both as it started out a company and grew inside Digital's data centers. And we continue to see that progress moving forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: I think you may have addressed this earlier, but the decline in guidance for spec revenue for this year that's just -- is that related to a longer-than-expected commencement lag?
Matt Mercier: No. I mean, this is a positive thing. It's actually -- the spec revenue we've cut in half. So meaning, we've signed up and expect to commence $15 million to $20 million of what we had in the prior quarter. So that leaves a -- or $10 million to $15 million, I'm sorry. And now, we have another $10 million to $15 million left for the year. But it's a positive.
Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: It's not a cumulative number?
Matt Mercier: It's not a cumulative number.
Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. I was a little bit confused on that. Okay. But that helps. And then, I guess, a question for Bill or Scott, just on the guidance on cap rates. I guess, your max contribution could be $400 million, if I read that correctly. And your average cap rate that you're projecting is about a 7%, and I seem to recall that you guys have said that Turn-Key would be a big component of that, or potentially a meaningful component. And so, I'm just curious if that's the right inference that you guys think that a JV partner is going to pay basically a 7% cap for Turn-Key. And if that's not really much of a spread in cap rate over Powered Base, I'm just wondering if you can help us with the right conclusions to draw from what we're seeing in your guidance?
Arthur William Stein: Yes. I think that is a fair inference. And by the way, I want to go back to your question on leasing. The guidance was cut in half because of the leasing we did, not because we don't think we're going to do anymore leasing. I just want to make that clear. But we do think that -- I mean, I think, your analysis is correct that the 7-ish is probably the accurate cap rate to use on the Turn-Key for joint ventures. Scott, do you have anything you want to add?
Scott E. Peterson: I think that's probably it. Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: First, I wanted to take a stab at the run rate that you ran through, Matt, on the guidance, starting out at $1.28, and then walking us down to $1.18 to $1.19. I guess what I didn't hear in there was any incremental contribution from the core growth that you're anticipating, as well as the impact of any new leasing in the speculative revenue. And I was wondering if there are offsets to those drivers.
Matt Mercier: Yes. Well, clearly, we have a backlog of NOIs we've shown. But the run rate's meant to project where we expect to be starting as of the second quarter. I think there's a couple of other things to keep in mind. First, as we've shown, we did have dispositions, but that's bringing down the run rate. And in addition, we have contemplated an additional capital raise in the year. So that provides some additional headwind that we could be facing, as well as our development program runs down. I think we've talked about in the past that there's capitalized interest that will be coming down. So again, this is just meant to project where we'll be starting as we enter the second quarter.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. Just a follow-up, I think, Matt Miszewski, you mentioned in your commentary that the inventory remained relatively flat sequentially, as you brought on a little bit more inventory and you had a move-out in LA of a Turn-Key customer. So if you could -- so one, I'm curious about the nature of the move-out. But separately, can you just speak to the amount of inventory you would like to have available ideally going forward?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So I don't think that -- to the question, I don't -- we always sort of bandy about the conversation about what the optimal amount of ready inventory is. But given Bill's comments about the just-in-time inventory adjustment that we're going to make, given that we can deliver within [indiscernible], it becomes a little less of a pressing issue for us. We simply don't see the need for us to hold on to a significant amount of inventory because we're able to satisfy the customer's needs relatively quickly. And I think I may have talked about this at Investor Day, as well. So you may want to refer back to that. The move-out is an interesting story. It was about a 300-kilowatt move-out. And in order for us to do that -- really the organization that did that was consolidating their operations, and they did that out [ph].
Operator: Our next question is from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Michael Bilerman, here, with Manny. So Bill, just had a question. As you think about when the board made the decision to make a change with Mike and let him go, you've titled this whole presentation in the supplemental, "Turning A New Path Forward." I'm just curious, is this your new path forward that you've presented to the board? Or is Chairman of the Board and transition committee putting forth a new path forward?
Arthur William Stein: This is a new path forward that both I and the senior leadership team have created. And we presented it to the board, and we're presenting it to shareholders clearly, and we're going to be rolling it out to the employees as well.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And so, how should we think about -- I assume, the board is thinking about a search process, both internal and external. And I'm not sure if you're raising your hand, or you have raised your hand. But I would assume, and if it is, if you're not the guy, and the new CEO comes in, they may have their own ideas about what path that they want to take, and their ideas about where they want to go. And isn't the board pigeonholing themselves a little bit? Or are you opening up investors to a secondary path forward when a new CEO comes into place, if you're not the person?
Arthur William Stein: Mike, well, I mean, I think these are pretty basic and fundamental in terms of a strategic vision. So optimizing a return on the portfolio, recycling capital, unleashing the intellectual capital of our workforce, is motherhood and apple pie? And I can't really see anyone else disagreeing with those initiatives.
Operator: Our next question is from Gabriel Hilmoe of UBS.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just going back to the spec revenue number for a minute, and what's been derisked so far. Are there any other moving parts in that number where you've added some additional spec relative to the $20 million to $30 million that you had in there before? Is that clearly here [ph], or has it truly been derisked, I guess, by 50%.
Matt Mercier: Can you repeat that? The first half was kind of lost.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess, just on the spec revenue number, is it -- is the $20 million to $30 million, and I guess, now it's $10 million to $15 million, is that truly an apples-to-apples comparison? Or has anything been added on a go forward basis that's new spec revenue I guess?
Matt Mercier: I mean, that isn't apples-to-apples. I mean, just to be clear, it reflects what we expect to recognize from -- on a revenue basis from new leasing. It doesn't include re-leasing or renewal-type activity. So this is new incremental leasing. And at the start of the year, as we've noted, we had $20 million to $30 million expected from -- we expected to sign and commence from new leasing. And as a result of the strong first quarter results, we've cut that in half.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then, I apologize if you mentioned this before, but how much of the leasing in the quarter was related to, I guess, the mid-market strategy? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that played out in the numbers?
Matthew J. Miszewski: I think, it's in there. But $4.1 million was related to colocation mid-market strategy.
Operator: Our next question is from George Auerbach of ISI Group.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Matt, you mentioned the pre-stabilized bucket has some assets moving in and out. Do you have a number for what the lease percentage would have been quarter-over-quarter had that bucket remained static?
Matt Mercier: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. The pre-stabilized bucket, the $500 million of assets that's now 10% leased and was 17%. I know there's things moving in and out. Just trying to figure out what -- at year end, it was 17% leased, where would that have been today had you not sort of moved some assets in and out of that portfolio?
Matt Mercier: I don't have the ins and outs in front of me. I'm sure that's something we can follow up on.
Arthur William Stein: But, Steve (sic) [George], just to be clear, one of the reasons that percentage went down is that we took some properties out of that bucket that were signed and shown as leased last quarter, and were moved out because the lease has commenced. So that caused the percentage to -- percentage lease decline. And in addition, we delivered some new pods to the bucket as well. Those are pods at Melbourne and St. Louis. So in Phoenix, we commenced leases that have already been signed. They moved out of the bucket. We also -- I mentioned some leases in New York and, again, that bucket percentage will go down. But at the end of the day, this is going to represent our finished inventory. It has to be leased. So I think you would expect, but for properties that are signed but not commenced, that lease percentage should be relatively low until the lease has commenced.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Right. I guess I was just trying to think of some sort of measure, how you're doing leasing up that finished inventory? So I was just trying to figure out, as you went from Q4 into Q1, how much was done? And I guess, maybe, the question is, of the $500 million that's in the pipeline today, at 10% or 11% leased, on a same-store basis, where do you think that portfolio is on a lease percentage -- occupied percentage by year end '14?
Matthew J. Miszewski: So I don't know if I've got that exact number. But I think what you're going for, between Q4 and Q1, I'm always careful about the word I use, but we did burn about 5 megawatts of that inventory. And moving forward, we feel like we've got a target on burning even more of that inventory in Q2. I think that gets towards your question.
Matt Mercier: And just to follow-up. Most of that space is not in the pre -- is not going to be in the same capital pool. It's going to be in -- it's new space. And I think that I would refer you back to the 92% to 93% overall total portfolio occupancy that we're guiding to. We're at 92.1% to date. So clearly, that suggests that we expect to lease a decent amount of that pool in the remainder of the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes. I was interested in the comments about one-size-fits-all. And I don't know if you answered it earlier or not. But you talked about, Bill, all Model Ts and being black, and so forth. And are you -- is there something different in terms of the technical specifications or parameters of the product around density or size that you were alluding to that's going to be different going forward? And then, my second question is, if you could speak to kind of the European market, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and so forth, and where you're seeing strength? And what kind of a competitive environment it is?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So great question about the product development that may be needed as we continue our customer focus moving forward. And you get right to the heart of what this senior leadership team over the past few weeks had struggled with and come to some conclusions about. We don't believe that there is a significant departure in terms of density and size, and what I call the building blocks of the solutions that our customers are seeking. The building blocks from our perspective will remain, space and power that we have delivered over time. They will also leverage our digital ecosystem in terms of the network deployments that we have made and that we have been able to leverage from some of our partners. And then, they will take some pieces from our partner ecosystem in the new Digital partner network, including items like managed services, cloud service provision, and the like, and they will be coupled together into solutions that our customers want. So in terms of what we need to provide from Digital's perspective, it remains in our wheelhouse. The density and size doesn't even change a whole lot. There may be a few things that we need to provide an individual market that maybe a little more dense or a little less dense, or a little larger, a little smaller. But the general facilities that we provide will continue to be the facilities we'll provide in the future for our customers. But the solutions will be different and will be tailored to their needs.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan -- a follow-up from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Reading a lot about data centers being built with no resiliency, no redundancies, so I guess, N, and obviously, the cost structure around that is a lot less. You guys have flexibility in terms of the redundancy that you can deliver to your customers. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any demand around that.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So great question, Jonathan. We see a lot of demand. And it really, from a resiliency perspective, plays the gamut. But the greatness of sort of our POD 3.0 architecture is we can deliver the components that our customers are asking for within the same time frame from market-to-market. So we had an example in 2013, where someone did come to us with a solid N requirement and we were able to deploy a data center solution whose cost profile met their price profile and met exactly what they were looking for in terms of resiliency. So I think that if there is anything changing, folks are moving more towards our incremental process so that they can actually address differing needs without addressing -- without significantly augmenting the cost to deploy.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session and conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Digital Realty Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) In the interest of providing fair access to all participants, we do ask that you limit your questions to a single question and a single follow-up. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
John Stewart: Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call.

In addition to the press release and supplemental disclosure package we put out yesterday, we’ve also posted a presentation to the Investors section of our website to accompany management’s prepared remarks. You’re welcome to download the presentation and follow along throughout the call. Before we begin, I’d like to remind everyone that management may make forward-looking statements on this call. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Forward-looking statements include statements related to future financial and other results, including 2014 guidance and the underlying assumptions. For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will also contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations of such non-GAAP items and reconciliations to net income are contained in our supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website at digitalrealty.com. Management’s prepared remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. Once again, questions will be limited to two per caller and if you have additional questions, please feel free to jump back in the queue. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Foust.
Mike Foust: Great. Thank you very much John and welcome to the call everyone. As we discussed at our Investor Day last November, driving improved return on invested capital, especially to the lease up of existing inventory is the top priority across our organization. And I’m pleased to say that we made very good headway in that front during the fourth quarter. As you can see on the first page of our presentation, we achieved record lease signings in the fourth quarter which also propelled the full year total for 2013 to our best year ever. In addition, we made good progress and we absorbed -- absorbing 12 of the 54 megawatts of finished turn-key inventory we had on hand at Investor Day last November. We’re also pleased by the higher than anticipated contribution from the mid-market and colocation sales initiatives. We signed $7.7 million of annualized GAAP colocation revenue during the fourth quarter which is likewise a record high quarter for this segment. We don’t believe that the strong fourth quarter volume was an anomaly as our mid-market sales team is ramping up with management sales directors now in place. We’re encouraged by the early results and we’re cautiously optimistic on the prospects for repeat performances in the quarters ahead. As you can see from the numbers at the bottom of page 2, base rents for our Turn-Key Flex product were lower than they had been in the recent quarters. However, this is primarily a function of market mix and was not due to rental rate erosion during the fourth quarter. Specifically fourth quarter leasing activity was heavily skewed by large cloud requirements in Ashburn, Virginia and in Dallas Richardson, Texas where absolute rent levels are lower than our global markets in Europe and Asia-Pac and elsewhere in the U.S. Most importantly from my perspective, the rents achieved during the fourth quarter represented consistent, very attractive returns in our invested capital in these markets. Turning now to page 3, affirming of market rents was also apparent in our re-leasing spreads on renewal leases signed during the quarter. Cash year one rents and Turn-Key Flex and colo renewal leases rolled down only a little less than 1% and the overall mark-to-market was up over 3%, driven by another strong quarter of significantly positive cash re-leasing spreads and our Powered-Base Building products. This increase included but not exclusive to the renewal several of large long-term [Econex] leases. Overall, PBB lease renewals increased by 27% on a cash basis and fully 51% on a GAAP basis, reflecting long term growing cash flow for these leases. In addition to signings, lease commencements were also healthy. The fourth quarter was our third best commencement quarter ever. And as you can see from the chart, at the bottom right of page 4, the weighted average GAAP between signing and commencement of these leases was only just over 5 months. Moving onto page 5, the backlog of signed leases translates to an incremental $28 million of GAAP NOI in 2014, with an additional $48 million beyond that. We would remind you that this solid backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced represents contractual obligations for future rental revenue, setting stage for healthy growth and cash flows over the intermediate term. Clearly leasing momentum picked up in the second half of the year. That momentum is carried forward into the first quarter, although slowed down a bit from the rapid pace in the fourth quarter. We feel very good about the first quarter leasing activity, particularly based on deals in the final stages of our sales process. But as typically the case, signings do appear to be back end loaded towards the end of the quarter. Overall, our team is engaged with more leased prospects than ever, representing over $3 million rentable square feet of 2014 requirements. Now, turn to some of the demand drivers. In addition to the success of the mid-market and colocation initiatives, large scale cloud deployments represented a significant portion of our fourth quarter leasing activity as well as demand in 2014 and above. Cloud infrastructure and applications are major data center demand drivers as represented here on page six of our presentation. And these cloud requirements accounted for over 60% of 2013 lease signings. IBM Software is a prime example. And many of you have seen them in January, IBM announced plans to spend $1.2 billion to open 15 new cloud data centers worldwide. We are working with IBM Software to ensure that we remain their trusted data center partner for much of their global expansion needs. As you can see from the top tenants’ table, in our supplemental package that IBM is now our second largest tenant, representing over 5.5% of total revenues. We believe that we have a portfolio best capable of supporting IBM’s cloud platform on a global scale, much as we have with software over the past several years of their rapid growth. Turning now to supply, the data center brokerage practice at Avison Young recently reported that there was 20% less wholesale data center inventory available for immediate occupancy or scheduled to be delivered by the end of the first quarter relative to this time last year. It is certainly consistent with our experience and you can see from the charts on pages seven and eight that new supply remains relatively muted in most major markets across the U.S. One change of note in the past 90 days is that 13 megawatts of Yahoo sublease space in Northern Virginia not in digital data centers has been confirmed as available and it has been reflected as such in our charts. We have seen several recent announcements of potential competitive starts in Northern Virginia and we are keeping watchful eye on the supply and demand dynamic in that market. But the fact is that Ashburn is a national market; it accounted for over 25% of our total leasing [environment] in 2013 and due to our continued leasing success in Northern Virginia it is a market where we continue to strategically invest our capital. We have a significant pipeline of good customers in that market today. I’d like to turn to compensation. Finally before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to address a couple of changes to our programs. First of all, we recently restructured sales compensation program to more optimally incentivize the sales force. Specifically we’ve emphasized a handful of simple controllable lever that will more closely align their variable compensation with our corporate objectives, particularly absorption of existing inventory, current year cash returns and lease term. In addition, our Board of Directors recently approved a new long-term incentive compensation plan for senior management based entirely on total shareholder return relative to the RMS index, as shown here on page nine of the presentation. In recognition of the comparably low starting point following last year’s stock price performance, the hurdles have been set approximately 300 basis points higher than REIT peers with comparable relative return plans. In the entire (inaudible) we’ll forfeited if we don’t have lease performing line with the RMS over the three year measurement period. Similar to the philosophy behind the sales compensation program, this plan has been designed to incentivize the creation of long-term shareholder value in the more closely aligned management’s interest with those of shareholders. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill to take us through our financial performance and earnings outlook.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. Starting with the balance sheet metrics on page 10, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was unchanged from third quarter at 5.4 times and fixed charge coverage improved slightly to a healthy 3.3 times. The balance on our $2 million line of credit stood at $725 million at year-end. And subject to market conditions, we expect to term out most of our borrowings on the line of credit with the combination of preferred equity and to our long-term debt over the course of the year. It is not our intent to take an outside interest rate risk and we’ve entered into a swap lock to hedge a potential U.S. bond offering midyear. Turning now to page 11, our Board of Directors recently approved a 6% dividend increase. This is the 12th dividend increase since our IPO in 2004. And as you can see on the chart, we’ve grown the per share dividend at a 14% compounded annual growth rate over that time. As we noted in yesterday’s earnings release and as outlined here on page 12, we acquired a datacenter in New Jersey for $35 million or $327 per square-foot late last year. The property is 100% triple net leased to an AA-rated financial services tenant with over nine years of remaining lease term. The existing debt structure was complex and the seller was required to close by year-end. As a result, the seller chose to negotiate with the most credible buyer in the industry and we were able to structure transaction at a going in yield of roughly 100 basis points over market. The going in cash cap rate was 9%, but we closed the project with the expectation that we would retire the existing mortgage and would incur a $4 million prepayment penalty which would run through P&L bringing the effective cap rate to 8%. We’ve subsequently reached an agreement with Prudential Real Estate Investors core fund to contribute the asset to the joint venture that we formed with them last fall. The terms will be similar to the existing structure and we expect to earn a healthy double-digit return on our 20% equity stake in the property. The joint venture will assume, but expects to prepay the in place debt and will incur the prepayment penalty. The contribution is expected to close by the end of the first quarter. Given the current cost and availability of capital, we remain sharply focused on discipline capital allocation. At the same time this transaction is an example of how we will also continue to take advantage of opportunities that arise and are aligned with our core competencies to create value for shareholders with the judicious deployment of capital. Turning now to earnings, our fourth quarter FFO per share came in $0.10 higher than the third quarter and the final 2013 outlook we’ve provided on the last earnings call. As shown on page 13, the primary sources of upside include $0.04 per share due to lower financing cost, the delayed execution of both the preferred equity offering and the Sterling bond issuance that we previously expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2003 along with higher than expected capitalize interest. It is important to note here that we’re expecting a significant reduction in capitalized interest for 2014 as we slowdown our development spending and that is one of the reasons why the bid in the fourth quarter does not automatically fall through to higher guidance for 2014. In addition, there is $0.02 of upside relative to our prior forecast due to lower bonus accruals. And this is evenly split between corporate G&A and property level compensation. In other words half was above the NOI line. Third one penny was due to other revenue and fee income which included a few small items such as a bit of development fee income and a small gain on the sale of the land parcel. Four, we had one penny of tailwind from favorable foreign currency exchange rates during the fourth quarter. And last but not least, we have picked up a penny of savings at the property operating expense line, primarily from reduction in discretionary spending. Our NOI margin excluding utility reimbursements were 74.2% in the fourth quarter and we expect a similar margin in the first quarter of 2014, as well as for the full year. We are maintaining 2014 guidance that we provided in early January for core FFO per share of $4.75 to $4.90. On the heels of the beat in the fourth quarter, the year over FFO per share growth rate admittedly looks like, but I would remind you that it’s largely a function of what we believe to be prudent balance sheet management along with the dilution from the joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors that we closed in the third quarter late last year, I am sorry, late in the third quarter last year. I would also like to point out that the greatest variable for guidance is financing, the timing and the cost of financings that we plan for the year. Finally as part of our ongoing commitment to excellence and financial reporting, I am pleased to report that we have recently engaged former [AMB] Chief Information Officer (inaudible) separate and integrate our existing IT systems and design leading future data center business intelligence platform. We expect to have more report on these initiatives as they progress over the next several years. Similarly we have made several enhancements to our quarterly supplemental package in direct response to feedback from the investment community on our disclosure practices. Most notably we provided a detailed components of net asset value calculation on page 12 of the supp. We added a second table to our same-store analysis on page 16 showing a same capital calculation which is our attempt to provide you a better measure of the true organic growth since our traditional same-store disclosure included properties under redevelopment. We have also provided the IT load by market across the portfolio for the first time on page 24. We have added a development lifecycle schedule on page 30 through 32 with market level detail on our development pipeline and finished inventory. We have added a comprehensive schedule on page 33 of our current and historical capital expenditures, reconciling our supplemental CapEx disclosure to the footnotes in the 10-K, as well as the statement of cash flows. And last but not least, we have provided summary balance sheets and the income statements for our unconsolidated joint ventures which allow you to ride at our pro-rata share of unconsolidated JV debt as well as NOI. We aim to continue to improve the transparency of our financial disclosures overtime. And we welcome additional input from analysts and investors in that process. This concludes today’s prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call back to the operator and we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator?
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Emmanual Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanual Korchman - Citi: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just, Bill if we think about your 2014 guidance, I appreciate point on higher capitalized interest and conservative financing, but maybe you can help us bridge the gap sort of between your Investor Day presentation and the slide deck today, specifically if you look at slide 54 of the larger presentation slide five, today, it looks like your contractual NOI is much higher going into the year versus where you thought it would be. So I’m surprised that that hasn’t flown through the guidance? And similarly slide 53, which was the backlog, looks like it’s increased significantly as well, if we look at slide four today and again that didn’t seem to sort of flow into the topline may be you can help us sort of bridge that?
Bill Stein: So, NOI, we expect that Q1 NOI will be slightly higher than the run rate at the end of Q4, but the reason that hasn’t flown through the bottom of FFO is because there is probably around $0.15 of financing costs, $0.15 per share.
Emmanual Korchman - Citi: For those already in guidance, so why should that change? What we know is your contractual NOI for ‘14 is up $71 million from Investor Day that’s $0.05 and the NOI was higher in the fourth quarter than you thought. So the run rate is more aggressive. The financing, if anything got delayed and if anything is at better pricing, because rates are falling. And so how is guidance not moving up? We’re just taking your numbers.
Mike Foust: Well, and this is Mike. And on one hand, the financings are occurring later than we had anticipated. And we’re also being conservative in our outlook since it is early in the year.
Emmanual Korchman - Citi: So that should be accretive right, this is happening later to more accretive the guidance, your NOI is at least [$0.05] higher today than where you thought it was in the Investor Day? So, is the 475 to 490 just not a good range to use anymore or is it some negative offset that’s happened that you are not telling us about?
Mike Foust: No, we expect leasing was higher on Investor Day than it is today obviously, because we leased up a lot of space in the fourth quarter.
Emmanual Korchman - Citi: Alright. Thanks guys.
Mike Foust: Thanks Emman.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a little bit about the same store occupancy rate? I guess I’m trying to put the 60 bps sequential decline and the 210 bps year-over-year decline in 2013 into some perspective given what was a record growth leasing year? So what should we be thinking about for our same store occupancy in 2014? And then as part of that, can you talk about the tenant retention ratio particularly for Turn-Key which I think was 79% last year and just talk a little bit about where you expect that to be?
Mike Foust: Sure. What’s interesting to note that while we had a slight tick down in occupancy overall, if you look at the amount of space that’s leased in the portfolio, it continues to go up every quarter. So we have had occupied square-footage of 19.8 million overall this fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter of 19.55 million. So we’re bringing on more space and as that’s inventory so that inventory goes into your denominator and then as that space gets leased up we will increase our percentage occupancy. So, the good news is we continue to have net positive leasing and we’ve never had more occupied space than today. And so we expect that we will start catching up and continue to absorb that existing inventory we mentioned earlier and that will raise that occupancy.
Bill Stein: Hey Ross, I want to give you a little detail on the 60 bps in the 210 bps. So if you look quarter-over-quarter of the 60 bps, 100 bps of decline is due to delivering vacant inventory into our pool. There was plus 60 bps of increase in same store for new leasing and then there was a 30 bps decline due to terminations in the quarter. If you look at Q4 2013 versus Q4 2012 the 210 basis points we have an office building out in the East Bay which that’s the Ardenwood property we’ve had at base since our IPO. And we had a couple tenants leased in that period last year so we had 110 basis point decline in occupancy in 2013 because of that. Again we had vacant inventory delivered that generated 40 bps decline and then terminations delivered 50 bps decline year-over-year 30 bps of that was data center and 20 bps of that was office or non-tech.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: And just on the retention ratio do you expect it to be roughly similar in 2014 as you saw in ‘13?
Bill Stein: Yes, over 90% in 2014 is what we expect right now.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you, good morning. Wanted to just drill down a little bit on the middle market sales effort and what you are seeing vis-à-vis the sales funnel early in the year on that effort. It sounds like things are still good but maybe you could add some color around the number of new sales people that have been on ramped since the investor day and just what you are seeing momentum wise?
Matt Miszewski: Yes, this is -- thanks Jordan for the question. This is Matt Miszewski, happy to give you an update. We have added since the Q3 call all three of the mid market vice presidents and their staff and so we will have additions of the 15 sales assets in all of the relevant markets from a mid market perspective. So we see as though we are very close to fully staffed in the mid market space for 2014, again, we’ve got a three year target in terms of hiring rents. So there will be some additional work to be done in 2015 and 2016. But we are very close to fully staffed on the mid market side from a staffing perspective. In terms of total pipeline, I think that I am comfortable with a number of dynamics in the mid market space coming off of a very strong $7 million plus mid market performance in Q4, I am pretty satisfied with the positioning of the pipeline coming in to the last month of Q1 to be able to hit our goals from a mid market perspective and I am also very satisfied right now with where the rates are looking for both the mid market space as well as large enterprise space not just for this quarter but for the balance of fiscal year ‘14.
Bill Stein:  Well what’s interesting about a lot of our customers in the mid market space is they are not necessarily taking one or two cabinets, they are taking 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 square feet at a crack. So it’s we are ramping up very well because there are some really interesting requirements out there that this team is able to address in addition to our traditional large cloud and large enterprise and network customers. So we are very pleased on how far our prospect funnels built overall we’ve gone from 2 billion square feet of real prospects to over 3 million rentable square feet as we stand today.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then a separate question, I appreciate the new disclosure I am just going to point you to page 16 on the same store capitals table. Is there any inside you could lend into the expense increases some of the lines moving around in there be it retail property operating versus RNM and property taxes just some big swings up and down any inside you could offer?
Mike Foust:  We are kind of looking at, I will let Bill jump in. And if you compare the 12 months ended on the RNM item, we are looking at 86 million versus 88 million. So it’s very close. 
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Well I mean in the table below that Mike, the same capital one where you are looking at just same capital employed, it’s -- so those are -- if you look at the 12 months, once our operating expenses are up 15%, RNM is down 16% and property taxes for the full year is the more surprising one, up 21%. What would be the driver behind some of this?
Mike Foust:  We discussed the property taxes on the last call, where we’re actively pursuing against the assessments, appealed against the assessments, so what happened in both Texas and California, we believe that we’re being charged twice for property tax and having property taxes included in the real estate tax. So not only are we -- assess value, so not only are we getting taxed twice, our tenants are getting taxed for the personal property and then us getting taxed again as real estate, which is not correct. And so, we are actively appealing those. But you have to pay them until you go back and get those. And we’re pretty confident that we’re going to be successful, but you have to go through as you can appreciate a long process and those appeals, again so we perceive and our tenants perceive as double counting if you will.
Bill Stein:  George, specifically the two states involved are California and Texas that are taxing both realty and personally. And in the third quarter, the incremental effect was 2.4 and in the fourth quarter the incremental effect was little over 3. So as Mike said, we’re appealing those and hoping to win them. And that’s net of reimbursements from our customers.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Stephen Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess first, you mentioned that Yahoo sublease in Northern Virginia and I’m wondering is there anything you are able to do kind of preempt that either by trying to further differentiate your product or -- in that market or prevent feeling that impact in the same way that Facebook is kind of impacted in Silicon Valley. And then I guess second, with recently announced Comcast Netflix deal, I’m wondering if you have any thoughts on kind of net neutrality and how you think that different outcomes impact your business? Thanks.
Mike Foust: Sure. As to Yahoo, that product in our competitor is very different from our POD 3.0 architecture. So, it’s very much of shared back claim for the power train or UPS and panels and electrical switchgear and also HVAC is not as modular as with our POD 3.0. So, our customers historically, and this is true in Ashburn as well, they really strongly desire the fully dedicated, UPS dedicated power and cooling. So that’s a huge product differentiator for us. We don’t believe that this sublease face will have much of an impact at all on our customers; And I think that’s -- and the customers we’re pursuing, and I think that’s reflected in the current good funnel of prospected tenants that we have. Comcast is growing tremendously, as we can -- even before their merger announcements. And we’re seeing quite a bit of business that we’ve been the beneficiary of from Comcast. They are very big customer for Digital Realty. And we see them and their subsidiaries growing and hopefully growing with us quite actively. The kind of issues around net neutrality are probably inevitable as we need more and more bandwidth, we see Netflix is entering into agreement recently with Comcast, and I just read yesterday where they’re negotiating with other large carriers like AT&T and Verizon. So that appears to be an important trend in order to deliver low latency, very high quality customer consumer experience as we want more and more gaming, content, films, TV shows et cetera over broadband.
Matt Miszewski: Steve, this is Matt Miszewski. We’ve been very involved with obviously both Comcast and Netflix as well as the number of other content distribution networks and other providers of content. So, the Comcast, Netflix business terms were interesting. I believe that the market from time-to-time confuses what’s going on with Comcast, Netflix as a net neutrality conversation. And it’s a little bit different if you look at the actual terms of the agreement. But the one thing that it does point out is that when content providers are looking for purring arrangements, they’re looking to get out of a current set of situations that they are with the current proprietary internet exchanges that exist which highlight sort of the new Open IX initiatives starting up amongst the country in Northern America. So, we don’t think that the Comcast, Netflix business arrangement signals anything with regard to net neutrality that’s concerning but it does signal a move towards the more open internet exchange.
Stephen Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore: Good afternoon or morning for you guys. But thank you for taking the question here. I just was trying to get a sense as to what your expectations for commencements were for this year, those that are embedded in guidance. And I do see a backlog of $61 million, based on stuff that you’ve signed already; in your guidance you’ve talked about expected of leasing of $20 to $30 million. I am just trying to understand if that implies expected to commencements of $81 million to $91 million or if there is other numbers that go into that? Thanks.
Mike Foust: In our conservative view, we’re looking at incremental income from commencements in the low 60s millions, annualized obviously that would be much higher.
Bill Stein: Annualized is over 100 Jonathan, on a GAAP basis.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore: Okay, that’s helpful. If I can instead of asking a follow up actually, I have got different question. I’d also be very interested in how your progress around [fibering] your buildings together is, whether you are seeing customer demand for that and how that’s impacting the sales process? Thanks
Mike Foust: I’ll let Matt jump in. It’s been a tremendous boon. I mean it really has changed the landscape. Our buildings are already well connected by networks and now with the network ecosystem in place in all this major markets, we are able to provide a whole another level of connectivity and interconnection for our customers. And we are seeing in virtually every market customers utilizing that or we’ve got the metro providers utilizing it to deliver lift services to our customers. In fact I just came from London last week and we’ve already sold 23 pairs of dark fiber to customers and virtually every new customer in the London and connecting to Europe markets are taking dark fiber with us. So, it’s been a tremendous addition.
Matt Miszewski:  Yes. And Jonathan, throughout -- we got an early start in the European market with regard to network ecosystem but also throughout 2013 in North America have primarily finished connecting up the campuses internally, connecting the campuses together. I can tell you from a sales perspective, it takes one of the concerns away from our customers in terms of easy network connectivity and then on the bottom line, it has a demonstrative impact on opportunities in the pipeline right now where customers are comparing two properties, one that is connected by digital ecosystem and one that’s not which has a multi-million dollar effect under total cost ownership. So the ecosystem process in Northern America and definitely the ecosystem process in Europe have both been tailwinds to the leasing process.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore: Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Terrific, thanks. Starting with your demand drivers, you talked about mid-markets and content providers; could you also describe your progress penetrating entirely new Fortune 500 type verticals that are moving to the cloud, petrochemicals and so forth or any of them looking particularly attractive given your recent experience? And then as you beef up the sales force to accomplish this if it’s going to take several years, should we expect gradual upward pressure on G&A going forward?
Bill Stein: Yes, so great question. Within the content world, obviously content continues to be king across all of our customers, not just the CDNs and the ISPs out there, but other providers of content and continues to be a heightened focus for us especially given the digital Open IX initiative, as well as the digital ecosystem initiatives. But within the Fortune 500, there is an uptick in activity in several verticals, energy being one of them. Inside our Q4 results we saw some impressive TKF numbers coming out of the energy vertical, incredible numbers coming out of the cloud vertical, which we talked about today on the call, continued performance out of financial services, but in the mid market in particular a new focus on smaller companies in the financial services industry who are interested in leveraging technology. But due that I’d like to sort of highlight for folks are little more complicated, but our pipeline is full with opportunities in as a mid-market space, as well as a large enterprise space in retail, where base data initiatives are really the light spot of retails’ cash performance. And then healthcare internationally not in the personal identifiable health information space, but in the diagnostic space, which is something that we didn’t necessarily anticipated, but we’re happy to find both in the U.S., as well as in Continental Europe. And if you look at G&A, we’re projecting because of our scale and our efficiencies; we are looking at G&A as a percentage of revenues as a percentage of EBITDA to stay pretty steady over the next couple of years.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That’s perfect and then just one more demand type question, could you attempt to size for us the opportunity to capture more business from existing customers, any estimate on what portion of their total datacenter needs that currently outsourcing to you and then whether that’s slowly on the rise?
Mike Foust: So, we do see a good uptick in repeat performance. If you look at the fourth quarter numbers in the details of who we lease to, we’re very happy with what we call multisite customers. We anticipate that will increase, I don’t have concrete data on the exact share of wallet that we have in each one of those accounts, but our focus during 2013 was expanding that share of wallet and actually targeting on the front side enterprises that had international growth ambitions and or even domestic growth ambitions outside of their headquarters activity. So, multisite for us is one of the competitive differentiators because we have a 130 plus properties and we’re in 33 markets throughout the world. When we target customers that have multisite opportunities we do much better.
Bill Stein: It’s very dramatic looking at folks in cloud, financial services, IT services are various which include cloud doing multiple market, multiple continents we’ve been very, very active in 2013 and continue to be very, very active in 2014. It is a huge differentiator for us that we are really the only folks that can provide that consistent program, consistent quality of product services, contracting across so many different markets.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Hey guys. Just I wanted to go back some of the comments Mike on the pricing trends; I know you attributed a lot of the downward movement to mix. But just curious it sounds like supply is also sort of stable. But just wondering if there are any markets where you are seeing incremental pricing pressure either from a reduction in demand or increase in supply? And also I had a follow-up, if you could just maybe comment on specifically what you’re seeing in Phoenix?
Mike Foust: So, I would say that we’re pretty well stabilized across the domestic markets. And we’re seeing very good pricing in Asia-Pac markets today. So I would say staying stabilized in the European market even at this point. I mean we’re not seeing blips up and down, Asia-Pac continues to be extremely strong.
Matt Miszewski: Yes. Vincent this is Matt. I did, I pull the report daily to make sure we’re on track and I look at our current fiscal year pipeline numbers in terms of pricing power and compared to the 2013 across the board and what I can characterize it is I was pleased at the result of the data that I called, now this is pipeline data so it’s certainly as we get into the negotiation process I fully expect that the pricing I am currently seeing in the pipe will constraint it’s up a little bit but even given that understanding I am very happy with where the pricing is today and given our past performance where we expect that to lend, we’ll get in leases.
Mike Foust: Yes. And Phoenix is going pretty well. We had a lot of leasing early last year we had kind of a quite period the last of couple of quarters and now the pipeline of prospects that we’re pursuing actively has grown pretty significantly.
Matt Miszewski: Yes. Vincent, we have a number of prospects that we’re pursuing in [Chickie] and Chandler in Phoenix currently and I don’t see any pricing trends that give me a great deal of concern in any of those deals that we’re chasing in Q1, Q2 and Q3.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Yes, good morning out there. I guess following up on the question about rates, I assume you’re kind of talking about stabilized or lease up assets, but as you think about new development and thanks for the color on the breakdowns of yields by kind of geography. But can you talk about given the more limited pipeline and development going forward whether the yields maybe should move up as you become more selective or with the better real estate market overall are those real, you are going to comment a little bit expectation on kind of the next round of start as you see them?
Mike Foust: We are pretty pleased what we have been achieving. Certainly overall, if you look the leasing in the last quarter, so we are looking at stabilized returns between 11.5%, so we are on average and that’s unlevered that’s based on projections for the individual leases. So we look at this lease-by-lease look fully loaded. Certainly as the mix expands in Asia-Pac that will increase. And I think as we see kind of the more stabilized situations and we are fully implemented in POD 3.0 which is a very efficient way to construct, while we have flexibility that adapt for different customer requirements. We are coming in at pretty good price on this brand new round of projects. So I think that combination will put some upward pressure on yields.
Bill Stein: Let me follow-up a little bit on that, not directly responsive, but the ROA on the company as a whole on a portfolio level will also be possibly impacted by the lease up of our existing finished inventory, which is fairly significant and as we lease up datacenter shells and we add additional thoughts. We no longer have the drag on the vacant shelf space, so both of those items will contribute to an increase in ROI on the entire portfolio.
Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: That’s helpful. And then the $80 million to $90 million I think you had put in original guidance for additional CapEx this year, telling that out to page 33 on the supplement the line enhancements and other non-recurring, does that suggest the $80 million to $90 million is down from the $111 million or $112 million that you kind of quoted in ‘13 or is that an additional $80 million to $90 million on top of that number?
Mike Foust:  Well it’s somewhat of a reduction from what we invested in the properties in 2013, and these are wide range of improvements replacing windows, replacing roofs, elevators adding UPS, additional UPS and additional capacity to buildings, those kinds of upgrades so it’s a wide range of activities at the properties that are non-recurring and either adding more space or replacing items like windows and roofs and elevators et cetera.
Bill Stein:  You could see in the supp and I think you referenced it Dave, for the year 2013 we are showing $111.5 million and our guidance is $85 million to $90 million, so it is down.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Jon Petersen of MLV & Company. Please go ahead.
Jon Petersen - MLV & Company:  Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the development pipeline, the new disclosure at the Investor Day is really helpful, but I am looking at the base building construction and trying to kind of understand how to model that going forward, I know that that includes some properties that are going to go on to be developed out of Turn-Key Flex and some of them are just going to leased out at power base buildings. Can you kind of give us an idea of the kind of the breakdown of what falls into which one of those buckets and any sort of timing on when we can expect, when you guys expect to receive revenue on those investments?
Mike Foust:  Generally speaking, the large majority of our business is Turn-Key, I mean that really is -- not exclusively, but I would say 80% to 90% of our leasing is fully fitted out Turn-Key data center space. And that’s both the TKF in the custom. So the customs often has other ancillary facilities like office space and testing space along with it. So I think it is safe to say that 80% to 90% of our base building development is going ultimately toward Turn-Key. If you look at the Turn-Key in custom that’s under construction now that’s data center construction, 79.4% as we say is leased currently over 550,000 feet. And so we’ll continue as we continue to build out POD 3.0’s pod by pod that will be built out in these base buildings and continue to add to that finish inventory.
Jon Petersen - MLV & Company: Okay. All right that’s helpful, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets:  Thanks. So the connectivity offer, I just wanted to see kind of where that stands, you’ve fully built out across all three major regions and are you seeing different demand profile by region?
Bill Stein: So, we’re fully built out in our, as of early February in all of our markets here in North America our major markets. We’re fully built out in London, there we have some interesting new opportunities at variable cost to add to that. And that connectivity in London goes right into the continental networks. So, essentially we have connectivity to our continental data centers today back to the major pairing points especially in Amsterdam, Paris and London. In Asia-Pac, it’s a little bit different [technology] of networks. So, we’re really focused on the international, inter market connectivity and for example between Singapore and Hong Kong, between the Sydney and the Melbourne bringing that connectivity between these markets.
Mike Foust: And Jonathan, the connectivity in particular in Asia-Pacific is coming as a result of customer requirements first and foremost. So again my comments about Sydney and in particular Melbourne as well as needs in Singapore and Hong Kong are really sort of developed directly from customer requirement. It had been the plan on digital ecosystem to make sure that Asia-Pac was covered to this fiscal year and we’re blessed to be able to do that at the same time that we’ve got customer request asking for that connectivity.
Bill Stein: And I will say that in Singapore with our flagship, the property there, we’ve developed quite a bit of new metro fiber connectivity through different carriers in that market. So we have a very good network architecture now of metro carrier serving our Singapore facility.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: And then on the Turn-Key rent trends you talked about how geographic mix kind of influenced that more than the same markets rental trends. And looking forward would you expect to further influence of geographic mix or if the current mix that is reflected in 4Q kind of carried through the year, if that result for Turn-Key?
Bill Stein: I hold that match, but we will definitely have a different mix, because we have so many different major markets and it varies quarter-by-quarter as to the particular market mix in any particular quarter.
Mike Foust: Yes. So like I said as I take a look at current fiscal year forward looking pipeline I saw healthy pricing power in each of our markets but regionally there is pricing differential. So we need to keep that in mind but I didn’t see a disturbing trend in any of the major markets we’re involved with.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Yes. Good morning over there. First of all, thank you so much for all the new disclosure that’s really, really good to see. And then question for you guys, the asset that was bought recently and contributed towards the JV, the acquisition price was in 8 cap. Could you talk a little bit about on what cap will you be contributing in towards the JV?
Mike Foust: Yes, so going in was a 9 with the debt restructuring because to make it more efficient for the JV, that cause turns it into an 8. And then…
Bill Stein: We haven’t closed on that contribution yet Tayo, we expect to do that by the end of the first quarter and I would rather not comment on the cap rate at which it is being contributed till after we closed.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Okay, that’s fair enough. And then second follow up question, the new hire for [AMB] just trying to understand a little bit better what his responsibilities are going to be and over the next one to two years whether it is some kind of the critical things you expect him to achieve for your bottom line?
Mike Foust: Just to be, it is not a hire. We have engaged Wayne, he has a firm here in San Francisco. And so we have engaged his firm. And he is going to, I think basically significantly upgrade our corporate information system. A few thing in portfolio reporting area right now basically the back half of itself that you see, a lot of that is excel based and our expectation is that data will be pooled from Yardi, which is the automated economic system that we use and use to populate the back half of that report. And in addition some of that data will be summarized on a very frequent basis to provide real time management to exports for the executive team and the board.
Operator: Our next question will come from a follow up from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you. A couple of things, first on investment as we think about capitalized interest declining overtime and overall investment declining overtime, it didn’t really happened in the fourth quarter. So I am curious what timing would look like, I guess what I am showing is, it seems to me that the total CAP or committed active development increased from about 900 million at the Investor Day to about 971 million today. I am curious at what point we should expect that to tail off and how low we should expect that to get or when the low point of the year should?
Mike Foust:  Well it starts the first quarter of this year. And at least over the course of this year the lowest amount of capitalized interest would be in the fourth quarter.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Is it just tail off consistently throughout the year?
Mike Foust:  Steps down each quarter, correct.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then Bill you talked about the financing timing. I am not sure if I am reading you right here, but in the guidance originally it said, not originally but now it says early 2014 for these financings to take place, but it sounded like you were looking more at a potential mid-year timing in terms of at least the swaps that you have -- the hedge that you have entered into?
Bill Stein:  Well that’s correct, at least in the case of the U.S. dollar -- we have U.S. dollar bond deal in our planning and we have the swap lock expires basically July ‘15 so we would do something in the mid June to mid July timeframe to make sure that hedges appropriately effective. We would do either a sterling or preferred I suspect sometime from mid March until or blacked out in early April so that would the window for that financing assuming the markets are open and conducive. And then the final financing it could be then, it could midyear or just could be towards the end of the third quarter and that’s going to be really a function of markets.
Operator: The final question will be a follow-up from Emmanual Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: Yes, Michael Bilerman, I had two follow-ups; one was just Bill to sort of a little bit on the timing on these capital raises, because it sounds like it’s later than early ‘14, from what you just said, but you given the fact that you said it’s the biggest component, the biggest variable in guidance, can you at least be very specific about sources and uses, right? So if you think about what you’ve put down in guidance call it 800 million to 1.2 billion of proceeds, about $450 million of debt rolling this year, I assume the balance, 350 to 700 is used to pay down the line at 1.6%. Obviously given the math, raising capital 5.5 to 6 and paying down the line is dilutive. But given when you do it, it’s more dilutive to ‘15 than it is to the ‘14, as you delay it. So I just want to make sure that we completely understand what’s embedded in guidance from a dilution standpoint of capital rates. And then the second question is, the disclosure in the supplemental on the NAV components, which is extraordinarily helpful, I’m just curious, if you look at that relative to what was presented at Investor Day, there seems to be much more NOI, which given that the trends that you are talking about make sense, but a number of other asset categories changed and it would appears though if you were to put the same cap rates on the NOI that you put at Investor Day that NAV could be upwards of $5 higher than what you presented. So if you presented 54 to 63, you could be talking something like 59 to 69. I don’t know if there is other things going on in here that make it not comparable, but I wanted you to be able to go through that as well.
Bill Stein: Sure, okay. With respect to the financing, we’re assuming and again this is all subject to change based on markets. But we are assuming a preferred and a Sterling offering in the first quarter essentially. And then the U.S. dollar deal as I said would be midyear since where we’ve hedged it. In terms of -- and I think you’re looking for amounts to, so for preferred we are assuming upwards of $300 million of Sterling debt, $480 million and U.S. dollar bond deal $250 million. So, that’s our best estimate today. But again, that could change. And then you’ve asked for NAV….
Michael Bilerman - Citi: Just on the financing. So I mean based on the disclosure, I recognize how much you are rising; you’ve laid it out in the guidance and the rates that you’re targeting. What I’m trying to understand is what you’ve embedded in for the uses of that capital and the dilution associated with it that’s embedded in guidance, because you spent a lot of time talking it, the most important variable in terms of timing. And so what I want to understand is what’s actually in your guidance. So you have $450 million of debt coming due at 5.6% this year. The only other use of proceeds could be the line of credit and if you just take your billing dollars of financing that will lease about $550 million to pay down the line. That result in a lower payback rate than what your raising the capital. So, I’m just trying to figure out based on that guidance you gave, how much dilution have you embedded in for capital raising?
Bill Stein: Right now all of the new capital is going to pay down the revolver. That is obviously are very modest rate, (inaudible) so that’s where the dilution is. And then revolver has been taken up over the course of the year as we complete our construction program which is what’s in the -- was about in the guidance.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: Okay. And then on NAV how does it compare Investor Day to today, it does look like there is additional other assets and obviously the NOI is very higher, so if we were to take the same cap rates is that the right math to do?
Bill Stein: Right. So there is about $26 million of increase in annualized NOI growth from Q3 to Q4. There is $14 million increase in NOI in the fiscal year ‘14 backlog. There is $500 million plus of CIP related asset value. And that’s really the upside potential slide that we’ve presented and then there is a $300 million increase in debt which would obviously from the NAV.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. We thank everyone for joining today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Theresa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Digital Realty 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. John Stewart, you may begin your conference, sir.
John Stewart: Thank you. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

Michael F. Foust: Thank you, John, welcome to the call everyone. The highlight of our third quarter for Digital Realty was our solid leasing activity. Our business has taken a turn for the better and healthy momentum has picked up across each of our regions. Data center demand is growing in the second half of the year, and we're quite pleased with the leasing velocity. In fact, as you can see on the first page of our presentation, the dollar volume of leases signed represents the third highest quarter in the company's history and year-to-date activity already exceeds the full year of 2012. New leases include a healthy mix of new corporate logos, as well as expansions of existing customers to new facilities. As shown on Page 2, the third quarter was equally strong in terms of lease renewals. I'm sure most of you saw last week that we completed 5 early renewals with Equinix. This was a mutually beneficial transaction, providing long-term operational certainty to a strategic customer. And from Digital's perspective, these leases contributed to the positive mark-to-market on renewal activity during the third quarter. Cash rents on turn-key leases rolled down slightly, but represented an improvement over the past several quarters. We believe that rumors of data center rent roll downs have been greatly exaggerated. We estimate the mark-to-market across our Powered Base Building portfolio at 6% -- over 6% actually and the cash mark-to-market across our Turn-Key data center portfolio is roughly flat. We are encouraged by the recent trends in pricing, as well as the leasing velocity. Despite the leasing highlights, third quarter financial results were lower than expected. Bill will walk us through the drivers behind our revised earnings guidance in detail during his presentation. But suffice it to say that primarily the combination of the noncash straight rent -- straight-line rent adjustment, delayed lease commencements and the near-term dilution from the joint venture we announced earlier this month has led us to revise our guidance for 2013 and to reset expectations for future periods. We do believe that our revised outlook represents a realistic assessment and puts us in position to provide more accurate lease commencement forecasts going forward. Turning now to Page 3 of the presentation. We are encouraged by the pickup in leasing velocity that we've seen in the second half of the year, and pricing has largely stabilized relative to last year. Furthermore, the solid backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced represents contractual obligations for future rental revenue and sets the stage for healthy growth and cash flows over the intermediate term. As you can see from this chart, the backlog of signed leases translates to an incremental $52 million of NOI in 2014 and additional $38 million in NOI beyond that. We're also pleased to announce today that on Monday this week, we signed a 7-megawatt lease with a social networking company that had outgrown its existing colocation footprint. This one deal represents an additional $11 million of annualized GAAP revenue, and is tangible evidence that the momentum we saw during the third quarter is clearly carrying through to the fourth quarter. The healthy backlog aside, we are taking proactive steps to address the lumpiness of our leasing activity, as well as the signing-to-commencement cycle. And Matt will walk through some of these steps in detail during his presentation. In terms of supply and demand, as shown on Page 4, we currently are tracking an estimated 3-megawatt shortfall nationwide. Silicon Valley is the one major market in the U.S. at risk of significant oversupply, whereas demand has been particularly strong in Northern Virginia, as well as in Dallas. Amsterdam, London and Frankfurt are currently the healthiest markets in Europe, and supply-demand dynamics are generally favorable across AsiaPac. Over the past 2 years, Digital Realty has made significant investment in developing additional inventory to meet growing demand, and this accounts for some of the new supply you see represented in the chart on Page 5. We expect that this new inventory in our major -- active major markets will be largely absorbed by corporate enterprise and cloud services demand over the next 12 to 24 months. In the near-term, however, the delivery of this inventory will continue to weigh on our return on invested capital. Lease up of existing inventory and driving improved ROIC are the top priorities across our organization. We fully expect to generate attractive returns on these new completions as we lease up our inventory and maintain our focus on consistent improvement on return on invested capital. In the near term, new development starts will be more measured and lease up of existing inventory will likewise be our primary source of near-term organic growth. In late September, we formed the previously announced $369 million joint venture with Prudential's Core fund at an attractive cap rate. Aside from our return on this investment, which Bill will cover in his remarks, we believe that this transaction was an important milestone in terms of demonstrating the appeal of data centers from the perspective of a sophisticated Core investor. I would like to point out that growing acceptance of this asset class is a bit of a dual-edged sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the private market value of our portfolio. On the other hand, lower return expectation on the part of Core investors do make it more difficult for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions of income-producing properties. Consequently, while we remained active and will continue to underwrite almost every deal and portfolio in the market, our near-term investment activity is likely to be more consistent with our pre-2012 history, until some of our expectations readjust consistent with our return requirements and our investment alternatives. During the third quarter, we introduced Digital Open Internet Exchange, which is running in conjunction with the Open IX initiative spearheaded by the Internet community here in North America. In short, we've committed to provide the data center environments for the new open Internet exchanges so that they can operate across all the targeted U.S. markets, for Open IX, as well as international exchanges that are expanding currently into the U.S. Our facilities will provide the foundation for a successful initiative, and we're very excited to be a part of it. On a related note, the Digital Realty Network ecosystem continues to develop on schedule. And we are now seeing new leasing opportunities with specific network requirements that our ecosystem and Open IX, allows to solve for our customers. It's too early to quantify the near-term financial impact from these initiatives, but we believe they will significantly enhance the appeal of our properties to a wider range of tenants and, in turn, our ability to generate future NOI growth and enhance the value of our portfolio over time. And with that, I would like to turn the floor over to Matt Miszewski for a deeper dive on our sales platform and leasing momentum.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. Let me jump right into the sales activity for the third quarter. It was a strong quarter for lease signings, and we continue to see positive momentum. In fact, this was the third highest quarter for lease signings in the company's history. Our year-to-date signings are about 40% higher than at this point last year, and as you see here on Page 6 of the presentation, already surpass full year 2012 activity. As of today, we are at over 91% of the highest signings year in the history of the company with just over 2 months left in the fiscal, and all regions provided positive signings momentum in the third quarter across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. And while this quarter's performance was solid, the future also looks bright. Our pipeline continues to see accelerating growth in qualified deals in North America, Europe and APAC with both healthy domestic and international components. We currently have over 2 million raised floor square feet requirements in our fiscal year 2014 pipeline. In addition, over the past 90 days, we've implemented a number of lead generation and nurturing tools to continue to build our already healthy pipeline. In our first test of this system over the past few weeks, we are seeing solid metrics supporting our new content marketing, inside sales and digital demand generation programs, including impressive open rates on new offers, healthy new lead generation statistics and encouraging lead conversion rates. In addition to this pipeline activity, we also closed a significant number of mid-market deals inside the quarter, including a rapidly growing cloud services provider in SingleHop [ph] in the Midwest, taking 1,500 kilowatts in our Franklin Park facility, as well as a well-known online travel advice company taking a total of 1,400 kilowatts across multiple locations inside our portfolio. In our colocation business, we continue to see mid-market penetration in the quarter, including one of the globe's top enterprise private cloud providers, as well as the country's fastest-growing mobile cloud platform company in one of our Boston facilities. We also continue to add new logos at multiple properties and in multiple segments. Our unique build-to-suit project with ARM Holdings highlighted our commitment to environmental innovation, while our new signings with a global leader in virtualization technologies highlight our global platform as they took space in both the Dallas and the San Francisco markets. We continue our new logo success in the financial services vertical with a national provider of diversified financial products in one of our Chicago facilities. And we also landed new leases with a true global software and cloud powerhouse in Australia and with one of the world's largest manufacturers of industrial engines, Cummins. I'd now like to cover some of the organizational adjustments we have made in our global sales and marketing program since the beginning of the year. Programs I'll describe for you in a moment, including our mid-market and global alliance strategies, are expressly designed to shorten the signings-to-commencement cycles, as well as addressing our premium pricing support. In addition, adjustments to our incentive compensation programs will focus on targeting existing inventory clearance to drive improved return on invested capital and continue to shorten commencement time line. Turning now to Page 7. With regard to our new global alliances program, our customers are asking us to provide them with insightful guidance across all of their needed data center services, not simply space and power. By providing them with a comprehensive global alliances marketplace, we will be able to satisfy our customers' requirements, while providing additional revenue opportunities to some of our closest, existing and exciting new partners. As pressures increase on our customer base, they need their data center decisions to be easier, and we hope to make Digital Realty their one-stop shop for a data center advantage. While Digital will continue to focus on its core strategic advantages, we will leverage our new partner ecosystem to provide high demand services, including managed services, cloud services, network services and more. In addition, we will be providing guidance to our customers from their perspective, initiating a vertical go-to-market process across multiple industry verticals, ranging from financial services, cloud services and manufacturing to energy, health care and retail. By focusing on our customers' needs as the primary focal point of our sales and marketing efforts, we believe we'll be able to more accurately fit their requirements and jointly create increasing value across the multiple segments from lead generation and nurturing into a growing level of customer loyalty, ultimately resulting in a solid renewal rate amongst our base. As shown on Page 8, we have also developed a new focus on the mid-market segment as an area that holds great promise in terms of shortening our sales cycle, keeping stable our pricing advantage, compressing the average time to commencement and broadening our installed base across our global platform. We have also begun developing muscle in addressing the small and medium-sized business segment, with a lower cost-of-sale model that will allow us to continue serving this segment by leveraging a more aggressive demand-generation program and a scalable new sales force. We are adding significant sales and marketing resources to successfully execute this multi-segment strategy. While we increase our focus on these 2 segments, it is important to point out that our large enterprise segment continues to perform incredibly well. Demand from that segment drove the healthy signings volume in the third quarter, including multiple purchases from one of the largest financial services firms on the planet now in multiple countries. We have also continued to see large expansions from global cloud services providers and have landed large enterprise logos as well, including a leading Japanese automobile manufacturer. We expect that this segment will continue to be strong for Digital. We simply view the mid-market and small- and medium-sized business focus to be additive to our longstanding large enterprise program. The longer sales cycles in large enterprise accounts can now be balanced with a more complete program to address the mid-market and small- and medium-sized business segment. We expect that this segmented strategy will continue to close the gap between lease signings and commencements and help to smooth out revenue from quarter-to-quarter. And as highlighted earlier, we also saw mid-market deals close across multiple verticals and across every geographic market we serve, including multiple new logos and deals that will commence in a much shorter time frame. And now I'll turn the call over to Bill.
Arthur William Stein: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by addressing the straight-line rent expense adjustment that Mike mentioned in his remarks. We booked a $10 million noncash true-up in the third quarter because we discovered that we had not previously remeasured the straight-line rent expense related to one of the handful of leasehold interests in our portfolio when we executed a 10-year early extension and modification of this leasehold in September of 2010. The $10 million adjustment that we booked during the quarter represents a catch-up of the noncash straight-line rent that should have been recorded from the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2013 at a run rate of approximately $830,000 per quarter. The entire prior-period adjustment has been included in reported FFO, whereas only the current period of $830,000 has been included in core FFO for the third quarter of 2013. Let me emphasize that the straight-line rent is always and everywhere an add back to FFO in the calculation of AFFO. So there is no impact on AFFO, regardless, for any period involved. Since the annualized straight-line rent expense adjustment represents an immaterial percentage of net income in each of the affected periods, we believe that it is not material. Consequently, we currently believe that it is unlikely to give rise to a material weakness. We believe that our internal controls are adequate. We have since reinforced our existing policies and implemented supplemental policies to address this specific issue. We believe that we've taken the right steps and have fixed the problem. If we can better help you understand the nature of the issue or its resolution during the Q&A portion of today's call, we'll be happy to do so. Moving on to our results. We reported third quarter FFO per share of $1.10 and core FFO per share of $1.16 compared to the consensus analyst estimate of $1.20. Starting on Page 9 of the presentation, let me walk through the various components and attempt to bridge the gap from our third quarter results to the $1.22 we reported in the second quarter as a proxy for the consensus estimate. The first item to note is the $10 million straight-line rent expense adjustment for 111 Eighth Avenue in New York. The entire $10 million adjustment, or a little over $0.07 per share, is included in reported FFO. In contrast, only the current period portion of $830,000, or less than $0.01 a share, is included in core FFO for the third quarter of 2013. Higher property taxes costs us a little over $0.01 per share this quarter, primarily due to additional county personal property taxes assessments in Santa Clara and in Texas. We believe these personal property taxes estimates represent double, and in some cases potentially triple, taxation since the counties charge personal property taxes but do not deduct personal property from a real estate assessment, and our tenants are taxed on their personal property as well. We will, of course, appeal these aggressive assessments, but in the meantime, we have accrued for the higher rates. The second quarter also included $0.04 from a gain on an insurance settlement, as well as an extra $0.01 of catch-up from the first quarter for the change in capitalization policy announced on the last call. Finally, G&A accounts for $0.02 of favorable variance in the third quarter since our independent directors are awarded a fully vested equity grant in the second quarter of each year. Adjusting the future run rate for each of these items gets you to the clean quarterly run rate of $1.14 to $1.15 or $4.60 annualized. This represents the base from which future growth forecasts should be framed, in our view. Moving on to Page 11 and turning now to our outlook going forward. We are revising our 2013 FFO per share guidance to $4.60 to $4.62, down from $4.73 to $4.82 previously, and revising guidance for 2013 core FFO per share to $4.65 to $4.67, down from the prior range of $4.74 to $4.83. The primary variables relative to our prior forecast include $0.07 per share for the straight-line rent accrual on 111 Eighth, $0.01 per share due to the lower-than-expected acquisitions. The joint venture with the Prudential Core fund is $0.11 dilutive on an annualized basis, so we will see $0.03 of that in the fourth quarter and another $0.08 next year. Finally, delayed lease commencements account for $0.06 per share. In hindsight, our sales forecasts for recognized revenue have been too aggressive. Our signings have been on target, but revenue recognition has not lined up with our projections. Nevertheless, as Mike pointed out during his remarks and as you can see, if you refer back to Page 3 of the presentation, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced does represent an extremely strong tailwind of contractually baked-in NOI that will come online over the intermediate term. We are still in the process of finalizing our budgets for next year, so we are not providing formal guidance for 2014 at this time. But we have outlined the broad brush strokes for next year in the earnings release. Clearly, the pace of our earnings growth has moderated somewhat as our sector has matured and the size of our asset base has grown dramatically. Even so, we expect to deliver respectable mid-single digits FFO per share growth, even on a $13 billion asset base. And now I would like to turn to our funding strategy and capital markets activities. As previously announced, we refinanced our global credit facilities in August, upsizing the line of credit from $1.8 billion to $2 billion and the term loan from $750 million to $1 billion. All-in pricing for the line of credit was reduced from 150 basis points to 130 basis points and all-in pricing for the term loan was reduced from 145 basis points to 120 basis points. In late September, we formed a $369 million joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors, as Mike mentioned, at a 6.7% cap rate. Since this transaction has already been announced, I'm not going to dwell on too many of the details here on Page 12. But I would like to highlight 2 numbers, mid-teens and 20, that I think have been largely overlooked with respect to this transaction. Specifically, we achieved an unlevered IRR of over 20% on the sale of our interest to the joint venture and we expect to earn a mid-teens return on our residual equity interest going forward. I also think it's important to note that the fee-stream figured into the pricing of the transaction. Said differently, the cap rate unquestionably would have been lower had this been structured as an outright sale rather than a joint venture. We believe that this transaction represents very solid execution and achieved our objectives of maximizing the menu of capital options available to us, while minimizing the related costs and simultaneously demonstrating the appeal of our data centers to a core institutional real estate investor. Proceeds from the joint venture have initially been used to pay down short-term debt. And as you can see from the credit stats on Page 13, we maintain a flexible investment grade balance sheet. We do not expect to need to access common equity in 2014, barring any unusual portfolio or M&A transaction activity. We do, however, expect to raise preferred equity sooner rather than later, and may also revisit the corporate unsecured bond markets as well to take advantage of what we believe is an attractive low rate window. The front loading of these anticipated long-term capital raises is one of the drivers behind our below consensus outlook for next year. But we believe it is the prudent course of balance sheet management. I would also like to point out that our exchangeable debentures are expected to convert into common equity in April of next year and that conversion will improve the debt-to-EBITDA by 0.3 turns. As indicated in yesterday's press release, our Board of Directors recently authorized a $500 million share repurchase to give us the flexibility to opportunistically buy back stock when the public market values our portfolio at a meaningful discount to the private market value. At present, however, we believe the double-digit yields that we are achieving on development still represent the best risk-adjusted returns available to us. In closing, I would like to draw your attention to several enhancements that we've made to our quarterly supplemental package in direct response to feedback from the investment community on our disclosure practices. As you can see on Page 32 of the supplemental, we've added a new schedule with details on our land holdings, including acreage, as well as our cost basis. In addition to the leasing activity typically disclosed, on Pages 29 and 30, in our traditional schedule, we've modified the format and added the following new metrics: the initial stabilized cash rent per square foot for new leases; the change in cash rents on renewal leases; tenant retention; and rolling 12 months in addition to the current quarter's activity. The presentation that we posted on the website to accompany today's call is a further step in the direction of improving our communication with The Street. We aim to continue to improve the transparency of our financial disclosures over time and we welcome additional input from analysts and investors in that process. This concludes today's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator and we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So my first question is really regarding sort of the guidance and how it is sort of not necessarily parallel to the leasing that was done during the quarter. So maybe just drilling down on leasing a little bit, can you maybe characterize what you think the leasing -- what will happen to the leasing volume over the course of the next 5 quarters? You mentioned the momentum continued in 4Q, but is it expected to slow materially next year?
Arthur William Stein: The signings are not expected to slow, but what we've been experiencing is a lag in commencements from signings, and that's really a function of the large enterprise customers. They're taking significant amounts of space. And there's a natural, I'd say impediment, to their ability to absorb all that space immediately based on just their needs. So that's taken down over a period of time. And that's the point of that backlog slide, is a lot of this business has been signed up but it will not commence for as much as 6 quarters away.
Michael F. Foust: That's right. So especially with the large tenants, like the one we signed earlier this week, where they're taking multiple pods, they'll phase in 1 or 2 pods at a time and that may take place over a 12- to 18-month period. And so then you have a delay in commencement for each of those phases as they lease in. But the income is there as you can see in that NOI build up. So the asset value and future -- near future cash flows and NOI will go up pretty significantly.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Can you think about bracketing what NOI growth might look like for next year?
Michael F. Foust: Well, if you look on Page 3 on the accompanying slide deck, we break that out for you, and I think in a conservative fashion. This is our -- and this is our backlog. So this slide represents actually signed leases and the contractual backlog that is already baked. So new leasing will be on top of that.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. So, right, so this is no -- this $952 million for 2014 includes no new leasing?
Michael F. Foust: That's correct.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: But that's not necessarily your assumption?
Arthur William Stein: Of course, not.
Michael F. Foust: That is correct. That is not our assumption. That is the minimum baked contractual without any of the good leasing that Matt and his team are doing.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the guidance, you said that you're looking to front-load some of this issuance? Any of the other levers where there's been sort of a conservative treatment so we could understand where the potential upside is here. Because obviously, being 7% below consensus with this initial guidance, it seems a little bit shocking to everybody, the stocks are reacting in that fashion. But it does seem like you guys have reset the bar somewhat. So any other sort of leverage you'd point to where you've tried to take the conservative route besides the sort of, that front-loading the debt?
Arthur William Stein: Well, there's a reduction in capitalized interest that reflects the reduction in capital expenditures. But to the extent that leasing demand merits it, there will probably be additional CapEx towards the end of year or there could be, which would affect the capitalized interest. Right now, there's about a 20% reduction in capitalized interest. I think the other thing to keep in mind, Jordan, is that the JV adversely affects the -- 2014 to the tune of about $0.03 a quarter and obviously, that's in 2013, but it's not in the next 3 quarters of 2014.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Robert Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: On Page 34 of the supplement, you guys list about $561 million of construction in progress. How much of that is going to need to be spent in 2014? And if I'm understanding your comments from earlier, you guys are intending to fund this with debt and preferred, or are you going to need a second JV or some sort of other equity in order to fund that?
Arthur William Stein: I think that most of that's going to be spent next year. And we have enough liquidity on our revolver to fund that without any additional equity. You'll see in our guidance that we're assuming a preferred issuance. On the JV front, we are assuming up to $400 million of additional JV proceeds. But we don't need a JV to fund that construction program.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then, Mike, if you guys were to do another JV, is it also likely, given what you've demand-wise, to be Powered Base assets? And so sort of can you contrast institutional investor demand in a JV format for Turn-Key assets versus Powered Base given the sort of longer-term triple-net leases of those assets?
Michael F. Foust: If we were to do another tranche with a core investor, likely it would be -- it would have some Turn-Key in it but the majority would be Powered Base, likely. It's potentially that we would look at, at other types of investors who may be more core plus, who would look at Turn-Key assets. But right now, we have a limited amount -- number of properties that we would even contemplate at this point putting in a joint venture, and they'd be more geared toward core with a little bit of Turn-Key.
Arthur William Stein: Rob, let me add to that. The way we see ourselves using private capital next year would be to supplement our acquisitions program and enhance the returns on our retained equity. So if you think about the Prudential JV that we did with an 80-20 structure, just think about applying that to a future stabilized acquisition where we retain 20%. But instead of a market cap rate that is, say, call it 7-ish, just for the sake of argument, but it could be under 7, through fees we may be able to boost that into the low double-digits, if not higher, as we did with this JV. So obviously, making the opportunity far more accretive.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Manny Korchman is on with me as well. Bill, just to start with you, can you just sort of go in a little bit more on the development side just so we're really clear as to what's happening currently and into the future? You talked about $800 million dollars of projects that are expected to deliver in '13 at 10% to 12% yields. And I want to understand how much of that will be in the numbers by the end of the year in terms of that run rate? But then the disclosure for 2014 talks about $600 million to $800 million of spend, not necessarily what's getting delivered. And with about $561 million left to spend on the current development pipeline, that would indicate that you're really not starting any new -- or much new development next year at all. And I want to make sure we're thinking about that the right way.
Arthur William Stein: I'll take the second question first. So the capital that's highlighted for 2014 is the spend in 2014. But it's also likely to be close to deliveries as well. There may be some carryover into 2015, but predominantly 2014. And you are right. Most of what's been highlighted for 2015 is either to complete existing projects or it's to honor commitments that we've made to customers for leases that they've signed. So it's really to finish projects that have signed lease commitments. And as for the capital that is in the guidance for 2013 with respect to deliveries, virtually all of that is in the numbers except for whatever is to commence this quarter.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just sticking with commencements. Mike, this is not the first quarter where you sort of had a delay in commencements. If you go back to last year, there was, I believe, 2 quarters where you pushed things out. And I'm just curious what internally from a function perspective are you doing that you can't get ahead of this, because it's a pretty material changes each time in terms of that delay. And while I respect that leasing and the numbers are large, you do have a large portfolio suite, we would hope it would be growing. But why -- is there something internally that was off in terms of tracking this stuff? And I guess, why hadn't you gotten further ahead of it that we're now talking about further delays in that cycle?
Michael F. Foust: That's a good question. And I think part of the challenge is a lot of our customers -- it's not internal methodology and how we're leasing. It really has to do with the decision-making process with our customers. And these large customers, for the most part, this is their first outsourcing and the first of many. So we're working with them in a pretty close partnership. And frankly, in many cases, what their time frames for when they want to complete a lease and they want to get up and running, it has slid more than they thought, more than we thought. And clearly, we haven't been conservative enough in putting in more wiggle room in the time frames for when these deals get actually signed. And then that gets compounded a little bit because on these larger deals, the ramp up, when someone is taking 3, 4, 7 megawatts, you have typically an 18- sometimes even a 24-month ramp on that long-term lease. So I think it's that combination of really spearheading this growing trend for outsourcing, as well as the ramp up. And as Matt went into detail, our mid-market and SMB program, we look to bring in more customers in that middle range, where they'll take space and commence space much more closer to signing.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. And Mike, this is Matt. As you think about the topics that Mike just discussed, it's a natural maturing of the market. When we initially entered the large enterprise segment, we saw a little bit tighter lease-to-commencement time line. And we're starting to see that large enterprise segment mature and take a little more time in their deliberative process as they move forward. But the maturing of the market, especially in the mid-market accounts, is starting to bring that same pattern that we initially saw in the large enterprise now in multiple transactions in the mid-market as well. So we expect to be able to bring -- tighten up the spread between lease signing and commencement inside the mid-market space the same way that we initially did in the large enterprise space.
Michael F. Foust: And I think what will also continue to help that acceleration, the fact that we're doing more and more with existing customers as well. We're expanding in multiple markets, multiple continents, and those tend to be more good size, more bite-size solutions where they are commencing much more closely to lease signings. So I think we'll see that tighten as we do more and more of these expansions with existing customers.
Arthur William Stein: Mike, I'm going to add one more item to that, which is to the extent we are doing business with a customer that hasn't outsourced before, their process may not be as well defined and refined as some of the existing customers that are accustomed to outsourcing. So there can be fits and starts in this process and it could be -- and it is, frankly, a situation where the fellow with the company that's got the data center requirement's talking to our salesperson, and he is absolutely sincere that the requirement needs to be filled within a reasonably short period of time, and our customer -- and our salesperson believes that, too. But then it gets kicked around inside these companies to several different groups and several different levels. And you find that instead of 1 RFP, there might be 2 RFPs or even 3 RFPs, as the requirements go from IT to corporate real estate and back.
Michael F. Foust: But the good news is we are getting these deals signed and we have a good backlog, and that backlog is going to grow significantly over the next 1.5 years -- 1 year, 1.5 years.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Douglas with Bank of America.
Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two, if I could. First, I'm interested in how you're thinking about the pacing of the buyback and kind of what the plan is there to balance that with the leverage? And then within the 2014 guidance, to what extent does that contemplate any buybacks? And then second, on the pricing front, I see the new disclosures on per kilowatt basis for the new leases signed. And I guess I'm wondering is there any kind of context you can put around kind of what the pricing for maybe last quarter would have looked like on that basis.
Arthur William Stein: Well, I'll answer the buyback question. There is no assumption with respect to a buyback in the outlook that we've given for next year. And as I said in my remarks, we consider the returns on our development deals, the 10% to 12% unlevered, to be superior to what the return would be in repurchasing our common stock. Now another point, quite frankly, is that we have -- basically, our capital is earmarked for our development program at this point. So our ability to repurchase common would be a function of raising alternative equity. As to the leverage, we obviously are very keen and focused on maintaining our investment-grade debt ratings. You saw on the statistics that we provided that we are in good shape in that regard. But I think if we were to embark upon a common stock repurchase program, it would be funded with either another preferred issuance or potentially a joint venture.
Michael F. Foust: And in terms of the lease rates as reflected for the per kilowatt, probably last quarter and this quarter are pretty consistent. I think we've seen pretty consistent pricing between the 2 quarters.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group, Inc.: I guess, 2 questions. I guess, first, on kind of the leasing front, if I think about the returns, Mike, that you're sort of talking about and Bill, this 10% to 12%, I guess, it's clear from kind of the way the numbers are penciling out now and the growth going forward that those returns are clearly not being achieved in kind of year 1 of these deliveries, which may have been sort of the old expectations. And I guess, I'm really trying to figure out is this a situation where year 1, these are 4% yields. Year 2, these are sort of 8% yields. And maybe by the third year of stabilization, these are hitting that 10% to 12%. Is that how we should be thinking about it?
Michael F. Foust: Well, yes, when you look at a project, typically it's going to be generally a 36-month process to reach stabilization. Sometimes it might be 40 months. So on an individual lease basis when we do our analysis lease by lease, we fully load all the costs and carry costs into that calculation on a lease-by-lease basis. And then that translates when we're stabilized on that asset, like any development project. In year 3, generally, you're going to be at stabilized or very close to, and that's where you're going to achieve your 10% to 12% unlevered returns.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group, Inc.: Okay. I think maybe part of the problem with estimates is people are giving you kind of these returns kind of day 1 when the project delivers and, clearly, it's taking kind of multiple years to get there, which I think just may be a modeling flaw. I guess, secondly, I just wanted to come back to the kind of the leasing, and you talked about the signings, but obviously, the commencements are falling short. And I guess I'm just trying to think through if a large office tenant kind of took a lot of space and somehow was phasing into it, or got free rent in effect, they would still start the lease kind of day 1 and would recognize ultimately the free rent as kind of a free rent payment. But it seems like in this case, the tenants are phasing into their space and the recognition isn't really starting until they are taking that down. And I guess I'm just trying to think what's different about this versus kind of maybe an office lease and kind of why wouldn't you be starting the leases but then have a larger free rent period?
Michael F. Foust: That's a really good question, and most of the time, what happens with these larger deployments is that because we're building pod by pod, the rent will commence on the pod that's built and being utilized by the customer. So in those cases, it phases in as they occupy pod-by-pod, as opposed to free rent, where customer is taking the entire facility and is getting free rent up front. So it's a little different nuance and the accounting treatment requires you to phase in pod-by-pod for those multi-pod customers.
Arthur William Stein: Just to add to that, Steve, so we would -- we commence upon both the tenant taking possession and Digital's obligations to the tenant in the construction process being met or fulfilled. So as Mike said, if there are multiple PODs, we need to finish the second, third, fourth POD, whatever it is, in order to commence the rent.
Michael F. Foust: And that reflects -- that phasing reflects the fact that for large customers, they just physically -- it's just physically not possible to take down and populate a multi-megawatt data center in 6 months or even a year depending on the size. It's just not feasible for anyone.
Matthew J. Miszewski: And Steve, that's part of why we made a decision to focus an increasing amount of effort on new market opportunities, because while we see the large enterprise exposure as something very positive to the long-term health of the company, we think that in the mid-market space, where the sizings for an ideal customer land is around 1 POD, it fits more directly with being able to commence within the fiscal.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So another question on underestimating the potential delays with the more complex customers. How do we know this is just a timing issue that surprised both you and perhaps the customer, versus any actual slackening of the need on the part of the tenants or at least the delay in their needs versus just the delay in implementation? So how do you know there's not some sort of temporary pause that some of your tenants are seeing in their own needs that's causing them to delay?
Michael F. Foust: That's a good question. And there's 2 -- actually 3 items that give us comfort that demand is really growing and the trend for outsourcing for both enterprises and cloud providers is growing. And first of all, one is the -- that Slide #3, that actually shows you the contractual backlog. I mean, those are signed leases that are commencing over the next short period of time. And over on top of which, new lease revenues will be added. Also on top of that are the signings and the growth in lease signings. So those represent real deals, real requirements that are moving ahead on a contractual basis. And I'd say third is our funnel of prospects that we're addressing directly today continues to grow at a pretty good clip over the last 2 quarters. So all those things give us a lot of confidence that the market for our facilities in our major markets is pretty healthy.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then lastly, regarding the straight-line rent adjustment, I guess what I'm not clear on is why was this one building ever treated any differently than the others? And how do we know there aren't more out there that could require adjustment?
Arthur William Stein: Most of our buildings are owned in feet. So this is 1 of 4 buildings where we have a leasehold and then we have another 7 ground leases. And I think what triggered this -- I mean, the reason we discovered this was that there was a cash bump in the modification in 2014. So cash rents paid didn't change from the original lease term through the initial period of this modification until 2014, which was when the original lease was scheduled to expire and then we added another 10 years to 2014 at an increased rent. So that's how it was discovered. And it's just -- we just don't have that many of them. So our team is obviously very accustomed to processing leases where we are the lessor and our customer is the lessee. Those leases, there are procedures that address that situation and the individuals in asset management, property management deal with those situations every day. This was a different situation. The procedure is still there to deal with the leasehold, but our individuals -- this is one of just a handful of situations where you would have an extension that needs to be reflected in our books and records appropriately, which it was not, and we admit that. We understand why it happened and we've taken additional steps to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Two leasing-related questions to start. First, do you think the delayed commencements further suggests that tenants have the advantage here in negotiating and setting the economic terms of data center leases? So that would be one. And then two, couldn't one argue here that lease signings as a data point just lost a lot of value as a leading indicator for your business? And if it's potentially a false-positive like it seemed to be in this case.
Michael F. Foust: No, I don't think so, Michael. Because if you don't have signings, you don't have future revenues. And the signings are very tangible, contractual-based cash flow that one can underwrite. So I don't think that's the case. And as we mentioned earlier, with the outsourcing being relatively new to a lot of these large customers, it's really the decision-making process and the fact that it is so important, they're entrusting critical facilities to Digital Realty, that it just has taken a longer time than our customers have contemplated and certainly than we estimated. I think we're in a much better position now to estimate and project when these leases will commence. But it certainly does not reflect a reduction at all in demand, and actually, our demand statistics and deals that we're tracking and pursuing have actually increased with Matt's group.
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes, and Mike, I think that on your question about who has the advantage on economics, we certainly do see a differential from market-to-market, and we don't see a connection between delayed commencements in the large enterprise segment and sort of tenant advantage in terms of negotiation. We haven't seen that come through in the -- in this fiscal year and we don't anticipate that coming through in 2014.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I hate to ask another question on lease signings, but we understand there's pretty significant pressure in the market for tenants broadly to sign new leases even when the lag in signing and commencement is long. Are you concerned that at this point you're pulling forward future demand that could result in weaker lease signings in '14 to '15?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So David, thanks for the question. We do see that pressure. We don't believe, given the 4 quarters looking forward pipeline, that we're looking at, that we're pulling forward deals into either Q3 or into Q4. We have a very healthy pipeline throughout the next fiscal year.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then as part of that, and maybe I missed this earlier, but I'm having trouble connecting, I guess, the occupancy declines that we saw in the quarter to the sort of historically high signing. And, obviously, that's a function of the gap between the lease signings and the commencement. Do you expect that to close at some point given the sort of high volume in the quarter?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, definitely. I mean, we've seen a bit of a blip, in that we've delivered completed Turn-Key space into inventory that will be leased over the next year, as well as we had a couple of office leases in non-data center buildings that expired and we're at the very beginning now of re-leasing those in Fremont, California.
Arthur William Stein: One other thing I'd like to mention is that the 2012 third quarter same-store occupancy data included occupancy from the JV assets, which are obviously not in the Q3 2013 since we've -- those are now owned by the venture. I think in the future, we'll be adding a footnote to the disclosure to make that clear. But that was -- that contributed to the decline as well.
Michael F. Foust: Yes, those were all 100% leased buildings.
Arthur William Stein: Right.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: If I may, first, in terms of the commencements and backlog, and I do appreciate the incremental disclosure on Page 3, but could you give us what the commencements number was for the quarter from a revenue perspective? And the backlog, what it is from of revenue perspective? So that way we can sort of tie it to the leasing activity and also the backlog that you provided on prior earnings calls. And then secondly, if I can sort of take us off the leasing path for a minute. I'd like to talk about your interconnected data centers and that initiative, and just give a little sense as to what the services that you're going to be providing? Are you just go to be providing dark fiber or is your intention also to deliver lit services?
Michael F. Foust: For the commencements in the quarter, we're looking at a little over $32 million of annualized GAAP rent and a backlog of almost $91 million of annualized rent.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And could you spread that out for us Mike? Last quarter, you gave us what was expected to commence for the remainder of this year and then '14 and then '15 and beyond. Can you spread that $91 million for us?
Michael F. Foust: Well, we have the actual lease rental revenue realizations that will be contributed on Page 3. We can probably provide something further on that. I don't have that table available right now, but I'm sure we could have more definition around that on kind of what the future revenue streams. Because these only reflect on Page 3 what is going to be realized in that particular year and not the long-term.
Arthur William Stein: We can give you that data at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.
Michael F. Foust: And also, Page 3 here is also NOI, it's not revenues. So we're really taking it down to the actual operating income at the property level for you in that, getting down to the bottom line. So obviously, those revenue numbers will be much larger, representing the future cash flows from each of those leases that will be commencing. You also asked about the network ecosystem, the Digital ecosystem. And that initiative is moving ahead actually quite well. We expect to have our major metros' dark fiber installed between our assets and back to the peering points, by the end of this year, January, February of next year. So we're very close to having those networks completed. And in some cases, providing lit wavelengths for customers that they can utilize as well. What this really allows us is for customers to utilize fiber themselves. It also, probably more importantly, allows the different carriers, metro and long-haul carriers, to land efficiently and effectively in our buildings to serve the customers in those buildings, and tied with the Open IX initiative, really allows all of our buildings in a metro to be connected directly with the major peering points and interconnection facilities, whether they're in a digital facility or whether they're in another location. And that's proven very effective already in customers in London, Silicon Valley and Virginia. And we expect that's going to really create more tenant demand from much wider range of customers than ever before.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So first question just on pricing trends. When I do look at the pricing data for leases signed during 3Q, especially on a per square foot basis, it looks kind of lower than what we've seen historically. Just kind of curious whether that's all geographic-mix-related this quarter or was that more of a power density mix that's kind of making those numbers look somewhat lower than historical levels?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, I think if you look on a per kW basis, they're pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. I think some of it's market mix as much as anything, and the fact that some of our tenants are taking not necessarily lower power densities, though in some cases that is true. But they are taking ancillary space along with the data centers. So the per square foot number was a little bit lower because they're taking staging space, a little bit of office space and it all gets wrapped into that lease.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second thing, just when I take a look at the 2014 guidance and the capital raising activity, I'm still trying to get a sense of why the decision to try to do all the capital raising very early in the year, number one. And then number two, the whole idea of once all that's in place, leverage ratios continue to go up. You're still probably going to be below your self-imposed target, but how comfortable are you kind of moving above those targets and adding more leverage to the overall balance sheet?
Arthur William Stein: Well, the reason we're front-loading the longer-term capital, Tayo, is because we're concerned that we're in a -- that rates will go up at some point next year, that the long-term end of the curve will increase. I mean, it's come down about 50 basis points in the last month or so, and we think this is the time to strike before it goes back up. As far as the leverage ratios are concerned, so the preferred brings the leverage down clearly. The conversion of the debentures to equity, as I said, helps our debt-to-EBITDA by about 0.3. And then the growth in EBITDA as well gives us that capacity. So our forecast shows us right around 5.5x, give or take, over the course of the year. And we're comfortable managing to that. I would hesitate to commit to the equity, that we can take the leverage up until we have the appropriate discussions with the rating agencies. So I'll defer on that question.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James & Associates.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Could you give us the spreads on the re-leasing activity x Equinix?
Michael F. Foust: I don't have that x Equinix...
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: We're hearing the Equinix is a big number.
Michael F. Foust: On the Powered Base Building, they generally reflected kind of the midpoint of the Equinix. We had a couple that went down and a couple that went up in addition to the Equinix ones. But the ones that went down were not material overall.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So I'm sorry, if we pulled Equinix out, the numbers would be similar to what you reported?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, I believe so.
Arthur William Stein: Bill, let me go speak to that for one second. We do disclose the Turn-Key renewals on Page 30 of the sup and we disclosed that both on a cash and GAAP basis. And we have Turn-Key and Powered Base. Equinix is all PBB. And I think one point that I'd like to make about these Turn-Key renewals is if you take a look, the Turn-Key cash renewals are down 2.7%. But we show a rolling 12 quarters -- just on a cash basis, we show a rolling 12 quarters down 7%. So if you think about those 2 numbers, that would, to me, indicate a positive trend on lease spreads.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then sort of beat the horse one more time here on the commencements. When you sign a lease, you contractually assume there's a commencement date at some point. And it may be 1 year out or 2 years out. I guess I'm trying to get my arms around why on a very short-term basis, it would cause you to have to miss guidance in the quarter, for the quarter. I guess that's what I'm trying to get my arms around.
Michael F. Foust: Sure. So part of it is leases getting signed late in the quarter or getting signed in the next quarter. And frankly, we did not forecast conservatively enough to take into account kind of that slippage in timing. So while the signings are good -- are very good, we definitely miscalculated how quickly those deals would get signed within a quarter and if they slip from 1 quarter to the next.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hilmoe with UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's Ross Nussbaum, here with Gabe. Two questions. The first is what are you anticipating the incremental operating expense and G&A spend might be with regard to the expanded effort to target mid-market and smaller tenants. I mean, how much -- how many more bodies do you have to put in place to execute on that initiative?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes, so we've taken a look at the amount of increase that we would need on the sales portion of that expense. And the number of heads is roughly 1/3 growth over where we are in the space today. So we are very wary of not trading too large a burden on our SG&A, but we do have to adjust significantly in order to meet the market.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Do you have a rough dollar estimate as to what that does from a dollar perspective to the payroll?
Matthew J. Miszewski: No, not yet, because we're also in the midst of a market that has -- is resetting its salary requirements. So we don't have the detailed information right now, until we get done with the -- with acquiring the asset.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just wanted to go back to the development commentary for next year, and just it sounds like the incremental dollars' best spent on development. But if I heard the earlier discussion correctly, it does sound like 2014 spend is mostly winding down the existing pipeline. I'm just trying to marry that with the very positive commentary we've been hearing all call on the signings and just the overall demand. Just why would the starts be -- why would there be limited amount of starts if that was the case?
Michael F. Foust: Well, we're in a good position of having sufficient inventory now in the major markets that we've targeted. And so we've gone through the last couple of years really ramping up our development program to meet that demand. And now going forward in 2014, 2015, 2016, we're in a really good position to lease up that space that we've been developing. And so we're ready to accommodate those customers because we have made the investment in our inventory.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just the second question, just on the commencements and some of the sales initiatives that you're implementing, which sound positive. Just curious though, it sounds like the process itself is just simply more complex and that's causing things to be delayed, that's more for the larger users. So is the expected improvement in that commencement timing, is it more just the mix of the type of leases where you're getting some more of the mid- and SMB-type customers, which just naturally brings that down because they're easier deals? Or I'm just curious how the sales force really can impact that decision-making process if it's simply the complexity of the deals that are being undertaken.
Matthew J. Miszewski: I don't want to suggest that they're necessarily the easier deals, but the structure of the companies that we're targeting in the mid-market and SMB space means that there's a higher demand in those markets. So they will have -- they will be incented internally to commence quicker because there's a larger amount of external demand in their business space. And then the sizing of the individual deals makes it sort of a perfect fit for our POD architecture to be able to serve in relatively short time frame. So instead of taking out 8 megs, 10 megs of opportunity, if you're taking out an 11.25, we can roll that in relatively quick.
Arthur William Stein: I want to go back to Ross Nussbaum's question. Just to clarify on one point. So the incremental -- a substantial amount of the incremental compensation from the additional sales personnel will be capitalized in the form of leasing commission. So base salaries are relatively modest, and most of the compensation to that sales force is success-based. And that shows up as capitalized leasing commissions.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with MLV & Co.
Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division: Going back to leasing on your Turn-Key Flex space, the renewals, the weighted average lease term was only 2.9 years this quarter. Just wondering if we should read anything into that? Historically, it's been about 7 to 8 years. Is this just tenants renewing early and just tacking on a few years at the end of their leases, that really don't already expire for a few more years, or is the new reality is that tenants are only leasing 3 or 4 years at a time?
Arthur William Stein: I think -- well, you have 8 deals, so you just don't have that many deals. So I think that could skew it as well. If you look back on a rolling 4 quarters basis, it's 4.5 years with a larger data set.
Michael F. Foust: And you have a few colo deals in there as well that are more of a, by their nature, are shorter term when you have the colo renewals.
Arthur William Stein: That's right.
Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the delay of commencements, just one more question. Just curious if you guys have the flexibility when you sign a lease and realize it's not going to commence until maybe 12 or 18 months from now, can you guys slow down the development spend on that? Or is it going to get developed at the same time anyway, and then you're just carrying it on your balance sheet until it gets occupied?
Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes, Jon, the structure of the POD 3.0 architecture does allow -- and our normal development time line does allow us to match up the actual deployments with the split of schedules as we know them. So if something is an 18-month planned rollout, we have the ability to rollout at staggard terms.
Michael F. Foust: And when you think about it too, it's not that the whole lease doesn't start for a year. You may get -- oftentimes, you'll get a portion of lease starts immediately or close to immediately, and then it phases in over 18 months. So you'll get portions commencing as you go through that 12- to 18-month time frame.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Art Massimiani with Federated Investors.
Art Massimiani: My question relates to FFO versus AFFO. Looking at the slide deck, you do a pretty good job of highlighting the new reset FFO rate. Whenever I look at the supplemental and you do adjusted FFO from there. First of all, you don't give guidance on AFFO, is that correct?
Arthur William Stein: That's right.
Art Massimiani: Okay. So if I look at it and just do a back of the envelope calculation, is the calculation for AFFO for the third quarter, would that be a good run rate, so about $0.89 a quarter kind of starting from this point?
Arthur William Stein: I think that the difficulty in providing guidance on AFFO and just using that as a starting point, relates to capitalized leasing commissions and capitalized leasing compensation, because that's going to be a function of what's signed in the quarter and what's commenced in the quarter. So I would discourage you from using the AFFO line at the very bottom of the page.
Art Massimiani: Okay. That being said, it looks -- could you then relate the lower guidance to what you guys -- how you guys are viewing the dividend going forward?
Arthur William Stein: Yes, the dividend is going to be a function of taxable income. So -- and I've said on many calls and with many investors that our dividend policy is to pay out 100% of taxable income. And the best proxy for growth and taxable income is AFFO. It's not FFO, because AFFO is cash. Having said that, we revisit our dividend level annually at the next board meeting. And we have a -- when we reported the JV, we indicated that we had a sizable taxable gain on the sale of those assets. And the IRS allows a REIT to in essence take some of the distributions made in a subsequent year and count it towards a distribution in the current year if taxable income comes in higher than might otherwise have been forecasted. So this year, our taxable income, because of the sale of assets, is higher than what we thought it was going to be when we set the dividend last year -- or earlier this year. So the implication of that is that we're going to be pulling some of our January 2014 dividend back into 2013 to satisfy the 100% distribution requirement. So having said that, what that means is that our 2014 distributions are starting out light because you can't count it twice. The only way we can meet our 2014 distribution requirement will be to raise our dividend to a level that gets us to a 100% payout of taxable income. We haven't determined exactly what that is, but that's our situation.
Operator: Next question is a follow-up question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A quick one, hopefully. On inventory, we've referenced this a number of times in terms of what's available for lease up. In some of your disclosures, obviously, occupancy disclosures by property, you referenced this. But I guess I'm trying to pinpoint a different number, which would just be total available inventory of Turn-Key versus PBB space that are available for lease up today. So completed developments. I know you point us to what's been completed in the quarter, but is there a spot in your disclosures where you have total available inventory for lease up?
Arthur William Stein: Yes, it's on Page 27 of the supplemental. At the very top line for each product type, it says, available. So for example, at the end of this quarter, we had 421,251 square feet of Turn-Key available and 161,000 square feet of PBB available. Do you see that, Jordan, on Page 27?
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I do see that. That's perfect. And so anything -- and that obviously excludes anything in the development pipeline?
Arthur William Stein: That's just what's available today.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Two quick follow-ups. One was just can we just get a little bit more specific on the capital drag. If you think about almost $1 billion of capital raise, call it, a midsize rate when you blend preferred and the debt, you are talking about a $0.38 drag before you use that capital. So I'm just curious what you're putting in, in terms of the return on that capital, knowing that you have the $600 million to $800 million of spend and about $200 million of debt maturities. Clearly, the timing of when you do that and when you capitalize will offset some of almost the $0.40 drag of interest expense and preferred expense. So can you just be very specific in terms of what's embedded into 2014 guidance for that? And then the second question relates to this $90 million of NOI backlog. And it would be very helpful to understand what that backlog is attached to. And so there's a handful of things that are out there. You have $800 million of deliveries this year. You have a $1.1 billion current development pipeline. You have vacancy in your core portfolio. I don't know, I can't remember if it includes renewals, I believe, it doesn't. But can you sort of break out where that $90 million is attached to so that we can better understand the dynamics of what's left?
Arthur William Stein: Michael, let me handle your first question. So we are assuming that the preferred and the debt is in place for the full year 2014, for the purposes of the outlook that we gave you. We are not assuming any acquisitions. That capital is being used to retire short-term debt at basically a very low rate given where LIBOR is today. For planning purposes, we're assuming a preferred at 7.5 and a debt at 5%. So a little bit higher than what you have in mind. I mean, if you were to think of something that's a little more normalized, you might say well, maybe we would do these financings midyear rather than at the beginning of the year but then of course rates, we think, would be higher as well. I'm not sure if that addresses your question, but we're not deploying that capital incrementally into acquisitions and really, the dilution is a function of retiring short-term debt and replacing it with what we think is a more prudent capital in terms of its duration.
Michael F. Foust: And in terms of breaking out where the commencements and NOI is being delivered, it's really primarily from -- for 2014, from the product that's been delivered and is work in progress that will be delivered in the first half of the year. So that's primarily in large part from space that's built in inventory or currently under construction.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Guys, just curious on your mindset on capital allocation and your cost of capital. I think with today's share price action, this will take you certainly below your own, what I would guess is your own estimate of NAV. I'm just curious how -- even if that discount is not enough to make share buybacks attractive at this point, does it temper your enthusiasm for deploying capital into developments? Just curious how it affects your cost of capital versus capital allocation opportunity mindset?
Arthur William Stein: Well, the capital that's being deployed next year, Michael, is to finish projects that are very near completion. Some of them are physically complete, but we just need to finish the billing, and then it's to build out projects for which we have signed leases. So there's really not much discretion in that capital allocation.
Michael F. Foust: And it's going to generate, we think, still attractive returns relative to other uses of capital.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering in terms of the backlog, are there any contractual outs for the customers that have signed up for these commitments? Are there circumstances where they can push out the start date or they can pull it forward for that matter?
Michael F. Foust: Really, there are no outs, other than in some cases if it's a build to suit, where if our development takes longer than planned then the commencement would happen later. But we don't anticipate that occurring in any cases. And so there are no outs in any of these leases.
Operator: And your last question comes from David Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I guess, first on cost of capital, but thinking more from your customers' point of view. I know historically there's been a lot of discussion about oversupply in the market or competitive pressures out there, pricing at below market pricing. But I mean, what's been the impact since, let's say, 2009 and the financial crisis, of your customers' cost of capital getting substantially better and the impact of that on your returns versus kind of some of these other inter-market factors like new supply? And I guess, to tie into that, do you think that pressure, if in fact it's there, is abating at all?
Michael F. Foust: Well, the customers' decision to outsource data center facilities, certainly, they are looking at their cost of capital and they are realizing in many cases, if not most cases, that their investment opportunities are better investing in their own businesses rather than in the expensive data center infrastructure facilities that we specialize in. So it's really where customers set their internal hurdle rates and their internal return requirements. And I think we're seeing almost across the board, except for the Googles and Microsofts of the world, almost everyone else is saying, "Hey, our internal hurdle rates are such that it makes sense for us to outsource."
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then as a second question, just to visit a topic I guess that was too often discussed earlier in the year, but with regard to obsolescence of the data space. I think a long time, your average lease term for first gen space that you delivered was about 11 years. It seems that most of the renewals that you're seeing, as you said, are somewhere between 2.5 and 4.5 years in total. That's kind of capping you out at maybe a 15-year total combined lease term, or 15 to 17. I don't know, is there any reason why there's kind of an inability to push above that on some of these second generation spaces? Can you give us any recent examples of combined first and gen -- first and second gen spaces that may be pushing beyond that hurdle to give us more confidence that there's not a big kind of capital spend in year 15 or so?
Michael F. Foust: Well, yes, certainly. I mean, there are 2 things -- I think you're looking at a pretty limited base of customers there from the Turn-Key just because of small number. If you look at combined Turn-Key and Powered Base Building renewals, those have gone out -- the Powered Base Building especially lately have gone out 10 years, 15 years. So those are -- have gone out, in many cases, very far. And what's interesting to know is that our cost on those renewals, even on the Turn-Key this past quarter, our cost per square foot was only $7 on Turn-Key and less than $2 a foot on the Powered Base Building, and -- which means, as a landlord, we're contributing very little capital. And on the Turn-Key, I can tell you, it's all leasing commissions. I mean, really none of it's going into TI or refresh, which really shows how long-lived these assets are, otherwise our customers would be asking us for a refresh capital, and that's just not happening.
Operator: There are no further questions.
Michael F. Foust: Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for taking the time today. And I want to thank our team for the hard work and everybody's attention. And I just want to emphasize the fact that our business is healthy, demand is growing and we expect to see really increased returns for our shareholders going forward here. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the show over to Pamela Garibaldi, Investor Relations of Digital Realty. You may begin.
Pamela M. Garibaldi: Thank you very much. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the Digital Realty earnings press release. If you have not, you can access one in the Investors section of our website at www.digitalrealty.com or you may call (415) 738-6500 to request a copy.

Now I'd like to introduce Mike Foust, CEO; and Bill Stein, CFO and Chief Investment Officer. Following management's remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust: Thank you Pamela, and welcome to the call, everyone. I will begin today's call with a brief summary of our second quarter operations. After my comments, Bill will discuss our second quarter financial results, capital markets activities and the revised 2013 guidance. Following his remarks, we will open the call to questions. We continue to experience strong leasing momentum and demand across our portfolio, particularly with our traditional customer base. That base consists of large corporate enterprise users, cloud infrastructure providers and Internet-based applications and services, including e-retail. They rely on Digital Realty to provide a dependable and secure environment for storage and processing of mission-critical electronic information, as well as housing primary IT applications. These corporate enterprise customers, representing leading companies from financial services, consumer and health care sectors, among others, often require large, multisite builds that deliver high-quality, long-term revenue for Digital Realty. Looking forward, we're implementing several strategic initiatives that will make our best-in-class data center platform more accessible to a wide range of enterprise customers and IT service providers. One such initiative is the transition of our sales team from one highly focused on opportunity management to a more diversified approach and raising [ph] a heightened focus on strategic account management under the leadership of Matt Miszewski, our Senior Vice President of Sales. This transition will match our market segmentation to our strategic sales effort and is designed to result in higher average deal sizes, shorter deal cycles and increased pricing power. We've also been working to implement a diversification revenue enhancement strategy by targeting mid-market customer segments within specific verticals selected for their growth potential. These targets will include companies that meet Digital's ideal customer profiles and as such, represent latent market demand and are positioned within verticals that represent higher probabilities of closure for Digital. Together, we're confident that the new strategic account management and mid-market strategies will capture incremental demand and provide us with a more diversified and predictable view toward our quarterly leasing results. These programs, combined with our connectivity ecosystem initiative and the data center infrastructure management, the DCIM offering, are critical components of our evolution. By leveraging our scale, operational expertise, global footprint and financial resources, our goal is to capitalize on our first-mover advantage by creating an unmatched data center offering for large and small enterprise requirements that would be very difficult to replicate in the marketplace. We are excited by the growth prospects from these initiatives and believe they further increase the high barriers to entry in our business. During the second quarter, leases were signed representing $16 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. And we're pleased to report that the remaining leases we expected to sign by June 30 have been complete since the quarter end. These additional lease signings totaled $19.6 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, bringing the total combined total to approximately $35.6 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. And this is in line with our original expectations and reflects level demand we're experiencing across our portfolio. It is important to note that with the exception of the one lease that was completed yesterday, the July signings are not included in our third quarter leasing goals, which are tracking as expected. We remain confident that we will meet our new leasing expectations for the year. Evidence of positive trends in the leasing environment is the solid pricing we've achieved, which we believe reflects improved market conditions in some markets, such as Ashburn, Virginia. The average annual rental rate for leases signed in the second quarter in North America for our Turn-Key Flex space was $209 per foot, and that's on a GAAP basis, which includes 2 power expansions signed in the second quarter. Excluding the power expansions, the rates averaged $177 per square foot, up significantly from our rolling 4-quarter average rate of $153 per foot. On a per kilowatt per month basis, the weighted average rate was approximately $178. Our current backlog, including leases signed to date, totals $95.2 million of annualized GAAP revenues, of which, $43.2 million are expected to commence in 2013, $31.6 million expected to commence in 2014, '15 and $20.5 million are expected to commence between 2016 and 2018. Please note that our backlog represents committed lease contracts that have been signed but have not yet commenced. These lease signings represent a wide variety of industry verticals, including financial services, colocation, IT services, online retailing and health care. Our unparalleled global footprint, which spans over 30 markets around the world, played a key role in capturing this demand. Markets where we experienced most activities were Boston, Northern Virginia, Chicago, Houston, Austin, Phoenix, our new site in Toronto, as well as internationally, London, Sydney and Singapore, outside of North America. The weighted average projected at year 1 stabilized return on investment for Turn-Key Flex leases signed in the first half of 2013 was approximately a healthy 12.4%. And this is consistent with historical trends and in line with our projected range of ROI of 11% to 14%. The current leasing prospect pipeline for new facilities stands at 1.8 million square feet, down from last quarter, largely due to the volume of leases we signed since the end of the first quarter. This figure represents current prospects in our sales funnel to whom we've made proposals and which we believe have 30% or greater likelihood of signing. In addition to the new strategies I mentioned, macro trends reflect a solid demand outlook that we believe will add to the current pipeline. First, big data has started to result in real, large-scale enterprise data center demand. In addition, the computational effort needed to accomplish the analytics attached to big data further increases both the space and power needed by our customers and our prospects. This is in addition to the network capacity demanded and utilized by these users. Second, the mobile revolution has increased back-office computational needs and has driven the adoption of internal clouds to service newly developed mobile enterprise application. Furthermore, the move to the cloud is driving a transition to internal cloud platforms that answer the data center space and power needed by enterprises, while they continue to support their legacy environments. To the degree to which growth is incurring in the public cloud and hybrid cloud spaces, we are also seeing positive impact to our business from both the growth of cloud providers, whom we count as customers, as well as enterprise connectivity to multiple cloud service providers, which can now be supported by our new global network ecosystem. Turning now to our re-leasing activity. Turn-Key Flex rates on renewals were up nearly 1% on a cash basis and up 8.6% on a GAAP basis in the quarter. Powered Base Building renewal rates were up 1.7% on a cash basis and up fully 27.5% on a GAAP basis. And colocation renewal rates were up 3.6% on a cash basis and up 14.7% on a GAAP basis. These re-leasing spreads were stronger than we projected. And for the remainder of the year, we are projecting rent spreads for data center space overall to be up 2.8% on a cash basis and up approximately 28.6% on a GAAP basis. However, there are a few Turn-Key Flex leases that we expect to renew during the second half of the year, which we expect to roll down from currently very high rates. We expect re-leasing spreads for Turn-Key space to be down approximately 13.6% on a cash basis and up 3% on a GAAP basis for the remainder of the year. Offsetting the decrease, we expect re-leasing spreads for Powered Base Building, which include early renewals, to be up approximately 12.9% on a cash basis and up a very healthy 44.5% on a GAAP basis. Occupancy decreased slightly during the quarter, primarily due to the expiration of non-data center leases. Excluding the nontechnical space, data center occupancy remains strong at 95.5% in the second quarter compared to 95.9% in the first quarter. In terms of supply and demand in our major U.S. markets, we're tracking a 12.8 megawatt shortfall of space nationwide overall. Specifically, we are enthusiastic about the dynamics we are seeing in Northern Virginia, the New York, New Jersey, Metro, Houston, Austin, Chicago, London, Amsterdam and generally in Asia-Pac. Turning now to our acquisitions program. Our strategy consists of targeting institutional-quality operating data centers, including sale-leaseback transactions, wherein users are looking to monetize their real estate assets while partnering with an operator that can support their ongoing data center operations. In addition, we acquired development sites to add future inventory in top global markets, where our customers need to locate their data center operations. During the second quarter, we added 1 development site and 2 income properties to our portfolio, including the sale-leaseback transaction we announced earlier this week in the Netherlands, with international network provider, KPN. In addition, we acquired the 6-building complex in Austin that is home to several data center network providers and other technology firms. Excluding the development site in Metro London, the average going-in cash cap rate for the second quarter transaction was 8.5%. As of June 30, we have completed $138.1 million in acquisitions at an average going-in cash cap rate for the income-producing properties of 10%. And this is well ahead of our guidance range of 7.25% to 7.75%. Our current pipeline of potential acquisitions totaled approximately $750 million, including high-quality, stabilized properties, value-add opportunities, roundup development sites, as well as sale-leaseback transactions. This excludes larger portfolios that we continue to track. Pricing in the U.S. has risen rapidly for stabilized long-term lease properties in major markets. Cap rates in the high 5s to mid-6s are becoming the norm, largely driven by core institutional investors and a couple of nontraded REITs. While this is a great reflection of the true NAV of our digital portfolio, it does make purchasing income properties become more challenging. However, with our operating, leasing and development platforms, we are quite competitive in situations were some in-place leases have less than 7 or 10 years remaining or there might be a value-add component that we can underwrite as a developer of data centers. I would now like to provide a brief update on the progress we are making on our digital ecosystem connectivity initiative. Our digital Ashburn, Virginia and Richardson, Texas campuses and our London sites are all tied together via dark fiber. Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Silicon Valley and New York Metro, including New Jersey, are in the final planning phases and we are well on our way to meeting our U.S. deployment expectations by year-end 2013. In addition, at our North American locations, we can now directly provide customers with IP network services, greatly facilitating new data center deployments and expansions. In fact, we're already seeing results, including from our London deployment. We were able to expand a subsidiary of a Fortune 100 customer 2 sites at Woking and Redhill, in large part due to the site's interconnectivity. Essentially, the dual-site requirement was predicated on the customer's ability to access and procure a significant number of dark fibers, which the customer have been controlling in support of their heavy content distribution needs between the 2 sites. In addition, the direct access we provide to key London and European Internet exchange facilities was an important prerequisite for the customer. Overall, we significantly reduced this customer's annual network cost, further lowering their total cost of occupancy in digital properties. We continue to see growing demand from customers for enhanced Metro connectivity and the ecosystem initiative greatly expands the value we deliver to our customers. We are very pleased with the progress we are making throughout our business and across our portfolio. 2013 is, in some ways, a transitional year for the company as we make significant enhancements to our portfolio and to our processes. We are already seeing the results of these efforts and expect to fully realize the benefits in 2014 and beyond. Ours is a dynamic and exciting sector that we believe requires both innovation and a global presence to address the future needs to our customers as they continue to embrace new technologies and compete in a globalized economy. More importantly, we believe that our talented professional team, superior delivery and operating platform, financial strength and investment expertise, Digital Realty has unparalleled competitive advantages as a global provider of data center solutions. As we work to further enhance and grow the business, we remain focused on enhancing our shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill.
Arthur William Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by discussing changes to our accounting policies, as well as new disclosures in our quarterly supplementary report. I will then review our quarterly results, provide an update on our funding strategy and capital markets activities and address our revised guidance. In terms of our accounting policies, to be more in line with GAAP accounting practices, in the second quarter, we began capitalizing all eligible portfolio-related costs totaling $10,000 or less, including those incurred in the first quarter. Previously, these costs were being expensed. In addition, we conformed [ph] our policy covering construction period offering cost with our interest capitalization policy, such that completion dates are now consistent. Our effective completion date is tied to receipt of certificate of occupancy. As a result, in the second quarter, we capitalized $3.4 million of additional operating repairs and maintenance and real estate tax expenses, of which, $1.5 million relates to the first quarter. Separately, in response to requests from our shareholders, we have made additions and clarifications to our quarterly supplemental report. This includes a new schedule on Page 26, titled Portfolio Overview by Property Type. This schedule provides further visibility into our portfolio by consolidating our properties by corporate data center, Internet gateway, data center and nondata center properties. Within each property type, we have also provided detailed information around the annualized base rent by product type. In addition, on our historical capital expenditures schedule on Page 29, we have modified the footnotes to improve the definitions of how we categorize recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. These modifications have been made to further clarify how we define capital expenditures. On Page 10 of the supplemental, capitalizing internal leasing commissions are now separately disclosed on the AFFO reconciliation. Recurring capital expenditures on our AFFO table now agrees to our historical capital expenditure table on Page 29. This modification was made to make reconciling the numbers easier. On Pages 9, 12 and 13 in the consolidated and same-store and new properties quarterly statements of operations and same-store operating trend summaries, we also broke out the repairs and maintenance line items from rental property operating expenses. As a reminder, this expense item is in addition to the recurring CapEx we spend to maintain our properties. These additions and enhancements are consistent with our policy of ensuring best-in-class reporting practices, as well as greater transparency for our shareholders. As always, we welcome your suggestions. Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, second quarter 2013 FFO was $1.22 per share, up 5.2% from the first quarter 2013 FFO of $1.16 per share and up 11.9% from second quarter 2012 FFO of $1.09 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams, second quarter 2013 core FFO was $1.19 per share or $4.1 million lower than reported FFO. These adjustments consists of: a $5.6 million insurance settlement gain related to disputed construction costs from activities dating back to 2009; a $370,000 adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout, which were partially offset by $1.5 million of transaction expenses and a $500,000 write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the payoff of the mortgage at the Clonshaugh property in Ireland. As noted in the past, a fair value assessment of a 3-year Sentrum earnout obligation is required for each reporting period and is likely to result in some quarterly earnings fluctuations. Changes in fair value are considered noncore adjustments. Turning now to the income statement. Net operating income increased by $7.4 million or 3.3% to $234.7 million in the second quarter of 2013 from $227.3 million last quarter. The increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing, acquisitions and the present value accretion related to the Sentrum earnout. Looking at expense line items. Rental property operating expense decreased by $2.2 million to $22.9 million in the second quarter of 2013 from $29.1 million last quarter, primarily due to the changes to our cost capitalization policy that I just discussed and an adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout. During the quarter, repairs and maintenance expense was $22.3 million, down from $23.6 million in the first quarter, primarily due to also to changes in our capitalization policy. Looking further down the income statement. Property taxes were $19.4 million in the second quarter, down from $21 million in the first quarter, primarily due to a favorable property tax adjustment for our 350 Cermak property that resulted from a lower tax assessment, a portion of which was passed on to our tenants. G&A increased to $17.9 million in the second quarter compared to $16 million last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the continued growth of the company, as well as our independent directors' annual equity award grants that were fully vested and expensed during the quarter. Interest expense decreased to $47.6 million in the second quarter compared to $48.1 million last quarter. Although gross interest increased in the second quarter due to additional borrowings, we capitalized $1.3 million of additional interest in the second quarter, primarily due to an aggregate increase in spending on qualified activities. Tax expense decreased to $210,000 in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $1.2 million last quarter, primarily due to noncash deferred tax benefit from foreign operations. Lastly, preferred stock dividends increased to $11.4 million in the second quarter from $8.1 million last quarter due to the issuance of the Series G preferred stock in early April. As a result of the changes in our cost capitalization policy, NOI margins, excluding utility reimbursements, increased by 180 basis points to 76.1%. Excluding the expense reduction resulting from the changes in capitalization policy and the fair market value adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout, the NOI margin will be 74.9%, which is in line with historical levels. Likewise, second quarter same-store NOI increased by $4.8 million to $200.2 million compared to $195.4 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and adjusted for noncash purchase accounting adjustments, was $181 million in the second quarter, up $6.3 million from $174.7 million last quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was largely due to the incremental revenue from new leasing and reduction to operating expenses related to capitalization policy changes. Excluding the expense reduction resulting from the changes, same-store cash NOI would be $177.7 million, up $3 million compared to last quarter. I would now like to turn to our funding strategy and capital markets activities. Our funding strategy includes issuing debt in local currencies to provide a natural hedge in mitigating our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and our growing international operations. Local debt as a percentage of regional assets ranges from 44% to 97%, depending on the currency. As part of this strategy, we are currently engaged in discussions to refinance our $1.8 billion global revolving credit facility, as well as our $750 million senior unsecured term loan. We're looking to take advantage of improved bank pricing in the loan market in light of the overall of volatility in interest rates. We expect to upsize both facilities, extend final maturities and modify certain covenants. In addition, we expect to have access to a number of additional currencies to help accommodate our growing global investment program. We're also exploring a potential joint venture on a pool of our existing assets. With this joint venture, we would seek to establish a private market valuation on the contributed assets, while maintaining significant equity ownership and operational control of the assets, access the new source of capital at a cost well below the returns we expect to achieve on new investment opportunities and generate management fees and thus, a higher return on investment -- on our retained investment. Turning to our balance sheet. Total assets grew to $9.2 billion in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $9 billion last quarter, which is consistent with the continued growth and scale of our business. Total debt for the second quarter was unchanged from last quarter at $4.7 billion. We currently have $1 billion of immediate liquidity, including funds that can be drawn on our existing global revolving credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility term loan, Prudential Shelf Facility and other unsecured debt. As of the end of the day yesterday, the balance on our $1.8 billion global revolver was $784 million. Since the end of the second quarter, we've paid off 3 loans totaling $56.9 million. We now have $158 million remaining in principal amortization and debt maturities in 2013 with a weighted average cost of 6%. We plan to retire the remaining amount initially with the revolver and eventually refinance with additional long-term unsecured debt, secured debt and/or preferred stock. As stated in today's earnings release, with better visibility towards our year-end results, we are narrowing our 2013 core FFO guidance range to between $474 and -- $4.74 to $4.83 per share, increasing the low end by $0.04 and reducing the high end by $0.02. As a reminder, core FFO excludes items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams. In addition, we are raising our 2013 FFO guidance range to between $4.73 and $4.82 per share, increasing the low end by $0.08 and increasing the high end by $0.02. The incremental increase in FFO guidance compared to core FFO guidance is primarily driven by the one-time gain related to the insurance settlement of approximately $0.04 to FFO. Furthermore, we now expect core FFO and FFO to be in line for the year. As a result, this guidance represents expected core FFO growth of 6.3% to 8.3% over 2012 core FFO of $4.46 per share and FFO growth of 6.5% to 8.6% over 2012 FFO of $4.44 per share. These revisions do not include the impact of the potential joint venture. With respect to the change, underlying our revised the 2013 guidance FX assumption, the impact from this change was more than offset by higher margins from the changes to our cost capitalization policy. This concludes our formal remarks. Mike and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman of Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Bill, I just wanted to just dive into the accounting things just for a moment. So you didn't restate first quarter results at all from FFO, you just adjusted FFO for the CapEx disclosure. But I'm more concerned about sort of earnings. So this $3.4 million change is effectively that $0.025 all in the second quarter?
Arthur William Stein: That's right. So roughly $0.01 of that would have been in the first quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hilmoe of UBS.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Bill, just a question on the joint venture. I guess, can you talk a little bit about potential size, who the -- what kind of partner might that be? And is this, in terms of the deal, like one large deal? Or is this kind of a staggered transaction that could close over a period of time?
Arthur William Stein: I'm reluctant to go into too much specificity before we close. But I will tell you it is one deal. Approximate deal size, we'll say, between $350 million and $400 million. It's one institutional investor. It's, I believe, a highly regarded institutional investor in the real estate space. And right now, we're expecting just -- I think I said one close, and that will -- I expect that will be in the third quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Can you talk a little bit about the Asia-Pacific business as to what you're seeing there in terms of opportunities to both expand and from a leasing standpoint?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. I'd be happy to. So we're seeing new opportunities in Japan. We expect to be closing soon on a development site outside of Osaka. We're moving ahead on schedule with our new development and joint venture with Savvis in Hong Kong and have very good interest in that new development. Also continue to discuss potential joint ventures with IT services companies in China, we'll see where that goes. And then we're seeing a pickup in leasing now in Singapore. It was a little slow for a couple of quarters, and now we're seeing requirements pick up in that market, which we know is going to be a very strong market ongoing for. So Asia, we see as having really good opportunities. And we have good activity in Sydney and Melbourne on those developments as well. You may recall, in Melbourne, NAB is the anchor tenant there and we have a couple of international firms as our anchor tenants in Sydney.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes. So I was interested in what you're seeing in terms of competitive behavior. You talked a little bit about supply being scarce in a number of markets, the competitive behavior, and when deals go away from you, what's the most common reason? And then maybe just an update on the connectivity strategy. You mentioned where you hoped to be by yearend. But if you could elaborate on your ability to fully pursue that business in the U.S., given some of the exclusivity that Telx has to offer the interconnects within several of your sites.
Michael F. Foust: Sure. We have certainly a very large footprint in North America and globally, which allow us to provide a wide range of space both in our Internet gateway buildings, as well as in our suburban data center facilities. So we can provide that space, whether it's smaller colo space or larger wholesale space, over a megawatt, to these different corporates and IT services companies that are delivering cloud services and require that connectivity. So all in all, I think we're incredibly well-positioned to deliver the space and the connectivity within our buildings, within our business parks. And as we mentioned back to the major network and Internet peering points, whether they're at in an Equinix facility or driving more business as well to an Equinix or Savvis or other folks. So it generally should be a win-win because hopefully we'll be driving more connectivity and Internet traffic back to these various peering points, whether they're in a Digital building or in another location. I'm sorry, the other question. Sorry, when we're seeing competitors -- competitor pricing. Typically, when a deal is done away with us, it's usually on price, where in some cases, we just feel we won't go as low as some of the competitors might, especially some of these folks that have 1 or 2 sites and don't have a portfolio approach to their business necessarily. But oftentimes, we are able to achieve a premium over our competitors because of our service, our professional operational platform and the fact that we can -- because of our modular POD architecture approach, we can customize spaces even within our Turn-Key Flex designs to meet the application requirements of the IT department. And that's very powerful as well as having fully dedicated UPS and cooling to the suites. And having that dedicated backup power and cooling is a very important criteria, especially among the corporate enterprise financial services groups.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. One question, 2 parts. So on the potential joint venture, the size was helpful. Should we expect pricing to be the range, Mike, that you offered up that you're seeing pricing in the private market, high 5s and mid-6s? And separately, as it relates to the guidance adjustment, what portion in total related to the accounting change? I think you said it was $3.5 million or $3.4 million of additional OpEx for the first half. So is it appropriate to annualize that, get to $7 million for the full year essentially of additional capitalized OpEx?
Arthur William Stein: Yes. Roughly $0.05 for the year from that, Jordan.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: $0.05 benefit?
Arthur William Stein: Roughly. Yes, I'd qualify [ph] that. And then in terms of the JV again, we're in negotiations with a partner now. So I'm reluctant to say too much. You can assume the cap rates are -- they'll be in rates that are attractive to us.
Michael F. Foust: Yes. I mean, they'll be significantly below our guidance for new acquisitions because of the long-term leases and stability in those assets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Thanks for giving us the extra color on the leases that occurred in July. I was wondering if you might give us a little background there and maybe we can get a sense as to whether it was Turn-Key or Powered Base Building and if the rates were sort of in line with what you saw in the second quarter.
Michael F. Foust: Sure. Yes, it's a -- the leases were almost entirely Turn-Key Flex or fully fitted-out Custom Solutions that we'll be building. And in colo space, that's fully fitted-out colo space. And that's consistent with the trends we're seeing now. We are doing a few Powered Base Building leases but well over 90%. I think of the deals we're doing now are Turn-Key. And rates being pretty consistent with what we've been doing historically, probably be a little higher in that case. So a nice combination of existing customers, new customers and seeing a lot of expansion in multiple sites, as we mentioned around trends with big data and cloud and hybrid cloud.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just another question on July. Could you quantify how much of July's strong leasing, in other words, how much of that $19.5 million in rental revenue signed would you characterize as having been delayed from the second quarter versus what might just be ordinary July signings, so to speak? I'm just trying to get a feel for whether there's any acceleration in leasing in July versus what the monthly average throughout the second quarter was.
Michael F. Foust: Yes. Actually the great, great majority of what we achieved in the last 3 weeks were leases we expected to close by June 30 and spilled over. There might be a couple million dollars of revenue, $1.5 million to a couple million that we would consider third quarter deals. And we expect to third quarter to meet our expectations in terms of leasing velocity. So we're very comfortable that we're on track. It's hard to keep in the course of business to keep too specific dates and quarter-by-quarter. And so it's -- as you all can appreciate it, it's often better to view things on longer timeframes. But yes, the leasing velocity is very good, we think.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart, Green Street Advisors.
John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Bill, just a couple additional follow-ups on the JV. First of all, the $350 million to $400 million amount that you referenced, is that the transaction size or is that proceeds? And are you talking about closer to the sale of a 50% interest or an 80% interest? And last but not least, have you seen any sensitivity from your partner on pricing, given the recent move in rates?
Arthur William Stein: So the $350 million is the total asset value. We are looking at 20-80 joint venture, where we'd be 20% and our partner would contribute 80%. So 80% of that $350 million to $400 million will be coming back to us. And we've seen no sensitivity as a result of those changing rates.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I'm trying to get my hands around the outlook for lease commencements. You've done about $53 million year-to-date. You have about another $43 million of leases signed but haven't commenced. Just kind of thinking about the back half of the year and where you were last year, you had $135 million, how comfortable you feel with the ability to kind of do better than that this year, given your outlook for the back half.
Michael F. Foust: We're certainly on track -- probably maybe even -- we're certainly on track to meet our budgets and our revenue expectations. We're probably lagging a little bit from a timing perspective, especially with these leases that are falling over by 3 or 4 weeks, do have an impact in terms of timing. But I mean, we're confident we'll be in our guidance range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach of ISI Group.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Mike, you mentioned that the leasing in the second quarter was consistent with kind of the new expectations for the year. I guess, can you just update us on the -- your sort of targets for leasing commenced space here in the 2013 and how that relates to what you achieved in 2012?
Michael F. Foust: We're certainly, on the lease signings, we're well ahead of where we were at this point in time in July of 2012. I don't know off the top of my head how far ahead we are in terms of lease signings.
Arthur William Stein: Roughly $80 million into mid-July equates to, I think, the first 3 quarters of last year for signings.
Michael F. Foust: So on signings, we're...
Arthur William Stein: 2.5 months ahead.
Michael F. Foust: Right. So we're making very good progress on signings. As I said, the commencements have been delayed a little bit from our expectations, especially with the latest batch of signings in July, which is great. But they're a few weeks later than we anticipated. So that will have a bit of an effect on the higher end of commencements.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just curious on the comments about the sales force initiatives. You mentioned one of the benefits being hopefully getting some shorter leasing cycles there. I'm just curious, are you -- and just in relation to the comments about the commencements, but are you seeing any shortening in the leasing cycle today just as a result of changing business conditions or improving business conditions?
Michael F. Foust: Not with our larger enterprise customers, and for a variety reasons there. These are large deployments for them and in large internal budgets for their own IT deployment and their own costs over and above the data center we're providing. As you can imagine, there's more levels of approval now, even for budgeted items within most organizations of substance that we're dealing with. And we're doing more customization as well. With our Turn-Key Flex product, we're doing a lot of tailoring to the IT application requirements themselves and customers' operating program. So that's taking some additional time as we go through the design and engineering project with our -- process with our customers for our Turn-Key Flex POD approach.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Two questions. Bill, any interest in using proceeds from the joint venture to buy back stock at the current price? And then the second question -- well, let's just leave it there with that question.
Arthur William Stein: Bill, that's one of the alternatives, for sure. So when we close the venture, we'll have to look at what our investment opportunities are at the company. And depending upon investment opportunities, we would either use all the proceeds to pay down the revolver or the other alternative would be to make the use of proceeds leverage-neutral, which is to say partially to retire debt and partially to retire equity in accordance with our pro forma capitalization. And of course, we could do anything along that spectrum.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. There is no response from that line. Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman, Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, it's Michael Bilerman again. Bill, I was wondering maybe you can just explain a little bit more sort of what exactly, when you went through the maintenance and the change in capitalization policy: a, just really what the driver of the change was; two, I guess, why you felt that, that wasn't really material of putting that in the press release and the supplemental as sort of forewarning people beforehand just given how much scrutiny CapEx overall has received and the materiality of that being $0.05. And then lastly, from an FX perspective, I guess, I'm surprised at the magnitude. I know the U.S. dollar has strengthened a lot. But just given the fact that you have local debt in a lot of these markets helping to offset some of the impact, I guess, I'm surprised at the magnitude of you really saying in FX is a $0.05 hit.
Arthur William Stein: I'll start with the FX, Michael. I think there must have been a misinterpretation there. So the FX is, I think, probably $0.01 hit at most, maybe $0.02. In terms of the -- what was the question on the -- oh, capitalization. So a little additional clarification on the capitalization. So we had -- and previously, we had been expensing all capital expenditures of $10,000 or less. And today, we are capitalizing what's appropriate to capitalize down to any amount, which is really consistent with GAAP. The $10,000 and lower policy, I think, was more or less a holdover from our IPO days. $10,000 was a holdover from our IPO days when we had limited resources and there was a question of our ability to track, from a capitalization standpoint, expenditures of $10,000 or less. And we just -- honestly, we didn't consider $0.01 in the first quarter to be particularly material.
Michael F. Foust: That's really to bring ourselves in line with GAAP and what we see as the capitalization policies of most of our peers and other companies. But we're still being fairly conservative.
Arthur William Stein: Yes. I mean, the other change on operating expenses, we were -- we started to expense operating expenses, recognize expenses prior to the cessation of the capitalization of interest, which is obviously not consistent. So now the operating expenses and the capitalization of interest line up. And the split between those 2 was roughly 50-50 in terms of effect.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So Mike, in your prepared comments, I know you talked about delayed leasing commencements over the course of between now and, I think, through 2018. You don't have to go through those again, but maybe if you could break them down between stabilized assets, what's under construction and what needs to be started from a development perspective to deliver on those leases.
Michael F. Foust: Yes. Well, generally, I wasn't speaking anything beyond 2013. So I wasn't projecting out beyond this year. So I do want to make that clear. And really the timing is not around so much around construction in most markets. It's because we're continuing to deliver data center inventory where we need it, both Powered Base Building and Turn-Key, and we can build a Powered Base Building very rapidly. So it's really the timing, which I wouldn't say timing is longer, but we're still seeing pretty elongated discussions and planning with our larger customers. And that's one of the reasons why we also want to focus, in addition, on middle-market customers, where we might be able to move more rapidly and smooth out the lumpiness of our signings and commencements. And the other thing, these transactions just don't follow hard-and-fast quarter-by-quarter rules. They take the amount of time that the customer needs. So they're not really focused on quarterly completions themselves. So you'll get these different deals extending as long as we need to make sure that the customer is getting the right solution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, ISI Group.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, I just want to clarify, Bill. So it sounds like you're having better leasing signings, but the commencements are a bit delayed. So the fact that guidance went up, I just want to be clear, that's really all due to the capitalization policy change and not due to faster leasing? And then secondly, you mentioned that tenants were taking space in some of the outyears, but I was surprised that tenants were committing to space to '16, '17 and '18. And I'm just trying to understand the thought process behind, I guess, the tenant committing to space effectively 5 years out and your committing to space 5 years out.
Arthur William Stein: So the answer to the second question, Steve, is that we have a build-to-suit one deal that has some long pickups, if you will, where we're delivering space in the outyears.
Michael F. Foust: And very big.
Arthur William Stein: Yes, it's a very large deal. And answer to the first question is yes. The -- about a $0.05. There's $0.05 in the forecast that's related to the change in accounting policy. And commencements, as Mike said, have been delayed, which affects revenue recognition and acquisition. And that would drive the guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes. Just a follow-up on the offsets. Were there any other offsets to the capitalization change, policy change other than the FX?
Arthur William Stein: I mean, there are ins and outs, Jonathan, that we would expect to -- the G&A might come in a little bit lower. OpEx might come in a little bit lower. But it's no more than $0.01 or $0.02 around the edges.
Michael F. Foust: And I think looking at our overall guidance and projections, on the high end, we think we have an opportunity to achieve additional leasing, as well as additional operational efficiencies. So we're now looking entirely at capitalization policy as driving what we think could be our higher end of our range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes. Just one quick follow-up around development. The guidance is for $980 million of development deliveries. From the supplemental, you can get a sense of, you've done about 400 square feet of deliveries year-to-date. But we don't really have a dollar value behind that. Could you give us a sense of how much dollar-wise you've delivered and how much is still to go and where that additional development deliveries meant to come from the CIP [ph] pipeline?
Michael F. Foust: I don't know if we have the dollar amount available.
Arthur William Stein: We'd have to get back to you on that.
Michael F. Foust: Yes. I mean, we have how much we spent. But you can see on Page 30 of the supplemental, the construction in progress by market breaks down the relative amount of activity in the different markets.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes. But which of these pieces are delivering in 2013 as part of your overall guidance?
Michael F. Foust: I think, overall, we're delivering about a total of them of 1 million square feet, a little more than that.
Arthur William Stein: A lot of the capital deliveries is back end-weighted in the year, Tayo. That's when the project completions are.
Michael F. Foust: And when we're building out the Turn-Key components.
Operator: That does conclude the allotted time for our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.
Michael F. Foust: Thank you for your time, everyone, and your attention to the company, much appreciated. And I want to congratulate everybody here on the Digital team for a terrific effort and on continuing to deliver a high level of service for our customers and very good, consistent earnings for our shareholders. Thank you very much, everybody.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Following management's brief remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust: Great. Thank you, Pamela, and welcome to the call, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a few comments regarding the important global network connectivity initiatives we announced yesterday, and will follow up with a brief summary of our first quarter operations. After my remarks, Bill will discuss our recent capital markets activity and first quarter financial results. Following his remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. During the Q&A today, we're pleased to have with us John Sarkis, our Vice President of Network and Carrier Operations, and he's available to answer specific questions related to yesterdays Digital Realty Ecosystem announcement. As stated in that announcement, the launch of this strategic initiative takes our global portfolio to the next level in terms of providing customers with a carrier-neutral network connectivity offering. From the beginning, our strategy has been to consolidate and grow a global portfolio of enterprise-quality data centers. This included acquiring key Internet gateway network hubs, data centers that offer our customers network-intensive applications, which are ideal locations to house their mission-critical business systems. At the same time, we've grown our portfolio of corporate data centers, expanding our footprint by assembling a high concentration of properties in key markets globally. So today by leveraging our global footprint and operating platform, we plan to deploy the Digital Realty Ecosystem across our portfolio, providing a neutral, efficient and connectivity-rich environment for our customers to connect, not only to any carrier of choice, but directly to one another. Beginning with our major campus locations including New York; New Jersey; Boston; Ashburn, Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Santa Clara; as well as Metro London, we'll be running high count dark fiber between buildings, enabling us to offer customers a "plug and play" GigE product, as well as straight dark fiber cross-connects to customers carriers and service providers campus-wide. Furthermore, this ecosystem will provide an underlying infrastructure for carriers and service providers to deliver their entire portfolio of products and services to our customers without them incurring the typical capital-intensive deployment cost. We see this strategy as a critical component of our evolution that will further advance our global leadership position as the data center provider of choice for both wholesale and retail colocation customers. At the same time, it adds significant value to our portfolio, giving us a competitive advantage that is unmatched in the industry. In addition to this exciting initiative, we are very pleased with the pace of leasing activity so far this year. We achieved our highest level of first quarter lease signings, totaling over $43.7 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, which was also our third-highest quarter on record. The results this quarter, in particular, reflect the success of our Custom Solutions product strategy, enabling us to capture large requirements from cloud infrastructure providers, as well as cloud-based services. In North America, the average annual gap rental rate for leases signed in the quarter for our Turn-Key Flex pace was $141 per square foot. This compares to the 2012 average rate of $151 per square foot. Please keep in mind that the fourth quarter 2012, the average rate for leases signed was $177 square foot, which was higher than our typical average. We believe that the $141 per square foot is more in line with historical averages over the last couple of years. On a per kW per month basis, the weighted average rental rate was approximately $177 per kW. For our Custom Solutions product, the average gap rental rate was $108 per square foot, and the weighted average rate for per kilowatt per month was $137. The lease rates for Custom Solutions space reflect the build-to-suit nature of the projects, including the elimination of leasing risk and carry and oftentimes, lower development costs for us based on the customers' engineering requirements and the needs for ancillary space. The stabilized projected ROI for these leases range from 8.3% to 12%. Markets where we saw the highest global activity in the U.S. included New York, New Jersey, Greater Chicago and Northern Virginia. Recently, Digital Realty entered into an agreement with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership that will allow the company and our tenants in our data center facilities located in Loudoun County to obtain an exemption from sales and use tax on the purchase of certain data center and computer-related equipment. We believe making this favorable tax treatment available to our customers adds significant value to our digital Ashburn campus. Excluding leases that commenced in the first quarter, the additional signings bringing our total backlog to $84.2 million of annual gap rental revenue. Another record high, of which, $45.3 million is expected to commence in 2013; $21.5 million in 2014, 2015; and $17.4 million expected to commence thereafter. Please note that our backlog represents committed lease contracts that have been signed but have not yet commenced. By contrast, excluding the leases we signed during the first quarter, our leasing prospects pipeline for our new facilities ticked up slightly from our last call to about 2 million square feet of prospects. This figure represents current prospects in our sales funnel to whom we've made proposals and we believe have a 30% or greater likelihood of signing. Notably, these new requirements tend to fall on categories: The first is the large multi-megawatt requirement similar to the Custom Solution leases we signed in the first quarter. Customers that fall into this category include financial -- global financial institutions, health care, traditional Internet enterprises, social media, cloud providers and large system integrators. By contrast, the second category consists of customers of varying sizes, representing an even broader range of industry verticals. These customers are often looking to lease data center space in smaller increments, sometimes less than 1 megawatt. These are our more traditional TKF or colocation customers, are looking for move-in ready space with the flexibility to expand then within our portfolio. Offering customers a full suite of data center solutions is key to our strategy and sets us apart from all of the other data center providers in the market. In addition, our geographic footprint scale, combined with our design and construction expertise and offering platform, enables us to meet a wide range of customer requirements while achieving attractive return for our shareholders. In fact, the weighted average 1 year -- year 1 stabilized return on investments for Turn-Key leases signed during the quarter was just over 13%. In terms of overall supply and demand, there are a handful of U.S. markets that have had meaningful shifts. For example, more than 3-megawatts either way up or down, from what we provided in our Analyst Day presentation. Moving east to west, we are now tracking approximately 36.1 megawatts of potential demand in Northern Virginia, up from 32.2 megawatts. This compares to 24.5 megawatts of supply built or under construction currently. Chicago saw one of the largest increases with 34.6 megawatts of track demand, up from 18.1 megawatts previously. This compares to an increase in supply of 6.7 megawatts, resulting in a shortfall of supply approximately 18.3. Demand in Silicon Valley jumped to 25.5 megawatts from 9.4 at the end of January as did supply, resulting in a smaller surplus of supply of 4.7 megawatts. While Dallas still shows a healthy level of demand at 25.7 megawatts, it's the only U.S. market that decreased. And they decreased from 32.6 megawatts we reported last quarter. By comparison, supply in Dallas increased only slightly, resulting in a shortfall of supply of about 5.3 megawatts. However, there have been recent announcements of planned new construction for the Dallas metro. Turning to our lease renewals during the quarter. Including re-leased space, we signed approximately 233,000 square feet of data center space at overall renewal rates that increased 0.8% in a GAAP basis, and decreased 18.2% on a first year cash basis. This decrease was solely due to 2 leases that we renewed with a particular top 5 customer in a New Jersey property. They were signed at the top of the market in 2008, and the renewals were subject to very aggressive pricing by 2 competitors in the New Jersey market. It is important to emphasize that these leases represent only 0.6% of our total annual revenue and do not reflect mark-to-market for the balance of our portfolio. From a strategic perspective, by renewing these leases, we were able to expand the customer into additional data center space in the same building, actually resulting in a net increase of $2.7 million of annualized gap rental revenue for the property. That said, our portfolio's geographic diversity limits our overall exposure to these markets versus other data center landlords who are concentrated in Northern Virginia, New Jersey and Silicon Valley exclusively. For example, excluding the 2 leases we just noted, rates on renewals were actually up across all product types, including TKF, which was up 18.3% on a cash basis and up 22.7% on a GAAP basis. Powered Base Building was up 0.2% just slightly in the cash basis and up fully 24.5% on a GAAP basis. Colocation, up 14.5% in a cash basis and 14% in GAAP basis. And for nontax space, up 2.3% on a cash basis and 5.6% on a GAAP basis. As further evidence of the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, including space that re-leased in the quarter, the combined average retention rate for data center space in the quarter was over 97%. On a square foot basis, over 93% of Turn-Key Flex space representing 97% of gap rent, renewed in an average term of nearly 107 months. We also renewed, re-leased 100% of expiring PBB space, reflecting 124.5% of gap rent, with an average lease term of over 147 months. The healthy length of renewals, along with the annual 2.5% to 3% contractual increases, allows us to recapture any decline in cash rents after year 2 or 3 on the new term on average with continuously growing cash flow thereafter. Looking at our projected renewal activity for the balance of 2013 and for the full years 2014, 2015, we project rent spreads for data center space to be relatively flat on a cash basis and up approximately 20% on a GAAP basis. Occupancy was 94% in the first quarter, down slightly from 94.4% the previous quarter, primarily due to the expiration of non-data center lease, office lease in a tech building in Fremont, California. We're currently marketing space to office users and will consider selling the property once it's been stabilized. This decrease was partially offset by the commencement of new leases, totaling 27,000 square feet on our existing data center inventory; the commencement of leases from our development program, totaling nearly 94,000 square feet and the acquisition of 4 100% leased buildings. Same-store occupancy also decreased for the fourth quarter slightly, 93.7% to 93.1%, due to the same non-data center office lease expiration. Turning now to our acquisitions program. We began the year with a healthy level of activity that included 2 properties, totaling 4 buildings that were 100% leased, one of which was the sale-leaseback with a major airline in the Minneapolis metro. The blended going-in, unlevered cash cap rate for the first quarter stabilized acquisitions was over 11%. In addition, we acquired another development project adjacent to our Chandler, Arizona property for running future inventory in this growing data center market, as well as a development project in suburban Toronto, Canada where we're seeing significant demand from new and existing customers for data center space. Our current pipeline and prospects for acquisition totals nearly $1 billion including high-quality stabilized property, value-add opportunities, ground up development sites, as well as sale-leaseback transactions. This does exclude larger portfolios that we continue to track. Finally, I will briefly review our development program. We continue to ramp up construction to add supply in select markets to meet current demand. Current development activity includes nearly 549,000 square feet of Turn-Key Flex space that is 14.3% pre-leased, over 200 -- over 276,000 square feet of Custom Solutions space that is 100% pre-leased, and approximately 564,000 square feet of Powered Base Buildings for future inventory in key markets. Detailed information in our development activity by market can be found on Page 29 of our first quarter supplemental package. We are very pleased with the strong start to 2013 and are equally excited about the new initiatives we are working on and we believe will further enhance the value of our global portfolio. These initiatives, combined with our commitment to delivering a wide range of superior data center solutions for our customers, will continue to drive earnings growth. I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill.
Arthur William Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with reviewing our capital markets activity, and then discuss our first quarter 2013 financial performance and guidance. Year-to-date, we have sourced nearly $885 million of new capital, including the GBP 400 million 12-year unsecured note bond offering with 4.25% coupon, which was equivalent to USD 634.9 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance, and the 5.875% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock offering in April, which generated gross proceeds of $250 million. Our funding strategy includes issuing debt in local currencies to provide a natural hedge, mitigating our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our growing international operations. Local debt, as a percentage of regional in-country assets, range from 50% to 96% depending upon the country. In reviewing our balance sheet, total assets grew to $9 billion in the first quarter compared to $8.8 billion last quarter, which is consistent with the continued growth and scale of our business. Deferred rent increased by $19.1 million to $340.8 million this quarter, compared to $321.7 million last quarter due to incremental new leases. Deferred rent as a percentage of rental revenue at 7.5%, remains consistent with our historical average. Total debt increased to $4.7 billion at the first quarter 2013 compared to $4.3 billion last quarter. We currently have $1.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $84.5 million in short-term investments plus funds that can be drawn on our credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, we would remain in full compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility, our term loan, our Prudential Shelf Facility and other unsecured debt. In 2013, we had $219 million of remaining principal amortization and debt maturities with a weighted average cost of 6%, which we plan to retire initially with the revolver and eventually refinance with additional long-term unsecured debt, secured debt or preferred stock. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.5x at quarter end, up from 5.2x at the end of the fourth quarter last year. This increase is due to additional borrowings to fund the development and acquisitions program. Pro forma for the recently issued preferred equity, net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 5.2x. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio decreased to 3.5x at the end of the first quarter compared to 3.8 in the previous quarter. Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, first quarter 2013 FFO was $1.16 per share in line with fourth quarter 2000 FFO of $1.16, and up 9.4% from first quarter 2012 FFO of $1.06 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams, first quarter 2013 core FFO was $1.18 per share, $2.9 million higher than reported FFO. These adjustments largely resulted from transaction expenses and fair value adjustments related to the central earnout. As I noted on our last call, a fair value assessment on the 3-year Sentrum earnout obligation is required in each reporting period and is likely to result in some quarterly earnings fluctuation. Changes in fair value are considered noncore adjustments. Quarter-over-quarter, core FFO decreased slightly from $1.19 per share in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher interest expense, as well as G&A and tax expenses, which were offset by higher NOI in the first quarter and was up 11.3% from first quarter 2012 core FFO of $1.06 per share. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the first quarter of 2013 was $123.6 million, up $115.8 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter of 2013 was 84.1%, up from 82.6% in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at quarter end of $212.6 million grew by 4.2% from $204 million last quarter and was up by 23.6% from $172 million in the first quarter of 2012. Turning now to the income statement. Net operating income increased by $7.7 million or 3.5% to $227.3 million in the first quarter of 2013 and from $219.6 million last quarter. The increase was due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions, as well as approximately $900,000 in insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Sandy. These are partially offset by an increase in property taxes and the present value accretion adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout as previously mentioned. Property, taxes increased by $1.3 million to $21 million in the first quarter 2013 from $19.7 million last quarter due to tax assessments at 2 properties, a portion of which was recoverable from tenants. NOI margins, excluding utility reimbursements, increased by 60 basis points and remained consistent with historical levels. Likewise, first quarter same-store NOI increased by $9.3 million to $195.4 million, compared to $186.1 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and adjusted for noncash purchase accounting adjustments, was $174.7 million in the first quarter up 5.6% from $165.4 million last quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was largely due to an incremental revenue from new leasing and the insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Sandy previously mentioned. G&A increased to $16 million in the first quarter compared to $13.4 million in the last quarter, primarily due to certain 2012 year-end accrual adjustments amounting to $1.9 million, which reduced G&A in the fourth quarter. Interest expense increased by $7.7 million to $48.1 million in the quarter from $40.4 million last quarter primarily due to the sterling bond issuance and lower capitalized interest in the quarter. Tax expense increased to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $10,000 last quarter, primarily due to noncash deferred taxes based on booked-to-tax differences from foreign operations. While we do not give quarterly guidance, I would like to bring your attention to a few items that we anticipate will impact next quarter's results. First, our Series G Preferred Offering which closed in early April, will result in approximately $3.4 million of incremental preferred stock dividends in the second quarter, which will be partially offset by interest expense savings of $830,000 from repayment of revolver borrowings. Second, we expect NOI growth to be partially offset by $800,000 each quarter through the rest of the year due to the non-data center lease expiration at the Fremont, California tech office property, which Mike referenced in his remarks. And third, while we are not revising 2013 guidance at this time, we are closely monitoring foreign exchange rates and plan to revisit their impact on our 2013 guidance at the end of next quarter. Finally, in reviewing consensus estimates, there are a few items that do not appear to be reflected in some of the 2013 models. The first item relates to $3.4 million increase in capitalized interest in the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third quarter that was due to the inclusion of additional qualifying activity. We expect capitalized interest to normalize at approximately $5 million per quarter. Also as a reminder, we manage to a 5.5x debt to adjusted EBITDA. As I discussed at our Analyst Day event in January, our 2013 guidance assumptions include $900 million to $1 billion of bond issuance, $300 million to $400 million of preferred or common, as well as a small increase in the balance of the revolver. As I mentioned in my opening remarks today, we've issued $635 million of bonds and $250 million of preferred stock. We expect to access both the debt and equity markets later this year to raise the balance of capital required to meet our 2013 funding requirements. Subject to market conditions, we may choose to issue additional common or preferred equity or unsecured debt to further enhance our financial flexibility. These assumptions would exclude additional capital associated with any significant portfolio acquisition, which is not included in our guidance. This includes -- this concludes our formal remarks. Mike and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: My question centers around the network connectivity focus here and how that might influence your approach to M&A going forward and whether it -- maybe it changes the likelihood that you will look to purchase a wholesale-oriented asset. As well, I would be interested in seeing if you could ballpark the revenue uplift that you might see longer term just within your existing properties and existing base of tenant leases from customers that used to cross connect with each other and presumably that becomes a revenue event for you?
Michael F. Foust: Sure, yes. We think this is going to be, really, a big benefit to our customers who are either requiring network access, customers who are carriers themselves who are ISPs, customers who are providing peering and cross connecting as we'll be able to pull more customers to them, as well as leasing more in our properties. In terms of revenue, we think that there's going to be, certainly, a material uplift, especially after we get all the infrastructure in place next year, by the end of this year and will realize in the end of the year in 2014. We haven't fully defined our product set at this point. A lot of the financial benefit will be from making our buildings much -- even more attractive to a wide range of customers, including cloud providers, infrastructure, ISPs and carriers. So it will help to ramp up our leasing activity. And we expect to be able to rent more space in our network pops, in our spaces, in our buildings. John Sarkis, I'd like John to comment on kind of the overall program and the benefits.
John Sarkis: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Yes, I guess in looking at the size of our portfolio, we have very large amount of buildings, and there's attractiveness on the wholesale and the retail side. By putting an ecosystem in place, all our buildings can accommodate both ends of the spectrum for our offering. So any new buildings that come online will automatically fall right into the ecosystem and operate seamlessly across the entire portfolio.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And in terms of CapEx or OpEx implications, just because you talked about connecting building and cities together and so forth, can you maybe discuss that a little bit?
Michael F. Foust: Yes. I mean, the operating expense will be pretty low and on the increment, because it's spread across almost our entire, portfolio. We'll probably be -- on the capital side, we'll probably be investing somewhere around, oh, probably no more than $25 million over the next 9 months or so. But then that's -- once again, that's spread out over a very large number of buildings.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I wanted to -- my follow-up there to the connectivity initiative surrounds sort of the competition with some of your existing customers. And to the extent that you're, I guess, engaging their customers and their product offerings to or -- offering similar products to a greater extent. Is that sort of the nature of the business, this sort of virtual -- vertical integration that you're seeing? And now that you're doing it basically across your sort of core cities, that you just -- the overlap is just to an increasing extent?
Michael F. Foust: Well, it's really for us to be able to put in the infrastructure so our current customers and new customers can more readily offer their services across our portfolio and be able to connect, have the infrastructure and to connect everyone. We're not going into the carrier business at all. And John, I'll let John comment a little more on that.
John Sarkis: Yes, we are not, and I like to overemphasize the word, not becoming a network provider. What we're doing is we're making it easier for carriers and service providers to deliver their services to our customers across our entire portfolio. And that is what our customers have been asking and looking for. And our carrier partners, as well as our data center industry partners there are looking for ease to navigate through our entire portfolio. And this ecosystem will provide them with the seamless cost efficient and secure environment that they look for.
Michael F. Foust: In other words, you can get to from, hopefully, any building in our portfolio to virtually any carrier, any Meet Me Room, any cross-connect peering platforms, any cloud infrastructure provider. And in that way, should be driving more business for everyone who resides or has facilities in a Digital Realty portfolio property.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: I just had a question on your international portfolio. It looks like in early March, you made an investment in Mexico but I didn't see anything mentioned in the release or in your prepared remarks. Just wondering what that was and kind of what your plan is for that market?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. We think there's opportunities for us in several locations in Mexico. The investment that we're making, it haven't fully closed yet, is a very small minority investment, about 8.5%, in one of our customers in Mexico City who's a metro fiber provider. And we've done work for them on data center design and project management. And what this will let us do, making a small investment, but gives us the ability to have a good lens into the growth and evolution of the Mexico market in Mexico City. Guadalajara, Monterrey, so we can have a good idea, kind of a front-row seat, if you will, on how that market is growing and where demand is for our wholesale products. So that's kind of the genesis of that initiative.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just going back to the capital side of things. The maintenance or recurring CapEx trended a bit lower. Could you just walk us through what exactly drove the decline and perhaps what should we should model going forward?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, and that's probably really kind of reflects first quarter seasonality, if you will, on deploying capital. And I think we'll generally be in line with our projections over the course of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: You did another sale-leaseback this quarter. Can you talk about the demand is for these transactions and what your pipeline looks like given the likely changes to lease accounting making these type of deals less advantageous for the lessee?
Michael F. Foust: We've had good activity. We did the Bouygues Telecommunications wireless company in -- outside of Paris and that was in December. This is the second sale-leaseback that we've done with Delta Air Lines. We're talking with other corporations as well who are interested in freeing up capital from the balance sheet so we're actually -- both in Europe and in the U.S. So it's hard to predict how many of these sorts of deals we'll be doing this year or next year, but we've certainly seen increased interest from corporate owners. That's for certain.
Arthur William Stein: Rob, it's not accounting driven at this point. It's cost to capital driven. Lessees just seize an opportunity to either obtain capital less expensively from us than from their banks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Rand with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So I have a couple on lease expirations. So first, just as a quick clarification. For your Turn-Key and Powered Base building lease expiration schedule, it looks like you added a month-to-month category this quarter, and it looks like some of the leases that went into that bucket were actually previously in the thereafter category as opposed to in 2013. Am I reading that right?
Michael F. Foust: I'm not sure. I don't have the detail.
Arthur William Stein: I don't think so. I think the month-to-month though is really more focused on the colo.
Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Well, because it was actually a pretty big step up in Turn-Key and Powered Base. And if you look at the number of leases in thereafter category, they went down. So I'm just trying to get a feel for if you were consolidating leases or reclassing them or something.
Michael F. Foust: No.
Arthur William Stein: No. We'll get back to you with the details, but that wasn't the case.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a question on -- going back to volumes, understanding that was a very strong quarter for you guys driven by Custom Solutions. But just wondering what you're seeing on the TKF front. That seemed like it was, maybe, a little bit lighter than it's been on a historical basis in terms of first quarters. And just maybe some color on why Custom Solutions demand seems to be a little bit stronger right now.
Michael F. Foust: Well, I think we've been seeing, certainly over the last 3 quarters, more interest, I think. As we came out of the recession and demand started to build in the second half of 2012, we're seeing companies looking at some large requirements out there that tend to be more of a build-to-suit nature and more of a custom-design nature. I think that the relative breakout this quarter between Turn-Key Flex and Custom Solution wasn't unusually large. I mean, we're dealing with a very small data set. So I think over the course of the year, it's going to even out more, where we'll be leasing more -- relatively more Turn-Key Flex space as we get further into the year. But certainly, the Custom Solutions is -- because we have the ability, the design, the project management, the engineering expertise, really gives us the ability to address a big part in the market that a lot of folks don't have ready access to with whom we compete.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: It only has 11 parts. No, seriously, I'd like to ask another question in terms of the interconnect product. For a long time, you guys have run Internet gateways and you've had your colocation products, so you could do some interconnect there. And the ability to tie together your data centers has always been there through the use of the carriers or the fiber backbones that set led into your centers. What's evolved from a demand perspective today that kind of brings a call to action for this? Is it the need to move workloads in and out of, say cloud environments? or is it the desire to extend the Internet gateways to the other data centers. I'm just trying to understand why now is the right time for the investment?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. And I'll let John jump in on this. In terms of timing, we probably should've done it 2 years ago in anticipation of this growth -- great growth in cloud. And -- but we think that we have an opportunity now. We're not late, but -- and as we're seeing more and more with new data centers coming online, our customers want the ability to have a ready solution from a range of carriers and ISPs and cloud infrastructure providers. And we want to be able to present that to customers, either existing customers as well as new customers coming into new buildings. And we want have that package of services in a very organized, well-defined manner. And I'll let John embellish on those odds.
John Sarkis: And that was a very good question. As you can see the evolution of the business and the market, bandwidth has created a dependency on the data center provider. It's become a much more critical component than just space and power. By providing our customers the ability to access their networks and the size of the bandwidth that they require is what the driving component here to get this rolled out as quickly as possible, though we've seen a lot of questions come in about very large bandwidth demands and structured deployment in a customized solution across our data center portfolio where we have one location would act as more as a production environment, whereas some of our other locations would act as a disaster recovery component or less critical equipment. But the two need to be tied together. So by providing this ecosystem, we will now be able to do that for our customers in a one-stop-shop format.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with the ISI Group.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Bill, just a question on the balance sheet. You mentioned that the leverage is creeping up and, I guess, will creep up a bit more through the year, and you are putting more debt on the line of credit than you have in the past. I guess, why the change in the balance sheet strategy over the last 6 or 9 months? And I guess what level from a net debt to EBITDA or fixed charge coverage and also floating rate debt exposure are you comfortable with?
Arthur William Stein: Hey, George, I don't know that there's been a change per se other than we went to the rating agencies in the fall, and we talked to them about running the company at 5.5x versus 5x, and they were comfortable with that. And we think given the scale of the company's operations and the diversification across various verticals and tenants around the world that, that was totally appropriate. Frankly, if you look at -- where most REITs, BBB-rated REITs, run their leverage they, I think, 6 is probably more typical than 5.5. So 5.5 is still on the conservative side. We ended up at end of the quarter 5.5 but, as I said in my remarks, we very consciously did a preferred, we weren't sure whether we're going to do it at the end of the quarter or at the beginning of the second quarter, and that took the leverage back to where it was at the end of the year which was 5.2x. And because we are managed to 5.5, that doesn't mean that we won't go over occasionally. But we're targeting a 5.5x debt to EBITDA, and we think -- oh, and your question 2 is, I guess, fixed charge coverage. And our target there is to stay in the high 2s or above. And so the fixed charge did go down in the first quarter and that was primarily due to the sterling bond offering that was done in January, which had a 4 1/4% coupon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Hilmoe with UBS.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about the occupancy drop, that 1 11 8. And Mike, you may have mentioned this in your remarks and I missed it. But what do you think the mark to market is on rents for the portfolio today?
Michael F. Foust: 1 11 8, we really didn't have much of a drop. We had one customer who moved into one of our other buildings. And then we're re-leasing that. I think we've already re-leased that space. So...
Arthur William Stein: It will commence second quarter.
Michael F. Foust: Commencing second quarter, this quarter. So yes, you just caught that building kind of in between re-leasing. So that space at 1 11 8, it's actually 100% occupied now. And in terms of mark to market, we talked about how we're seeing renewals over the next couple of years being flat on a cash basis, a very high rate. So historically high rates based on the cash uplift that we've been enjoying in the leases on average. So we think that mark to market on a GAAP basis is probably -- and this is really just a projection on my part, you're talking 5% to 10% probably, or maybe at least I would think in that case, on a GAAP basis, maybe even slightly more.
Arthur William Stein: Depends on the product class, too. PBB will have a much higher uplift than Turn-Key.
Michael F. Foust: Right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisers.
John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Bill, could you please shed a little bit of light on the Sentrum earn-out, maybe specifically how it's performing relative to pro forma and kind of help us tie that back to the earnings noise? And then, Mike, came across a story recently indicating that you guys were prepared to make your initial foray into mainland China next year, I guess, with sites selected in Shanghai and Beijing. Can you kind of talk about, first of all, how accurate that might be, and the underwriting process, and then the type of returns that you would target in mainland China?
Arthur William Stein: So Mike, relative to the earnout. The earnout is a function of both the rents achieved, the absolute rent level runs, the timing for those rents and the capital deployed to achieve those rents. So that's what goes into the formula to determine the -- whether or not it's a plus or minus. Last quarter, it was a plus. In this quarter, it's a minus. But most of the changes here are going to be accretive. But we don't consider that core. I mean, it's just -- again, it's noise and we have another 2 years and a quarter left of that. And the amount of the adjustment will -- because it's a present value calculation, the amount of the adjustment declines with the passage of time as well. So there will be less as we get closer to the end of the earnout period.
Michael F. Foust: And in terms of our China initiative, we are speaking with -- as we have been over the last couple of years, and meeting with different service providers, both managed services, network providers, cloud providers with whom we might be able to strike up a partnership. So at this point, we're still on an early, relatively early stages of the discussion, but we have targeted a couple of prospects, potentially would be good partners with us in a JV. We feel very strongly in China that to be successful, we want to be partnered with folks that are providing data center services in the marketplace and have the proper licenses for power and fiber, which is so important. So it's still relatively early days but we're definitely interested in that market. I mean, it's many markets obviously in China and probably the 3 most likely forays would be Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. But we're not at a point where we have site selection or agreements drafted or anything like that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Michael F. Foust: We lose connection.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, Michael Bilerman speaking. Mike, just as you think about this interconnectivity that you're building out, just given the fact that data center rents and Powered Base building rents are different across the U.S. and internationally, I guess do you anticipate a potential shift of tenants that want access to digital and the benefits that you'll have from the interconnect shifting to lower cost locations? And how you think that sort of evolved, understanding that there is a benefit to going into it, but do you think that there may be a shift in demand going to lower cost locations. That's number one. Number two, just for Bill, as you talked about how doing local denominated debt in different geographies sort of reduces your FX exposure. And I'm just curious as you think longer term, you look at your sort of largest global REIT peer, Prologis, they want to be 80% to 100% U.S. exposed but have a 60% global x U.S. portfolio. So I'm just curious how -- do you eventually want to move to that as well as, being 100% U.S. exposed with a large global exposure?
Arthur William Stein: Well, I'm not exactly sure what your question there is, Michael. I will tell you that our philosophy is to, to the extent we can, we'll put more debt against the foreign assets to provide maximum natural hedge. So -- and right now our largest market exposure is the U.K.. We're a little over 50% there. Most of the Asian countries are in the 90s right now in terms of debt as a -- local debt as a percentage of the net asset in that region. So it sounds like we might have a different philosophy than Prologis, if I understand your question correctly.
Michael F. Foust: And let me go ahead and answer Michael's part of first question regarding kind of locational decisions. I don't think we're going to see a significant shift, and I'll let John jump in on this, but we're seeing across our major markets, folks who need to be in London and New Jersey and Virginia still want to be there. And there's folks who want to be in central time zone or in lower cost environments and are looking at Dallas and Austin and Houston. And there's folks who need to be in Silicon Valley. So I don't think we're going to see a shift away from a particular market. I think we're going to see more opportunities for our portfolio broadly. John, what do you see there?
John Sarkis: Yes, I just like to add one thing to those comments. In when looking at a market, you have a different buildings that are gateway buildings and non-gateway buildings. We will be re-leasing the ecosystem to level the value of our portfolio buildings across the entire platform, making some of our properties much more valuable than they are outside the ecosystem. So if you're looking at a market where there are the 3 major gateway buildings and then we have a number of other buildings outside the gateway, those buildings become that much more desirable and offer the, what I mentioned earlier, the customized solution of splitting a footprint across the region and our building. I hope that answers the question.
Michael F. Foust: So a lot of it is diversification within a region or across major markets, but not necessarily going to tertiary areas, or at least based on the customer base that we're seeing growing quickly for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Rand with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I appreciate the color in your prepared remarks on the cash spreads on the leases signed during the quarter, but I'll confess when I saw the supplement this morning, I was a little surprised to see that -- the big negative number on Turn-Key. What it seems like, from your remarks and from everything we're hearing in the market is that, there is increasing divergence between different markets between different density levels between all sorts of things. And there's kind of 2 key pieces of information that we don't know about your portfolio. One is kind of where the expirations are over the next couple of years. And the other is what the kilowatts or kilowatt levels are across the portfolio as opposed to square footage, which really actually drives your leasing. Can you provide some color for all of us on the call so that we sort of have a little better sense of how the next couple of years might unfold in terms of lease roll?
Michael F. Foust: Well, I mean we've got a lot of information in supplementals about the rolls. I mean, it's spread out across a lot of different markets. So it's hard to make a broad characterization other than, on average, we think we're in a good position broadly on the renewals and folks want and need to stay in our buildings. So it's difficult in this call to draw broad conclusions because we are in so many different markets, and as you know, we have different product types. Bill, I...
Arthur William Stein: Yes, I mean, I think in terms of broad brush, it's safe to assume that the Powered Base, as I said earlier, is going to have a pretty substantial uplift as they renew. And there's several factors that are driving that. It's not just where the rents were struck and the timing for the initial rents, but typically that was 10 -- those are 10- to 15-year initial deals, so they were some time ago. It's also because the tenants have invested significant capital in that space and have a -- and they tend to be quite sticky as a result of that. The Turn-Key rents started out at a much higher level. If it once again -- I mean, the tenants although they didn't invest in the data center infrastructure the way the Powered Base customers do, they still have significant investment in their space. And we covered this on our analyst day, relocation costs are significant even for our Turn-Key customer. And for that reason, we think it's with certain exceptions. We had one of those exceptions this quarter for a major customer that was under attack in a market where there's been some weakness. On a percentage basis, it was small overall. But with certain exceptions, we would expect that the cash rents on Turn-Key would be roughly flat on a mark-to-market basis across the portfolio regardless of region.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess that explanation from Matt was helpful. Just a couple of things, though. Just in regards to the renewals in the New Jersey market and the much lower rent that those were signed for to keep those tenants. Can you just talk a little bit about overall competition in Jersey and what you're seeing?
Michael F. Foust: Yes. New Jersey, it's definitely good market because you've got the financial services and many large corporations in the region. The challenge is there's a couple or 3 competitors who are very aggressive on pricing and have had challenges getting traction with their developments and thus are being aggressive in that market. So I think that's probably the market where we're seeing a little more downward push on rents, but I don't think rents are going down further. I think they stabilized probably last quarter. But there is, in that particular market, probably a couple of folks who are trying to grab market share and trying to get absorption, and they've had some challenges.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Michael F. Foust: Great. Well, thank you very much, and then thanks, everyone, for your time and good comments and questions today. And thank you to the Digital team. It's another quarter well done, and we're really excited about our Digital Realty Ecosystem. I think it's going to make -- bring a lot of value for our customers and for new customers. Thanks very much.
Operator: This concludes today's interactive broadcast. You may now disconnect.

Following management’s remarks, we will open the call to your questions, which will be limited to one per caller and following your question the operator will be putting the line on mute in order to manage it in an orderly fashion. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Foust: Great. Thank you, Pamela, and welcome to the call everyone. I would first like to thank everyone who participated in our Analyst Day two weeks ago. We greatly appreciate your interest and all the positive feedback we received since that event. I’ll begin today’s call with a few comments on our sector, a brief summary on our 2012 operations, as well as our progress to-date in 2013. After my remarks, Bill will discuss our fourth quarter, as well as our first year 2012 financial results, and we will address some of the questions we’ve received since Investor Day with respect to our 2013 guidance. Following his remarks we will open the call to your questions. Much has changed in our sector since Digital became the first datacenter REIT in 2004. Today there are four datacenter REITs with different backgrounds, management teams, design philosophies, growth strategies and claims of competitive advantages. It is clearly an exciting sector with attractive growth prospects, but also one that requires a high level expertise around operations, innovative engineering, design and construction, finance, as well as acquisitions and investment management. Digital Realty is well-positioned with deep professional resources in all of these areas. As we indicated in our -- at our event last month we finished 2012 with a solid performance and we are very encouraged by the level of activity going into 2013. Types in the year include, first, an exceptional 22% growth in adjusted EBITDA over fiscal year 2011. Secondly, strong and consistent EBITDA margins of approximately 70% adjusted for transaction expenses and utility reimbursements. Furthermore, we have record high leasing commencements of $135 million of annualized GAAP revenue and acquisitions of US$1.6 billion. In addition, we have record first quarter leases signed to date in Q1 2013 representing $31.4 million of annual GAAP rent revenues. Let me turn first to our leasing activity, the record level of commencements in the fourth quarter of 2012 drove our strongest annual performance to date totaling $135 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue, up 36% from 2011. Since Analyst Day I’m pleased to report that we’ve signed additional leases totaling $13.4 million, bringing total lease signings for the first quarter to date to $31.4 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. This compares favorably to nearly $18 million of lease signings for the entire first quarter of 2012 and nearly $19 million for the first quarter of 2011. In fact, we are on track to exceed 2012’s highest quarter for lease signings of $32.2 million. The additional signings increased our backlog to $99.5 million of annualized GAAP rent, of which $61.6 million is expected to commence in 2013, $20.4 million expected to commence in 2014 and 2015 timeframe, $17.5 million expected to commence between 2016 and 2018. We are very encouraged by our progress so early in the year. Enterprise customers appear to be moving ahead with their new datacenter requirements as our cloud and managed services providers. Furthermore, we are seeing this activity across our portfolio including Phoenix, New Jersey, Aspen, Virginia, London and Sydney from industry verticals including financial services, social media, Internet enterprises and managed hosting cloud providers. We continue to track approximately 1.9 million square feet of demand for new facilities. This consistent demand represents prospects in our sales funnel to which we’ve made proposals that we believe have a 30% or greater likelihood of signing. For detailed supply and demand information on our major investment market, please see the appendix section of our Analyst Day presentation, which is posted on our website. Turning now to our 2012 lease renewal activity, during the year we signed approximately 621,000 square feet of Turn-Key Flex in Powered Based Buildings space at renewal rates that increased 9.3% on a GAAP basis and decreased slightly 3.7% on a first year GAAP basis. This includes over 212,000 square feet of Turn-Key space and an average GAAP rental rate of $165 per square foot, up 5.2% on a GAAP basis and down 6.4% on a cash basis in the quarter. In addition, we renewed a large amount of Powered Based Buildings space over 408,000 feet, that’s up 20.3% on a GAAP basis and up 3.4% on a first year cash basis. The combined average retention rate for datacenter space for the year was over 84%. On a square foot basis 74% of Turn-Key space or 82% of GAAP rent renewed on an average term of nearly 90 months. We also renews 90% of expiring Powered Based Building, quietly 106% of GAAP rent and an average lease term of over 105 months. The healthy length of renewals along with the annual 2.5% to 3% contractual increases allows us to recapture any declines in cash rents after year three of the new lease term on average with continuously growing cash flow thereafter. Last month we presented estimated mark-to-market annual GAAP rental rate increases on datacenter renewals and re-leasing of increased considerably 5% to 10% expected for 2013 to 2015. On a cash basis over that same period, we are projecting the first year cash rental renewals to decrease slightly by 3% from relatively high expiring rents. As further evidence of the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, occupancy increased in the second quarter in a row to $94.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to 92 -- [94.2%] in the third quarter. The increase was driven by the addition of over 165,000 square feet of space that was leased from our existing operating portfolio. Secondly, the acquisition of two 100% occupied properties and commencement leases totaling nearly 187,000 square feet from our development program. These additions were partially offset by new available datacenter space converted from our development program and lease expirations noted above. Turning now to our acquisitions program, we completed over $1.6 billion of strategic acquisitions in 2012 another record high for the company. Our acquisition programs remains very important component of our growth strategy and accounted for approximately 57% of our NOI growth in 2012. Included in that figure are the Bouygues Telecom sale leaseback properties located outside of Paris, therefore we acquired in the fourth quarter for US$79 million. Bouygues Telecom is a BBB+ rated wireless telecom provider in France and the three properties are mission critical to their operations. We expect to see more sale leaseback opportunities in 2013 reflecting part of the growing outsourcing trend. The blended going in unlevered cash cap rate for the fourth quarter acquisitions consisting of the Bouygues Telecom sale leaseback properties and the single-tenant Sydney property, this unlevered cash cap rate was slightly over 9%. So far in 2013 we have completed two acquisitions totaling $32.5 million. The first property is an operating datacenter totaling 61,750 square feet located in Dallas, Texas area, approximately 3.5 miles from our Digital datacenter campus in Richardson. The single tenant facility is leased on a long-term basis to a leading provider of business, information technology and communication solutions. The second property is located in Phoenix, Arizona and consists of -- actually in the Chandler market and consists of three buildings totaling approximately 227,000 square feet. The first building, which totals above 109,000 square feet will be added to Digital Realty’s inventory of space held for development and is capable of supporting initially 7.2 megawatts of IT capacity. So our current tenant occupies the remaining two office buildings on a short-term basis offsetting the near-term carrying cost for the property. Significant additional datacenter development is possible on this property and the site provides added future inventory to the Phoenix market where we’ve experienced significant absorption at our existing facilities, along with continued strong demand from enterprise customers in particular. We remain committed to maintaining our dominant position as the market consolidator. We have an extensive pipeline of prospects for acquisition totaling almost $1 billion. These prospects include high quality stabilized properties, value add opportunities, ground up development sites, as well as sale leaseback transactions. Finally, I will briefly review our development program. In addition to inventory through our acquisitions, we continue to ramp up construction to add [Flex] markets to meet current demand. Current development activity includes nearly 460,000 square feet of Turn-Key Flex space that is 21% pre-leased, over a 153,000 square feet of custom solution space that is 100% pre-leased and approximately 760,000 square feet of Powered Base Buildings space for future inventory in key markets. Detailed information on our development activity by market can be found on page 29 of our fourth quarter supplemental package. As stated in our 2013 guidance, we plan to invest somewhere between $850 million and $950 million in new construction this year, the largest amount in our history. We believe that our scale and improving development program combined with our disciplined investment management approach and our superior balance sheet allow us to better manage market risk by diversifying our capital deployment across geographies and product types, while achieving unmatched returns on invested capital. We have a great deal to be optimistic about in 2013. In addition to our outstanding team of dedicate real estate financial and technical professionals, we’ve added significant new talent in key positions within the organization. Because of our global platform, financial resources and dominant position in industry that has tremendous growth prospects we are fortunate -- we are in a very fortunate position to continue to track and retain professionals that we consider among the best in the business. We believe that our commitment to excellence and innovation, delivering superior datacenter solutions to our customers will continue to drive solid earnings growth for our shareholders. I’d now like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I will keep my remarks brief and focus primarily on fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and elaborate on 2013 guidance. As Mike indicated in his comments, 2012 was another year of exceptional performance for Digital. As a result on Tuesday our Board approved a quarterly common stock dividend increase of 6.8% or $0.05 a share to $0.78 per share. This is our 11th dividend increase in a little over eight years since our 2004 IPO and reflects the quality of our earnings and optimism for continued growth. Since our first full quarter of operations in 2005, we have grown our dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of over 15%. In 2012, we raised over $2.4 billion of new capital. Our balance sheet strength combined with our excellent lender and investor relationships continued to provide access to multiple capital sources globally to fund the growth of our company. For example, last month we were the first U.S. REIT to access the sterling bond market with a 400 million sterling 12-year unsecured note offering at a coupon of 4.25%. Proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under the global revolving credit facility drawn to fund the Sentrum acquisition and to further hedge our FX exposure to foreign markets. This transaction is consistent with our strategy of minimizing our financial risk by lengthening our maturities at attractive rates. Currently, we have $1.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $48.5 million in short-term investments plus funds that can be drawn on our credit facility. If this capacity we’re fully utilized we would remain in compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility, term loan, prudential shelf facility and other unsecured debt. In 2013, we have $228 million remaining principal amortization and debt maturities with a weighted average cost of 6%. We plan to retire initially with the revolver and eventually replace with additional long-term unsecured debt and/or preferred stock. For the full year 2012, we sold approximately 957,000 shares of common stock through our at-the-Market equity distribution program for net proceeds totaling $62.7 million at an average price of $66.19 per share and currently have approximately $54 million of availability remaining on the ATM program. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today’s earnings release, the fourth quarter FFO per share was $1.16. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, fourth quarter 2012 core FFO was $4.1 million higher than reported FFO or a $1.19 per share. This reflects a 15.5% increase from the fourth quarter 2011 core FFO of a $1.03 per share. The non-core expenses of transaction expenses are largely due to our recent acquisitions in Paris and Sydney. These expenses were partially offset by a change in fair value of contingent consideration related to the Sentrum portfolio that was recorded as a reduction to rental property operating expenses, accounts payable and other liabilities. A fair value assessment on the three-year Sentrum earnout obligation is required for each reporting period. Changes in fair value are considered non-core adjustments. For the full year 2012, FFO per share was $4.44, up over 9% from 2011 FFO per share of $4.06. When adjusting for non-core items, 2012 core FFO per share was $4.46, up 9% from 2011 core FFO per share of $4.09. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the fourth quarter of 2012, was $115.8 million, up from $115.6 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 82.6%, unchanged from last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, at quarter-end of $204 million grew by 25% from $163.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and by 2% from $205.5 million last quarter, excluding transaction cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 27.5% and 4.1% respectively. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.2 times at quarter-end, up from five times last quarter, which is mostly due to higher transaction cost in the period, as well as a higher drawn balance on our global revolving credit facility at year end. The ratio is within our new guideline of maintaining debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times up from five times. This increase in debt capacity is in line with our BBB, Baa2 investment grade ratings and was discussed with the rating agencies at our recent annual meetings. The higher balance decreased our weighted average cost of debt to 4.25% at quarter-end from 4.35% last quarter. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was 3.8 times compared to the previous quarter of 3.7 times. For the full year adjusted EBITDA was $758.7 million in 2012, up 22% year-over-year from $622.9 million in 2011. As disclosed in our Analyst Day presentation, at the midpoint of our 2013 guidance, we forecast 17% growth in 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $891 million versus 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $759 million, up slightly from the midpoint estimate of $757 million disclosed at that event. Based on the information, we provided on page 74 of our annual state presentation entitled ‘return on strategic capital investment,’ we expect incremental revenue in 2013 to be 47% of stabilized revenue, which implies commencements are mostly back-end weighted in the year, slightly back-end weighted, excuse me, modestly. Turning to the income statement, net operating income increased to $219.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up $7.8 million or 3.7% from $211.8 million last quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to growth provided by incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions which was partially offset by unreimbursed landlord costs related to Hurricane Sandy and an increase in property taxes and $1.6 million special reserve relating to one tenant which affected rental revenue. Tenant reimbursements decreased by $3.8 million to $75.1 million in the fourth quarter from $78.9 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to seasonal fluctuations in utility expenses. Property taxes increased by $1.7 million to $19.7 million in the fourth quarter from $18 million in the third quarter due to supplemental taxes resulting primarily from reassessments of completed developments in Singapore and one U.S. property. NOI margins including utility reimbursements decreased 120 basis points in the fourth quarter versus third quarter due to the previously discussed increase in property taxes as well as unreimbursed Sandy-related landlord costs. NOI margins including utility reimbursements increased slightly in the (inaudible) quarter versus third quarter due to lower utility reimbursements in the period as previously mentioned. We prefer to look at NOI margin and EBITDA margin excluding utility reimbursements because of the seasonal fluctuation that occurs in a given calendar year in utility expenses. Likewise, fourth quarter same-store NOI was relatively unchanged at $181 million compared to $181.4 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments was $163.3 million in the (inaudible), also relatively unchanged from $161.7 million in the third quarter. This nominal decrease quarter-over-quarter was largely due to Sandy and the tax assessments we mentioned. It is important to know that combined with the late rating of lease commencements in the quarter i.e. December, approximately 73% of fourth quarter commencements occurred at new properties and are not included in the same store pool. G&A decreased (inaudible) to $13.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14.4 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to year end accrual adjustments. Transaction expenses increased to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $504,000 last quarter due to costs incurred in connection with the recent international acquisitions activity previously mentioned. Interest expense decreased to $40.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $41 million last quarter. Although gross interest increased in the quarter due to additional borrowings, we capitalized $3.4 million of more interest in the fourth quarter than in the previous quarter primarily due to the inclusion of additional qualified activity in our unconsolidated joint ventures and pre-purchases of heavy equipment as well as higher construction in our portfolio. Going forward, we expect capitalized interest to normalize around $5 million per quarter. Finally, we are confirming our 2013 FFO guidance of $4.65 to $4.80 per share and our 2013 core FFO guidance range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share that we announced at our January 31, Analyst Day with the assumptions that were set fourth in the press release. In response to (inaudible) that we’ve received regarding our 2013 guidance assumptions, we would like to provide some additional color on the expected ROI or return on investment, up 10% to 12% on a $986 million of datacenter capital that we expect to deliver in 2013. And that range compares to our stated targeted returns of 11% to 14%. There are two important factors that (inaudible) expected return of 10% to 12%. First, the low-end of the 10% to 12% ROI range reflects the potential lag associated with the timing of lease commencements. By comparison, the 11% to 14% range is based on stabilized cash NOI. For signings in 2011 and 2012, we achieved unlevered cash returns of 12.3% and 12.2% respectively. We expect to deliver returns on a stabilized cash basis in line with historical performance. Second, based on the three-year earnout agreement associated with the Sentrum acquisition, there is a cap 9% return on leases signed at the Woking property that we estimate will lower 2013 lease of returns by 50 basis points. As it is customary, we will revisit our guidance assumptions each quarter and revise them as necessary. This concludes our formal remarks and (inaudible) now open the call to your questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator instruction) And your question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about lease pricing and the leasing spreads you are seeing across the different property types. And if you can -- if you think the guidance you gave, how does it break out across the different types of properties?
Mike Foust:  Well, we kind of tend to look across the Turn-Key Flex and the powered base buildings. And the powered base building renewals tend to -- and I think as we mentioned as, we talk about renewal activities those generally are up probably around 10% on a GAAP basis and 3% or 4% on a cash basis. Generally, when I think on the Turn-Key Flex, our experience has been those increase on a GAAP basis a little over 5% and last quarter they were down 6%. But I think we are generally seeing that they’d be down on a first-year cash basis on average more like 3% going forward on the Turn-Key Flex. So overall we are looking at projecting somewhere in kind of the high single-digits to 10% on a GAAP basis going forward and on that first year and on the first year of cash, about 3% overall.
Operator: Your next question will come from Schildkraut with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just kind of following-up on some stuff that came to us this morning. I had a question about the capitalized lease commissions. Just wondering the terms of the timing, do you pay those out when the leases are commenced or at the time that you sign leases? Thanks.
Bill Stein: Half on signing and half on commencement.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Your next question will come from George Auerbach with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.
George Auerbach - ISI Group: Great. Thanks. Mike, could you give us some color on the leasing pipeline? I know you’ve had some success here in the first quarter, but maybe help us understand what the pipeline looks like going forward? And of the $31 million of leases that were signed so far in the first quarter, how much of that would you say was business that you may have thought was going to close in the fourth quarter kind of drifted into the first quarter? And how much of it -- do you think it sort of represents maybe an acceleration of kind of ongoing demand?
Mike Foust: Sure. I think probably, I don’t know $5 million or $6 million of revenue was items that drifted. I think from fourth quarter to first quarter and the remainder, things that were closing in the kind of the natural course of business. So, overall, we are very encouraged by the amount of leasing activity and it includes enterprises, financial services, our cloud and managed service providers, even some of the large social networking and Internet commerce companies. So we are seeing a really good general [growth] in demand. And I think the trend for outsourcing of enterprises is definitely driving that continued trend upward and signings this quarter.
Operator: Your next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Just going back to the TIs and leasing commissions for a second. They looked particularly high, especially in the renewal portfolio. I was wondering, what would make them jump up so much over on your recent run rate?
Mike Foust: Emmanuel, there was one deal in particular that involved a tenant in a high-rise building. It was an anchor tenant and it involved not only a renewal but a relocation. They were in two different locations in the building. So one was an eight floor location and one was a second floor location. So the second floor suite was located adjacent to the eight floor, and there was also expansion associated with that. And just because of the nature of the building, it was very expensive to relocate them. And I guess, additionally, this is a tenant that we would hope to do additional business with on a global basis support. It’s a strategic customer for us.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning, out there. Just wanted to circle back, Bill, to -- you gave some color that was helpful on the G&A change sequentially and the capitalized interest. But if you could flesh those out a little bit more for us? It sounded like G&A was down because of reversal of accruals, just the source of that. And then on the cap interest, I think you said -- it seemed like a very big spike to me and up $3 million to $4 million given that your average borrowing cost has come down. It seems like a lot of money would have to -- a lot of additional investment would be capital. If you could walk us through the mechanics of those two, that would be helpful?
Bill Stein: Sure. So in the case of the G&A, that was predominantly a reversal in the bonus accrual for the year because we didn’t make the high end of its internal targets and that’s what accounted for that. In the case of the capitalized interest, there is a catch-up associated with this and there’s new methodology as well. But as a result there was a $3.5 million catch-up, as I said it would normalize at around $5 million going forward.
Operator: Your next question will come from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Hi. Thanks. Just a question around your development costs. It appears that some of the estimates went up in the quarter on a sequential basis. Just give us a little bit of detail as to what’s driving this and if you are expecting any yield impacts or was that all sort of pass-through costs at this point?
Mike Foust: Well, our development costs are going up actually as a result of more projects. So on a unit basis actually, Jim Smith, and our team have really driven down unit costs on per KW per square foot. So the increase in the amount of construction we are doing and our guidance is a direct result of taking advantage of more opportunities that we are seeing in the market around the U.S., around the globe. So it’s (inaudible), so we are building more.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC: Yeah. I was interested in the revenues that you classified as retail, and what types of returns you are seeing on those deals versus the rest of the business. Is this retail kind of captive business that you are winning from your existing wholesale customers or given that there is a broader set of competitors like Telex and Equinix competing for the business, is it kind of a different dynamic? If you could maybe flush that out a bit that would be helpful.
Mike Foust: Those are our small footprint customers where we are just designating. And maybe big companies with a small footprint requirement and it might be an existing customer that has a smaller requirement in a particular geographic market and that’s where (inaudible) program really comes into play, to be able to serve that broad range of customers. And so we are really focused on expanding those opportunities, (inaudible) our customer base broadly. So that’s and we are pretty -- we are very bullish actually on being able to increase that opportunity. So we can capture the broad range. Our returns are probably somewhat higher than on our larger footprint leases. If you look at unlevered return on costs, we are clearly on a higher returns. So we like that business all around.
Operator: Your next question will come from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Hey, good morning. And maybe a follow-up to John’s, on the colo business. The occupancy at 365 Main sell in the quarter, should there be any particular read through on what you might want to do with that space internally? And then along the colo line, do you have any earmarked money in either acquisitions or development CapEx this year kind of geared towards that retail colo business?
Mike Foust: Yeah. So at 365 Main that was just -- we just built out more space in that building. So, we’re taking advantage of the opportunity to add values. So our folks are really clever and creative and we’ve been able to capture space. Add our UPS power and be able to expand there and certainly we’re deploying a significant amount of capital either directly to building out that colo business if you will. I don’t have it at my fingertips, but significant portion of our $850 million to $950 million projected CapEx for this year is devoted toward adding value at our assets with the colo program.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with the question.
Mitch Germain - JMP Securities: Good morning, guys. Just interested, Mike or Bill, in terms of allocating capital outside of the U.S. Seems like you kind of fall in Europe, is the goal is sort of beef up your Asia Pac exposures at this point?
Mike Foust: We’re looking -- we’re definitely looking at opportunities both in Europe as well as Asia Pac. And we’re at a point now in Europe where we’re pursuing a couple of opportunities on the continent to add to our portfolio. So while the capital spending actually, I think is probably going to go up a little bit as a percentage in Europe. Right now, we are projecting about 9% of our CapEx spend to be in Europe and the CapEx spend in Asia Pac was probably mostly due to the timing going down from 21% of the total bucket to 16%. But the bucket has grown also. So you are probably looking at almost the same amount in terms of dollar investment.
Bill Stein: Yeah. Asia is (inaudible) on an absolute dollar basis and Europe was up I think by about a third in absolute dollars.
Operator: Next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
Rob Stevenson - Macquarie: Hello, guys. Just a sort of follow-up on that. Can you contrast the U.S., Europe and Asia and your sort of core markets for us both in terms of the ability to drive cash rents where you see the best pricing power and where it’s sort of lagging at this point? And then, what you are seeing in terms of acquisition cap rates in those three regions for core income producing assets?
Mike Foust: Well, in terms of income producing assets, we are projecting I believe in our guidance 7% to 8% roughly.
Bill Stein: 7.25% to 7.75%.
Mike Foust: And we were able to achieve somewhat over 9% in the fourth quarter with a combination of Sydney deal and a Paris deal. So we think that our guidance numbers are conservative. But there’s going to be a range there and clearly it’s averaging somewhere between that 7.25% and 7.75%. It’s hard to make a sweeping statement about regions like that because every market in the U.S. has different characteristics and as well as in Asia-Pac as well as in Europe. A lot has to depend with (inaudible) are. I think it’s safe to say that generally for investment properties across the board, cap rates have declined over the last couple of years. For datacenter buildings, we are not seeing a rapid decline for the properties we are looking up. And also there is properties that trade at 6% to 6.5% that we just don’t bid on it. There is a property - a couple of things that we’ve taken a look at in Europe that have been potentially 5.5% to 6%. So we are looking for those opportunities where we can either create value or be in a position to underwrite tenants in buildings and releasing risk that other core investors are going to have a difficult time doing. In terms of lease rates, we are generally seeing lease rates have stabilized in most markets in the U.S. and they’ve been flat, pretty flat year-over-year, that we did have an uptick in the fourth quarter of 2012 that was encouraging. And broadly, every market is a little different in Europe and Asia-Pac. Europe is pretty steady at rates that have declined. I would say London is pretty steady. Paris doesn’t have a lot of activity right now. Amsterdam will continue to be a healthy market. And we are still seeing a good activity in London. So, I think flat rates would probably be the norm. In Asia Pac, lease rates are very healthy, demand is healthy generally and we see really good pricing power in the Asia Pac markets.
Bill Stein: And, Rob, one thing I would like to add to that is that in Europe on the acquisition side, there are situations where the seller of the asset is seeking liquidity and there is limited liquidity in Europe today. So in those situations, we can really achieve a pretty attractive risk adjusted return.
Operator: Your next question will come from Tayo Okusanya with Jeffries. Please go ahead with your question.
Tayo Okusanya - Jeffries: Yeah. Good afternoon. So just a quick question in regards to deferred rents. Just when I look at the growth on that line item relative to how much rent has been growing, it seems like deferred rent has been growing a little bit faster over the past few quarters. I was wondering whether you could address that.
Bill Stein: We bought a pretty large portfolio in July, which was the Sentrum Portfolio, and that would account for a significant component of that. It was US$1.1 billion, Tayo.
Operator: Your next question will come from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Hi guys. Mike, a couple of your tenants focused over in the ISP in cloud arena had a rough week in the stock market mainly Rackspace, CenturyLink, and Level 3. I’m just curious as you look at the way the market responded to what those companies had to say, I don’t know if you had a chance to look at what they said to the market. But what was your read on how their businesses are doing and what you think that foretells in terms of the space that they are going to be demanding going forward from companies like they did?
Mike Foust: That’s a really good question and actually we’re seeing both of those companies in particular continue to see good demand and very good growth. It seems like the market did not like CenturyLink’s decision to use cash flow and to shift that cash flow from dividends to stock repurchase. I think that in my opinion had a very, very big effect on their stock rather than our operating results. If you look at CenturyLink’s enterprise market both network and enterprise market data hosting which are our tenants, that would be your -- generally your Savvis and your historic Qwest. Operating revenues in their hosting business was up almost 13% year-over-year on the quarter. Colocation revenues were up almost 10%. They are seeing quite a bit of increase in their geographic expansion including and expanding further into Germany and they have got adding to their portfolio of cloud services. So it’s a very attractive growing business which is why CenturyLink brought them on onboard. The enterprise network market, those revenues were up almost 6% quarter-over-quarter to $671 million. Their other revenue is up 4.5% year-over-year. So that business is showing good growth too. Those are the businesses that would -- that do occupy and continue to take more space in our facilities. If you look at CenturyLink overall, they have operating cash flow of U.S. $7.7 billion and in the quarter it was up -- it was $1.9 billion, which was an increase year-over-year before and net income was up. So their business overall and cash flow from operations and those sorts of health metrics look good and as I said that the enterprise hosting and enterprise network are doing quite well. Rackspace, it appears the market didn’t like that. They only grew 57% quarter-over-quarter instead of 65% quarter-over-quarter revenues. So their revenues and new business is still growing tremendously well. And they need more space in many markets. So I think a natural adjustment and sometimes when stocks get a little frothy on valuations, but their business is extremely healthy and growing.
Operator: Next question will come from John Stewart with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
John Stewart - Green Street Advisors: On the TI, on the Turn-Key Flex renewals, first of all, can you tell us which market that was. Secondly, is it fair to assume, call it a 65% NOI margin so, a $100 rent. And then lastly can you tell us what the book value per square foot was before you capitalized the additional $130 a square foot in leasing costs?
Mike Foust: John, your question was cut off. We didn’t hear all of it.
John Stewart - Green Street Advisors: I asked which market the Turn-Key renewal space was in. Is it fair to assume a $100 net rent and what was the existing book value per square-foot before you capitalized on a $130 of additional leasing cost?
Bill Stein: We don’t have the book value for you in Chicago. We don’t have the other information for you right now. We can talk about that offline.
Operator: Your next question will come from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: ….specifically, it sounded like you are seeing some pretty good demand there and recently bought another portfolio of office buildings to get the inventory. Can you just talk about what verticals are really -- you’re seeing strength there and what the sweet spot is for deal sizes?
Mike Foust: I’m sorry, Vincent, the first part of your question didn’t come through.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank: I was just wondering about Phoenix. It sounded like you had some positive comments there, and recently added some more inventory. Just trying to get a sense of what the demand looks like, where the strength is coming from in terms of industry verticals. Also, what is the sweet spot in terms of size of deployment that you’re seeing demand for there?
Mike Foust: Phoenix is very active. We’ve seen a wide range of large requirements, multiple megawatts, as well as growing smaller footprint requirements. And it’s a combination of enterprise, web-based commerce, retail, hosting, managed services. So a pretty good mix of customers in Phoenix. Phoenix has always been historically a very tech market, broad based datacenter market for enterprises and financial services companies. And we already have a big stable financial services companies in Phoenix and particularly in Chandler.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from (inaudible) Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on your conversations with the largest corporate enterprise users. I mean it seems like last year they have been -- they were in the pipeline, they are still in the pipeline. What changed for those guys after the first of the year. What do they need to see to really get more active here and just kind of how are they thinking about their needs going forward that if we do start to get a better economy here and more visibility on earnings that you will really start to see a pick up or maybe that’s the wrong way to think about it?
Mike Foust: Well, I think in 2012, there is a lot of (inaudible) going on about outsourcing. And a lot of internal strategic planning around capital allocation in a lot of the big -- and in many, many big enterprises and especially in financial services. So I think our indications are that a lot of these plans have been formulated and they are ready to be implemented. And we see almost across the board, the plans include outsourcing of new space and consolidation of space. And outsourcing that is more of a leasing model as opposed to build-and-own yourself model. And we think that’s going to add significant new business in 2013 and 2014. So we are really encouraged by that. And I think financial services are going to lead the way in that. Other verticals are already looking down hard at healthcare. I think it will be another vertical that we will see more business coming out of. Certainly, the cloud services, computing, managed services. They are already focused on outsourcing and I think that’s a very positive trend for us all around.
Operator: Your next question is also a follow-up from George Auerbach with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your follow-up question at this time.
George Auerbach - ISI Group: Bill, thanks for the additional color on the development yields. I guess, I just -- I understood what they mean. So that the 10% to 12% is sort of the year one cash return, the 11% to 14% is the stabilized return. Then I guess just how should we think about the timeframe in your view to hit the 10% to 14%. Is that sort of six to eight quarter lease up?
Bill Stein: Okay. So the 10% to 12% would be taking all of the commencements over the course of the year and basically establishing a run rate on 12/31, divided by investment capital deployed. And the 10% assumes that some of the investment capital doesn’t lease. So that’s the reason for the delta between 10% to 12%. You can see the 12% is pretty close to what we achieved in 2011 and 2012 but in fact adjusting for the 50 basis point reduction due to the Sentrum earn out, the 9% -- you could argue that we are expecting to do better this year than we did in prior years. The 11% to 14% is where we expect yields to fall. So some yields will be at 11%, some yields will be at 14% and some actually could be higher than 14% and in fact have been higher than 14% in prior years, particularly in Asia. So, the 11% to 14% is really a range of outcomes and it just so happens that our results as adjusting for the Sentrum earnout, the 12.5% is really an essence right in the middle of the 11% and 14%.
Operator: Your next question is also follow-up from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your follow-up at this time.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I just want to circle back. There was some commentaries surrounding colocation and this was a discussion topic and point the colocation strategy at the Investor Day that I think it hit on. But you identified the firm’s current markets as a broad swath including the major metros like New York and Boston, Northern Virginia, Chicago, et cetera. I know colocation had -- you picked up this business through (inaudible) and you’ve grown it in markets where some of your major tenants who are in the colo business haven’t wanted to necessarily expand into such as Dallas for instance or certain buildings in Dallas if you will. How are you thinking about the business today. I mean, are you willing to put your own colocation business to the extent -- with an existing customer in buildings with existing tenants and essentially going head to head?
Mike Foust: Well, our colo offering does not include managed services. So, if they overlap, I think we see very little overlap because most of our folks -- colocation in our vernacular is just a small footprint. We’ll provide the remote hands, the rack and stack, the cabling, these are normal typical datacenter services that we do for the large customers as well as small customers. Actually we do more of that type of -- the large footprint customers than the small ones in reality and actuality. So, we don’t see a big differentiation around our product type. We don’t see a lot of overlap but we’re going to go ahead and continue to work hard to fill our buildings and serve our customers who have a wide range of footprint requirements. But I think in actuality, there is not much overlap between our customers that are providing a broader set of managed services and interconnect network services offerings.
Operator: And we do have time for one final question for today and that will be coming from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead with your follow-up at this time.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC: The robust (inaudible) leasing year-to-date (inaudible), just wondering, if you can comment is that reflective of all three regions in terms of broader market trends or primarily U.S. centric?
Mike Foust: Well, we certainly have more markets in the U.S. So the U.S. is always going to drive more volume, but we’ve also had success with significant lease requirements in London for a build-to-suit, in Singapore a smaller TK Flex requirement or an international bank. New York Metro was one of our larger Wall Street customers, some office space in Philadelphia. So it’s a pretty wide range of requirements. I think that’s reflective of the amount of activity, leasing activity we’re seeing across the board whether it’s Singapore or Sydney or in Phoenix or Northern Virginia or Chicago. So it’s Dallas -- I mean certainly all these markets, New Jersey, we are seeing good activity. So it’s pretty broad based, which is great for us because we have stock customers -- customers who want to be in multiple markets with us. And we will be able to take advantage of that throughout the year as well.
Operator: And we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers for today. I would now like to turn the call over back to the management for any closing remarks at this time.
Mike Foust: Thank you. And thank you everyone for spending the time with us today on the call. As you can tell, we are very positive about the opportunities for our business and for our customers’ business as well. The secular demand drivers that we reviewed on Investor Day continue to be in play and are only pointing towards greater demand as we had. We’re probably in better position to capture that demand than anybody else in the market. So thanks everyone and we will be speaking with you again soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Following management's remarks, we will open the call to your questions which will be limited to one per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Foust: Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call everyone. I will begin today's call with an overview of our operations as well as an update on our activity in our major markets. After my remarks, Bill will discuss our 2012 guidance, third quarter financial results and recent capital markets activities. Following his remarks, we will open the call to your questions. While slow economic growth in the U.S. and abroad, has delayed the decision-making process of many enterprise customers, based on our strong sales funnel and the investment opportunities we see in the market, we are very optimistic about the growth prospects and the near and long-term outlook for our business. In fact, we are on the offensive, taking advantage of our strong balance sheet and financial resources to continue to both expand our portfolio through new development leasing and to be the consolidator in the industry consistently making accretive investments of strategic data center portfolios and individual properties. Our deep team of professionals continues to execute this broad growth strategy that is unique in the data center sector. Turning first to our leasing activity, during the quarter we commenced leases totaling approximately $26.9 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, including approximately $800,000 of colocation revenue. Year-to-date, as of September 30, 2012, lease commencements totaled $82.6 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. As stated in our earnings release this morning, we lowered the high-end of our leasing guidance range to between $130 million and $150 million for the year. The revised range includes our backlog of leases scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2012, totaling approximately $29.2 million of annualized rental revenue. In addition, our 2013 backlog of leases scheduled to commence currently totals nearly $35 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. Consistent with what we discussed in our last call, the decrease from the high end of guidance is primarily due to the prolonged sales cycle which has made the timing of signings and therefore the timing of commencement difficult to predict. However, we continue to experience sustained growth in leasing activity. For example, the revised range of $130 million to $150 million represents a 31% to 51% increase in annualized GAAP rental revenue over last year's commencement of $99 million. And 2011 was 30% higher over 2010 commencements. This is a continuation of the strong trend in growing year-over-year commencements. We believe this projected increase remains impressive by any measure and reflects growing demand for our products, despite the macroeconomic environment. This compares very closely what we experienced in 2008 when demand for our data center space continued to increase, despite the state of the economy at large. This positive trend is confirmed by research report published by IDC last month which identified the impact of economic uncertainties over the last several years in the US data center market. The report stated "organizations began to eliminate smaller less efficient server rooms and server closets, while owners of larger data centers revaluated the sale and scope of IT systems housing their data center." The report went on to say "the reduction of more limited data centers and the rapid expansion of larger data centers primarily build by a service provider will accelerate in the coming years driven by three major forces". One, efforts to extend the use of virtualization to the next phase with denser, more finely tuned converted systems. In other words, this means that organizations are migrating toward automated preconfigured IT systems that the older enterprise-owned data centers can't support. Second, growing investments in data center assets to deal with the content explosion that is reshaping many industries from media to healthcare to energy. And thirdly, a shift to cloud architectures in the private area and business models in the public area that encourage greater use of third party data center facilities and assets. We also believe that these macro trends in our industry along with the steady progress we've made in our leasing during the year and our current prospect funnel [belies] a negative sentiment surrounding our sector. In fact, we are currently tracking approximately 2 million square feet of demand. This demand represents prospect in our sales funnel to whom we have made proposals that we believe have a 30% or greater likelihood of signing. In terms of new lease signings, we signed a strong volume leases for over 228,000 square feet of data center space including colo. And this totaled 16.4 megawatts of IT capacity. This IT capacity exceeds last quarter's volume of 12.3 million megawatts, as well as our prior four quarter average of 12.5 megawatts. Excluding colo, the weighted average lease term was 116 months. The US was by far our strongest region accounting for approximately 211,000 square feet of data center leases signed in the quarter. This includes 87,000 square feet of Custom Solutions, which we firmly refer to as built-to-suit. Custom Solutions in Houston at an average to annual GAAP rental rate of $65 a foot. Now, it's important to note that the lease rates for Custom Solutions space vary project-by-project, depending upon the engineering specifications and the type of improvements required by the customer and should not be made in a direct comparison to our TK Flex, Turn-Key Flex product. For our Turn-Key Flex space, we leased 124,000 square feet in United States at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $142 per square foot. The rental rate is largely in line with our prior fourth quarter US average of $145 a foot. The slight decrease is largely due to leases signed in markets with lower development cost such as Houston, as well as in leases in Northern Virginia which might be the most competitive market in the country. We also completed leases in Phoenix and Silicon Valley where we signed a new lease for the newly completed Turn-Key POD at our 1100 Space Park property in Santa Clara. Turning to Europe, we signed two small Turn-Key Flex leases in London, totaling 10,000 square feet, one in our Redhill facility and the other at the newly commission facility in Chessington. The average annual GAAP rental rate during the quarter was $198 per square foot for that small amount. No leases were signed or commenced during the quarter in the Asia Pacific regions, however, we do have a significant amount of active requirements there with leases signed already in October. As we've said, lease rates and activity can vary widely market-by-market and region-by-region. That is why we focused on cash return on investment targets of between 11% and 14% for our spec development. Even without Singapore, we've historically contributed to a high end of the range. The quarterly cash return on investment for TK up leases signed in third quarter was a strong 13%. ROI for our Turn-Key leases has been trending up in 2012. For example, second quarter ROI was up 60 basis points over first quarter and third quarter ROI was up 80 basis points over the second quarter average. The expansion of our colocation offering is on track, as we continue to build our leasing and deployment team to address opportunities. Leases signed for colo space during the quarter totaled $1.3 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $3.4 million. In prior quarters, leasing activity from our colo offering was primarily driven by a 365 Main Street facility in San Francisco. However, we saw an increase during the quarter in signings in certain of our Internet gateway data centers and other select DLR facilities as we gained momentum in those additional markets. Turning now to our lease renewal activity, in response to concerns around renewal rates we're including both cash and GAAP numbers in today's call. We signed approximately 26,000 square feet of Turn-Key and Powered Base Building space at renewal rates that were up 15.7% on a GAAP basis and up 7.6% on a cash basis. This includes approximately 14,000 square feet of Turn-Key space and an average GAAP rental rate per square foot of $127, which is up 16% on the GAAP basis and 7.8% on a cash basis. On a square foot basis, 62% of expiring Turn-Key space was renewed in the second quarter, with an average lease term of 45 months on the renewals. With so little rolling during the quarter, the lower than average renewal rate was primarily due to one customer that reduced its space in one property in favor of consolidating into new and expanded space in another deal at our facility. So we deliver a lot of flexibility to our tenants with multiple property solutions that often end up being very accretive for our shareholders. Portfolio occupancy increased in the quarter to 94.2% compared to 93.5% in the second quarter. The increase was driven by, one, the addition of over 75,000 square feet of space that was leased from our existing operating portfolio. Secondly, the 99% leased Sentrum Portfolio and that's 99% net of redevelopment space. Three, a second 94% leased property entering the portfolio on acquisition. And fourthly, lease space that was converted from our redevelopment inventory. These additions were partially offset by the lease termination noted above and vacant space converted from our redevelopment inventory into our operating portfolio. The same-store occupancy also increased to 93.4% from 92.9% in the second quarter. Third quarter same-store NOI was relatively unchanged at $181.4 million compared to $181.6 million in the previous quarter. Excluding the non-data center Solyndra Building in Fremont, third quarter same-store NOI for the data center portfolio was $181.8 million, up 0.7% from $180.5 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments was $161.8 million in the third quarter and that is an increase from $161.1 million in the second quarter. Again, excluding Solyndra Building, third quarter same-store cash NOI for the data center portfolio was $162.2 million, up 1.3% from $160 million in the previous quarter. I would now like to renew some of the supply/demand trends we're tracking in our US major markets. We define supply as our best estimate of data center space that is either built out or under construction. Moving east to west, in the New York, New Jersey Metro, we're currently tracking approximately 34 megawatts of potential demand. This compares to 24 megawatts of available supply, a healthy situation. We currently have 1.6 megawatts of built out supply in New Jersey with three 1125 kW PODs under construction, as well as we have a capacity to accommodate virtually any requirement with our existing redevelopment inventory. In Northern Virginia, we're tracking nearly, 30 megawatts of potential demand. This compares to approximately 27 megawatts of available supply. We currently have 1 megawatt of supply built with three 1125 purpose built data centers PODs to be delivered in the second quarter of 2013, and a new building that's currently under construction at our Digital Ashburn Campus. Dallas remains a very active market for us with limited available built out supply. We've identified approximately 26 megawatts of demand compared to about 9 megawatts of supply. Our current built out supply totals 1.5 megawatts. The construction of two new buildings continued on our Richardson campus during the quarter with the first two 1125 kW Turn-Key Flex data centers to be delivered in January of 2013. So, once again, we have very little exposure and we're working hard to bring on new supply to meet this demand that we're seeing in Dallas as well as other markets including Virginia and New Jersey. Silicon Valley demand has increased for the third quarter in a row with nearly 37 megawatts identified. This compares to nearly 29 megawatts of supply. We currently have about 5.1 megawatts currently under construction. Turning now to our acquisition program which remains essential to our business model and a key component of our growth strategy. We will close approximately $1.4 billion of new acquisitions of 2012. As we discussed in our last call, the completion of the Sentrum Portfolio demonstrates our ability to source, fund and complete accretive transactions that add stable long-term income. In addition, it delivers the opportunity to expand our global customer base and further enhance our operating scale and the debt of our technical and operations talent. In addition, we continue to identify attractive single property acquisitions such as the 286,000 square foot data center and office complex we closed recently in Aurora, Colorado. The property consists of three interconnected buildings and includes approximately 170,000 square feet of data center space. It is currently 94% leased to two customers with a weighted average lease term of 10 years. It's located near our Englewood 8534 Concord Center Drive facility in the suburban area and expands our presence in the Denver market, contributing to our revenue stream of long-term stabilized leases. We remain committed to maintaining our dominant position as the market consolidator and we're currently tracking property acquisitions totaling more than $600 million globally. Finally, I'll briefly review our growing development program. We continue to ramp up construction to build out supply in select markets to meet current demand. We have increased our construction team from 40 to over 50 professionals since last year. Current development activity includes 468,000 square feet of Turn-Key space that is 31% preleased, 190,000 square feet of custom solution space that is 100% preleased and approximately 1 million square feet of Powered Base Building, PBB space for future inventory in key markets. Detailed information on our development activity by market can be found on pages 20 and 29 of the third quarter supplemental package. We are investing more this year in new construction than we have in our history. We expect development spending to continue at this pace or higher going forward. We believe that our disciplined investment management approach and superior balance sheet allows us to better manage market risk by diversifying our capital deployment across geographies and product types. Our strategy is both unique in the marketplace and a critical component to our continued success. We attribute this success with a team of dedicated real estate and technical professionals which continue to drive the growth of our business. Year-over-year, our team has [maintained] committed to excellence and innovation delivering superior data center solutions to our customers while achieving attractive returns from our investment program. This in turn continues to drive solid earnings growth for our shareholders. As I said in my opening remarks, we were very optimistic about our growth prospects and the long-term outlook for our business. I will now turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my remarks today with a detailed discussion of our updated 2012 guidance, followed by a review of our financial performance and capital markets activities. Please note that all per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release with better visibility towards our year-end results, we are narrowing our 2012 FFO guidance range to between $4.40 and $4.44 per share, increasing the low end by $0.03 and reducing the high end by $0.04. Furthermore, we now expect FFO and core FFO, which includes items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams to be identical for the year. As a result, this guidance represents expected FFO growth of 8.4% to 9.4% over 2011 FFO of $4.06 per share. Reflected in the revised FFO per share range are the following assumptions, which have been updated since our last call. We narrowed our range of revenue recognized from Digital Design Services to between $8 million and $9 million. The high end of our development and redevelopment capital expenditures was reduced by $100 million to between $700 million and $800 million. Our previous guidance also assumed losses from early extinguishment of debt of $30 million to $31 million related to the Sentrum acquisition. After further research, it was determined that the appropriate accounting treatment was to record such costs as part of the acquisition since Digital never intended, nor was required by the contract to assume the debt and the related swaps. The purchase price was adjusted to reflect the debt extinguishment and this treatment does not impact FFO. Finally, as Mike mentioned in his remarks, we reduced the high end of our leasing assumptions range by $20 million to between $130 million to $150 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue contributed from the commencement of leases. The updated range includes the year-to-date commencements of $83 million, $29 million of backlog from signed leases that we expect to commence in the fourth quarter, and what we expect to sign and commence between now and the end of the year based on our current sales funnel, which per this guidance will range between $18 million and $38 million in the fourth quarter. Consistent with last year and given the $20 million range in fourth quarter leasing guidance, we plan to provide 2013 guidance in January. Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. As stated in today's earnings release, third quarter 2012 FFO was $1.13 per share, up 11.9% from the third quarter of 2011 FFO of $1.01 per share and up 3.7% from the second quarter 2012 FFO or $1.09 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, third quarter 2012 core FFO was the same as reported FFO at $1.13 per share. Adjustments to FFO in the third quarter included non-core revenues of approximately $1.1 million consisting of fees associated with the early termination of two leases. These non-core revenues were offset by certain items that do not reflect ongoing expenses consisting of $500,000 in transaction expenses, the majority of which was related to the Sentrum acquisition and $923,000 in non-core expense adjustments relating to intangibles associated with the lease terminations mentioned previously. The Sentrum purchase agreement contains a contingent consideration clause or earn-out. This obligation expires in July 2015. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, an acquirer is required to recognize the fair value of such contingent consideration as additional purchase price. At the acquisition date, we accrued an $88 million liability related to the pending consideration. Any future changes to the fair value of this contingent consideration will be reflected in earnings. We've also recorded a $106 million deferred tax liability for the Sentrum portfolio as of the acquisition date to reflect temporary differences between book and tax basis for items contained on the balance sheet to account for the tax effects of this business combination. The deferred tax liabilities will be amortized over the lives of the underlying assets. These liabilities are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the third quarter of 2012 was $115.6 million up from $101.2 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter of 2012 was 82.5% down from 85.4% in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at quarter end of $200.5 million grew by 30% from $154.3 million in the third quarter of 2011 and by 10% from $182.2 million last quarter. As you review the balance sheet, you will see that accrued – that account receivables increased by approximately $55.4 million from December 31, 2011 to $146 million at September 30, 2012, primarily due to the Sentrum acquisition which accounts for about $40.1 million in the increase as a result of quarterly rents that were built in September and are due in October. The remainder relates primarily to tenants in newly acquired properties and developed space coming online. Accounts payable increased approximately $300.9 million from December 31, 2011 to $616 million at September 30, 2012, due primarily to the deferred tax liability in the contingent consideration recorded in conjunction with the Sentrum acquisition that I mentioned earlier. The remaining increase primarily relates to construction and other property specific accruals across the portfolio. Turning now to the income statement, net operating income increased by [$22 million] to $211.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $189.7 million last quarter. Overall, this increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions. Looking down the income statement, tenant reimbursements increased to $78.9 million in the third quarter from $60.4 million in the previous quarter. This $18.5 million increase is largely driven by seasonal fluctuations in utility costs and subsequent reimbursements which are higher in the summer months and an additional $3 million of non-utility reimbursements associated with the Sentrum acquisition. The decreases in other revenues reflects termination fees relating to the Solyndra lease which was recognized in the second quarter. On the expense side, rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased to $106.7 million from $87.6 million in the previous quarter. The $19.1 million increase is largely driven by a $15 million increase in utility expense during the period of which approximately $6 million relates to the Sentrum acquisition and the remaining relates to the seasonal summer increases in usage and rates. These utility expense increases are offset by higher reimbursements. The balance of the $4.1 million relates to cost other than utilities of which $1.7 million relates to the acquisition of the Sentrum Portfolio. NOI margins decreased third quarter versus second quarter by approximately 170 basis points due to the loss of NOI at the Solyndra property this quarter resulting from its bankruptcy and the seasonal increase in utility reimbursements and expenses which inflates total revenue. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was due to a $2.3 million gain associated with the disposition of a non-core property in the second quarter. Tax expense decreased to $710,000 from $1.2 million in the second quarter primarily due to a true-up of non-cash deferred taxes. Lastly, preferred stock dividends decreased to $9.8 million from $10.3 million due to the conversion of 1.87 million shares of series D convertible preferred stock into common stock during the third quarter. Finally, I'd like to review our recent capital markets activities, liquidity and important credit metrics. Over the last few months, we've executed interest rate swaps converting approximately 75% of the term loan balance from floating to fixed rate. As of today, the all-in weighted average interest rate on the term loan is 2.325%. This is consistent with our strategy of minimizing our financial risk while seeking to achieve the lowest possible cost of capital given market conditions. Year-to-date, we've raised approximately $2.4 billion of new capital which includes the $300 million US dollar unsecured notes offering as well as a $300 million commitment increase on the global revolving credit facility completed during the third quarter. On September 24, we completed the issuance of $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes at Digital's lowest coupon rate to-date of 3.625% and a yield of 3.784%. The coupon is 162.5 basis points lower than the 10-year coupon on our March 2011 unsecured notes issuance and 87.5 basis points lower than the five-year coupon on our July 2010 unsecured notes issuance. This debt issuance further reduces our embedded cost of capital and improves spreads on investments. We've also positioned ourselves for additional financial flexibility in future periods. Certain covenants were modified to align the most recent indenture with the covenants included in our global revolving credit facility and multicurrency term loan. Modifications included a cap rate reduction from 9% to 8.25% as well as an increase in the cross payment for our cross acceleration threshold from $50 million to $75 million. We also added language that excludes unconsolidated joint ventures from the calculation of total unencumbered assets. Under the terms of this indenture at September 30, 2012 incremental debt capacity would be increased by $450 million. We have almost $1.3 billion of immediate liquidity, which includes approximately $79 million in short-term investments and funds that can be drawn on our global revolving credit facility. If this liquidity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance with all covenants contained in the global revolving credit and term loan facilities, our Prudential shelf facility and other unsecured debt. During the quarter, we repaid a consolidated secured loan totaling $52.8 million. In 2013, we have $226.8 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities with the weighted average cost of 6%, which we plan to retire initially with proceeds from the revolver that we'll eventually replace with additional long-term unsecured debt and/or preferred stock. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5 times at quarter end, up from 4.6 times at the end of the second quarter. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was 3.7 times compared to the previous quarter at 3.4 times, and our weighted average cost of debt including interest rate swaps was 4.35% at quarter-end, down from 4.67% as of last quarter end. As a reminder, we manage leverage based on two key metrics. Fixed charge coverage and debt-to-EBITDA. Our plan is to maintain fixed charge coverage ratios in excess of the high 2s and debt-to-EBITDA in a range of 5 to 5.5 times. As always, we welcome your comments and greatly appreciate your continued support.
Pamela Garibaldi: Operator, we'd like to open the call to questions at this time.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. So I guess the big question here is how can we get comfortable with the remaining commencement guidance in the fourth quarter? I know you've laid out kind of your pipeline of $29 million backlog. Can you talk about the rest of it and kind of where you stand on these leases and why we should be comfortable that you're going to hit that number?
Michael Foust: Sure. We've got – as I've mentioned, the funnel is very full with prospects and in prospects that – to whom we've made proposals, that was that 2 million square feet of proposals. And if we look at our prospects that we're negotiating leases with currently, that makes us very comfortable that we're going to achieve well within that range. So from the amount of activity we're seeing, which is in excess of what we achieved in the third quarter, we're very comfortable with the amount of transactions that we're actively working to sign up and commence.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I guess a little more color. I mean can you characterize where they are in the process, I guess is we're just thinking about what's to come certainly the fiscal cliff is on people's minds, business decision-making seems to be slowing down. Why would those – why wouldn't these wait until next year?
Michael Foust: I think what folks have, maybe in this environment, having trouble understanding is that these are requirements that have to be in place now. They have to be in place for customer requirements, in a lot of cases it's cloud providers and IT service providers who have customer contracts that they need to get up and running. So they need to get this space going. It's enterprise – some enterprise customers who have requirements, expansions, new applications that are going to save money and raise productivity that they need to get up and running early in 2013. I can't give you the actual names of the customers, but many of these are repeat customers of ours that we have relationships with and we're actively negotiating leases. So we're very comfortable that – we're working on real deals with major international companies, looking at major cloud providers and managed service providers, international financial companies, system integrators who are providing space for international financial firms, international tech and Internet-based businesses. So it's a very wide range of customers that we're engaged with currently.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just a final follow-up on the same topic. When you think about the second quarter earnings release and the guidance you gave then and now you're at the lower end. What's kind of changed in that number to get you to the lower end?
Michael Foust: Well, I'd say -- we brought down the top end but we didn't lower the lower end. But we're very confident that we're going to be well within the range with a substantial backlog of signed leases going into 2013 in addition. So based on the activity, our folks are, on the leasing side are, I think I can safely say, as busy as they've ever been.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And I guess that these leases that got pushed out or if some have fallen out of bed, I assume you saw it when you gave the second quarter number that that was -- the midpoint was the reasonable point you'd hit?
Michael Foust: Yeah, it's timing. It's timing. I'm looking at one particular lease as an example and the tenant and us, all thought it was going to be signed in the second quarter and it's going to signed next month. So it's really not a matter of requirements not there, it's – in some cases, it's a matter of timing.
Bill Stein: Jamie, there's one deal that I know that was done away. It's a pretty good size.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I guess (inaudible) when you think about – I'm sorry.
Michael Foust: I'm just saying in the Southwest where, because of the timing, our building wasn't going to be done in time and we thought that their timing was going to be a little more flexible. But we didn't have the capacity built yet.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. So does this suggest your 2013 – I mean some of the stuff getting pushed back that you actually feel better about lease signing next year than you did three or four months ago?
Michael Foust: We've always been competent. I think perhaps market observers haven't appreciated and we haven't done as good a job and maybe perhaps we could at that, demand for data center space of all sorts continues to expand at a pretty good cliff and that's what IDC is seeing, that's what other firms like Forrester and Gartner are seeing. So we're comfortable and we've been very positive about the near-term and long-term growth of the business.
Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Caton with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line may be on mute.
Chris Caton -- Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on Jamie's line of questioning. You gave demand in the market across, I think, four markets; New York, Virginia, et cetera. It added up, I think, to 127 megawatts. I think compared to the second quarter that was 143. So I was hoping you could comment on the ins and outs of that funnel in terms of leases that are getting signed and new demand that's kind of coming into the funnel, how are those trending? And then the uses, how are they thinking about pricing as they kind of hang out in terms of trying to make a decision, where was their thinking on pricing three, six, nine months ago and where do they think they'll ultimately sign?
Michael Foust: Sure. On the demand side, from our appalling of the market, a couple of things. There was some absorption, so customers got signed leases. Also, we changed our methodology a little bit. We were including federal government requirements all in Northern Virginia because that's what we are marketing to the different departments. And so we've spread that out now to the actual locations now that we have some better visibilities where they want to be. And then thirdly, there were a few customers that – respective customers that didn't move ahead mostly in kind of private equity-backed colo companies. But largely I think was absorption and how we're looking at our federal government program.
Chris Caton -- Morgan Stanley: Thanks. And then just on the pricing, how has their expectation on rate changed over kind of year-to-date in terms of – in some of these markets?
Michael Foust: I think customers typically are looking at – because leases are long, they're looking at kind of average rents over time periods. I would say generally that as I've been saying for the past several quarters, Northern Virginia is probably the most competitive and the market where we've seen the most decline in rents. So it really hasn't had much effect on our returns as we continue to get more effective. Other markets, we're seeing the lease rates pretty stable year-over-year. I think we've expressed that out of our 32 markets, some softness in Silicon Valley, some softness in Virginia and some softness in New Jersey. But we're still attaining good returns and other markets are pretty stable at very high returns process as we noted earlier.
Chris Caton -- Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: Yeah, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Just want to go back to the pipeline a little bit. If we dial ourselves back a year to this call, the forward backlog for 2012 at that point was $37 million, this year is $35 million, even though the portfolio has grown substantially in size. So I sort of want to understand that a little bit in context of this order of ramp? And then when we think about what's still needed to not only sign but actually commence in 2012, the revised guidance you'd put out, you're talking $20 million to $40 million of annualized rents, it's still a big number and obviously it's nice to have backlog of $29 million that you already know, but that's still a very large number relative to your history. And so what's unclear to us is there are a couple of big leases in there that – you got one $5 million, you got another one of $2 million. That gives us more confidence that we're going to get to those numbers. And then just as a third part of that, we ended the second quarter, you talked about having a $41 million backlog for this year. You commenced 26 in the third quarter and now you have a backlog of 29. Maybe you can just help us understand how that backlog – how much came into the third quarter and how much went into the fourth quarter?
Michael Foust: I mean generally, the leasing activity has been consistently growing in terms of requirements and we're seeing a lot of fourth quarter business that we've been engaged with for quite a while. And folks are working hard on both the customer side and our side to get leases on – get leases completed in the fourth quarter. Like I said, our sales teams are busier than they've ever been and we've got a number of large – relatively large leases spread widely across the portfolio that make us confident that we can – in addition to the backlog that's signed in and placed that the funnel will allow us to make good that range of commencement. And I think also folks get a little too wrapped up about, does something commence in November or does it commence in February? We're talking long-term leases here that have long-term contribution to earnings. So while we're confident of making our range, I think people get a little hung up on 60 to 90 days swings in activity.
Bill Stein: And Mike, the total backlog for this year and subsequent years is over $78 million. So it's 29 in Q4, but…
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: Right. But this time last year you gave a figure of $37 million for 2012 which would be comparable for the $35 million for 2013. So for something that should be accelerating, I would have assumed at this point next year the pipeline would be even greater than it would, not a little bit less. Now I don't know if that's because you have so much more coming in the fourth quarter relative to where you were last year, but I was just trying to bring it up as a point of reference. And to Mike's comment about – yes, well, I think we all understand that long-term leasing is important, but you also have to understand it from the Street's perspective, you started at 145 to 180, 145 to 180 became 130 to 170, 130 to 170 became 130 to 150. We can all understand that things take longer to occur, but at some point there is some element of – are things falling out of bed or are they just being pushed. And if they're being pushed, then there is an immediate hit to the growth rate?
Michael Foust: Yeah, Michael. We've got – the $35 million of backlog will very likely be much higher by the time we get to the end of the year for 2013. So we're talking about the backlog as it exists today in October. By the time we hit December, that backlog going into 2013 will certainly be larger.
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: Hopefully, it doesn't come from the $20 million to $40 million that you still have to sign and commence this year moving into next year. The last question is on the 2 million…
Michael Foust: Once again, Michael, I think you're really missing the point. This is – I mean we're talking about near-term leasing and the amount of activity is there. And we're executing on it. And it's fully 30% to 50% higher than the last year.
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: Right.
Michael Foust: I think folks are losing sight that growth is there and it continues to be demonstrated.
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: The 2 million square feet funnel that you talk about, obviously the dollars associated with that would be completed different if it was Turn-Key or Powered Base Building. What is the annualized rent related to that 2 million square feet?
Michael Foust: I don't have that number. I don't have it calculated. But it's a much higher majority now of Turn-Key spaces versus Powered Base Building. The mix is clearly shifted for folks wanting the fully fitted out solution.
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: Right. So like a $200 million potential number?
Michael Foust: I haven't added it up, but it would be substantial, yes.
Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Foust: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets: Yes. I'm interested a little bit in the colo business and maybe give us an update on how you see that growing over time as well as your propensity to sign tenant deals with colo and hosting companies? And is that a type of tenant group that you would emphasize differently going forward in favor of other verticals? And then during the prepared remarks, you talked about I think October leasing and Asia-Pac and can you maybe talk about recent trends in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong in that context?
Michael Foust: Sure. In terms of the colo business, we're focused on our existing buildings, especially in Internet gateway buildings and other buildings where we have the high concentration of networks that is very attracted to the colo. And where we have inside staff that we can leverage to bring cost effectively, bring that smaller footprint higher touch business online across several buildings in the portfolio. So that is going at pace. We're making sure we're doing it in a very methodical way, so we have a high-level customer service that folks expect. And what's interesting is if you look at a lot of the customers for colo, they are cloud providers, managed hosting providers, content distribution. We're seeing folks that are doing gaming, online gaming with handhelds. I mean there is a lot of really interesting applications that don't take a lot of space. And that's a good set of customers for our colo business. The other question about Asia-Pac, yeah, we've had a little bit of a wall in terms of signings, but not reflective of any decrease in the amount of business we're pursuing. And we're seeing a lot of increased requirements from folks that are providing cloud services, managed services in the region. And we're seeing those requirements being signed in Sydney and Singapore and it's still early days in Hong Kong where we're ways off, but we have interest in Hong Kong preliminary interest from both, those sort of folks as well as especially from corporate enterprise and international Internet companies looking for additional space in both Hong Kong as well as in Singapore. So we're very positive about the activity in Asia-Pac in general.
Jon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao -- Deutsche Bank: Hi, everyone. Just maybe a follow-up on the Asia-Pac discussion and in the context of keeping the development pipeline going, just wondering if you could update us on Japan and the progress that's been made there?
Michael Foust: Yes. I mean we're – our team's looking very hard at the Japan market, certainly Tokyo as well as Osaka. And while we don't have anything to announce as yet, we're looking very hard at opportunities because we do see a significant amount of demand, especially from international firms with whom we have relationships who need expansion space or they need a business continuance in areas outside of Tokyo region. So it's something – it's a market region in Japan that we're looking at very actively.
Vincent Chao -- Deutsche Bank: Okay. And is that sort of the next step in Asia?
Michael Foust: I would guess yes with the focus that we're giving it, and certainly conversations on possible ventures in China as well. But Japan is really on the front burner at the moment in terms of new markets.
Vincent Chao -- Deutsche Bank: Right, that's what I meant. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: Hi. I'm here with Gab Hilmoe. A question on your rent spreads. Can you give us a sense of how your in-place cash rents across the portfolio compare to the rents that you're achieving on new renewal leases or maybe in other words, what's the current cash mark-to-market on your portfolio? I think there's a real question out there given what Dupont announced yesterday.
Michael Foust: Yeah. I mean we have a very different portfolio than Dupont and they have a much more limited portfolio geographically and a highly concentrated customer base in the Internet sector. So it's really – I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's different and we have a much more diversified portfolio. So I don't have that calculation. My estimate is we're probably up – I don't know, probably over the overall portfolio 5% to 10% would be the roll off overall run rate.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: On a cash basis?
Michael Foust: Yes, I would say so. Because remember we have a lot of leases that are legacy leases and leases in assets where we've been done (inaudible) building leases many years ago. And those where the customer put the improvements in that were originally leased as an alternative use rents. Now we can see a significant uplift and that's been our experience with PBB type leases uplifts 10% to 15% from that component of the portfolio [rhetorically].
Bill Stein: Ross, we've had many over 20% uplifts on those PBBs. And if you look at the lease rollover schedule which I think is posted, you'll see there's a high concentration of PBB rolling over the next several years.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: But across the blended portfolio, you do think it's a positive mark, I think that's…?
Michael Foust: Definitely.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: Okay. The other question is, I wanted to try to go back on the question that everybody's been asking about the backlog. I just want to make sure I understand how you're defining it? Are you defining that the $29 million backlog as those are leases that are already signed and set to commence this quarter?
Bill Stein: Yes.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: So in order to get to the 130 to 150 number for the full year to the midpoint of that, there's another roughly $25 million of annualized lease revenue that has to commence in addition to that backlog, is that roughly the right way to think about it?
Bill Stein: Yeah, 23 close enough.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: Okay, my rounding's off. Okay. But last question is, you had mentioned in the beginning of the call your role as a consolidator and I guess the question would be how does your – does the changing cost of equity capital influence how you think about the volume of activity that you would do going forward?
Michael Foust: We're very bullish on the opportunities and I think that's something that the market, I think, has not valued highly enough when you look at the increase in stable bottom line earnings as we've been able to deliver as a consolidator. And I think we'll continue to have our cost of capital advantage in the marketplace along with – what's very important too is our technical expertise, that's very attractive to sellers because they know we understand the product, they know we have the wherewithal to close. And that's going to continue to serve us very well and drive very stable increasing earnings as well as additional operating scale. And many of these come with value-add opportunities as well. So we're still quite bullish on our opportunities there.
Bill Stein: Ross, the other point there is the portfolios that are out there, if they're large enough they're looking to a possible public exit. And clearly the multiples for the public exit have changed a fair bit in the last month, if you assume that that will be trading to some discount to DLR and the other public companies.
Ross Nussbaum -- UBS: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie: Good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on Ross' question on pricing. Where is pricing today in rough order for sort of older seven to 10-year-old Turn Key space in a market like Northern Virginia as the leases there roll versus where you're putting people in a price point basis for brand new space that you're bringing online?
Michael Foust: We don't have much of that, because our portfolio is pretty new, in that market. But I would say on renewals, we'll continue to see a high renewal activity that we would expect close to market rents, unless the tenant has a fixed uplift in their renewal option. But we don't see much difference because in our portfolio and we've seen this in other markets where we have tenants renewing leases on 10-year-old space and that space is extremely functional, especially since we've seen – we have not seen much of an increase in terms of power densities. So folks in terms of UPS, usually where they have to upgrade the space of adding more UPS, and which we'll do from time to time and especially if its telco space that we want to turn into enterprise data center. But the space is very functional, especially with the corporate enterprise or for your cloud and managed services, IT colo companies, they want space in that 100 to 120 watts a foot. We built space in excess of 200 watts a foot for customers who want this, but we take that space as very competitive.
Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie: Okay. So you're saying that the perception out there while new space – brand new space maybe something on the order of 130 bucks that – this perception of a 10-year-old space as it renews is going down to $90 or $80 on a comparable basis is incorrect from what you've seen through your portfolio?
Michael Foust: That is incorrect. It's absolutely not the case.
Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie: Okay. And then just for Bill, the $29 million of backlog, does that include what you guys have signed in October?
Bill Stein: No, it doesn't. That would be additional.
Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie: Okay. Is there a number that you guys have out there for October that you can give us?
Bill Stein: We really don't disclose quarter end data. We certainly have signed leases since the quarter commenced, but we don't disclose that information.
Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Bill Stein: We could, it's just – it gets messy when you start talking about partial quarters and a little confusing.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of George Auerbach with ISI Group.
George Auerbach -- ISI Group: Great. Thanks. Bill, you mentioned within the accounts payable or other accrued liability or liability you recorded for difference in GAAP and cash, I guess book basis on the Sentrum Portfolio. What was the amount of that liability and for that purposes, should we view that as a sort of non-economic liability?
Bill Stein: Yeah, the deferred tax liability is 111 and that's timing differences between GAAP and tax.
George Auerbach -- ISI Group: So I guess is that now your real liability that we should sort of back out for that purposes?
Bill Stein: Yeah, I mean it will – that will be amortized, that liability will be amortized over the term of the lease.
George Auerbach -- ISI Group: Okay. And I guess so early…
Bill Stein: Cash is going to go out the door to pay taxes, but the tax going out the door to pay the taxes on a cash basis will be different than the expense that's recognized.
George Auerbach -- ISI Group: Okay. And I guess the last question on the backlog from me, early thought on the '13 commencement, I know this year it's sort of in the 130 to 150 range. Can you just give us a sense, early thoughts on next year, is that number same, higher or lower than the '12 number will be?
Michael Foust: I think we'll certainly be at least on par. It's probably – it's early yet, but we're thinking it should be a little higher.
George Auerbach -- ISI Group: And also on the development spend line, I think this year's 700 to 800, early thoughts on next year?
Michael Foust: It's going to be on pace. We're kind of going as fast as we can. So I think it will be very similar.
George Auerbach -- ISI Group: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc: I'd just figured I'd follow-up on George's question there, any early thoughts on FFO for next year? That's a joke. There seems to be a big disconnect, Mike, between your tone and view of the world, the demand set, I mean for your product and for what's going on in the technology sector relative to everything else in the world. And the stock's performance, you stocked down 25% from the peak three months ago. We look at – everybody on this call -- a lot of people on the call look at real estate from all walks of life, I mean the demand argument it seems almost indisputable on some level for your space relative to everything else we have to look at. What's the disconnect here? What seems to be the problem, do you think?
Michael Foust: I think folks would be well served spending more time looking at the secular technology drivers that drive demand for growth and IT application, growth in broadly IT services, what they're companies are doing in terms of consolidating all these, just for data centers in a closet and getting them into new modern facilities. Looking at a lot of this, the basic research that folks like IDC, Forrester, Gartner, Tier One Research, these folks do deep dives into the secular demand drivers and specifically about demand for data center space broadly. So if you look at, at the growth in folks that are providing managed services, cloud services, content distribution, many, many who are customers and growing customers in addition to the enterprise sector, I think you'll see a lot of that information pretty clearly communicated and defined out there. And I think maybe folks haven't dived into that information that that would be very worthwhile.
Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc: So I am with you, I understand the demand side. The market is suggesting something else, right? There are other issues and they're keying off of things that are actually going on in the world, right? DFT's report yesterday, I know you guys are very different. Your report today, even though demand is – I think you said stronger than ever and busier than ever for your sales guys, your commencement guide is down for the second quarter in a row. That's not something we have to come to expect from Digital Realty Trust and that's because of your track record that you've established. So what's changing that we're sort of getting this negative stimulus, if you will, in the most recent months? I mean you mentioned the elongating of the sales cycle 90 days ago or so, but I mean is there anything else out there? Is it supply? Is capital just more available?
Michael Foust: Well, I mean certainly there is more competition in certain markets but a big driver for us is that our – one in particular the Asia-Pac market, we've had a couple of slow quarters and that is – in terms of lease commencements and signings and that's picking up. So I think Singapore and Australia probably have had a bigger effect and I think that's – you're talking about a small dataset of deals and we'll see the activity in Asia of signings and commencements pick up here over the next three or four months based on what we're working on.
Bill Stein: Jordan, our plan assumed that [Jurong] – our initial plan assumed that Jurong would be basically full at the end of this year. It's probably going to be full mid next year. So that's a six-month delay.
Michael Foust: We've got tenants that we're negotiating with and engaged with for almost the entire building there and we've got good activity on the new Sydney building. So we feel good about the activity. It's just the timing is a little different than we initially anticipated at the very beginning of the year.
Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc: I mean you guys are consolidating this space, right? You're the consolidator of this space, the biggest player in this space in terms of network neutral data centers, in terms of controlling real estate and there's a couple other public players and some increasingly better capitalized small players but not that many new players from what I can tell and you're going to be buying some of these guys that are already out there. Don't you have the ability, and I step lightly here to sort of control price? I mean it's all about supply and demand. So demand we know. Supply is all about you and another guy? And one of the other guy is only in four markets.
Michael Foust: You have competitors in all the markets, many of the markets that we're at a premium over, but they're keeping their lease rates flat. And also remember too there comes a point where you just can't keep going up on rate because customers will start to consider alternative build to suits for themselves and go back to owner-occupied models. So we want to be mindful that we want to get deals done and not have folks reconsider owner-occupied and we do a lot of…
Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc: That's not what IDC is saying, right? You read it. And we haven't heard of a lot of – the bigger guys even building for their own account recently.
Michael Foust: But people will consider building themselves. You don't have infinite pricing or else we have Manhattan – we have Los Angeles or distribution states of $50 a foot. I mean it's not an infinite upward trend and there are competitors, you got folks like CyrusOne out there and they compete on price. Some of the other folks that you mentioned compete on price. We compete on quality of service and hiring (inaudible) uptime in our deep professional staff for liability security. It's where we'll achieve a bit of premium, but you got a whole world of corporate services (inaudible) brokers and their job is to represent their customers aggressively and that whole real estate world. So you just can't price all the time with a continuous upward trend, but we're at very attractive 13% average on the level of returns on costs this past quarter. So we're pretty happy on the type of returns we're achieving on our developments.
Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc: Thank you. I'll yield the floor.
Bill Stein: I'd like to make a clarification on the signed and commenced for the quarter, the midpoint's 28. So, 18, 38, the midpoint's 28.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Johnathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners: Thank you for squeezing me in. Actually most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I would actually like a little bit more color on how the backlog works? Historically or traditionally I would have imagined that you have a backlog number. You do some signings that goes into the backlog. You have commencements, that comes out of the backlog. But that math doesn't seem to work. So if you could just explain how this backlog works, it'd be really helpful? Thanks.
Michael Foust: That is how it works. And we define backlog as signed leases. And we usually refer to prospect as our prospect funnel. So backlogs are our signed leases and then once those leases are commenced, then they're out of the backlog.
Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners: Okay. Because last quarter you said you had $41 million in backlog and you pretty much signed and commenced the same amount of leases and now you have $74 million in backlog. Is it that $41 million in backlog was only reflective of 2012 and there was always separate 2013 backlog?
Michael Foust: Yeah, it's kind of a continuous process.
Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners: All right, great. There's been a lot of speculation that New York Stock Exchange is going to look to unload its two buildings, I guess one over here in New York and one in the UK, and I was wondering if you had any perspective on that and whether those would be attractive assets?
Michael Foust: Conceptually, there would be attractive assets. Always one has to look at comparison to replacement costs because both – and our understanding is both of those assets would have a considerable amount of vacant space, vacant space that also needs to be built out. Our understanding is there's a lot of shelf space. So any investment in properties like that, you have to be able to have a view that you could build out this space and be competitive in the market with other space including space that we would build. So I think a big question there on kind of the investment [thesis] would be, can you be in at a – all-in at an attractive basis that would make you competitive leasing out the vacant space.
Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners: All right. Thank you for taking the questions.
Michael Foust: Sure thing.
Operator: I would now turn the conference over to Michael Foust for closing remarks.
Michael Foust: Great. Thank you, everyone and thanks for the great questions and comments. As always we're available to discuss and we very much value your observations and comments in the market and in our business. And I do want to congratulate our team here at Digital who are doing a terrific job and working hard to take advantage of the opportunities here. So thank you team and once again, thank you all for your time. Appreciate it today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.

If we’re unable to take all of your questions on the call, we’ll be happy to discuss them with you offline. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Foust – Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, Pamela, and welcome to the call, everyone. In response to last week’s leasing results press release, our primary goal today is clear up any uncertainty around the state of our industry and our business. After my brief introduction, Bill will discuss our 2012 guidance, second quarter finance results, and recent capital market activities. Following his remarks, I’ll provide an overview of our operations as well as an update on our activity in major markets before opening the call for your questions. Like most global businesses, we are mindful that current uncertain economic and political environment. However, we believe that data center sector will continue to be a growth area in the context of the broader economy. In fact, our business has benefited significantly from a number of recent trends since the downturn in 2008, including the outsourcing of data center requirements by corporate enterprises, including large financial institutions, as well as the growth of managed service providers. With our track record of reliability of financial resources as well as our design and construction expertise, we continue to attract enterprise customers especially financial institutions are looking for a data center provider to have mission critical applications. In addition, we are attracting many new customers to DLR. We’ve consistently said that the great opportunity for our business is to convert the large enterprise users from building their own data centers to outsourcing that function to DLR. While this has contributed to a longer sales cycles in the short term, in part due to extensive procurement processes as many of the larger institutions, it does not represent a reduction in demand. We firmly believe that providing long-term data center solutions to these customers deliver sustained value and growth for our business and for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Bill. 
Bill Stein – Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. To address the concerns that have been raised since we issued our second quarter lease results last week, I’ll begin my remarks today with a detailed discussion of our 2012 guidance followed by a review of our financial performance and capital markets activities. Pleased note, that all per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. The original guidance range of $4.34 to $4.48 per share assume that items that did not represent ongoing revenue and expense streams would net out to zero over the course of the year. Therefore, core FFO and reported FFO would be essentially identical. As a result of the transaction costs, including debt extinguishment costs associated with the Sentrum acquisition, core FFO will now be significantly greater than reported FFO in 2012. We estimate that the Sentrum portfolio acquisition and the upside equity offering will add approximately $0.08 per share of FFO in the second half of 2012. Furthermore, we believe that the delay in the timing of lease commencements will result in a decrease of $0.05 to $0.08 per share of FFO. As a result, we have revised the 2012 core FFO guidance range to $4.37 to $4.48 per share increasing the low end by $0.03 per share and maintaining our high end. With respect to the changes underlying our revised 2012 guidance leasing assumptions, as of June 30, 2012, we commenced leases totaling approximately $56 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. And we have a backlog of $41 million that we expect to commence during the second half of 2012, which results in approximately $97 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. While we’re very confident about our prospect funnel, the timing of the signings and commencements at this point in the year is difficult to predict. However, as Mike said this does not represent a deceleration in demand, rather with many large corporations including financial institutions there is often an elaborate and structured procurement process particularly for major IT deployments. Nevertheless, new customers continued to be a very important component of our growth strategy, contributing stabilized income in the form of long-term lease commitments, while providing additional growth opportunities for potential future deployments at our sites worldwide. We’ve therefore revised our assumption for 2012 lease commencements to range between $130 million and $170 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue from $145 million to $180 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. By comparison last year, we commenced approximately $100 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. It is important to note that our revised range of $130 million to $170 million represents an increase in annualized GAAP rental revenue over the last year of 30% at the low end, 50% at the midpoint and 70% at the high end. I would also like to note that our leases commenced for the first half of this year plus our backlog totaling $97 million is just $3 million, or 3% shy of what is commenced – what was commenced for all of last year. We believe this growth rate range in commencement further illustrates the strength of our business and the confidence we have in our leasing program. As we stated in our leasing results press release last week we are adding sales directors and sales engineers to our team to address the additional demand in these markets as well as to support the growth for our business and markets like suburban Chicago. To a large extent, these positions are budgeted and have no impact on guidance. We consider these hires to be the normal course of business and a positive indication of the growth prospects for our company. Let me now turn to the quarter’s financial results. As stated in today’s earnings release, second quarter 2012 FFO was $1.09 per share up 2.8% from the first quarter 2011 FFO of $1.06 per share, and up 6.9% from second quarter 2011 FFO of a $1.02 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, second quarter 2012 core FFO was $2.6 million lower than reported FFO or $1.07 per share. Adjustments to FFO in the second quarter included termination fees and other non-core revenues of approximately $7.8 million primarily consisting of a $4.1 million termination fee related to the Solyndra lease. It is important to note that we have recognized approximately $1.5 million in rent for this lease through March and receive the termination fee during the second quarter. We also received the $2.3 million fee associated with another lease termination for space that was subsequently released during the quarter. Lastly, we recognized a foreign currency gain of approximately $1.4 million associated with the repayment of inter-company loans dominated in sterling and Singapore dollars with proceeds from the $750 million term loan. Partially offsetting the non-core revenue items during the quarter were items that do not reflect ongoing expenses. These items consisted of $4.6 million in transaction expenses. The majority of which was related to the Sentrum acquisition, a $303,000 non-cash loss on early extinguishment associated with mortgage loans that were repaid during the quarter and the $337,000 in tenant expense adjustments related to the second lease termination. In addition, we incurred approximately $30 million to $31 million of debt extinguishment cost in the third quarter associated with the repayment of third=party debt in conjunction with the Sentrum acquisition. Adjusted funds from operation or AFFO for the second quarter of 2012 were $101.2 million, up from $100.5 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter of 2012 was 85.4%, up from 84.6% in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at quarter end of $182.2 million grew by 5.9% from $172 million in the previous quarter and by 17.6% from $155 million in the second quarter of 2011. Turning now to the income statement, net operating income increased by $7.1 million to $189.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $182.6 million last quarter. Overall, this increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions. Looking down the income statement, tenant reimbursements increased to $60.4 million in the second quarter from $57.9 million in the previous quarter primarily due to increases in utility reimbursements. The increase in other revenues reflects the termination fees previously described. On the expense side, rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased to $87.6 million from $79.8 million in the previous quarter primarily due to seasonal utility rate increases as well as lease commencements. The transaction and other expenses were discussed in my earlier comments regarding FFO. Our NOI margins remained in the mid 60% range. The slight fluctuation within this range is generally attributable to timing of recording a various one-time adjustments related to CAM reconciliations and other true-ups. The increase in equity and earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was due to the $2.3 million gain associated with disposition of 700 and 750 Central Expressway and office complex located in Santa Clara, California. This game was not included in FFO. Tax expense increased to $1.2 million from $721,000 in the previous quarter primarily due to deferred tax expenses related to our foreign operations. Lastly, preferred stock dividends increased to the issuance of Series F preferred stock in April, which was partially offset by the conversion of the Series C preferred stock. Finally, I would like to review recent capital market activities. Over the last few months, we have executed interest rate swaps converting approximately 75% of the five-year term loan balance from floating to fixed rate. As of today, we all in weighted average interest rate on the term loan is 2.29%. This is consistent with our strategy of minimizing our financial risk, while seeking to achieve the lowest possible cost of capital given market conditions. Year-to-date, we raised nearly $1.8 billion in new capital. Since our last call in connection with the Sentrum acquisition on July 2, we completed the sale of 11.5 million shares of common stock, which included 1.5 million shares issued upon the exercise of the underwriters’ option of purchase of additional shares at a price of $72.25 per share. Net proceeds totaled approximately $796.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Sentrum portfolio acquisition and the temporarily repaid borrowings under our global revolving credit facility. Given the amount of capital raise from the stock offering, it was not necessary to utilize the previously negotiated bridge loan to fund the portion of the acquisition price. Rather funds were drawn in sterling on our global revolving credit facility. In addition to ensure ample liquidity in sterling, euros, and U.S. dollars in future periods, we have exercised a portion of the global credit facilities accordion feature for $300 million equivalent. When it closes in the early August, the total commitment on our global revolving credit facility will be $1.8 billion. We have not sold stock for aftermarket equity distribution program since January. Year-to-date we have sold approximately 957,000 shares of common stock, where net proceeds totaling $62.7 million at an average price of $66.19 per share. We currently have approximately $54 million of availability remaining on the ATM program. Currently, we have $1.1 billion of immediate liquidity, which includes $88.1 million in short-term cash investments and funds has been drawn on our global revolving credit facility, but excluding the incremental $300 million of capacity from the exercise of our accordion. If this liquidity will fully utilize, we would remain in compliance with all covenants contained in the global revolving credit and term loan facilities, our prudential shelf facility, and other unsecured debt. During the quarter we repaid consolidated secured loans totaling $36.4 million and one unconsolidated secured loan totaling $25 million. In addition we have a $52.8 million secured loan that we expect to retire in early September. The weighted average interest rate on these three loans was 6.09%. In 2013, we have $224.4 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities, which we plan to retire initially with proceeds from the revolver. These activities are consistent with our practice of lowering the overall cost of debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.6 times at quarter end, down from 4.7 at the end of the first quarter. Pro forma for the Sentrum acquisition, net debt to adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain unchanged at 4.6 times. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was unchanged from the previous quarter of 3.4 times and a weighted average cost of debt including interest rate swaps was 4.67% at quarter end, down from 4.75% in the first quarter. Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to add that in response to many of your recommendations, we no longer plan to announce our leasing results ahead of earnings. We believe that combining the leasing and earnings announcements will enable us to provide you with important detailed information on our results and address questions regarding leasing during our quarterly call. As always, we welcome your comments and greatly appreciate your continued support. I’ll now turn the call back to Mike. Mike?
Michael Foust – Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bill. Turning first to our leasing results, during the quarter, we signed new leases totaling approximately 210,000 square feet. This includes 189,000 square feet of Turn-Key space of which 160,000 square feet was for leases signed in the U.S. And this is our highest quarterly volume of Turn-Key leases signed in the U.S. in over two years. We’re very encouraged by this increase and believe it reflects the strong demand we’re tracking in our major markets. As we have said on many occasions, lease rates vary market by market across U.S., as well as across our global markets. The amount of leases signed in the quarter also impacts overall average lease rates, particularly when the number of leases are signed in oversea markets or both lease rates and currency translation can impact results. This way we prefer focus on cash ROI targets between 11% and 14% for our spec leasing. We also look at our current average lease rates by market and by region and compare them to annual rates on a rolling 4 to 6 quarter basis, particularly, in the U.S. where the range is greatest across markets. We believe this provides an accurate – a more accurate view of lease rate trends. For example, we reported that for our Turn-Key Flex Solution in the second quarter. The average GAAP rental rate per square foot in the U.S. was approximately $149. Over the preceding four quarters, the average rental rates range from a low of $122 per square foot in the third quarter of 2011 to a high of $176 per square foot in the proceeding – preceding second quarter of 2011. On a rolling four quarter basis, the average lease rate was $154 per square foot, very consistent with this quarter’s average rental rate, an indicative of stable pricing for our Turn-Key product. Based on the stable pricing, increased leasing particularly in our U.S. portfolio for Turn-Key Solutions and our strong pipeline of prospects. We are confident that we will continue to capture significant share of the growing demand for data center space in U.S. and globally. Expansion of our co-location offering is on track as we continue to build our leasing and deployment team to address opportunities in certain of our Internet gateway data centers and other select DLR facilities. During the first half of 2012, we signed leases for co-lo space totaling $2.1 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. Turning to our lease renewal activity, we signed approximately 331,000 square feet of Turn-Key and PBB space and an average 14.8% increase in GAAP rents. This includes approximately 87,000 square feet of Turn-Key space and an average GAAP rental rate per square foot of $154, a 9.9% increase over the expiring GAAP rental rates. On the square foot basis, 72% of expiring Turn-Key space renewed in the second quarter with an average lease term of 88 months. In addition, we released fully 100% of the remaining Turn-Key space that was not renewed during the quarter. We also renewed approximately 244,000 square feet of powered base building space and rates had increased by almost 23% on a GAAP basis and lease terms at average are healthy at 124 months. Portfolio occupancy decreased to 93.5% in the second quarter compared to 94.8% in the first quarter. The decrease was driven by the termination of 225,000 square feet of non-technical space, the majority of which was Sulinda’s 183,000 square foot lease in Fremont, California. The same-store occupancy was similarly affected by the Sulinda termination and decreased to 92.9% from 94.4% in the first quarter. Despite the decrease in same-store occupancy, second quarter’s same-store NOI actually increased to $181.6 million, up 2.9% from $176.5 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we defined a same store NOI adjusted for a straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustment was $161.1 million in the second quarter, up from $159.7 million in the first quarter. We saw significant increase of demand for higher revenue and higher NOI turnkey space in many of our major markets. Moving east to west, in the New York, New Jersey Metro we are tracking nearly 47 megawatts of potential demand, up from 41 megawatts in the last quarter and 31 megawatts at our Investor Day in January. We believe this reflects pent-up demand largely from financial services, as well as from system integrators and managed services providers that support the financial vertical. This compares 23.8 megawatts of available built-up supply. We signed new leases on a number of our facilities in New York, New Jersey Metro during the quarter and commenced on the build-out of the additional turnkey space. We currently have 1.5 megawatts of supply available as well as the capacity to accommodate virtually any requirement with our existing redevelopment inventory in the region. In Northern Virginia, we are tracking over 40 megawatts of potential demand, up from 37.7 in the previous quarter. This compares to approximately 27 megawatts available supply that’s either built-out or currently under construction. With less than 500 kilowatts or 0.5 megawatt of available supply in our inventory, we broke ground during the quarter on a new 214,000 square foot facility on our Ashburn campus. The building shell and core is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012, followed by the first three 1125 KW data centers, Turn-Key datacenters to be delivered in the second quarter of 2013. Dallas remains very active market for us with limited available built-out supply. We have identified currently 29 megawatts of potential demand compared to about 8 megawatts of built-out supply. Our current supply consists of only 960 kilowatts or 0.96 megawatts of co-location space available at our 2323 Bryan facility in downtown Dallas. In response, during the quarter we broke ground on two new buildings on our Richardson campus. Each building will total approximately 120,000 square feet and will be capable of supporting 6.75 megawatts of IT capacity. The building shell and core is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012 followed by the first two 1125 KW Turn-Key data centers to be delivered in the first quarter of 2013. In Silicon Valley, demand has increased significantly for the second quarter in a row to nearly 27 megawatts of identified potential demand, and that’s up from about 12.8 megawatts on our last call. We are flexing the demand fluctuations in the Valley that are dramatic and sometimes be difficult to predict, but we are seeing a very positive trend here. We delivered a new Turn-Key pod during the quarter, bringing our total availability to approximately 1.7 megawatts, with 2.2 megawatts currently under construction. Like New Jersey, with our existing redevelopment inventory, we have the capacity to culminate virtually any requirement and are poised to develop new buildings with entitlements. I would like to conclude with few comments regarding the success for acquisitions program. We acquired three properties in the U.S. during the quarter, including two income producing assets and an average un-leveraged cash cap rate of 8.5%, in line with the higher end of our guidance. We also expanded our footprint in the greater Chicago market with the acquisition of the significant redevelopment property in the suburban metro. Internationally, we entered the very important Hong Kong market by completing the acquisition of a redevelopment facility with our joint venture partner, Savvis. And finally, we completed the acquisition of the Sentrum portfolio in London on July 11. With Sentrum not only do we acquire top five facilities of the very strong tenant base, but we welcome into the Digital Realty family a strong team of professionals who operate the portfolio. This expert team provides us with additional strength and scale to take advantage of the market opportunities in London and in Europe more effectively. Including the Sentrum properties, we expect our European portfolio to contribute approximately $187 million U.S. on an annualized rental revenue basis, representing almost 20% of our total portfolio. Our European portfolio consists of 18 properties across six major markets totaling 2.1 million square feet. Approximately 54% of which serves the important Greater London market. We currently are tracking nearly 55 megawatts of potential demand in London, which includes a number of fairly large requirements. This compares to 20.5 megawatts of supply, that’s currently either built or under construction. Including our 1 megawatt of available built-out space in the Sentrum portfolio, we have a total of 2.9 megawatts of currently built-out availability in London Metro at DLR. Similar to the U.S., the sale cycle can be long and difficult to predict selling to large international enterprises. However, we are very well-positioned to capture significant portion of this demand while the combination of our move-in ready space and construction-ready redevelopment inventory. This was clearly unusual quarter for us in terms of our acquisition activity and illustrates the expertise and capacity of our team to underwrite and negotiate complex transactions. These strategic acquisitions enable us to grow our business in new markets and expand our footprint in other legacy markets while providing attractive returns for our shareholders. We’re very proud of these accomplishments and attribute them to the talent and dedication of our team. We also would like to thank our shareholders for your continued support and look forward to sharing our growing success with you. This concludes my formal remarks. We’ll now open the call for your questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of George Auerbach.
George Auerbach: Great. Thanks very much. Hi, guys. I just wanted to touch on the slowdown in enterprise leasing. I guess, at sort of what point in the spring did you start to see those trends pull back, and maybe how was this experience different than past cycles, in dealing with the large tenants?
Michael Foust: Well, I don’t think we’ve seen anyone pull back in requirements. In fact, we are seeing the actual amount of enterprise requirements, especially in major markets like New York and London actually growing. There are large requirements in many cases. And so we see the potential – funnel of potential requirements actually as larger now than they were previously. So, – but it is saying a longer timeframe, when you are working with larger enterprises and that certainly offset by the leasing we are doing with smaller requirements, they maybe big companies and with the managed services and cloud providers, who are often times, move more quickly than some of the larger enterprises.
George Auerbach: I guess two follow-ups. First, I guess maybe the question should have been, at what point do you see the sales cycle start to lengthen out, maybe a demand issue, it’s more on the timing from discussions to signings? At what point did tenants start to become more hesitant to sign leases? And also, it sounds like the mix of tenants is changing a bit more – more corporate than managed services. Are there any tenants within the corporate side that you see are being a bit more skittish or cautious at this time?
Michael Foust: No. On the contrary, we’re seeing more potential demand from the large enterprise users, especially looking to create more efficiencies and lower their operating costs, often times looking to get the data centers out of high-rise office buildings or suburban office locations into proper mission-critical facilities that have the power backup, mechanical system backup, and resiliency that they require and also be to allow them to be able to expand as I need to expand. So, I’d say it’s more and this is kind of real – I’m putting my finger in the air here as to timeframe, so maybe where we saw a 6 to 9-month timeframes. Those timeframes are can be 6 to 12 months working with customers. And that’s a guess, but yeah, we are seeing larger potential requirements that we are almost uniquely positioned to acquire, because we have the professional team with the engineering staff, the design staff, construction, technical operations facility staff. So, we are really well-positioned to serve these large customers.
George Auerbach: Okay. And I guess just last, Bill, on the straight line rent, it went from $15 million change to $19 million and change this quarter. Is that a better run rate to use going forward or was that impacted by the Solyndra lease termination?
Bill Stein: That wouldn’t have been affected by the Solyndra lease termination. I think there might have been one or two deals in the quarter that had some free rent that affected the free rent in the quarter.
George Auerbach: So, we should expect sort of burn down towards $15 million again?
Bill Stein: I think that $15 million is better – better rate.
George Auerbach: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman.
Jamie Feldman: Great, thank you. Focusing on the terminations for a minute, I know you had mentioned Solyndra, can you first talk about the plans for that space, I think you said non-technical. But then I guess bigger picture, what are you seeing in terms of your actual technical tenants taking lease terminations and moving out and kind of where are they going if anywhere, and in what markets?
Michael Foust: Sure. For the – regarding Solyndra, that’s a two building property, very highly improved clean room manufacturing. And so they are pretty highly improved facilities. So, we think that this is an attractive facility either sell to a user or lease to someone in Silicon Valley who can utilize this kind of space. So, we think this is a pretty valuable space and we can be positioned to lease that out at very competitive rates for the improvements. In terms of other, we have very, very few terminations. I mean, I think, we had one or two this quarter of data center tenants and those that we initiated those in order to put in longer term tenants. One was a – we have a tenant in Dallas who wasn’t fully utilizing their space, and we had no space in Dallas. And we had another, a brand new customer who wanted to lease space with us in Dallas on a ten-year basis. We were able to trade out two years remaining for a ten-year lease at significantly higher overall rents. So, I give credit to our asset management team for being really creative and being able to take advantage of – and the work to negotiate really interesting deals and allow us to add to the overall value of the portfolio, pretty significantly in that case. So, it’s not very typical that we would do that, but where we can add significant value to the asset, we’ll be creative about doing those kinds of transactions.
Jamie Feldman: Yeah. I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is are you seeing instances that in certain markets where tenants are just trying to – or competitors are trying to poach tenants with a more attractive options?
Michael Foust: No. No, that’s rarely the case. It’s very expensive and awkward in most cases for customers to move. The switching costs in other words are high and it’s very disruptive to operations. And also tenants have had a very good operating history with us and that five, nines of uptime represents a very high level of resiliency and security in the operation. So, we continue to have a very high level of renewals.
Bill Stein: Jamie, just to be clear to, the facility in the East Bay and Fremont that we leased to Solyndra is not a data center. It was a not data center. It was owned by GI Partners prior the IPO. So, it’s a legacy property. And I think at this point most it’s likely to be disposed.
Jamie Feldman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if we could from a housekeeping perspective get what the backlog was at the end of Q1. And then in terms of the acquisition of Sentrum, I was wondering if you could give us a sense as to what the run rate revenue was out of that asset. And just I’m trying to understand how the inclusion of that might change the margin profile. And in terms of the lease commencements looking forward, are any – is there any expectation of new lease commencements within that asset? Thank you.
Michael Foust: Sure. Focusing on Sentrum, actually the operating margins are high in that portfolio. There are very efficient buildings. So, while our current NOI margin in our broader portfolio is in the mid-60s. Off the top of my head, I believe that Sentrum NOI margin is in the mid-70s I believe. But I would have to go back and get the exact number. But it’s definitely higher than in the rest of our portfolio, so definitely have a positive uptick in that regard. We are clearly expecting to achieve additional leasing especially at the Woking property, which is the largest of the three buildings and the latest one to come online were we have potentially a couple of 100,000 square feet of space that we can build out for four new users and there is definitely a funnel of customers for that space with whom we are in discussions currently. I have to go back and look at what the revenue – operating revenue was from the Sentrum, I don’t have that number at the tip of my figures.
Bill Stein: I think it’s about 108.5, 108.5.
Michael Foust: U.S.?
Bill Stein: Yes, U.S. dollar.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great, I guess with my question about the leasing was, is that you made an adjustment here on your lease commencements expectation for the year. I think you did a very nice job of explaining that, but I am wondering as the number came down if there was any add back for particularly lease commencement in Sentrum so, trying to get like a sort of organic-to-organic compare?
Michael Foust: Yeah. No, we have not added any potential from Sentrum.
Bill Stein: Yeah, there is no Sentrum in the forecast right now.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Alright, super, thanks a lot. I appreciate taking the questions.
Michael Foust: Thank you, Jon, though we do have activity on that aspect.
Jonathan Schildkraut: I understand.
Michael Foust: It just wasn’t, it wasn’t part of forecasting process because of when it closed, it probably will be in the next quarter.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks and good morning out there. Bill, could you clarify you said in your guidance there is $0.08 contribution from Sentrum and the larger than originally anticipated equity offering so, it’s those two factors combined assuming the rest of the portfolio is financed on the line would contribute to $0.08 contribution for the second half. Is that the way to think about it?
Bill Stein: That’s right, I totally understand your question, but…
Jordan Sadler: How do you get the $0.08 contribution?
Bill Stein: We upsize the equity offering from $600 million to $800 million so, the $0.08 reflects the additional $200 million of equity that was raised so, they will probably be another – probably $0.10 of accretion if we had issued just a $600 million worth of equity.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
Bill Stein: Is that your question?
Jordan Sadler: Yeah, I mean the portfolio, so basically if you are layering from modeling perspective you are layering that in that $1.1 billion acquisition. It will be financed with an $800 million net equity offering and the rest of the financing would be drawn off the line, the credit or the term loan?
Bill Stein: That the line of credit. That’s fine, I think as a practical matter sometime in the fourth quarter probably mid-quarter we will be going to market in the sterling bond market to hopefully issue 10-year debt and I think the rates will be same it was at least that’s what they look like today.
Jordan Sadler: And what size would be an all euro your offering there be, you think.
Bill Stein: Yeah, I think a minimum just for liquidity would be £250 million.
Jordan Sadler: £250 million, and the other question I would have, this is a follow-up there, is just on the offering I’m curious what the remaining capital requirement are for the year in terms of the remaining capital spend as well as any additional acquisitions you have keyed up.
Bill Stein: There are a couple of acquisitions that I guess it’s fair to say under our LOI. So, we would hope that they would close and I think there are roughly a $100 million maybe a little more than $100 million and the CapEx I think.
Jordan Sadler: Of the seven – you got 700 and 900 in the guidance, how much is left to spend there?
Bill Stein: I would just assume that half has been spent to-date, take the midpoint 800.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And that would be financed how? You just on the line of credit you think?
Bill Stein: Off the line initially, I mean that the debt to EBITDA as I said – is in pretty good shape, so, I don’t see any additional equity this year unless we do another large portfolio acquisition. So, it would be off the line and then a combination of various fixed income instrument, so sterling bonds potentially U.S. bonds as we have enough balance on the revolver. And the preferred stock market continues to look attractive as well, the rates on the preferred stock.
Jordan Sadler: That’s helpful, thank you. Lastly on the leverage target, you’re trying to stay under five times debt to EBITDA or 5.5?
Bill Stein: We’re targeting 5 to 5.5, I mean we’re okay, but we’re happy to be in the mid 4s as well.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you.
Bill Stein: Yep.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson.
Rob Stevenson: Hi good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about the joint venture acquisition in Hong Kong with Savvis? What you guys spent on that and what you guys anticipate spending on the redevelopment. And whether or not you’re looking to do additional projects with them in Asia as well?
Michael Foust: Sure. The Hong Kong, as you might guess is really one of the major financial hubs of the world and thus one of the major financial datacenter markets in the world. So, we see significant opportunity there with Savvis as our partner. So, Savvis can deliver over the managed services and cloud services out of the datacenter, which are definitely in high demand and we can also be leasing space on a more wholesale basis, if you will to the enterprise. And we’re essentially a 50-50 joint venture with them. Certainly, we welcome the opportunity to do more in the region on that basis and we think that’s going to be a really great project for us, we’re redeveloping an existing industrial building and I think we’re going to even be able to add on more power capacity by adding another load to the building, which is a real track of value add opportunity for us that our team is able to put together and working to finalize the entitlements of permit on that. Overall, we’re not giving out the amounts of budgets on this project specifically it is a bit proprietary at this point and also the fact that we are in a joint venture with Savvis. We want to be a cognizant of their sensitivities around disclosing information from the joint venture. So, at some point we will provide more details on this project as we’re about to bring forward the first part for lease.
Rob Stevenson:  I guess a question is what at this point is the size when you add the floor and do everything else, what in terms of square foot or megawatts is that asset expected to be full build out.
Michael Foust: Yeah, I think we’ll be able to get somewhere between 6 and 7 megawatts of IT load in that facility.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And is construction cost in that market similar to Singapore?
Michael Foust: Cost maybe a little bit less in Hong Kong on the actual construction. Land is always a challenge – we’re on long-term ground lease, but we may be a little more efficient on development costs than in Singapore.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then just lastly, while we’re in Asia, you talked about what – where leasing there in Singapore is going relative to expectations?
Michael Foust: Yeah, we’re actually a little bit ahead of our original pro forma timelines. We’re about 65% leased on the data center, the Jurong township data center. And really good – really good funnel of prospective tenants there and as it my guess, similar to the tenants that we’ve already signed up and it’s a nice mixture of international financial institutions as well as the international managed services and some network providers as well. So, we are very bullish on the Singapore market. I think between Singapore some of new leasing prospects in both, Sydney and Melbourne, Hong Kong, Asia-Pac, is going to be a really exciting region for us and we’ll have a good material addition to our growth in the coming years.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman.
Michael Bilerman: Hi, good morning there. I’m on the phone with many Quarterman as well. Can you just provide a little bit more color, so you talked about $6 million to $10 million or I guess $0.05 to $0.08, which would be the dilution effect away from the commenced leases being pushed out? And then you’re looking at the amount of commenced dollars, you reduced the range to a midpoint of 150, that was from 162.5, and that's revenue. So, the NOI impact on an annualized basis would only be like $8.5 million to $9 million bucks. And so, I'm trying to figure out how guidance would go down by so much, if that's all that was just – that’s been pushed out completely. How much was it a delay in the second half commencements versus a delay in the first half commencements that didn't start as you thought you would, right. So, you did $56 million in the first half, did you think you we're going to do 70, and you just sort of fell short versus now you are expecting to do 94 of annualized revenue commencements in the second half of which you already have 41 of backlog and that’s down from 107, when does that 94 start? Did you think it was going to start at the end of the third quarter and now it’s going to start all at the end of the fourth quarter? Can you sort of just bridge all the numbers together?
Bill Stein: Well, firstly all of that it is in the second quarter or second half, I'm sorry not the first half. There was one deal in the first half that delayed, that actually we thought was going to commence last year, and that was with a large bank, much like your own, but not yours. I would say virtually all of it is second half.
Michael Bilerman: And so how do you – how do you reduce FFO by $6 million to $10 million push out $13 million of commencements on an annualized basis of revenue. How much of a delay shift is this causing and maybe you can breakdown that $94 million in terms of when does it commence between quarter and the timing in the quarter?
Bill Stein: I don’t have that handy in terms of when in the quarter and I can’t really tell you what the specific delay is for these commenced leases, but this was bottoms up approach.
Michael Bilerman: But it sounds like…
Bill Stein: Yeah.
Michael Foust: I think it’s important note, the amount of increase year-over-year has been pretty steady and so the revenue growth and earnings growth continues to be good and it might be delay and it might be our people fully taking account the additional shares and the timing of that.
Michael Bilerman: I know, but if that is being reduced for the commencements by $8 million at the midpoint, $8 million right, so $12 million of annualized – of impact from a revenue perspective for the full year that would imply significant push back of what these start commenced leases are or that you’ve baked in more of a cushion and saying $6 million to $10 million of FFO because I’m just having a hard time from – if you’ve only pushed out $13 million of commenced leases things must have been really delayed until late into the year?
Bill Stein: It is delayed until late in the year. Make sure, you take by the way the margins, it’s about 65%.
Michael Bilerman: Right. I grossed out the FFO impact for 65%. And how much more backlog you mentioned $41 million backlog for the second half, how much more backlog you assigned, but not commenced going forward into ‘13 and ‘14?
Bill Stein: About $26 million for 2013.
Michael Bilerman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin.
Jonathan Atkin: I wanted to circle back a little bit on that segue from Sentrum into kind of Europe. Europe, I think is 80% – 50% or more way into the UK, and I wondered if you feel like that’s the right mix or if there are other markets that you begin to focus on from an M&A or new development perspective? And then with respect to Asia, you commented how strong the demand is and I wondered if you could share some perspectives on whether you’ve seen any change in the competitive environment?
Michael Foust: Sure. Well, in Europe we always focused on these major markets, where we see a lot of enterprise activity and activity from the IT services world. Certainly in our minds, right now, London and Amsterdam, and to some extent, Dublin, because of all the international companies, many U.S. companies in Dublin are interesting places for data center. Certainly, London being the largest potential market, Amsterdam next, Dublin after that of markets that we are in, where we see potential for growth. Paris, I think will be a good market. We are taking it more slowly. We are almost – we are virtually fully let in Paris. We’re going to take a little bit slower tact on that market to see how things progress economically over the second half of the year, but Paris is a nice market, because there is a lot corporate entities, including financials, but not necessarily financials that make up the typical marketplace there. One market that we are not in, that we would like to be in would be Frankfurt. And that common theme of very important financial center, where we are seeing demand for data centers, especially as the financial institutions are consolidating out of office buildings, out of older facilities that they are not capable of expanding, and so Frankfurt would be a very interesting market that we are not in that we would like to be in Europe. Asia-Pac, like most markets, it’s, from a competitive perspective, it’s very fragmented. You don’t have, while these are mature economic markets, they are not mature from a data center perspective, so I think we have a good early mover advantage in these markets, especially being positioned as we are to be able to finance and execute instantly on these very large projects without having to look for secured debt, and that puts us in a competitive advantage, especially vis-à-vis you’re more kind of private developer type competitors that pop-up market-by-markets. So, we think we’re in a very good position both from spec leasing perspective with spec projects as well as very well-positioned for potential build-to-suit opportunities with some of these larger institutions.
Jonathan Atkin: And then just on the colo business, I know that’s non-core but can you share which markets you are doing the most business in that line?
Michael Foust: Sure. San Francisco is the very important market for us. Dallas is growing. St Louis, I think as a regional market, we are going to see a lot of traction there. In Boston and New York Metro, those would be the most active markets where we are in. As a reminder, we are doing colo in existing buildings of ours that are network-rich buildings, usually the internet gateways, like in Dallas, 2323 Bryan, where we have space and power capacity and network capacity.
Jonathan Atkin: And then, can you talk about the average footprint in your core wholesale business, the average size or requirement you are bringing in and do that very significantly by market?
Michael Foust: Yeah. I mean – and this is a very rough qualitative comment. We are seeing 1 to 2 megawatts to start is pretty typical. That might be 10,000 to 20,000 feet maybe a little larger on a rentable square foot basis, but boy, it can run the gamut of 5,000 feet to 30, 40, 50. But I would say if there was kind of a median probably around that 1 to 2 megawatts.
Jonathan Atkin: Are there geographic trends that you could kind of point to in terms of where it could falls at the lower end versus the larger end of that range?
Michael Foust: Not really.
Jonathan Atkin: Great, thank you very much.
Michael Foust: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question will come from the line of Paul Morgan.
Paul Morgan: Hi, good morning. Just on the development CapEx spend, I mean you still have the same range for the year, we’ve only got five months left to get for the $700 million to $900 million, I mean, is there any particular reason for having the same range? Is any of the gap between bottom and the high end of the range related to the kind of the least commencement timing issues or is it anything else?
Michael Foust: No. I think it’s just kind of the way the construction projects, development projects have been commenced and scheduled. I don’t think it’s not tied directly to leasing.
Paul Morgan: There is no more visibility now.
Michael Foust: Well, in many cases, we are developing product, so we have product to lease and for revenues next year is a lot of what we are up to.
Paul Morgan: I guess another way to think is it’s kind of what would make you kind of hit the high end as opposed to the low end or are there particular markets or kind of leasing that would be a catalyst for the need for future space?
Michael Foust: I think it’s more the how fast our people are deploying their current budgets.
Paul Morgan: Okay. And then just kind of one more last hit at the sales cycle issue, you mentioned something about financials and I just wondered if you could maybe characterize – I mean, is the longer duration of the decision process concentrated in a vertical? I mean, you mentioned the enterprise, about kind of within enterprise, I mean, how much of it could be related to financials and just kind of the broader issues in that vertical versus a just a broader trend of more complex deals in longer planning horizon?
Michael Foust: I think it’s a latter. I think it’s more general with large enterprises. There is a lot of different constituents, because it’s not just the rent, it’s not just the lease, it’s the IT applications, their design, network, you’ve got budgets coming from different departments often times into these projects and because of the high ticket, especially after the recession, capital expenditures and operating expenditures are being scrutinized at higher and highest levels of organizations these days. So, even if the budget is already in place, there is often times additional approvals, in many times at the board level, even with those large, very large organizations, because these are so impactful and they are such important strategic decisions that there is often times a lot of different departments working on these and that’s where it comes into play. The fact that we have a dedicated leasing team that’s focused on working with the enterprises, working with the IT departments, and the treasury CFO office that puts us in such a good position to win these types of large important deals, because we have made the big investment and we have made the big investment on our engineering and design teams, because this is very much a solution sale, consultative sale. So, our investment in our professional staff and infrastructure positions us really well to meet this – what we see as a growing funnel of potential demand from the enterprises and especially its financial institutions.
Paul Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Foust for closing remarks.
Michael Foust – Chief Executive Officer: Thank you everyone and thank you for your time and attention today. And I just want to reiterate the confidence and – that we have as a management team and the good continued secular growth in our markets and demand for our data center product and I want to thank our team members for another job well done in a very good quarter in the second quarter of this year. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

Questions will be limited to one per caller to manage it in a timely manner. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust: Great. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call, everyone. I will begin my remarks today with an overview of our operating results, followed by a brief review of our markets and current acquisition and development activities. Following my prepared comments, Bill Stein will go through our financial results.  Following our record leasing results in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had a relatively modest first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. As I have previously mentioned, our leasing activity tends to be seasonal with stronger results often occurring later in the year. During the quarter, we signed 94,000 square feet of Turn-Key space at an average lease rate of $163 per square foot, with an average rate for U.S. Turn-Key leases at $136 per square foot. Over the past 5 quarters, average rental rates per square foot for Turn-Key in the U.S. have ranged from between $122 to $176 per square foot.  Rental rates have historically varied by building and by market and by customer application. Therefore, we do not feel that the sample size of lease in the first quarter indicates a Turn-Key in overall Turn-Key lease rates.  Excluding colocation, the average term for leases signed in the first quarter for Datacenter space was 148 months or 12.7 years, exceeding our average range of 7 to 10 years for the second straight quarter.  Other leasing highlights during the quarter include a signed lease for an entire 47,000 square foot building at our Datacenter Park Dallas property in Dallas, which continues to be a very good market for us. The building was leased on a PBB basis to a leading information management and data security company.  On the West Coast, we signed new leases in San Francisco and Los Angeles with one of our top 10 customers, supporting the growth of their colocation interconnection business.  In London, we continued to see steep demand with 2 new leases signed at our Redhill facility, where we are now nearly fully leased. In addition, we're on track to complete the first phase of the redevelopment of our Chessington property later this year in suburban London.  In Asia-Pacific, we signed 2 new leases at our Singapore property with a strong funnel of prospects for the balance of the building. We've also signed our first lease in Hong Kong and plan to issue a press release on this in the coming weeks.  In addition to the current Build-to-Suit projects underway, we're actively pursuing a number of new opportunities. Because of their size and complexity, the timing in these deals tend to be lumpy. Leveraging our experience in size selection acquisitions, building design and construction management, our dedicated Build-to-Suit team is focused on working closely with prospective customers to create tailored data center solution to meet their specific requirements.  We're also expanding our co-location offering in certain of our Internet gateway data centers and other select DLR facilities. Our goal is to convert underutilized space and facilities where we believe we can achieve a higher ROI if converted to co-location space. This space is typically located in buildings and markets that are currently under-served.  Turning to our lease renewal activity. We're quite pleased with our continued success, signing over 264,000 square feet of space for an average of 2% increase in GAAP rents.  Rentals included approximately 78,000 square feet of Turn-Key space, an average GAAP rental rate per square foot of $186. This compares to the $187 per square foot for the expiring leases. The small $1 per square foot decrease was primarily driven by 2 leases that renewed at a property we acquired in 2010 that had in place above market rents. The new rates yield very attractive returns on this asset.  We also renewed approximately 120,000 square feet of Powered Base Building space at rates that increased by 20.5% on a GAAP basis.  Overall, tenant retention remains very high. On a square foot basis, 95% of expiring Turn-Key space renewed in the first quarter. On a revenue basis, Turn-Key leases renewed at approximately 96% of GAAP, with an average lease term of 104 months. Again, on a square foot basis, 100% of expiring Powered Base Building leases renewed in the quarter at over 120% of GAAP rents, with an average lease term of 82 months.  Portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 94.8% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we added over 1 million square feet of space to the portfolio through our acquisitions and development programs, which includes 70 PODs in Singapore and new space in Phoenix, arguably 2 of our strongest markets for new prospects, along with Dallas.  Same-store occupancy was relatively unchanged at 94.4% compared to 94.6% in the fourth quarter. First quarter same-store NOI increased to $176.5 million, up 2.4% from $172.4 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for noncash purchase accounting adjustments, was $159.7 million in the first quarter, up 2.4% from $155.9 million in the third quarter.  We continue to track over 2 million square feet of prospective data center demand across our active markets.  Along with positive absorption, our pipeline is consistent with a steady stream of new customer requirements we see coming to the market. Many of these requirements come from customers new to DLR. While the sales cycle with the new customer is typically longer, the investment time in securing new logos has historically proved significant -- provided us with significant long-term growth opportunity for our businesses. Many of these new customers end up expanding in multiple locations with us.  I will now briefly run through some of the supply/demand statistics we're tracking in a few of our major U.S. markets, which we received the most questions. As you know, our strategy is to maintain a disciplined approach to managing inventory market-by-market by utilizing our flexible POD Architecture that's designed to deliver data center space in approximately 1 to 2-megawatt increments. This enabled us to meet customer just-in-time requirements across our global portfolio while limiting our financial exposure in any one market.  Moving east to west. In the New York, New Jersey Metro, we're tracking nearly 41 million megawatts of potential demand. That's an increase of 10 megawatts from what we were tracking last quarter. We believe this reflects pent-up demand from financial services, as well as system integrators and managed services cloud providers that support the financial vertical. As a matter of fact, the financial vertical represents over 18% of our average base rents today. This compares with approximately 25.8 megawatts of available supply that's either built out or currently under construction in the market.  At DLR New Jersey/New York exposure buildout space remains relatively small with 3 Turn-Key PODs, about 3.5 megawatts currently available. However, we do have the capability to accommodate virtually any requirement with our existing redevelopment inventory that we're poised to develop with entitlements.  In Northern Virginia, we're tracking approximately 37.7 megawatts of current potential demand. This compares to approximately 35.9 megawatts of available supply that's either built out or under construction. In our view, Northern Virginia's currently the most comparative market in the country. As a result, we're seeing some downward pressure on rent in that area. Again, we have a very manageable current exposure in this market with 3.9 megawatts of available built out supply in the digital portfolio.  As I mentioned earlier, Dallas continues to be a very active market for us, limited available built out supply. We've identified approximately 21.2 megawatts of demand compared to about 8.7 megawatts of new built out supply.  Finally, in Silicon Valley, we're currently tracking 12.8 megawatts of demand, which is up significantly from the 3.6 megawatts we discussed in our last call. This increase is consistent with our experience with the growth of IT and Internet enterprise customers in the Valley, which can be dramatic and difficult to predict. Our exposure at present is very manageable with just under 4 megawatts of available supply, including 3.5 megawatts we have under construction currently.  Turning to our acquisitions program. We acquired the large Convergence data center and office campus in Lewisville, Texas and the DFW Metroplex during the quarter. This property consists of over 819,000 square feet, it's 99% leased and it presents attractive features and new development potential with excess entitled land and utility substation under its construction.  We also announced earlier this month that we are under contract to acquire our first property in Hong Kong, a very robust yet quite under-served global market. And we're doing this with our joint venture partner, Savvis. We plan to begin construction following the closing of the acquisition expected to occur in June with completion of the first PODs expected early in the second quarter of 2013.  We have a strong pipeline of additional acquisitions. They're in various stages of negotiation for both income-producing, as well as development properties.  As you know, our development program is a very important component of our business that fills much of our growth. During the first quarter, we completed approximately 153,000 square feet of turnkey facilities with over 35% pre-leased and 53,000 square feet of Powered Base Building that was 100% leased.  At quarter-end, we are under construction on turnkey space, totaling about 485,000 square feet. This includes 326,000 square feet in the U.S., 44,000 square feet in Europe and approximately 114,000 square feet in Singapore and Australia. Approximately 25% of this space-under-construction's pre-leased.  For Powered Base Building space, we're under construction at about 638,000 square feet, including 503,000 square feet in the U.S., 48,000 square feet in Asia-Pac and 88,000 square feet under construction in Europe, which includes the new Chessington redevelopment property in London that we acquired in third quarter of 2011.  Lastly, we had approximately 275,000 square feet of Build-to-Suit space under construction in the U.S., which is 100% pre-leased.  Including the preconstruction work in common area building improvements, the total construction work-in-progress invested in the first quarter was $305 million. The estimated cost to complete ongoing March 31 work-in-progress was $447 million.  This concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein.
A. William Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our financial strategy and capital markets activity and then discuss our financial performance and guidance.  Last week, we announced the closing of a USD $750 million equivalent unsecured multicurrency term loan, which can be increased by $100 million to $850 million. It matures in April 2017 and includes the ability to borrow in U.S. dollar, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Hong Kong dollar, as well as euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen denominations.  We accessed the bank term loan markets to take advantage of attractive 5-year borrowing interest rates and to place debt on foreign subsidiaries, which allows us to naturally hedge our growing international balance sheet. In line with our overall capital strategy, the term loan also enhances our financial flexibility to accommodate our growing global investment program and to provide immediate liquidity for potential acquisitions.  We've made an initial draw of USD $525 million equivalent to U.S. dollars, Singapore and Australian dollars, as well as British pound sterling and euros, and have up to 90 days to draw the remaining $225 million. Over the next several months, we expect to execute interest rate swaps to hedge at least half of our total exposure.  Including the term loan, year-to-date, we've raised nearly $989 million of new capital. Additional financings include the 6 5/8 series cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering of 7.3 million shares in April, raising net proceeds of $175.8 million, which is the lowest yielding perpetual preferred stock that the company has ever issued, and the issuance of 957,000 shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity distribution program, with net proceeds totaling $262.7 million at an average price of $66.19.  All of these shares were issued in January, prior to our last earnings call. We currently have approximately $54 million of availability remaining on the ATM program.  We have $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity, which includes $68 million in short-term investments, funds that can be drawn on our global revolving credit facility and the delayed draw on the term loan. If these liquidity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance, with all covenants contained in the global revolving credit and term loan facilities of Prudential Shelf Facility and other unsecured debt.  During the quarter, we paid up 2 European secured loans totaling $73.4 million. We have $79.5 million of remaining principal amortization and debt maturities in 2012. This includes a $16 million secured loan that we expect to retire this week, as well as a $52.8 million secured loan that we expect to retire in September. In 2013, we have $247.6 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities unsecured debt, which we plan to retire with proceeds from the revolver. These activities are consistent with our practice of lowering overall cost of debt.  As of the end of the day yesterday, the balance on our $1.5 billion global revolving credit facility was $20.7 million, and we held unrestricted cash of $68 million.  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.7x at quarter-end, up from 4.4x at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Pro forma for the recently issued preferred equity net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.6x. This increase is due to a higher level of borrowings on our global credit facility. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio increased to 3.4x at the end of the first quarter compared to 3.2x in the previous quarter.  Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, first quarter 2000 (sic) [2012] FFO was $1.06 per share, up 3.9% from the fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 of $1.02 per share.  Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, first quarter 2012 core FFO was $677,000 higher than reported FFO or essentially unchanged at $1.06 per share. This reflects a 2.9% increase from fourth quarter 2011 core FFO of $1.03 per share.  Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, for the first quarter of 2012 was $102.8 million, up over 8% from $94.9 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter of 2012 was 82.8%, up from 81.9% the last quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA at quarter-end of $172 million grew by 5% from $163.6 million last quarter and by 15% from $150.1 million in the first quarter of 2011.  Turning now to the income statement. Net operating income increased by $9.5 million to $182.6 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $173.1 million last quarter. This increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions. As we discussed on our last quarter, fourth quarter 2011 property taxes included a favorable tax assessment, a portion of which was passed on to tenants.  G&A increased by 14.4% to $14.3 million in the first quarter compared to $12.5 million last quarter, primarily due to 2011 year-end accrual adjustments of $1.4 million, which lowered the fourth quarter 2011 run rate.  Tax expense was $721,000 in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a tax benefit in the previous quarter of $1.2 million. This increase of $1.9 million was primarily due to the fourth quarter true-up of about $1.8 million of deferred taxes relating to foreign operations and taxable REIT subsidiary activities.  Finally, we are not revising our 2012 FFO guidance range of $4.34 to $4.40, or its underlying assumptions.  While we do not give quarterly guidance, I would like to remind you that I discussed at our Investor Day in January that we expect growth in 2012 recognized revenue, NOI and FFO resulting from new leasing to be back-end loaded in the year. Also, because of the success of our recent term loan and the preferred equity offering, we do not expect to issue additional capital in 2012. Most of our acquisitions volume exceeds our current guidance assumption of $300 million to $400 million.  Our 2012 outlook remains positive. A combination of our leasing funnel, investment opportunities and access to attractively priced capital make us well positioned to capture a variety of market opportunities and we are tracking worldwide in order to increase shareholder value.  We look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months and quarters ahead.  This concludes our formal remarks. Mike and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I'm just -- I wanted to follow up on the bit about acquisitions in the pipeline. Mike, it sounds like it's strong both on the income side and otherwise. I'm curious if you would have interest at the enterprise level. It's been telegraphed that Cincinnati Bell is looking to monetize CyrusOne, and I know it's in different markets. I'm wondering if that would even be on the radar for you guys?
Michael F. Foust: Well, we're always looking at opportunities both on individual assets, portfolio, corporate levels. So we're definitely open to any opportunity. Our understanding is that they're pursuing an IPO for the CyrusOne division, so we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just a follow-up, any -- can you maybe just give us a little bit of color on the recent departure of the Head of Sales and has -- there's been any disruption in leasing at all as a result of sort of that transition?
Michael F. Foust: No, no disruption at all. Yes, we're fortunate that we have a very strong team of leaders and -- in place, as well as the -- we have the local sales team and our listing brokers and asset managers who all work together. So we don't expect to skip a beat in that regard. I mean, we hate to see Brent leave, great guy. But the organization moves on because we have built a very deep organization here.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Did he have a non-compete?
Michael F. Foust: No.
A. William Stein: Non-compete aren't enforceable in California, Jordan. It's a matter of public policy.
Michael F. Foust: And law.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Caton, Morgan Stanley.
Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I have a question on the redevelopment pipeline, 2 parter. First, in Boston, you started -- as you mentioned last time that you're expanding your Needham project. Can you give us more detail on that? And then second, you had talked about wanting to expand activities in Chicago on the last call as well, and wondered if you're pursuing development or redevelopment opportunities that may show up in the future or is that going to be more like an acquisition?
Michael F. Foust: Sure, yes. The Needham site is underway. In fact, I was just out there week before last and we're going full bore. I believe we'll be delivering somewhere approximately 150,000 square feet of new construction in that facility and that will nicely augment the existing operating site there in Needham. So we're very excited about that market. And in Chicago, we're definitely pursuing opportunities there to create more product for the customer demand that we're seeing in the Chicago market, so we are actively pursuing development opportunities in that area.
Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just to follow-up on Boston, what type of customer verticals are you servicing in Needham? And is there anything specific or is it general?
Michael F. Foust: Boston is a good regional market. So the great majority of your demand is coming from New England and Boston region. So it's financial services, including large money managers, banks, life companies, healthcare -- you have such a strong healthcare market in that area -- and other corporate headquarter types in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Hilmoe, UBS.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, just given the capital plan in terms of acquisitions and development, can you talk a little bit about where you expect the focus to be over the next few years, beyond what's in the current pipeline whether it's domestic, overseas? And kind of what you expect the portfolio to look like kind of on a pro forma basis?
Michael F. Foust: Well, we'll continue to focus on a combination deploying capital. It's difficult to look out beyond the next 24 months specifically, but certainly, the major markets in the U.S. where we're seeing continued demand, and that would be places like New Jersey, Dallas, Phoenix, Bay Area, Boston, Chicago -- I mean, these are all the, among others, the important markets for us. So I think you'll continue to see the majority of growth because the United States is so large with so many markets. But you'll see increased volumes certainly in Asia-Pac. We're quite excited about the Australian markets we're in: Sydney and Melbourne. We think Singapore has very good long-term potential for us. We think Hong Kong has very long-term potential for us. So I think you'll see us deploying significant capital in those areas. And we'll selectively continue participating in the major markets in Europe and especially London, Paris, Dublin and Amsterdam in particular will continue to be areas of focus for us.
Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And can you quickly -- can you just give the cash release in spreads and assigned turnkey notes in the quarter?
Michael F. Foust: We've been focusing on the GAAP and we want to be consistent and keep giving out the GAAP numbers, but I don't have the cash at my fingertips.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman, Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: It's Manny here with Michael. Just a couple of questions for you. In Hong Kong, I know previously you had discussed buying in-place assets and now you've gone in this JV to do a development, just wondering if that's a change in strategy or just taking the opportunity do something with Savvis?
Michael F. Foust: No, this is actually exactly the strategy we've been pursuing to find existing building that has the power and the fiber available that we could redevelop as data center space. So actually this is -- what we've been pursuing for the last couple of years defined that kind of an asset would be really adaptable for data center use. And the park that we're in is really attractive place because of the significant amount of power that's available and the tremendous fiber access and other corporate data centers, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, et cetera. So it's really a very attractive location and what we've had our eye on for some time.
Emmanuel Korchman: Okay. And then turning to the U.S. for a second, if we look at the supply that you have in any given market, how would you classify that SME? Is it more sensitive to price and if you price it correctly you have a tenant that would come in and take in any of that space or is it really a demand -- a trigger thing from the tenant where if they need the space they'll come and pay whatever price you're asking for?
Michael F. Foust: Well, I wouldn't say -- I'd say it's kind of customer demand is specific to markets. So in different markets, no surprise New York/New Jersey is very heavily financial service oriented. Silicon Valley is very tech, social networking oriented. Dallas, you've got a wide range of corporate enterprise, a number of different verticals, as well as IT services in there. So it really just depends on the particular market and the mix of customer demand. And then, pricing is generally driven by supply and demand dynamics and relationships.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers, RBC Market.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: A question for you on the colocation business. With regard to your 2012 Investor Day presentation, you had a slide in there, I think, that said you wanted to double the size of colo from 5% to 10% of revenues. Can you kind of talk about why you're making that push into that side of the business? How far along that is and when that hurdle is to be reached? And then, I guess, the second question along with those lines would be, are you doing this yourselves? Are you pushing into the interconnect business or this is just another way to kind of create space for resellers in your portfolio?
Michael F. Foust: Well, it's really an opportunity for us to create value at the asset level in existing Internet gateway buildings that employ the high connectivity with having many networks and ISPs and other assets that we think blend themselves well for the colocation. The smaller footprint business -- it's really, we look at it kind of the spectrum of size of customer requirements, maybe a big company, but in a particular geography, they may need a small footprint. We have space available that we think we can add a lot of value on a property level by building it out and leasing to the smaller footprint requirements. So it's really an asset-driven strategy. And being able to utilize our in-place operating staff, because we do have folks that are operating these facilities and doing a very good job of it. So kind of piggybacking on the business we have now which if you look at total gross revenues of our current colo business, it's about $55 million, and we'd like to see that double in 3 to 4 years. That may be a little ambitious, but I think with the space we have available, it's something that we can achieve in. And the -- again, the margins are very good because they are smaller footprint deals.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Would these be add-on spaces to Telex or somebody else who manages that gateway site within the larger facility or were you guys pushing ahead and do this on your own? And will we see you get into more interconnect business in the future?
Michael F. Foust: Well, the colo space that we refer to is space that we're managing and leasing ourselves. We've pretty much given other folks, who are large customers of ours, first crack at the space. And more often than not, if folks -- other service providers want the space, we're happy to lease it to them more on a wholesale basis, if you will. But it's phased out that we see we could -- that follow right now that we can add a lot of value with and add value at the asset level. The interconnect business, it's probably something we'll continue to do in certain locations where we don't have a Telex meet-me-room setup, but it's really more focusing on space power warm hands and being more network neutral on the network side.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow, Raymond James.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions here. Mike, could you talk about the sensitivity on the demand side in Europe, given the economic issues they're having there?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. I mean, we're certainly not seeing as much demand as we're seeing in, generally, in the U.S. markets and the Asia-Pac markets we're in. But I don't want to give the impression that nothing's going on. I think in markets like London and Amsterdam, we're going to see continued good demand requirements. Amsterdam is such a big network location and London with corporate and financial services, it's pretty robust. I mean, we're seeing a lot of demand in London right now, and probably almost 32 megawatts of potential demand. Even in Paris, we're seeing requirements out there, different stages of purchasing of between 12 and 13 megawatts. So it's certainly not totally quiet. So we'll continue to be very focused and bringing on space, utilizing our POD Architecture so we don't get ahead of demand with supply. And I think we're very well positioned to nab, hopefully, more than our fair share of those requirements. We'll be very incremental as we bring new space on in London, Paris and Dublin. And we are looking for another project in Amsterdam because we're fully leased in that market.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And then at your Analyst Day, you talked about potentially entering Latin America, following your customers, if you will. Any update on that opportunity?
Michael F. Foust: We are doing some consulting work with our digital design services in Mexico City with a customer on a development that they're doing. And we're definitely only in conversation mode regarding Brazil, although that continues to be an intriguing opportunity and what I think we will explore in more earnest here this year. Nothing to announce at this stage.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And then Bill, if I can ask you one question, we all heard you at the Analyst Day at the back-end loaded year. I think consensus is $1.17 for the fourth quarter. Do you have any commentary on that? Obviously, it's important as we start thinking about '13.
A. William Stein: I mean, I think, we don't give -- as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. I'd say, given the slope of the growth in the year, the $1.17 would be right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: [indiscernible] the acquisition pipeline a little bit if you could just -- if you could give some color on -- if most of that is focused internationally or domestically, that would be helpful.
Michael F. Foust: For income properties, it's primarily U.S. And so that's what we're seeing most of the prospects for us for income acquisitions.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Great. And then also the development -- the joint venture in Hong Kong, any sense -- if we could get a -- just a better sense of pricing, what kind of development yields you expect and just how much is spent on it and how much it actually cost to develop it out?
Michael F. Foust: We're not prepared to give out that information at this point, partially for competitive reasons and as well as we do have a partner in this, especially for competitive reasons. We don't want to give out those kind of metrics.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Then, thanks for your commentary on Northern Virginia and pricing in that market. Could you give us a sense on what you're seeing in New Jersey and Santa Clara pricing-wise?
Michael F. Foust: I'd say New Jersey and Santa Clara are holding pretty steady. And those we did see in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley, a decline in the second half of last year. I think it's holding steady at those levels. Definitely in Virginia, with a couple of players choosing to be very aggressive on lease rates, that's probably the biggest decline that we've seen. We've been fortunate. I mean, we've been working to meet the market and still maintain double-digit yields on our investments by and large.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And just one more quick question. With a lot of the talk around the Pacific Northwest becoming a hotter data center market, how do you think of that relative to the current assets you own and whether that's going to create incremental competition on a going forward basis?
Michael F. Foust: We've been very active in Seattle and expanding our portfolio there with our new developments and continue to build out the existing Westin Building as well with our partner, Price Properties. And they're fabulous partners. So we're really excited in looking at other opportunities working with them to expand the Seattle footprint. And we're currently underway -- well underway on a Build-to-Suit for NetApp in Hillsborough, Oregon which is suburban Portland, which is another very attractive submarket for corporate data center users. So we'll continue to look at that Greater Portland area as well. Potentially, to do some, maybe even do some, spective element and continue on with the Seattle business which continues to expand.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then Silicon Valley, you gave us the typical stats of the demand you're tracking and your current inventory in the market, but you didn't give us a sense of what market supply is.
Michael F. Foust: Yes, let's see. I think Silicon Valley, we're looking at a current supply under construction of either existing or under construction around 20 megawatts perhaps. I'd have to -- I don't have my notes in front of me on that one offhand.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I'll follow up offline on that one. And then just -- I'm sorry, just one more question. Build-to-Suit, just kind of curious what your outlook is at this point whether you're still kind of seeing a strong demand for that?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, we are seeing good demand. These are a little bit trickier opportunities. And tricky, I mean, because they take a lot of face-to-face planning work with the customers because these are more customized solutions, sometimes including site selection and acquisition as well. So I think this is going to be -- continue to be a growing area for us because we're so uniquely positioned with our site selection, our design, our project management our supply chain management. So it's hard for me to put a number on it like what percentage of our overall growth is going to represent, but they do tend to be larger requirements. So I think in 2013 and 2014, we'll definitely see the impact of that work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a question on back to the acquisition pipeline, particularly the income-producing. In the past you've talked about sort of the pipeline in a dollar terms, in terms of what you're tracking, is that something that you can talk about here?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, I mean I think we're looking at various phases of prospecting probably around $750 million of suspect deals. Like I said, they're in various stages of review. And that's both income and for development projects.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And it sounds like those are probably smaller -- not really portfolios you're looking at, is that correct?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, tend to be one-off individual deals.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then Bill, maybe on the term loan, you said I think 50% of it you'd look to fix on a -- via swaps. Can you just talk about what your expectations would be if you were to fix that today, what kind of rates you'd get?
A. William Stein: I actually said at least 50%. The swap rate is very -- fair bit by currency. So the U.S. dollar would swap basically mid-2s. In fact, just about everything swaps mid- to high-2s. Well, mostly mid-2s, except for the Aussie dollar which would swap mid-5s.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- sorry, I'm bouncing about around a little bit here -- on the colo discussion. To get to the 10% over time and your doubling of the revenues from where you are today, do see yourself having the infrastructure today to do that or do you need to staff up to get to those levels?
Michael F. Foust: We have the great majority of that staff in place because, well, these are buildings we're already operating. So we can utilize a lot of that facility staff. And so we've been adding in terms of management, as well as leasing and marketing. Those are the main areas that we've been adding to the staffing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich, Green Street Advisers.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Mike, this is a question for you. I'm just curious how competitive you think your older spaces? Is there still demand for lower power density product or does that stuff just get redeveloped?
Michael F. Foust: Well, I think you're making an assumption that's necessarily lower power density, which isn't the case relative to new product. So the power densities are -- tend not to be an issue. And I think you see on our renewals that we're renewing a very high percentage. And typically, the power -- what we label as Powered Base Building renewals because that's where the customers put in the improvements have been renewing over the last couple of years at least in the high-90s percent. I think this quarter was 100% at 20% uplift in overall rent. So as you see by the renewal activity, that continues to be very valuable space.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach, ISI Group.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Bill, I guess 2 related questions on balance sheet. First, you mentioned that you won't need any new capital this year, but given where unsecured debt rates are when your stock is trading on an applied cap rate basis, I guess, how do you think about maybe some earnings dilution versus locking in long-term financing? And second, given the spread between your stock price and/or I think most people have your NAV, why not accelerate the ATM issuance, the kind of capture that spread will lock in the financing?
A. William Stein: George, right now, we're effectively sitting on cash. We have still $220 million, $230 million to draw on the term loan. So we're going to take that down over the next 90 days, which is what the term loan provides for. As far as the long-term market is concerned, the rates are certainly attractive. And our strategy there is consider a swap lock of out, probably, 12 months and that would really at least for a portion of our long-term financing needs in the first quarter of next year. So basically lock in at today's treasury. We can't hedge the spread but we can hedge the -- against the treasury. I think on the equity, we'll be opportunistic. So there is no need to issue equity, and that's the point I want to make. If we exceed our acquisition targets, it would raise equity so that the acquisition is leveraged neutral, and it may make sense to issue some equity as well. But I'm not going to issue equity and just put the cash on the balance sheet.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I guess I was thinking more in terms of not drawing down as much in the term loan, just given with the stock kind of the 6s on an applied basis, does that sort of make sense in a long-term basis?
A. William Stein: We really have to take the term loan within 90 days. That's how it's structured -- the balance of it.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of James Feldman, Bank of America.
Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's actually Jeff Spector. Just a question on the seasonality that you talked about at the beginning of the call. Can you just explain again how that impacts the new leased rents on the turnkey for the quarter?
Michael F. Foust: Well, it's kind of a more on a timing basis and a market basis. So these rates can vary pretty widely by market. And in terms of the overall volume, it's timing, and activities generally seems to be a little more back-end loaded for us as in terms of new signings. And the lease rates are going to vary pretty considerably market by market. And the type of asset as well and the type of applications, whether it's a smaller footprint for a very dense trading or whether it's a more typical power density for more general corporate applications.
Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And so, does that mean that the development yields are still intact even though, let's say, that new lease rent was slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter?
Michael F. Foust: I think we're definitely in that 11 to 13 range domestically for stabilized returns, higher internationally. So it's -- our yields are good, very good.
Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then just focusing a little bit more on that. Can you give us any additional information since the quarter-end? Anything new that have surprised you to give us a little bit more comfort that the first quarter was just seasonal? I mean, we've seen results from some of your peers today and we saw some strong numbers in the data center industry. Is there anything you've seen since the quarter-end to give us some additional comfort?
Michael F. Foust: Well, since the quarter ended like 3 weeks ago, but we are seeing good activity. And the leasing -- if you look at -- you can't -- the activity is very good. And you can't just separate out the first quarter from the fourth quarter. It's -- we're seeing a trend with very good activity over the last 4 quarters. So I think if you look in totality, the trajectory is good and we're in a number of different markets. So having the diversity of product and customer verticals, I think, will definitely benefit our shareholders.
James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And this is Jamie. So the -- your JV with Savvis in Hong Kong, now we were a couple of quarters into their acquisition by CenturyLink, is there anything different in that structure now that, that's a combined company or any kind of different way that they're working with you guys than when they were on their own?
Michael F. Foust: No. I mean, they're very good customer, obviously, of ours and along with other folks. But they are combined with the Savvis and Qwest combination in the CenturyLink, they're our largest customer. And we continue to look at opportunities with them across U.S. and in some of these international location sites. I wouldn't say this represents a different trend other than continue to, hopefully, be able to be a good partner and help them expand their footprint domestically, as well as internationally.
James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then just one final detailed question on the colocation leases you said that they're much longer now than they used to be. Is there a reason for that? Anything we should think about when we see that?
Michael F. Foust: Well, I think what we're saying, the non-colocation leases continue to be very long-term. I believe we're well over 10 years, and so I think for the larger footprint leases, we continue to see a good term. So tenants are committing to long-term. So we like that because we think that reflects a higher asset value and in very predictable cash flow stream, earnings stream from our asset base. [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Mike Foust for closing remarks.  [Technical Difficulty]  Sir, please go ahead with the closing remarks. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Foust.
Michael F. Foust: Yes, sorry for the telecom glitch there. Looks like we had a crossed line. But, I definitely appreciate everybody's time and good questions today.  And I want to congratulate our team for very good financial results and the good efforts across the globe in driving our new customer relationships and driving what we think will be a very good year of results for Digital Realty. Thank you again.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Questions will be limited to one per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust: Thank you, Pamela and welcome to the call everyone. Before we get start with our formal remarks, I would like to thank everyone who participated in our Investor Day a few weeks ago. We greatly appreciate the positive feedback we received, and we are glad you found the information useful. Now I'll proceed with the call. I will begin with my remarks and then turn the call over to Bill who will review our exceptional fourth quarter and full-year 2011 financial results. As we previously announced, 2011 was a record setting year for DLR. We signed new leases for approximately 1.3 million square feet, representing over $136.6 million of annual GAAP rental revenue, which represents a 22% increase over 2010. We were able to achieve these results by leveraging our global platform and expanding relationships with several multinational customers in markets ranging from Amsterdam to Dallas and Silicon Valley to Singapore. We also achieved excellent results serving the local customer base in markets such as Paris, Los Angeles, and Melbourne, Australia. We believe that the strength of our leasing program lies in our geographically diverse portfolio, supported by local experts who deliver service and solutions to customers with a consistent commitment to excellence regardless of location. At the same time, our global portfolio enables us to provide data center solutions where our customers need them while mitigating our exposure in any one geographic market. Heading into 2012, we have a healthy backlog of signed leases totaling approximately $84 million of annual GAAP revenue, of which $62 million will commence in 2012 and the bulk of the remaining backlog in 2013. The increase in our build-to-suit activity in 2011 certainly helped to contribute to this strong backlog. Lease terms continue to trend on the longer side. Leases signed in the fourth quarter for data center space averaged 152 months or 12.7 years, up from 110 months in the third quarter. We also had good renewal activity in the fourth quarter, rolling over approximately 413,000 square feet of space or a 5.6% increase in GAAP rents. The renewals included approximately 90,000 square feet of turnkey space, which increased 2.2% on a GAAP basis, and approximately 290,000 square feet of Powered Base Building, which increased 15.3% on a GAAP basis. Overall, tenant retention remained very high. On a square foot basis, 100% of expiring turnkey space renewed during the fourth quarter. On a revenue basis, turnkey leases renewed at approximately 102% of GAAP, with an average lease term of over 135 months. Again, on a square foot basis, 99% of expiring Powered Base Building leases were renewed in the quarter at 114% of GAAP rents, with an average lease term of 82 months. Portfolio occupancy increased to 94.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 93.7% in the third quarter, reflecting new leasing activity and our high renewal rate. Same-store occupancy also increased to 95.3% from 94.2% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter same-store NOI increased to $136.7 million, up 3% from $132.6 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, was up to $124.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 3.8% from $119.6 million in the third quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we see active demand from new data center space virtually across all of our markets. We are currently tracking over 2 million square feet of demand, which is consistent with what we reported on our last call. This compares to 1.4 million square feet of identified requirements at year-end 2010, so we're certainly seeing an uptick in overall customer requirements that we've identified. For the benefit of those who were unable to participate in our Investor Day last month, I'll briefly run through the supply and demand statistics we're tracking in a few of our major markets. As you know, our strategy is to maintain a disciplined approach to managing inventory market by market by utilizing our flexible POD architecture that's designed to deliver data center space in approximately 1-megawatt increments. This enables us to meet customers' just-in-time requirements across our global portfolio while limiting our financial exposure in any one market. Year-over-year, lease rates in our major markets remained relatively flat. Although we've seen increased supply in Silicon Valley, Northern Virginia, and New York/New Jersey, we continue to have strong demand for product and we've been able to maintain rents in line with our historical rates while achieving our unlevered cash return on invested capital on our new developments of between 11% and 14%. In New York Metro, including New Jersey, we're tracking nearly 31 megawatts of potential demand. We believe the increase in demand over previous quarters reflects pent-up demand from financial services as well as system integrators and managed services cloud providers that support the financial vertical. This compares with approximately 23 megawatts of available supply that is either built out or currently under construction. At DLR, our New York Metro exposure is relatively small at present. We currently have three TKD PODs or about 3.5 megawatts available. We believe that DLR represents about 60% of the 17.6 megawatts of supply that was absorbed in 2011. In Northern Virginia, we're tracking approximately 18.5 megawatts of current demand. This compares to approximately 29.5 megawatts of available supply that's either built out or under construction. Again, we have a very manageable current exposure in this market with 2 megawatts of available built-out supply in the DLR portfolio. We estimate that DLR represents approximately 49% of the 43.3 megawatts of supply absorbed in Northern Virginia in 2011. Dallas has continued to be a very active market for us, with very limited available built-out supply. We've identified approximately 24.5 megawatts of demand compared to 7.2 megawatts of net new built-out supply. During the quarter, we signed leases with separate customers at two buildings that are under construction currently at our Datacenter Park Dallas property. That's in Richardson, Texas. The first lease is for a 112,000 square foot build-to-suit, and the second is for 42,000 square feet. As a result, we're moving ahead with the construction of two new buildings in the park in addition to the two that we've leased. In the Dallas market, we estimate that digital lease signings represented approximately 62% of the 2011 absorption. And finally, in Silicon Valley, we're currently tracking about 3.6 megawatts of demand compared to about 24 megawatts of currently available supply. As we discussed at our Investor Day, with more than eight years of experience leasing in Silicon Valley, we recognize that it has rather unique demand characteristics. Internet based companies have traditionally been major consumers of data center space in the Valley. Their growth and subsequent data center requirements are extremely difficult to predict, even for the enterprises themselves, which are growing so quickly. While there appears to be a significant supply surplus today, new requirements can and will emerge and absorb supply quickly. Our exposure at present is a very manageable just 4 megawatts of available supply either currently or that we currently have under construction. We estimate DLR represented approximately 19% of the over 36 megawatts of absorption in Silicon Valley in 2011. In addition, we're seeing strong demand in markets such as Phoenix and Boston, where we're generating significant leasing momentum. Let me turn to our acquisitions program. We acquired four properties during the quarter for a total purchase price of $157 million, bringing total acquisitions for the year to $246 million. Fourth quarter activity included the Dublin development site we discussed on our last call as well as two income-producing properties, one in San Francisco, CBD, and one in Atlanta. In addition, we acquired a development side in Northern Virginia that was subsequently contributed to a joint venture partnership with an existing customer for another build-to-suit project. As soon as we receive customer approval, we plan to provide additional information on this transaction in the coming weeks. We continue to take a prudent approach to expanding our European portfolio, which currently represents 11% or $91 million of total annualized rent in the portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, the stabilized portfolio was 92% leased in Europe. In Asia-Pac, we've signed leases for 40% of our building in Singapore, and this is more than 18 months ahead of our underwriting assumptions, so we're seeing very good activity in the Singapore market. We're currently tracking over 51 megawatts of potential demand, as we continue construction on the remaining 11 megawatts of available IT capacity at that building. In Melbourne, we held a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction on a 50,000 square foot facility fully leased to National Australia Bank, NAB. We have additional expansion capacity at this location, and we're currently tracking about 4 megawatts of demand. Construction is also underway at our Sydney site. We're building a 90,000 square foot facility designed to support four of our 1,440-kilowatt PODs. We expect to deliver the first two PODs in the fourth quarter of 2012. In Sydney, we're tracking about 8 megawatts of demand. Our development program continues to be very active, supplying new facilities that will fuel our ongoing growth. During the fourth quarter, we completed over 224,000 square feet of data center space, which was 93% leased. This consisted of 36,000 square feet of turnkey that was over 56% leased, 5,000 square feet of Powered Base Building 100% leased, and over 183,000 square feet of build-to-suit space that was also 100% leased. At quarter-end, we were under construction in turnkey space totaling about 489,000 square feet, including 284,000 square feet in the United States, 44,000 square feet in Europe, and approximately 161,000 square feet in Singapore and Australia. Approximately 31% of this space is pre-leased. For Powered Base Building space, we're under construction on about 341,000 square feet in the U.S. In Europe, we had about 88,000 square feet under construction, which includes the new Chessington redevelopment property in London that we acquired in the third quarter. So we've started building on that straightaway. Lastly, we had approximately 275,000 square feet of build-to-suit space under construction in the U.S., which is 100% pre-leased. Including pre-construction work and common area building improvements, the total construction work in progress at the quarter was $221 million. The estimated cost to complete the ongoing December 31 work in progress is $486 million. So this concludes my prepared remarks. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein. Bill?
A. William Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. I will keep my remarks quite brief and will focus primarily on fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results that were not addressed on our Investor Day. As Mike mentioned, 2011 was another year of exceptional performance by Digital. On Tuesday, our Board approved a quarterly common stock dividend increase of 7.4% or $0.05 a share to $0.73 per share. This is our tenth dividend increase in a little over seven years since our 2004 IPO. Since our first full quarter of operations, we've grown our dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 17%. This increase reflects our optimism for continued growth, the need to meet REIT distribution requirements, and is consistent with our existing policy to distribute 100% of taxable income to minimize corporate level federal income taxes. As we disclosed in our Investor Day presentation, we raised $2.8 billion in capital during the year from a variety of sources to fund the growth of our company, which includes our $1.5 billion global revolving credit facility that closed during the fourth quarter. This substantial increase in borrowing capacity will accommodate our growing global investment program and provide immediate liquidity for potential acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we generated $42.4 million of net proceeds from our At-the-Market equity distribution program from the issuance of 668,000 shares at an average price of $64.08, bringing the total for the year to $456.8 million of net proceeds under the current and previous programs at an average share price of $59.68. Since January 2012, we have issued approximately $63 million of common stock at an average price of $66.19 per share. We have $53.8 million remaining under the current program. We have $1.1 billion of immediate liquidity, including $26.6 million in short-term investments, plus the funds that can be drawn on our credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility, our Prudential shelf facility, and other secured debt. After the payoff of two European secured loans in January for $73.4 million and assuming extension options are exercised, in 2012 we have $68 million remaining principal amortization and debt maturities, including $53 million for a secured loan maturing in October. In 2013, we have $260 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. All per-share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, the fourth quarter FFO per share was $1.02. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, fourth quarter 2011 core FFO was $600,000 higher than reported FFO or $1.03 per share. This reflects a 7.3% increase from the fourth quarter 2010 FFO of $0.96 per share. For the full year 2011, FFO per share was $4.06, up nearly 20% from 2010 FFO per share of $3.39. When adjusting for non-core items, 2011 FFO per share was $4.09, up over 17% from 2010 core FFO of $3.49. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $94.9 million, up from $92.5 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 81.9%, up slightly from 81% last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.3% or 6% quarter-over-quarter, which improved our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.4 times in the fourth quarter, down from 4.5 times last quarter. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.2 times at year end 2011 compared to 3.4 times in the previous quarter. This decrease is due to the issuance of our 7% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock in third quarter of 2011. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $622.9 million in 2011, up nearly 22% year-over-year from $512.1 million in 2010. As disclosed in our Investor Day presentation, at the midpoint of our 2012 guidance, we forecast 18% growth in 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $733 million versus 2011 adjusted EBITDA of $623 million. Turning to the income statement, net operating income increased by $6.8 million to $173.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $166.3 million last quarter. This increase is primarily attributed to growth provided by incremental leasing, lower net utilities in the quarter and a favorable property tax adjustment that resulted from a final tax assessment, a portion of which was passed on to tenants. Although total reimbursements of $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased from $56.7 million in the third quarter, the operating margin for the overall portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2011 is higher at 65%, compared to 63.1% in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting lower OpEx in the fourth quarter. G&A decreased by 14.4% to $12.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $14.6 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to year-end accrual adjustments. Interest and other income decreased to $398,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.2 million in the last quarter, primarily due to third quarter 2011 foreign exchange transaction gains. Finally, we are maintaining our 2012 FFO guidance range of $4.34 to $4.48 per share that we announced on January 30, 2012, with the same assumptions that were set forth in that press release. That concludes our formal remarks. We can now open the call to your questions, Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Thanks and good morning out there. I just wanted to follow up on markets and market rents specifically. I know that you guys do a nice job of providing some demand and supply statistics. I'm just curious. And I know you have a lot of different -- you have a broad product array and a broad number of markets now. But if you could maybe just generically talk about what you're seeing in market rents across your different product types?
Michael F. Foust:  Well, rents --
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Oh, go ahead.
Michael F. Foust:  Oh no, I'm good. Go ahead, Jordan.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  That's the question. And then as a follow-up, I was just curious if you could maybe talk about any large tenant requirements you were seeing in the market.
Michael F. Foust:  Sure. By and large, for the leases we've been executing on, we were looking at the last five or six quarters in some of these markets where there is some growing supply like in Silicon Valley, in Virginia, and New Jersey. And our lease rates have been remarkably flat and really not declining on what we've been executing on. I would say probably, generally, in Silicon Valley, rents might be down 10% to 15% in some cases. But depending on the requirement, the level of resiliency in the facility, we've been pretty flat. Now we haven't had a lot of product to lease in Silicon Valley. We'll be bringing on a couple more PODs in a couple of months because we always want to have some product even in markets that are a little more frothy. But I think by and large, our lease rates are holding well in some of these markets.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Is that in the U.S., or is that everywhere?
Michael F. Foust:  Now in other markets, we've seen maybe prices, the rates tick up a bit in places like Dallas and Phoenix. Certainly internationally, in Australia and Singapore, pricing is very good for us and we're looking at healthy returns in those markets. But across the board in the U.S. markets, we're still on our spec buildings achieving 11% -- 14% unlevered return on costs. So that continues to be very consistent for us.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Thanks. And just the follow-up on the large tenant requirements, are you seeing large tenants in any of these markets? I know you don't have a tremendous amount of availability, but I was curious in terms of what you're seeing out there for demand there.
Michael F. Foust:  Yes, it's interesting. In New Jersey, we're seeing some very large requirements from major Wall Street firms. And those will be ones that we can accommodate either in our Powered Base Building product that we have built out in Piscataway. We have space in Weehawken as well, a little bit less, smaller space in Weehawken, a couple PODs there and we've got a combination of build-to-suit requirements in Somerset and other sites that we have that we've identified. And we're seeing a couple of very large requirements potentially in London, certainly in Dallas, a number of good medium-size requirements for Phoenix, Boston. So across the board, it's pretty active. What's interesting, especially interesting are the large requirements that are percolating out there, some maybe in early stages for the New Jersey area.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Paul B. Morgan – Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC:  Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit in terms of your visibility about the ramp in development spend over the course of the year relative to your full-year guidance? And then just in terms of plans for funding, how comfortable are you with growing the volume of equity issue to the ATM versus other forms of capital raise?
A. William Stein: Paul, I can speak to the funding piece of it. The good news is we're coming into the year with a relatively low leverage. We're at 4.4 debt-to-EBITDA. We'd like to manage it up to five, higher if need be. So given the growth of EBITDA, there's clearly plenty of room for additional leverage, and our needs for equity are relatively modest. So given the modest needs for equity, I'm very comfortable that we can fund through the ATM. And one of the alternatives for us, which we demonstrated in August of last year, is that we're willing to go to the perpetual preferred market as well. And those rates, if anything, are more attractive today than they were when we issued in August. So we view that as extraordinarily attractive permanent capital.
Michael F. Foust:  And then in terms of the ramp, I think we're fairly steady now. I don't have a schedule in front of me that breaks it out by quarter, but I think we're relatively steady quarter-by-quarter at this point with the amount of activity that we have underway.
Paul B. Morgan – Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC:  Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thank you. Bill, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the year-over-year change in operating expenses in the same-store portfolio and walk us through the different line items and your expectation for this year.
A. William Stein: I've got the Q4 to Q3 comparison for same-store margins here and let's -- I'll pull up the same-store from the sub.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  And also versus 4Q last year, it seems like there were some pretty big spikes.
A. William Stein: The operating margins in Q4 versus Q3 improved about 150 basis points, so 67.3% Q4 versus 65.8% Q3.
Michael F. Foust:  And I think you'll probably see a similar uptick in margins compared to the fourth quarter of last year as well. And I think one of the things you have to remember is on fourth quarters there are a lot of reconciliations going on. And when you look at annualized year-over-year, our margins are holding or improving.
A. William Stein: The other that will happen and which has happened during this period is that we've brought online quite a bit of turnkey data center space, which has the effect of increasing the operating expenses quite a bit when it comes on. And to the extent that it's vacant, there's no revenue, obviously, so there may be some of that going on versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  So if you look, I'm just looking at the supplemental feed. It shows 40 basis points of year-over-year occupancy growth. Do you think some of that space last year was dormant even though it was leased?
A. William Stein:  Yes.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  And then you've got utilities are showing 12% growth. Your other maintenance and operating is showing 20% growth. Taxes is 24%. What would drive such a big increase on each of those lines?
A. William Stein: In taxes or in the whole thing?
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  No, like those are three of the ones that really stick out. Do you think all that space --
Michael F. Foust:  Your portfolio is growing quite a bit year-over-year. And once again, really what's more meaningful is looking at the entire year of 2010 with the entire year of 2011 gives you a better idea because the operating margins are actually improving and there are just a lot of reconciliations that go on the fourth quarter. So fourth quarters are hard to -- it's hard to extrapolate from a fourth quarter alone.
A. William Stein: Yeah, I think you need to ignore the utilities because the utilities are increasing 11.8% but the reimbursements are increasing 14.4%.
Michael F. Foust:  Yeah, we've actually added quarter-over-quarter,12/31/2010 to 12/31/2011, we've added over 770,000 square feet of occupied square feet and the great majority of that is turnkey data centers that are gross rents -- I'm sorry. It's actually over 1 million.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay, all right. Thank you.
Michael F. Foust:  It's actually over -- I'm sorry. It's over 1 million square feet, 1.2 million square feet we added.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Is that considered same-store even though you add square footage?
Michael F. Foust:  A lot of that's in the same -- in operating buildings, yeah, not all of that. And I don't know exactly the proportion, but a lot of that is in current operating buildings, yes.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay, I guess it will be useful to know what was utilized square feet year-over-year also in this presentation.
Michael F. Foust:  If you look at our EBITDA margins year-in, year-out on an annual basis, we're going to be on an EBITDA margin basis 60% or a little better very steadily.
A. William Stein: And the NOI margin of the rents 75%.
Michael F. Foust:  Right.
James C. Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay, I appreciate it.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.:  Hey, guys. It's Manny Korchman here with Michael. Just looking into 2012 and your acquisition guidance, can you help us think about how those might flow in? I think at your Investor Day, you had talked about a big acquisition happening in 1Q. Is that still on pace?
A. William Stein: That's still on pace. And I think for purposes of -- with the exception of that acquisition, when that acquisition happens, you'll see how much it is. Subtract it from our guidance and then I would assume mid-quarter convention for the balance.
Michael F. Foust:  Yes, it may be a little back-ended because that seems to be the way that real estate transactions occur. There seem to be more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, but that's probably as good a convention as any.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.:  Just for modeling purposes at this point, is that half of what you're talking about? Is it three-quarters, or can you give us some idea of magnitude?
A. William Stein: Of the first quarter?
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.:  Of the 1Q, yes.
A. William Stein: It's roughly one-third at the low end.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.:  Okay. And then so going back to, I guess, Mike's comment, a pretty slow 2Q and then a pickup in 3Q and 4Q?
A. William Stein: That would be safe. These acquisitions --
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.:  Okay.
A. William Stein: To the extent they come in later in the year, really don't move the needle that much for the current year FFO. It's more of a subsequent year FFO item.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.:  Yes, perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from ISI Group. Your line is open.
George D. Auerbach – ISI Group, Inc.:  Great, thanks. Bill, just I guess to follow up on Jamie's question, maybe asked a different way, the non-utility OpEx jumped by about $5 million in the fourth quarter. So should we expect that to go back to a $25 million or so run rate going forward?
A. William Stein: Let me see.
Michael F. Foust:  Once again, we're adding properties because we're doing a lot of construction and, hopefully, a lot of leasing along with it. And we have a good backlog, as I mentioned earlier, that will be coming online, and a lot of that's in those same-store buildings. But I think we're going to -- on a percentage basis, we ought to be pretty steady.
A. William Stein: I think it should be flat, flatter.
George D. Auerbach – ISI Group, Inc.:  Flat with the $30 million going forward?
A. William Stein: Flat to the $30 million.
George D. Auerbach – ISI Group, Inc.:  Okay. And I guess on the rental rate side, the gap spreads on the turnkey leasing were about 2% positive this quarter. But can you help us understand what the cash roll-down was? I'm assuming it was negative.
Michael F. Foust:  Is this on the renewal activity?
George D. Auerbach – ISI Group, Inc.:  Yes.
Michael F. Foust:  Yes. So on renewals, we had two transactions with two very large, very long-term customers that renewed in the quarter. And we did have a roll-down somewhat in the cash based on those two. And both of these were long-term leases; one was 10 years and one was 13 years. And they had both been going up, one like 4% a year, one 3% a year and they renewed. Each one renewed for like another 10 to 12 years each. So when you get that compounding, sometimes you get an occurrence where that rent has gotten so high at the end of 12 years that when you're resetting to have a reasonable lease rate, especially for big customers of ours, we're willing to be flexible so that the overall rent going forward on a straight-line basis is a significant uptick for us. But they get a little bit of relief at the front end, so the cash goes down 2% or 10% or 12% in one case where it was a PBB lease. But on an overall basis, it went down 12% on this Powered Base Building, but on an average, it's going to be up almost 17%. And we're not talking about -- we're talking about rents in the $20s, $20 per square foot per year. So, all-in-all, it's actually a net increase in value for the buildings because we're renewing these big tenants at higher average rents for a 10 to 12 year basis. And if you took those two out, then the cash uptick would be 4% for turnkey and 3% for Powered Base Building if you take those two out on a cash basis.
George D. Auerbach – ISI Group, Inc.:  Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just finally, Bill or Mike, what should we expect in terms of land acquisitions this year? And can you just remind us on that million or so square feet of re-dev space that aren't under construction, are you capitalizing any costs on those land or they all sort of a drag to FFO?
Michael F. Foust:  Well, land, you can't capitalize land under any circumstance. So our land holdings are really -- we're really in good shape in terms of kind of feeding demand, so our significant land holdings would be our next phase in Virginia, the smaller piece that we acquired in Dublin. We have land for development at our Richardson Datacenter Park, Dallas. So those three locations are probably where we have actual land. And then where we have re-development space, shelf space in the re-dev portfolio, if it's not under construction, we are not capitalizing. But the acquisition that should close this quarter has some land that we'll be able to use at a later date; about 10 acres and a lot of power.
George D. Auerbach – ISI Group, Inc.:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies & Company. Your line is open.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Going back to Jamie's question on G&A, the $12.5 million of G&A this quarter, how much of accruals were actually in? And if you were to take that out, what would be the normalized run rate?
A. William Stein: Well, I think what we should do is look at the guidance for 2012.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  I think it's the reconciliation I was just trying to do basically, figuring out if that guidance actually does make sense.
A. William Stein: Well, $14 million is sort of a normal.
Michael F. Foust:  Yes. And, Tayo, if you look at -- especially if you look at G&A as percentage of revenues, we're very steady there. So if you look at the G&A and our guidance on G&A, it's very much in line with the previous years and even ticked down a snitch, but we're very consistent as G&A as a percentage of revenues, which I think is a meaningful number, meaningful ratio if you look at how we're managing our business.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  Okay, that's helpful. Bill, second question goes to you. As I look at your credit metrics, they're just really, really strong at this point. Just kind of curious what you think your chances are in regards to getting yet another credit rating upgrade.
A. William Stein: It's awfully hard to anticipate the rating agencies' actions. I think clearly, we maintain a very strong balance sheet. I think one of the criteria that the agencies rely upon is knowing how long a company has been operating as a public company, but how long it's been operating as a rated entity. And in our case, I think it's been a couple of years now. But the agencies publish their criteria for the ratings of these various -- and what the criteria needs to be on per-credit metrics. And I think that certainly you could make the argument that we should be a BBB plus or a Baa, one. And in fact, we do make that argument every time we see them. But clearly, to-date, we've not been successful in winning that argument. But that's not to say we won't try it the next time we see them.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  Okay, makes sense. And then just last question in regards to any markets that you're not in right now where you do feel those markets are attractive and you could take a look at, a strong to look at?
Michael F. Foust:  Certainly, we like the Hong Kong market a lot and we'd like to be there and we're working on being there. We're hopeful that we're going to be participating in that market before the end of the year. That's probably the main one. Frankfurt's an interesting market as well that we're not in. I'd say those are probably the two main larger markets that have a lot of appeal.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  Nothing domestically?
Michael F. Foust:  We're in so many markets now. Now, that's not to say on a build-to-suit basis, we wouldn't expand into some new markets, but yes, the latest one being with our build-to-suit operation with NetApp in suburban Portland, in Hillsboro, Portland, that's kind of an interesting market, so that -- but if you look around, we're in Seattle meaningfully, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, LA, Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago. You'll probably see us doing more in Chicago. We like that market a lot and we're virtually 96% leased there. We'll be doing more in Boston, expanding our footprint in the Boston market and expanding in our Needham facility and continue to expand the operations in Wakefield. Virginia, we continue to be very active, as we are in New Jersey. And I could see us perhaps -- we made a nice acquisition of income, stabilized property at Linton, and that's a market we'll look at potentially doing more in. But I think we've got the U.S. pretty covered from a major market per spec building, but that's not to say on a build-to-suit basis we wouldn't go to new markets in the U.S.
Tayo T. Okusanya – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  Great, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank:  Hi, everyone. I just wanted to clarify something, I'm not sure if I have missed it but it sounds like you're ready to move forward with some work in the Silicon Valley, even though there's somewhat of a supply -- over supply situation there today currently based on the quirkiness. In New Jersey, are you guys ready to move forward on new stuff there? It seems like your commentary in terms of the supply demand has been more positive than I think a lot of people looking at that market would think, and I just wanted to get your thoughts there.
Michael F. Foust:  Yes, certainly. In New Jersey, I think we have three PODs available right now, about 3.5 megawatts that's built out, ready to go, but we also have hard-based building, probably a couple of 100,000 feet that we have available that we can build out custom or build out more or leases as Power Base Building. The folks want to use their own capital to build out. And we are talking to customers about doing more customized build-to-suit within those buildings if you will. And we continue to look at new sites to accommodate some of these larger requirements that are out to there that are more build-to-suit-oriented. So we're definitely very busy in New Jersey right now.
A. William Stein: And Vincent, we think that New Jersey is more so than other markets, a market where demand is characterized by corporate enterprise as opposed to Internet. And we believe that we've demonstrated that our product is well suited to the corporate enterprise market. And so, to the extent that you might hear from others that demand is not looking as strong in New Jersey that might be a function of whether their product meets the corporate enterprise market as well as ours does.
Michael F. Foust:  Just this week, we became aware of maybe another 20 megawatts of potential projects from major firms. So there's a lot going on potentially in New Jersey.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank:  Okay. I guess I'm just trying to understand for the minute, it does sound like there's some activity there and your product if it fits better, why not go ahead more aggressively with spec. Your commentary just now just seems more oriented towards build-to-suit type of stuff, which obviously carries a little bit lower risk. But if there's already a demand, under supply of space for the type of space that's needed, why not go ahead with more spec?
Michael F. Foust:  We can build that very quickly in our existing Powered Base Buildings. So in Somerset, in Piscataway, and Weehawken, in all those places we have Powered Base building -- in the case of Weehawken, it's actually built out beyond Powered Base. We have one POD and one POD that is about halfway built out. In Piscataway and Somerset right now, we have space that we can build out very quickly, customized space. So instead of building out the spec POD, if we can deliver something in 12 or 14 weeks for a customer and we could do it on a more customized basis, it's definitely for everyone's benefit to do that. And we have the just-in-time product available for those who do want to move in, in 30 days. So we have the best of both worlds there.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is open.
William A. Crow – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Hey, good morning, guys, a quick question here for you. You clearly have the capacity to be an industry consolidator. What are you seeing on the private side from a potential acquisition perspective? And I'm not talking not just one-offs, but larger transactions. We've seen CyrusOne being mentioned as potentially coming public or being spun off. Anything you can comment on there that could give us a roadmap to where you guys may end up?
Michael F. Foust:  The opportunities that we're seeing right now that we think are executable are individual property acquisitions. And we're really not seeing other than speculation other M&A opportunities, though we always have our feelers out and we're always inquiring with companies about the potential for larger, more enterprise M&A type investments. But I really can't say that there's anything percolating at this point.
William A. Crow – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay.
A. William Stein: If the right opportunity came along, we'd be clearly interested.
William A. Crow – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay.
A. William Stein: And we have the balance sheet today to acquire just about anything.
Michael F. Foust:  Yes. We're very, very open to the ideas.
William A. Crow – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  And then one final question, hopefully on New Jersey, which is you talked about pent-up demand from financial services tenants. Is there any concrete evidence now that they're out in the market more aggressively? Are tours increasing, or have you actually seen some deals signed, or is this just still on the come?
Michael F. Foust:  The demand that we're talking about and that we put in our stats are projects that we're bidding on or that we have at least preliminary proposals out to or proposed LOIs at least. And then there are some very large potential build-to-suits that are out in the market with RFPs and RFIs currently.
William A. Crow – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Thank you. That's it for me.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.
Lukas Hartwich – Green Street Advisors, Inc.:  Thank you. Hey, guys. Mike, I was hoping you could talk about how you think about the relative risks and rewards when you're weighing whether to deploy capital domestically or internationally.
Michael F. Foust:  It's interesting because the markets that we're looking at, where we're actively building, both the U.S. and internationally, are major markets. So whether it's London or Dallas or Singapore or Northern Virginia, we're not taking emerging market risk at all. So the initial risk that we think we mitigate very well with our processes and procedures is going into a new market, whether it's a new market domestically or a new market internationally. And we mitigate those risks because we have tried and true very specific programs on design, contracting, project management, commissioning, and property operations. And when we go into a new market, whether it's in the U.S. or in international, we have market leaders come in from other Digital regions to get things set up, trained, establish our program while we're training local folks. And a lot of our employees are international folks too who have a lot of experience. So there, for example, our folks in Australia and Singapore, our long-time data center experts and operators in those markets. So it's more of entering a new market rather than an international market because we're not going into emerging markets. We're staying in mature, where are a lot of our customers, frankly, especially a place like Singapore and London and even Paris are existing customers of ours and working with us in multiple markets, the same for Amsterdam as well.
Lukas Hartwich – Green Street Advisors, Inc.:  That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.
Gabriel Hilmoe – UBS Securities, LLC:  Hey, guys. It's Gabe Hilmoe here with Ross. I was wondering. Can you maybe talk a little bit about Equinix evaluating the possibility of converting some or all of their business to a REIT and how you maybe view that relationship going forward from a potential competitive standpoint?
Michael F. Foust:  We're really good partners and we're doing work together all the time and new things all the time, including currently. So with our relationships and in terms of value that we bring, in being able to play in so many markets, it has been very value-add for them. We've got great relationships top to bottom throughout the organization. So we expect to continue to have a great relationship with them.
Gabriel Hilmoe – UBS Securities, LLC:  Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners. Your line is open. Jonathan Schildkraut, your line is open.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Hello?
Michael F. Foust:  Yes, we can.
A. William Stein: Now we can.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  All right, I apologize for that. I had a question about New Jersey. Bill, you talked about tracking a lot of demand and demand from financial services, and we're tracking actually a bunch of demand from financial services as well. And one of the things that we are hearing is that some of these clients are very interested in dedicated backup systems, generators, and other equipment. And you noted that perhaps your facilities were better suited to fill some of the demand in the New Jersey market. I was wondering if you could tell us if that was one of the items that you were seeing. And if not, maybe you could elucidate us a little bit on what it is about your facilities that places you in a better competitive position. Thanks.
Michael F. Foust:  Sure. Mike here. I'll go ahead and answer that. Yes, definitely, our POD architecture, where we have dedicated power and UPS backup power infrastructure, is critical, especially for financial services, but really for almost all corporate enterprises. They really don't want to be in a position where they're sharing the power systems and parts of the cooling systems with other customers. So our buildings are designed essentially to be buildings within a building, so that power and backup power infrastructure is fully dedicated to the individual customer. And that really is a primary criteria for your financial services and corporate enterprise in general.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  All right, excellent. If I could sneak one more, it's more of a mathematical question, but we were calculate churn. And it looks like churn, at least for 2011, is falling somewhere or fell somewhere in the 7% on an annual basis range. Is that in the range of a correct number?
A. William Stein: I don't believe. If you look at our renewal overall, our overall renewals on a revenue basis, GAAP revenue basis, I think we're probably about 100%.
Michael F. Foust:  Are you looking at square footage?
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  No. I was just trying to look at the revenue run rates, incremental lease commencements and then realized incremental revenue growth. You know what; I can take that question offline. I apologize.
Michael F. Foust:  Okay, no worries.
Operator:  And your last question comes from the line of Chris Lucas from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Chris R. Lucas – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Good morning, guys, just a couple of quick questions. Just going back to New Jersey real quick, Mike, just so I'm clear, latency is not an issue for a lot of these users at this point. Really it is more of a back-office functional demand issue in New Jersey for those corporate users?
Michael F. Foust:  It varies. It varies widely. Yes, I'd say it's a range. There's still a significant amount of latency sensitive. Even if it's not necessarily trading, there are databases that need to be concurrently maintainable. And then there are a number of -- a significant amount of applications that are less latency critical, some of the more cloud-oriented, grid-computing types. And some of those actually applications we've taken with Wall Street firms down in Virginia and some other locations that maybe they can enjoy a little bit lower power cost especially. So it really runs the gamut. We're seeing a lot of consolidation, and we've been seeing this across the board now for a couple years and it's starting to accelerate where companies in general will have data centers in different departments. It's in the converted broom closets, the converted conference rooms, in high-rise buildings. And the IT departments are getting their arms around all these dispersed applications in different departments and bringing them under one roof. And that typically means coming into a new facility that's built for them. So I think we're seeing a lot of that. That does represent a pretty wide range of applications and equipment.
Chris R. Lucas – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Okay, and then just talking about consolidation. There is money in the federal budget for data center consolidation. I guess I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in terms of actual movement along that front and then also sort of what your sense is to the ultimate size of that opportunity.
Michael F. Foust:  We're clearly seeing more activity and more interest in leasing as opposed to owning with the government. We think it's going to be a trend. We speculate it's going to be a trend. It's a little too early to tell, especially in election year, but we are starting to see some requirements and we've actually executed on government requirements recently in Virginia that represent that kind of consolidation into the new facility. So I'm guessing we'll continue to see that and maybe start to build through this year. So we're encouraged that there's going to be more government demand, especially as looking more at operating model versus an owning model.
Chris R. Lucas – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Okay. And then last question, Bill, just on -- relative to guidance. There's been a little deterioration in the dollar relative to some of the other currencies. I just wanted to get a sense as to how much variance off of the guidance dollar to the other currency denominations do you need to see in order to have a meaningful impact on sort of the outcome of the results for 2012?
A. William Stein: Right now, our guidance or assumptions for currency exchange rates for guidance purposes are conservative, in the sense that I think the euro and the pound and the Sing dollar are all quite a bit higher -- not quite a bit, but higher than what we stated in our assumptions. So, at this point, if today's exchange rates for the balance of the year and there were no fluctuation whatsoever, it would add another couple of pennies to the existing FFO.
Chris R. Lucas – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Great, thanks a lot. That was helpful.
A. William Stein: It actually goes the other way.
Operator:  And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Foust for any closing remarks.
Michael F. Foust:  Once again, thank you everyone for taking the time to be with us today and taking the time for a great turnout for the Investor Day as well. And I'd just like to thank all of our team members here at Digital Realty. Our team has done a terrific job, record-breaking year in leasing and developing our customer relationships more deeply. And the team here is doing a terrific job delivering those data center solutions across a wide range of market. So my thanks to the DLR team and we're looking forward to a really good 2012. Thank you.
Operator:  And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kerry, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Digital Realty Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Pamela Garibaldi, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Marketing. Thank you. Ms. Garibaldi, you may begin your conference.
Pamela M. Garibaldi: Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. By now, you should've received a copy of the Digital Realty earnings press release. If you've not, you can access one in the Investor Relations section of Digital's website at www.digitalrealty.com or you may call (415) 738-6500 to request a copy.

Explanations of such non-GAAP items and reconciliations to net income are contained in the company's supplemental operating and financial data package for the third quarter of 2011 furnished to the SEC, and this information is available on the company's website at www.digitalrealty.com. Now I'd like to introduce Michael Foust, CEO; and Bill Stein, CFO and Chief Investment Officer. Following management's brief remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Questions will be limited to one per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust: Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call, everyone. My comments today will focus on providing additional color around our leasing results and our recent acquisitions activity. I will also briefly discuss details of our Build-to-Suit program and its progress thus far.  My concluding remarks will include a review of the current supply-demand dynamics in Santa Clara, New Jersey, as well as an overview of our construction activity. Following my remarks I'll turn the call over to Bill who will review our strong financial performance and revised 2011 guidance, we'll discuss our financial strategy, and the key role it plays in funding our growth.  The market for DLR's data center solutions continues to be very strong with good demand from providers of cloud services, collocation, network peering and financial services. As reported, our leasing results for the third quarter were in line with expectations and new leases will generate approximately $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue.  While not as strong as our exceptional second quarter results, we continue to see steady demand from customers for our suite of data center solutions. We're expanding existing customers in multiple markets including SoftLayer and IBM in Singapore, Net2EZ in L.A., as well as the recently announced new Build-to-Suit for Equinix in Seattle. We also signed new customers, such as the Build-to-Suit for NetApp in Hillsborough, Oregon, a suburb of Portland.  We have a good funnel of prospects under negotiation and expect to meet our projections for new leasing in 2011. We believe that our strategy of offering the market a variety of flexible solutions that are truly customer-driven will continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.  Relatively long lease terms are the norm. The average lease terms for all leases signed in third quarter was 123 months over 10 years. For turnkey space the average lease term was 110 months, or a little over 9 years. These lease terms have trended toward the high end of our average target range of 7 to 10 years, and we believe this reflects the quality of our data center solutions and that customers’ confidence in our long-term commitment to them.  For the Build-to-Suit transaction, initial lease terms are typically between 10 and 15 years. We have a good leasing backlog for the balance of 2011, totaling nearly 270,000 square feet and $21.8 million of annual GAAP rent. This includes the 153,000 square-foot Build-to-Suit with Equinix in Northern Virginia that's scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter. We have strong momentum heading into next year, as well. The backlog at the end of the third quarter for leases commencing in 2012 is over 226,000 square feet, representing almost $37 million of annual GAAP rent.  Our acquisitions activity is picking up in all regions. As mentioned on our last call during the third quarter, we expanded our Asia-Pacific footprint, entering the Australian market with the closing of a development site with 20 megawatts of allocated power in Sydney, Australia. This site was acquired for AUD $10.1 million, approximately USD $10.9 million. We have secure planning permission to develop 2 100,000 square-foot buildings, each delivering at least 6 megawatts of IT load. Construction on the first building began this month. There is a significant lack of supply for enterprise solutions in the market and customer interest in the site is good. We followed up with a second transaction in Australia, with the acquisition of a development site in Melbourne for AUD $4.1 million, that's about USD $4.3 million. We are already in negotiations with the financial services firm for the first 60,000 square-foot building. We're confident that our commitment to the Sydney and Melbourne markets will lead to a significant presence in Australia for DLR.  In terms of our plans to further expand in the Asia Pac region, we continue to explore development opportunities in Hong Kong where we see very attractive corporate demand from new and existing multinational customer of ours. While it remains a very challenging market to enter we have interesting prospects that we're working diligently to secure.  In Europe, we closed on the 130,000 square-foot redevelopment property in suburban London that we acquired during the quarter and discussed in our last call. In spite of the challenges in the European Capital Markets, demand in London from international financial services firms is good and we are in discussions with interested parties already on this project.  In addition, we closed this week on another development site in Dublin, Ireland for a purchase price of EUR 4.5 million. There's quite a bit of data center activity in London -- I'm sorry, in Dublin by international firms. We are virtually 100% leased in Dublin, so we want to have the ability to deliver inventory for the new requirements that we see emerging.  Consistent with our strategy, these acquisitions provide DLR with future inventory enabling us to bring new products online incrementally to meet visible customer demand in our key European markets, while maintaining our investment discipline. We also completed the acquisition of a 69,000 square-foot data center facility in Sacramento for a purchase price of $30 million. The facility is fully leased on a long-term basis to a quality data center services tenant, and will contribute approximately $3.3 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue.  As we mentioned on previous calls, the market for acquiring income-producing data center assets is somewhat limited, which is reflected in our revised guidance assumptions for the year. However, we do expect to close on over $200 million of income properties in 2011 that would generate attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.  Turning to our Build-to-Suit program, during the quarter we acquired the first of 2 development sites in the Pacific Northwest. The first site was acquired for $1.6 million in conjunction with the Build-to-Suit agreement with NetApp to lease a 58,000-foot facility. It is located in the Hillsborough Oregon enterprise zone, approximately 18 miles west of Portland. Hillsborough is the home to numerous high-tech and clean tech manufacturing companies and emerging data centers.  In addition to the favorable tax treatment offered by the enterprise zones, the development will benefit from the mild Northwest Oregon climate. This is ideal for air site economization, which uses the outside air to cool the data center, resulting in lower overall power costs. All of these attributes were important considerations for NetApp as we worked with them during the site selection process. The second project in Northwest, which closed in October, is located in downtown Seattle. The redeveloped site for a 50,000 square-foot data center was acquired in a joint venture partnership with Clise Properties, our JV partner in the adjacent Westin Building.  In conjunction with the acquisition, we signed a long-term lease agreement with Equinix for the entire facility. And finally, during the third quarter we signed a Build-to-Suit agreement with an existing customer at one of our Silicon Valley properties. The project expands the building's existing footprint by approximately 40,000 square feet, with completion schedules for the end of first quarter of 2012.  As reflected in our results this quarter, we are expanding our Build-to-Suit program to more broadly address the trend for corporate enterprises and IT services companies to outsource their data center facilities to DLR. This option allows companies to invest their capital in growing their businesses while leveraging our real estate and data center design and construction expertise, as well as our supply chain and financial resources. Though challenging, we believe that over time we can increase our market share by offering a robust Build-to-Suit program along with our other flexible data center solutions. As to return expectations for the Build-to-Suit program, we are targeting a return on investment range of approximately 9% to 11% on an unlevered basis, which we believe is consistent with our philosophy on risk-adjusted returns. This range falls between our target cash cap rates for more stabilized assets of between 8% and 9%, and our general spec development returns projected to be 11% to 14% upon stabilization.  As stated in our leasing press release, we had good renewal activity, rolling over approximately 646,000 square feet of space resulting in a healthy 16.9% increase in GAAP rents. The majority of the renewals consisted of approximately 74,000 feet of turnkey data center renewed, which resulted in a 7.6% increase on a GAAP basis, and a small 2% decrease on a first year cash basis. And this will be made up typically in the second year with our usual rent bumps in the leases. In addition, we renewed 557,000 square feet of Powered Base Building, which renewed for a 32% increase on a GAAP basis and a 4% increase on a cash basis.  Center retention was very strong, 91% on a square foot basis for turnkey leases. On a revenue basis, turnkey leases renewed at approximately 99% of GAAP or 90% of cash rents with an average lease term of over 66 months.  Over 97% of expiring Powered Base Building space was renewed during the quarter at 120% of GAAP rents or over 94% of cash rental revenues with an average lease term of over 83 months. Across all of our market, we see active demand for new facilities. We're currently engaged with potential customers representing over 2.1 million square feet of new requirements, which is consistent with what we reported in our last call. This identified 2.1 million square feet compares to a much less 1.4 million square feet identified at year-end 2010, so we've seen over the last 10 months, quite a buildup of potential new requirements across our markets.  Turning to a couple of individual markets. In New Jersey, on an aggregate basis, we're tracking over 42 megawatts of demand plus nearly 33 megawatts of earlier stage opportunities. We believe that the increase in demand over last quarter reflects the pent up demand from financial services as well as system integrators and managed services and cloud providers that support financials and other large corporates. This compares to approximately 24 megawatts of available built out supply. At DLR, our New Jersey financial exposure is relatively small. We currently have 2 turnkey pods built or about 2.2 megawatts currently available of fully fitted-out space.  Aside from a 5,600 square-foot lease that we signed at our Piscataway property, to our knowledge no significant wholesale data center leases were signed in the third quarter. We estimate that DLR represents approximately 68% of the 16 megawatts of supply that we believe the New Jersey market has absorbed year-to-date.  In Silicon Valley, the market also appears to be in equilibrium. On an aggregate basis we're tracking nearly 26 megawatts of demand compared to 27 megawatts of currently available built out supply. Year-to-date we estimate that the market has absorbed approximately 29 megawatts of supply, and that includes a 40,000 square-foot 3 megawatts Build-to-Suit requirement we signed during the quarter.  As of New Jersey, our financial exposure at present is very manageable. We currently have 0.5 ton available in our Alfred Street property and are at conclusion on 2 turnkey pods for a total near-term availability of 2.8 megawatts in Santa Clara. Year-to-date, we estimate DLR represented approximately 16% or 14.5 megawatts of these Silicon Valley absorption. Portfolio occupancy was steady at 93.7% in the third quarter compared to 93.9% in the second quarter. This very small decrease was primarily due to new turnkey data center space that was delivered during the third quarter. Approximately 53,000 square feet of the turnkey space that was delivered, has been leased, but not yet commenced. It's important to note that the amount of space actually under lease in the portfolio increased by 244,000 square feet in the third quarter.  Same-store occupancy remained steady at 94.2% in the third quarter. Same-store NOI was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter at $132.6 million. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments was a $119.6 million in the second quarter -- I'm sorry, in the third quarter, $119.6 million in the third quarter, up slightly from $118.6 million in the second quarter.  We continue our robust construction program delivering new products to meet demand in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia Pac. During the quarter we completed over 226,000 square feet of data center space. This consists of nearly 156,000 feet of turnkey space that was over 78% leased at completion, and 15,000 square feet of PBB, Power Based Building space, that was over 86% leased. We also completed construction and delivered a 56,000 square-foot Build-to-Suit project in Amsterdam that is 100% leased with Terremark.  At quarter end, we're under construction on turnkey space totaling over 350,000 square feet, including 229,000 square feet in the U.S., nearly 15,000 square feet in Europe, and approximately 106,000 square feet in Singapore, which has been a very active market for us. Approximately 16% of this space overall has been pre-leased. For Power Base space, we're under construction on just shy of 400,000 square feet in the U.S, in Europe we had about 148,000 square feet of PBB space under construction and this includes the new Chessington redevelopment property I mentioned earlier of 130,000 square feet.  Combining the U.S. and Europe, approximately 3% of the PBB space is pre-leased, which is to be expected. Lastly, we have approximately 251,000 square feet of Build-to-Suit space under construction in the U.S., which is 100% leased, including preconstruction work and common building improvements, the total construction work in progress at the quarter end was $173 million. The estimated cost to complete the ongoing September 30 work in progress is $468 million.  So we think we're running on all cylinders here and in a very, very good position to continue to deliver our data center solutions for our customers across multiple markets that will continue to drive good growth for our company. This concludes my prepared remarks and now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein.
A. William Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our financial strategy and year-to-date capital markets activities and then briefly discuss our financial performance and revised guidance for the year.  In anticipation of ongoing challenges in the global economy, we closely monitor the Capital Markets and executed during narrow windows in the third quarter to access attractively priced capital. In addition as reported in today's earnings release, we are in the process of closing a $1.5 billion unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility, which will double the size of the current $750 million facility that is scheduled to expire next August.  We initiated efforts to modify the facility this year in response to deteriorating market conditions emanating from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In addition, we saw to substantially increase the borrowing capacity to accommodate our growing global investment program and to provide immediate liquidity for potential acquisitions that may arise from the diminishing availability of capital for Commercial Real Estate in general.  Consistent with the current facility, cap rates will remain at existing levels. Key modifications to the upsides facility include covenant levels that are adjusted to be consistent with other BBB rated REITs, and guarantees which are no longer required from subsidiaries. A $1.5 billion facility also includes the ability to borrow in U.S., Canadian, Singapore, Australian, and Hong Kong dollars, as well as euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Japanese yen denominations.  Excluding the new revolving credit facility year-to-date, we've sourced over $1.2 billion of capital, including $615 million since last quarter. These activities consisted of securing a $100 million U.S. dollar equivalent of Asia Pac revolving credit facility with a USD $100 million equivalent of accordion and the ability to borrow in Singapore and Australian dollars.  This facility is designed to act as a bridge to fund our development activity in these markets until the expanded revolver is finalized. A 7% Series E perpetual preferred offering of 11.5 million shares in September raising net proceeds of $277.4 million. Our at the market equity distribution program, which generated net proceeds during the third quarter of approximately $238 million from the issuance of approximately 4.1 million shares at an average price of $58.38.  We currently have a $160 million of availability remaining on our current ATM program. While maintaining a strong balance sheet, we reduced our overall cost of capital by exchanging the remaining $48.3 million principal balance with 4 1/8% exchangeable senior debentures due 2026 for $48.3 million for cash, and approximately 716,000 shares of common stock.  We've also converted year-to-date approximately 1,874,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, with a liquidation preference value of $486.8 million into 1 million newly issued common shares at the request of voters pursuant to the terms of the Series C convertible preferred stock. This comprised approximately 26.8% of the Series C preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2010.  Additionally, we have converted year-to-date approximately 5,933,000 shares of the Series D convertible preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $148.3 million into 3,639,000 newly issued common shares at the request of owners pursuant to the terms of the series D convertible preferred stock. This comprised 43% of the Series D preferred stock outstanding at year-end 2010.  As of the end of the day yesterday, the balance on our $750 million credit facility and our $100 million Asia Pac facility was $139.2 million net of unrestricted cash. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had $3.8 million of principal amortization remaining and no debt maturing. In 2012, excluding the revolving credit facility, and assuming extension options are exercised, we have approximately $157 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities on secured debt, which we currently plan to pay off with the expanded revolver.  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.5x at quarter end, down from 4.9x at the end of the second quarter. This reduction is due to the pay down of our revolving credit facility with proceeds from the Series E preferred offering and additional ATM issuance during the quarter. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was 3.4x at the end of the third quarter, up from 3.2x in the last quarter.  Let me now turn to the quarter’s financial results. As stated in today's earnings release, third quarter 2011 FFO of $1.01 per diluted share was down 1% from the second quarter 2011 FFO of $1.02. The decrease is primarily due to $3.6 million of transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of a redevelopment site in London and other acquisitions-related activity. And to the additional 4.1 million shares issued through our ATM program. These expenses were partially offset by a nominal lease termination fee of $600,000 and $1.9 million in foreign exchange transaction gains associated with exchange rate movements on the euro and British pound sterling draws on our revolving credit facilities. The foreign exchange gains are shown in the interest and other income line item.  FFO on a diluted basis was $121.3 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase from $119.6 million in the second quarter of 2011. After adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, third quarter 2011 core FFO was approximately 1.1 million higher than reported FFO or $1.02 per diluted share in unit. This is unchanged for the second quarter, and up 13.3% from third quarter 2010 FFO of $0.90 per diluted share and unit.  Adjusted Funds from Operations or AFFO for the third quarter of 2011 was $92.5 million, and was also unchanged from the second quarter. The diluted FFO payout ratio for the third quarter 2011 was 81%, up from 79.1% in the last quarter. EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and noncontrolling interest was $154.3 million for the third quarter of 2011, slightly down from $155 million in the second quarter of 2011, and up 17% from $131.9 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Turning to the income statement. Our digital design services formally known as POD Architectural Services, had construction management revenues of $9.4 million and expenses of $7.4 million for the quarter, which netted to an earned fee of $2 million. Due to an overlap of 2 additional contracts that commenced during the quarter along with an existing contract near completion, we recognize fees at a higher level in the quarter and we expect to recognize on a going forward basis.  Rental property operating and maintenance expense was $82.2 million in the third quarter, up 13.7% from $72.3 million in the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to expenses associated with new product coming online for future growth, and the seasonal increase in power consumption across the portfolio during the summer months. This increase was partially offset by higher tenant reimbursements.  In response to investor inquiries, we would also like to address the impact of the Solyndra bankruptcy and lease at our Fremont, California property. As of today, Solyndra is current on its rent, which is approximately $4.1 million on an annualized basis. We also have a $4.5 million letter of credit, which secures the rent obligation.  We would also like to bring your attention to the single tenant lease with a large Internet company at our Atlanta property that was scheduled to expire at the end of this year. When we acquired the asset in 2006, we attributed a portion of the purchase price to an intangible liability that has been amortized to rental revenue over the original lease term consistent with required purchase accounting rules. This liability will be fully amortized at the end of this year concurrent with the expiration of the original lease term. As a result, we estimate a reduction in non-cash rental revenue of approximately $3 million in 2012.  We would also like to note that the customer exercised its five-year fixed-rate renewal option in the third quarter. This lease and its option rights were negotiated and agreed to by the former landlord. Despite these events, we expect to generate strong growth in NOI next year.  Finally, turning to our revised guidance. We increased our midpoint and narrowed the range for our 2011 FFO guidance to between $4.02 and $4.05 per diluted share. This guidance represents expected FFO growth of 18.6% to 19.5% over 2010 FFO of $3.39 per diluted share and unit. The low end of our reported FFO guidance for 2011 reflects the variability and timing related to lease commencements, acquisition closings and possible foreign exchange losses related to exchange rate movements.  After adjusting for non-core revenue and expense items, 2011 core FFO is expected to range between $4.07 and $4.09 per diluted share and unit, which represents expected core FFO growth of 16.6% to 17.2% over 2010 core FFO of $3.49 per diluted share and unit. The following revised 2011 FFO guidance assumptions represent our current view towards our full year results and include estimated total transaction expenses.  Acquisitions of income-producing properties for the year totaling $150 million to $180 million at average cap rates of 8% to 9%, commencement of leases which will contribute $95 million to $105 million of GAAP rental revenue on an annualized basis, development and redevelopment capital expenditures of $550 million to $600 million; total G&A of $55 million to $56 million, and total transaction expenses of $6 million to $7 million.  Since the fourth quarter of 2009, we have provided the following years guidance on our third quarter call or shortly thereafter. In each year since 2009, we have raised guidance when reporting our fourth quarter results primarily because we've had a significantly better view towards the new year's projected performance.  We surveyed the practices of the top 15 REITs and found that the majority of them provide guidance on their fourth quarter call. Therefore, we have decided to provide our 2012 guidance around the time of our Investor Day meeting in New York, which we are planning to host in mid-January. Once we secure the date and venue for this event, we will be sending out invitations. The current Street consensus for 2012 is a $4.43.  Based on our recent 2012 budget projections, we believe that our core 2012 FFO per share results will be in line with this consensus. This concludes our formal remarks. We can now open the call to your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.
James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mike, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your -- a little bit more about your decision to go to Oregon with your tenant? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the read through is for the business in general given that's where a lot of the internet companies have gone and the new technology is more kind of weather-related and better cooling based on the climate up there. Just trying to get a better sense of what this means for the future of DLR.
Michael F. Foust: Sure, and it's not really new technology. It's just using different techniques for different climates and different levels of perceived customer reliability. So it's really, from our perspective, it's about working with the customer and delivering a solution that fits what they need, and they require, for their set of applications and their business. So going to Portland is a very easy thing for us to do. We have a lot of experience looking at sites and evaluating the markets, both in Oregon as well as in central Washington. So in this case, we worked with the customer and looked at actually 3 different locations in the Western United States, and working with them for what they wanted to do decided that Hillsborough, Oregon was the best site for them. And NetApp is a great company, and we're very comfortable working with them. And Portland is a very nice tech market. So we're not out in some of the more remote areas where we would perhaps have a different view. So it's just a natural progression for us for doing these Build-to-Suit type projects, where we're delivering product for customer requirements on a long-term basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, Bill, just you say you're not going to give guidance until January, but you certainly made a statement that you're comfortable based on your budgeting process of where the Street is at $4.42, which sort of implies a quarterly run rate of $1.10, $1.11 somewhere in that range. Yet in the fourth quarter you're at $0.99, this quarter, you're basically a little over $1. And so it's a pretty big gap to get over. So maybe you can talk about -- you talked about the $3 million negative on the straight-line rents for that one asset, which is $0.03 down. So what are the key items that we have to think about for 2012 that are baked in today, whether it's development that's completing, redevelopment, the acquisitions that you've bought that haven't been fully leased up, what are the big components that we should start thinking about that's driving that significant growth into next year?
A. William Stein: Well, first is the Solyndra deal, so get the $4 million of rent. They've obviously filed for bankruptcy, and we don't know whether they're going to affirm or reject the lease. So we're somewhat constrained in terms of what we can say given the fact that it is in bankruptcy and that we are potentially a creditor. But clearly I think in modeling it, it might be prudent to take out the annualized rent. It's a triple net lease, so there are also expenses associated with that asset. That's on the downside. On the upside, one of the reasons we haven't provided guidance is that we're looking at potentially a pretty significant quarter of leasing in the fourth quarter. There's an awful lot under discussion, which affects backlog. It also affects the capital plan for the quarter. But clearly, the Singapore asset in particular is performing extremely well. And we expect to be delivering space quite regularly, I guess would be the best way of putting it in 2012 in that asset. And given the -- given what's under discussion there in terms of potential leasing, I think you would see potential lease commencements occurring on a pretty regular basis sequentially in the year. So I mean the best way -- I don't know what else to tell you, Michael. There are a lot of variables right now and if we put out guidance, our core would have been right around where the Street is. I think you could look historically and see that when we’ve put out guidance at this time of year, almost invariably we raise it the next quarter because we have a better view of where the year is headed. And in fact, we frequently raise it in subsequent quarters as well in the year. So we're comfortable with where the Street is, in terms of core, I'm emphasizing core because there are transaction costs that affect reported. I don't know what else I can tell you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities.
Mitchell B. Germain - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Mike, just curious about the CenturyLink relationship, and how that's progressed now that it's been about 6 months since the merger was announced.
Michael F. Foust: It's very good. The team that we've been working with at Savvis has stayed in place from the CEO on down. So it's been very consistent working relationship, and we're looking at new opportunities to expand the relationship, both in U.S. and internationally. So it's a very good program.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Regarding the balance sheet, Bill, looks like quite a bit of I'd call it maybe pre-capitalizing ahead of what could be this significant 4Q leasing activity and the Build-to-Suits you would have. I'm just -- I'm curious as to sort of your thought process on the ATM going forward. Obviously, you viewed it as a pretty good tool in the third quarter. And just how we should be thinking about your financing activity in the sort of near to midterm.
A. William Stein: Well, we did raise a lot of equity preferred and common in the third quarter, and I did that because I was concerned -- and frankly I'm still concerned about macroeconomic risk. And I thought, in view of that, it was appropriate to delever and derisk the balance sheet, which is what we did. We’re at 4.5x net debt to EBITDA this quarter. Without any equity issuance in the quarter, in the fourth quarter, we'll be at roughly at the same level at the end of the fourth quarter. So there is really no pressing need to issue equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM. So whether or not we do so would be really opportunistic on our point, from our standpoint. We also, as I noted, we're doubling the size of the credit facility, and that's going to give us a lot more flexibility in terms of when we access the capital markets. The $750 million was a little small for us given the size of our development program, as well as some of the acquisitions we were looking at. So it's not only a $1.5 billion credit facility but it has a $750 million accordion feature so we could increase it to $2.25 billion. And I think that's -- you'll probably see the balances obviously higher now on short-term debt than they were under the former revolver simply because it's larger. I think our next -- you frequently ask the question, what is our next capital raise? And I think our next large capital raise would be unsecured bonds. Clearly, the unsecured bond market for REITs is -- hasn't -- it's basically been nonexistent since the S&P downgrade of the U.S. And we don't need to access that market immediately, clearly, but I think logically, we would be looking to term out revolver debt and we might be looking to term out in currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar to match fund on some of our non-U.S. investments.
Michael F. Foust: I would just like to add that the work that Bill and the finance team has done well all along, but especially this year in light of all the uncertainties around the Capital Markets, has really been outstanding from an operating and growth perspective. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue our growth program and to continue to deliver our solution across multiple markets and multiple continents. We were in good shape before, and now we're in terrific shape now. And that is a very powerful competitive advantage for us in the marketplace because we can provide these solutions on a go-forward basis, very readily without financing contingencies, which is very, very powerful in the market today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dave Rodgers with RBC Capital Markets.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Maybe just, I guess, help with the thought about leasing next year, to talk about the supply side and what you have available. I know you've got a lot of details in the supplement, and we'll try to go through them, but in terms of the megawatts of supply that you have available today, and then what you would be delivering without additional acquisitions over the course of next year to kind of lease up so that we can kind of think about what type of revenue number we're building up to based upon what you have and will be available, could you give some color around that, please?
Michael F. Foust: Well, we typically don't give out our KW megawatt inventory. We prefer to do it in terms of square footage because requirements can vary so much, and markets can vary so much. I can tell you right now that we have spread across 12 or 13 markets about 323,000 square feet of built out turnkey space that we expect will be absorbed in pretty short order. Similarly we have about 322,000 square feet of Powered Base Building space that's ready for customers to either use their own capital or for us to build out incrementally, so we can really manage our exposure to any particular market. And we're probably looking at completing, overall this year, about $600 million or $650 million of construction and certainly next year we'll be on that same track probably somewhat accelerated as well.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: With a similar mix between Power Base and turnkey?
A. William Stein: I would have to look at that because we really are looking at this on a market-by-market basis. Certainly, in the Asia Pac region, in Singapore and Australia, those will be almost probably entirely turnkey product in those markets. So I would expect it to probably skew further toward the turnkey.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: On the leasing activity, on the renewals that where signed, can you add a little color to the cash rents spread? I think you said it was negative 2%. I'm just trying to understand that in the context of whether or not the roughly 5 year lease terms that were signed, was this some contractually agreed to new lease rate? Or what caused the new rents to be lower than the old rents?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, I mean, so when you're looking at -- and that was only on the turnkey rents, I would say, we had dramatic increases, in some cases, on the Power Base Building rents. Really, if you're looking at the turnkey space these are typically gross rents and these gross rents are at relatively high per square foot basis and KW basis because it does include all the operating expenses net of power typically. So your increasing -- so these leases have been increasing over many times, a 7- to 10-year period or even a 5-year period, and a 3% clip on a high number. And it's very good economics for us. So sometimes when we get the end of these leases, oftentimes there is a market rent criteria in the rollover in the renewal option, and so in this case, in this particular quarter, some higher, some lower, it averaged about a 2% decrease on a cash basis, but that's going to be made up in the second year of lease with the 3% bumps that are almost entirely in there. And there are actually 2 contractual situations that were set beforehand not around market, which contributed that. So the good news is with these 3% bumps that we generally have in the leases, that small 2% decrease will be made up in the second year of the lease and then accelerate pretty rapidly going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A 2-part question. First of all, Bill, you mentioned using the ATM because of your fears over the macro environment. What does that say about capital flows into the space in particular into the private developers and owners? And then the second question is, with you kind of embracing consensus for next year, how should we think about the dividend? I know that's a board decision; we were a little surprised you didn't -- they didn’t increase the dividend this quarter. How do we think about dividend increase commensurate with, say, FFO growth?
A. William Stein: Okay. Second question first. As you said, the dividend is a board decision. We are -- I think it'll be 12 months from the next board meeting since the last board increase. So we're trying to do it on an annual schedule. I know that we got off of that a little bit and we were increasing it twice a year, but we're trying to increase it just once a year and put a more meaningful increase in place on that 1 date. So the board will have a view and we will, as a management team, will have a view of the 2012 results including taxable income at the next board meeting. And I think everyone will be in a good position to decide what the appropriate increase should be. And the increase will be, most likely, whatever the increase in taxable income is. And that's since we're paying out -- actually, we're paying out a little less than 100% of taxable income. So we end up pulling back from the next year to meet the 100% requirement. I'm sorry now, what was the other...
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: The other question was the capital flows into the private owners and developers.
A. William Stein: So the -- I think it’s -- the private debt is very challenging for this space. It has been for a while, really since the CNBS market went away. Life companies are lending to real estate in general, but we haven't seen them lending to data centers. And life centers or life companies are also focused on lending to best of class operator/sponsors. And the private companies would be less likely to fall into that category than the public companies. There is obviously the possibility to obtain bank financing, because the banks I think are looking to lend money today. So that may be one source of financing. But that's short-term money, and that's a -- as I think we all recognize, that's a risky way to finance a longer-term asset. And I think that's it. I mean private equity is certainly out there, and there's a lot of private equity to be deployed in just about anything today that moves. I mean, real estate operating companies, you name it, the private equity companies are flushed with funds. So there is really no accounting for that piece of it. I think, that clearly there are some private equity funds that have -- that are in our space that and everyone -- I think everyone on the call knows who they are. We're not aware of any new entrants from the private equity world, but it's possible that if a private equity fund has a lot of capital that it needs to deploy it may be willing to invest for a while at 100% equity with no leverage. My question, how they will achieve their return thresholds for their limiteds. And we do, frankly. But in some ways the motivation maybe more retaining asset management fees on that capital by putting it out the door rather than achieving return hurdles.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sloan Bohlen with Goldman Sachs.
Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a big picture question. Mike, you laid out what you thought the pipeline in terms of demand was. It seems like more and more that demand is coming in the form of Build-to-Suits, and I'm wondering if you could comment on how that changes, if at all, your view on holding PBB space versus building out TKD space or whether at some point building out additional spec space makes more sense.
Michael F. Foust: We'll continue to deliver spec space and we can do that very cost effectively with our POD program. And frankly, I think that will continue to be a majority of turnkey space that we deliver and lease. The Build-to-Suit program is interesting and it will add, I think, materially to our growth. But at the same time we think that combination of our spec building and the PBB where customers want to use their own capital, will continue to be strong contributors. The Build-to-Suit program is really interesting and exciting to us. But at the same time, the deals are even more lumpy than during our spec turnkey developments. So it's hard to project how much contribution they'll have. But we've laid out a pretty good track record now in the last 3 years with these more customized projects and I think we're establishing ourselves as one of the go to groups for these kinds of projects.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors.
Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Mike, it's been about a year now since you acquired 365 Main, and I was just hoping you could share your thoughts on the collocation part of that business. Do you like it? And I guess if you want to get -- do you want to get more involved with it?
Michael F. Foust: It's performed quite well for us. And that project as well as several others, especially where we have high concentrations of telecom networks, the Internet Gateway buildings, and some others in central CBD markets. Where we have pockets of space that lend themselves very well to the colo business. So we see it as a very good adjunct for us to be able to utilize space for enterprises who may not necessarily be small companies but have smaller footprint requirements. And so we'll continue to focus in that area. And I think it can be another adjunct for growth for us in 2012 in going forward. So we quite like the space. It will always be a relatively small percentage of our revenue, but it can be a meaningful adjunct to our other product especially in those more CBD locations.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Auerbach with ISI.
George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Bill, I know you're not giving 2012 guidance, but this year with the most recent guidance, you're calling for $550 million or $600 million of development or redevelopment CapEx. I was we look forward to 2012, is that a good guidepost for the kind of capital you want to put out next year, in development?
A. William Stein: I think it will be at least that. Probably a little more.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on the comments about the fourth quarter leasing, which sounds like it's shaping up to be pretty strong. Is that basically your tenants delaying the decision-making into fourth quarter? Or are you seeing an acceleration of demand there? I know the pipeline is kind of stable at 2.1 million square feet, but can you provide some color there?
Michael F. Foust: I think it's kind of the typical rhythm of real estate and deals. Oftentimes, fourth quarters, you see a lot of activity. People need to get budgets deployed. They're looking forward there at their 2012 budgets, and their operating budgets. So I think it's just part of it is seasonality. I think it's kind of a typical rhythm in the real estate world. But we have a good funnel of prospects, and continue to be working in a number of different markets as you know. So there are -- a bit of it is good momentum and a bit of is I think is seasonality.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just following up on Vincent's question. Could you talk a little bit about just markets where you are expecting to kind of see that improved leasing velocity in the fourth quarter? Is it a specific market, or is it kind of across the board? And is it domestic versus international?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. It's pretty well spread out. Certainly Singapore and Australia, relatively new markets where we're getting a lot of activity. Working with folks in London. We do have some space at Redhill. I think we have some good activity in Dallas and Phoenix, and then pockets of space in other markets we're working on with some customers in New Jersey as well, Boston, smaller requirements and we have some requirements actually in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley that we're working on as well. But it's pretty well spread out, which is good, having a diversified portfolio from investment basis as well as from a customer service basis is working very, very well for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: It's actually Manny here with Michael. You guys have discussed kind of your spending requirements and sort of what you expect to put out next year and also the amount of capital you've raised this year. But how far does that equity capital get you before you think you have to revisit the equity or preferred markets, in order to keep your debt ratios where they are?
A. William Stein: This is pretty far. We could go deep into the year. We clearly have the choice of issuing equity through the ATM to more or less match fund development when we like the share price or to issue equity in bulk. I think it's more likely that we'd issue in bulk if we have an acquisition that’s sizable, and we want to make it on a leverage neutral basis but with the growth in EBITDA and where we stand right now in terms of our debt to EBITDA, I think we have quite a bit of flexibility.
Michael F. Foust: It's really a great position to be in because we can really see clear how we're going to execute our business plans and our growth plans across 4 continents. And that's a very powerful position for us to be in.
Operator: Your last question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So I keyed in on your mention of cloud, colo, network pairing, and then of course financial services, as the drivers of demand that you identified at the beginning of the call, Mike. Can you maybe compare and contrast the demand you're seeing for your Internet Gateway properties versus the more traditional data center space right now and what rent trends are in each subset? So is demand stronger in one? Are rents more elastic or inelastic in one? I'd be interested in your thoughts.
Michael F. Foust: Boy it's hard to characterize. Typically, we have a limited amount of space available in the Internet Gateway buildings. And the ones where we do have space, it's pockets of space that will generally lend themselves to a smaller footprint, more colo-type customers or colo-providers that want to take the space. The pricing for the Internet gateways has always been strong and probably going up somewhat year-over-year after enjoying some good uplifts from 2007 to 2009, and so I don't think there's a real pattern there because of our larger footprint customers that tend to be in more suburban locations, the demand there is good as well. I wish I could give you a more clear-cut answer, but it's more kind of the footprint-size of the customers tend to, not exclusively, but tend to be smaller footprints in the CBD because of demand for colo and kind of the nature of the customers for those markets.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for questions. Gentlemen, are there any closing remarks?
A. William Stein: I'm just very pleased with the great work that our team has done to really deliver the consistent program for our customers across a wide range of markets and regions. And that's a theme, being able to deliver what the customer needs for their data center solution is something that we're really focused on, top to bottom, in our company. And so I congratulate our teams on the great work, and we're very appreciative of the support from the investor community, and continue to drive good returns for our shareholders. So I appreciate everyone's time today. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-07-28 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Digital Realty Trust 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

And this information is available on the company's website at www.digitalrealtytrust.com. Now I'd like to introduce Michael Foust, CEO; and Bill Stein, CFO and Chief Investment Officer. Following management's brief remarks, we will open the call to your questions. To stay within our one hour time limit, questions will be limited to one per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust: Great. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call everyone. My comments today will focus on providing some additional color around our leasing results, including renewals and pricing trends, as well as our recent acquisitions and construction activity. I'll also provide our view of the supply and demand fundamentals, including absorption rates for New Jersey and Santa Clara markets. Following my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Bill, who will discuss our recent financial performance, provide an update on our capital markets activity and 2011 guidance. As reported in our leasing results for the quarter, this was the second best leasing quarter in our history and best since the third quarter of 2008. We continue to see strong demand for our Turn-Key Datacenter solutions across 3 major regions: North America, Europe and Singapore. In addition, lease signings consist of customers representing a wide range of industry verticals, including software solution providers, managed services, cloud providers, financial services and Internet enterprises. We made excellent progress in Singapore, where we signed leases for approximately 80,000 square feet of Turn-Key space, including a lease with Adobe in the second quarter. We are in active negotiations with several other customers and are tracking over 45 megawatts of potential demand in the Singapore market. Other markets that experienced good activity during the quarter included Dallas, Santa Clara, San Francisco, Boston, Northern Virginia and Amsterdam. As we've stated in the past, leasing volume for both our Turn-Key and Powered Base Building products can vary quarter-to-quarter, evidenced by our lease signings through June 30, 2011, which totaled 262,000 square feet of Turn-Key and 186,000 square feet of Powered Base Building. We continue to experience strong demand across our markets for both solutions. In terms of leasing backlog for the second half of 2011, we expect 137,000 square feet of TKD leases to commence, including approximately 112,000 square feet in the third quarter and 25,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. Expected PBB lease commencements for the balance of the year totaled 263,000 square feet, which include 110,000 square feet in the third quarter and 153,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. In other leasing activity, we renewed approximately 123,000 square feet of Turn-Key and increased rates by square foot -- and increased, I should say, per square foot rates by 8% on a GAAP basis with a weighted average lease term of over 6 years. We also renewed approximately 113,000 square feet of PBB space and increased rates per square foot by 14% on a GAAP basis with a weighted average lease term of nearly 12.5 years. Lastly, we renewed over 166,000 square feet of non-technical space for a weighted average lease term of just over 8 years. The majority of this represents leases extended in our non-data center property in Fremont, California. Tenant retention was 94% on a square foot basis for Turn-Key leases. On a revenue basis, Turn-Key leases renewed at approximately 98% of GAAP or 95% of cash rents. Over 90% of expiring PBB space was renewed during the quarter at 107% of GAAP or 103% of cash rental revenues. Customer demand remained strong as reflected in our new leasing renewal results. We currently are engaged with potential customers representing over 2.1 million square feet of new requirements. And that's slightly ahead of the 2.0 million square feet we reported on our last call. This 2.1 million square feet compares to 1.4 million square feet of new requirements at year end 2010. These customer prospects continue to come from a variety of industry verticals such as financial services, and this includes internal cloud deployments, energy, consumer products, telecom networks, managed services, including cloud services, managed hosting, colocation and system integrators. In New Jersey, on an aggregate basis, we are tracking 25.7 megawatts of demand compared to 24.8 megawatts of available built-out supply. This data indicates that the market is essentially in equilibrium. Year-to-date, we estimate that the market has absorbed approximately 16 megawatts of supply, surpassing 2010's full year absorption estimated to be 13 megawatts. Our Turn-Key product continues to represent an important solution for New Jersey's enterprise customers with its dedicated UPS infrastructure, especially for the financial services, as well as the system integrators and managed services cloud providers that support the financials. In Santa Clara, on an aggregate basis, we are tracking 21 to 27 megawatts of demand compared to 27.7 megawatts of currently available supply. Year-to-date, we estimate that the market has absorbed approximately 29 megawatts of supply, which also surpasses last year's total absorption estimated to be 25.6 megawatts. At DLR, we are currently under construction on 2 Turn-Key PODs and have 1.5 POD available for a total near-term availability of 2.8 megawatts in Santa Clara. We continue to closely monitor this market and maintain our disciplined approach to managing our exposure. As we've said in many occasions, our development strategy is to bring on supply incrementally to meet market demand for our Turn-Key solution on a just-in-time basis. This approach allows us to closely manage our capital allocations while satisfying our customer's data center requirements. With our global footprint, sales and operating platform and our ability to a deliver data center in 20 weeks or less, we believe that we are in excellent position to capture customer demand while maintaining our targeted, unlevered cash returns of 11% to 14%. In fact, year-to-date, for our Turn-Key solution, we've achieved a weighted average unlevered cash return on cost of 13.9%. Portfolio occupancy was up 0.4% to 93.9%, as several weeks assigned earlier in the year commenced during the quarter. This was offset in part from new Turn-Key data center space that was delivered during the second quarter. Same-store occupancy increased to 94.2% in the second quarter, up from 93.8% in the previous quarter, also benefited from the commencement of new leases. Second quarter same-store NOI increased to $132.2 million, or 3.7%, over the first quarter. This primary related to increased rental revenues of properties in the same-store pool. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, was $118.6 million in the second quarter, up 3% from $115 million in the first quarter. Moving on to our construction activity. During the quarter, we completed and converted over 374,000 square feet of data center space. This consists of over 98,000 square feet of Turn-Key space that was over 50% leased and nearly 276,000 square feet of Powered Base Building space that was over 90% leased. At quarter end, we are under construction on Turn-Key space totaling over 245,000 square feet in the U.S., over 66,000 square feet in Europe and nearly 61,000 square feet in Singapore. Approximately 37% of this space in total is pre-leased. For PBB space, we were under construction on approximately 492,000 square feet in the U.S., including 800 Central Expressway in Santa Clara, Beaumeade Circle in Northern Virginia for Equinix and a major expansion project underway at our Chandler property in the Phoenix market. In Europe, we had about 24,000 square feet of PBB space under construction. Combining U.S. and Europe, approximately 34% of this space is pre-leased. Lastly, we are nearing completion of the build-to-suit project in Amsterdam, which is 100% leased to Terremark and Verizon. Including pre-construction work and common building improvements, the total construction work in progress at quarter end was just under $200 million. The estimated cost to complete the ongoing June 30, 2011 work in progress is $335 million. Turning now to our acquisition activity. Earlier this week, we announced our entry into the Australian data center market with the purchase of an 8.6 acre development site in Sydney for approximately AUD $10.1 million. This site, located in Erskine Park, which is an industrial precinct in the Western Sydney employment hub, adds an important market to our expansion in the Asia-Pac region. We have permits in place to develop up to approximately 200,000 square feet of data center space, which we will develop in 2 equal phases. We plan to break ground in September in the first phase, 100,000 square feet of shell, and which will be capable of supporting 4 1440 kW Turn-Key PODs. The first 2 PODs are scheduled to be delivered upon completion of the shell and core in approximately 12 months. The Sydney market is a robust business environment with a limited supply of data center space available to meet the customer demand. Traditionally, colocation managed services and regional telecom providers have been the source of data center space in Australia, aside from the do-it-yourself option. We believe that our suite of flexible data center solutions will be a significant benefit to customers who are expanding their IT operations in the region. We're very excited about this development and look forward to updating you on our progress there. On Tuesday, we completed the acquisition of a redevelopment site in Chessington, England, about 17 miles southwest of central London, and 8 miles inside the M25. The purchase price was GBP 12.9 million. With our existing facilities nearly fully leased, this acquisition provides us with additional inventory to meet customer demand in London, a key market for financial services, corporate enterprise, telecom network providers, large system integrators and managed services companies. The building delivers -- will deliver approximately 130,000 square feet and is capable of supporting 5 1440 kW Turn-Key PODs with a total IT capacity of over 8 megawatts. We are currently tracking approximately 30 megawatts of demand in the market. This includes a number of requirements of 6 megawatts or more of contiguous space. At this time, few facilities are capable meeting these specifications in the Greater London area. In June, we acquired the non-controlling ownership interest in Datacenter Park Dallas from our joint venture partner for approximately $53 million. This follows the recent completion lease-up of 1232 Alma Road, which is Phase 1 of the development. The 105,000 square foot multi-tenant facility is fully leased to customers that reflect Dallas' diverse data center customer base. We are currently underway on the second phase of the development at 900 Quality Way and expect to deliver the first 1125 kW Turn-Key POD in the first quarter of 2012. The total building size of that phase is 112,000 square feet and is designed for 6 Turn-Key PODs with a 6,750 kW of total IT load. We are currently tracking approximately 32 megawatts of total demand with only about 3 megawatts of completed inventory available. As I mentioned on our last call in April 15, we acquired a 39-acre site that is contiguous to our campus in Ashburn, Virginia for a purchase price of just over $17 million. This site will provide future inventory for our campus to meet the ongoing demand from both new and existing customers. We have remaining 28,700 square feet of Turn-Key or just over 2 megawatts of IT capacity in building up. In the market overall, we're tracking about 37 megawatts of demand. And this is compared to an estimated available supply of 34.4 megawatts. In terms of the balance of our acquisition pipeline, we are under contract on a number of sites in markets that would have future supply to meet customer demand. We anticipate closing out a site in Melbourne in the third quarter. Both Sydney and Melbourne are markets that have strong demand for wholesale data center space from financial services, managed services colo, as well as from government applications. In addition to the new London redevelopment property in Europe, we're in a process of acquiring development sites that will provide inventory for Paris and Dublin. We expect these transactions to close by year end 2011. We are actively pursuing and negotiating the acquisition of a number of stabilized assets and build-to-suit opportunities. We're tracking approximately $200 million to $300 million of potential income properties and about $300 million of build-to-suit opportunities that are under consideration right now. The market is competitive for income properties, and we are maintaining our investment discipline. This concludes my prepared remarks. And I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein.
A. William Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our year-to-date capital market activities and then briefly discuss our financial performance and revised guidance for the year. Year-to-date, we've raised approximately $615 million of new capital from the following sources: the $400 million unsecured 10-year note offering with an interest rate of 5.25% per yield -- per annum, rather, yielding 5.79%; the issuance of approximately 3.6 million shares under the company's at-the-market equity distribution programs for net proceeds totaling about $215 million at an average price of $60.79. We currently have approximately $361.6 million of availability remaining on the new ATM program. Consistent with our goal of migrating towards an unsecured debt financing strategy and reducing interest expense, we paid off $116.5 million of secured debt this quarter with interest rates ranging from 5% to 6.72%. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid a maturity, the $25 million of 7% Series A unsecured notes under the Prudential Shelf Facility. As of the end of the day yesterday, the balance on our $750 million revolving credit facility net of unrestricted cash was $344.7 million. We've notified the administrative agent that we intend to exercise the one year option to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to the end of August 2012. Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. As stated in today's earnings release, second quarter 2011 FFO of $1.02 per diluted share and unit was unchanged from the first quarter 2011 FFO of $1.02 per diluted share and unit and up 34.2% from the second quarter 2010 FFO of $0.76 per diluted share and unit. After adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses of revenue streams, second quarter 2011 core FFO was approximately $1.1 million higher than reported FFO, but rounded to $1.02 on a per diluted share and unit basis. These non-core expenses included a non-cash expense related to the exchange of $4.6 million of our 4.125% Exchangeable Debentures, a prepayment fee associated with the payoff of the mortgage in 3 Corporate Pl. and transaction expenses incurred in connection with potential acquisitions. Second quarter 2011 core FFO per diluted share and unit was down 1% from first quarter core FFO of $1.03 per diluted share and unit, primarily related to the issuance of nearly 2.9 million shares under our at-the-market equity distribution program during the second quarter and increased interest resulting from the $400 million 5.25% 10-year unsecured notes issued in early March, which was used to pay down our revolving credit facility. These 2 items were partially offset by increased net operating income. Adjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, for the second quarter of 2011 was $92.5 million compared to our first quarter 2011 AFFO of $93.7 million. The decrease is primarily due to higher straight-line rents and cash leasing commissions paid, this was partially offset by higher non-cash real estate depreciation. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter of 2011 was 79.1% compared to last quarter of 75.4%. EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and noncontrolling interests was $155 million for the second quarter of 2011, up 3.3% from $150.1 million in the first quarter 2011 and up 34.8% from $115 million for the second quarter 2010. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.9x at quarter end versus 5x in the first quarter. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio remained steady at 3.2x at the end of the second quarter. Turning to the income statement. Our POD Architecture Services and construction management revenues, up $13.8 million and expenses of $11.2 million for the quarter, which netted to an earned fee for a specific contract of $2.6 million versus $80,000 last quarter. Total earned fees today under this contract represent approximately 59% of total currently budgeted revenues for the entire project. We expect to earn the remaining fees over the next 2 quarters. G&A was $14.1 million, up 13.5% from $12.4 million in the first quarter. The increase is primarily due to the continued international growth of the company, which has resulted in increased staffing requirements, including expat taxes and professional fees. In addition, our Board of Directors' annual stock award grants were issued fully vested and were expensed during the second quarter. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expenses were 5.3% in the quarter compared to 6.4% in the second quarter of 2010. The important takeaway here is that as we continue to grow our business, we are nevertheless increasing our operating leverage. Interest expense was also higher in the second quarter over the first quarter, due to a full quarter of additional interest expense from the issuance of the $400 million of notes mentioned earlier. Preferred dividends decreased to $4.7 million at the quarter end from $6.5 million in the last quarter due to the conversion activity during the second quarter. Finally, turning now to our revised guidance. As stated in the press release, we are revising our 2011 FFO guidance to between $3.99 and $4.05 per diluted share and unit, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint. Due to the potential for higher transaction expenses and uncertainty around the timing of lease commencements, we are not increasing the high end of our guidance at this time. However, excluding transaction expenses and other non-core items, we expect 2011 core FFO to meet or potentially exceed the high end of our revised guidance range. This concludes my prepared remarks. We can now open the call to your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sloan Bohlen of Goldman Sachs.
Sloan Bohlen: Mike, just a quick question for you. Obviously, it's a topic that's come up before about Internet gateway users potentially shifting to owning their own facilities. But a recent article showed that they're also in leasing space from wholesalers, leasing at shorter-term leases. I wonder if, one, that's a trend that you guys are seeing in your own portfolio? And two, if you could maybe kind of frame what percentage of demand outstanding is made up of these Internet gateway users?
Michael F. Foust: Well, if I understand what you're asking about, telecom network providers, colocation, managed services providers, financial services companies, it's a pretty wide range of -- and financial services trading, securities trading, commodity trading, it's a pretty wide range of users that are attracted to the network density and the Internet gateways, so...
Sloan Bohlen: I guess, Mike, I was maybe trying to get more at the Googles and Facebooks of the world.
Michael F. Foust: Oh, those aren't Internet gateway customers for us. Those customers are more standalone and oftentimes in some multi-tenants, but more often in single-tenant facilities. And as has always been the case, those -- I tend to call them Internet enterprise customers, your Microsofts, Googles, Facebooks, they always have and always will rely mostly on their own owned facilities. And that's a trend that hasn't changed in the 7 years we've been public. So it's a good category for us. It's about 10% of our revenues, which has been a pretty stable percentage over the years. But we don't see any change there in our portfolio experience. And we think it will continue to -- that group will continue to be around 10% of our revenues.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: It's Manny here with Michael. Just had a question. In Dallas, there's been a significant amount of new development recently, and I was wondering what gives you enough confidence to buy the rest of the Datacenter Park asset?
Michael F. Foust: Well, we haven't seen much development actually of built-out space in Dallas. So we see a lot more demand than we see supply of built-out space. So by acquiring the minority ownership from our partner, it gives us a lot more operating flexibility to accelerate our building of that site. I mean, we've got 68 acres and over 750,000 feet of structures on the site. In addition, we have pads for build-to-suit. We have a potential for 90 megawatts. So we think this is a great long term -- we've got our Dallas portfolio demand set and supplies set for the next several years there. So it worked out well for us, it worked out well for our partner, because we see a real lack of built-out space in that Dallas market.
Emmanuel Korchman: So what's been your all-in cost with that asset? The yield if you can give it?
Michael F. Foust: We're not giving that detail out of this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: My first question is just really regarding the acquisition pipeline. It sounds like things may be a bit more competitive. But maybe 1 or 2 deals may have slipped from the pipeline. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color around what you're seeing in the market and where you're seeing assets or flow?
Michael F. Foust: Yes. I mean, there's a limited number of properties that are of the quality and tenant-quality -- if you're talking about income-producing properties that are more stabilized.
Jordan Sadler: Yes, income-producing.
Michael F. Foust: Yes, yes. So there's just -- it's a relatively small universe, though, as I mentioned, we're tracking and engaging on about $200 million and $300 million of income properties today. And in addition, we're seeing a lot more activity on the build-to-suits. And for us, that's a really interesting way that we can effectively make income-producing investments, utilizing our acquisition and development capability. And we think that's going to bear some really interesting fruit for us going forward. And we're engaged on about $300 million of build-to-suit opportunities right now that we've got under consideration.
Jordan Sadler: And markets, is it domestic or European? The acquisitions and the build-to-suits?
Michael F. Foust: It's mostly -- for the income properties and build-to-suits right now, it's mostly domestic. Though internationally, there's always a couple of portfolios that are out there that may or may not be opportunities that we continue to monitor. But that's not part of that $200 million, $300 million.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that's helpful. And Bill, just real quick, on the debt strategy here, I see you seeing prepaying and reducing some of this secured debt. But at the same time, the line of credit is being utilized increasingly. What are sort of your thoughts strategically here? Is the unsecured market looking attractive to you guys here or what?
A. William Stein: Well, it's definitely in unsecured market. Tenure treasuries are under 3%, it's a pretty good benchmark. And so I think that you could see us coming into the bond market once things stabilize in Washington. We might also consider a potential preferred, which should be more of a retail product.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson: Mike, can you just talk a little bit about the sort of trend on leasing? I mean, you talked earlier on the pricing. It seems very stable, and that was very helpful. Can you talk about what you're seeing today in terms of tenant's desire on the length of lease? And then also, sort of what percentage of your leases are now phasing in over an extended period of time?
Michael F. Foust: Sure, yes. If you look kind of quarter-to-quarter, pricing has maintained very stable overall and at good levels, good strong returns, as I mentioned. So we're very satisfied with them, and I think because of the quality of our product and our ability to perform, were able to sometimes achieve somewhat of a premium in the marketplace. Lease lengths tend to be, for the data center space, we are averaging over 8 years lease terms, and I think that's been pretty steady, 7 years to 8 years, for our kind of average, weighted average lease terms. So that seems to be very consistent. We expect build-to-suits will be probably more in the 10 years to 15 years range. And so as those start to execute, we'll be lengthening those a little bit.
Robert Stevenson: And then on percentage of leases that are sort of phasing in over extended period of time?
Michael F. Foust: Well, I wouldn't say extended. Most leases -- customers usually have a couple of months of ramp-up. And it will vary from tenant-to-tenant, lease-to-lease. And sometimes, there might be a ramp-up based on our delivery of a space as well, where lease commencements will be upon completing different phases of Turn-Key space.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, but you're not seeing the need to write down the phase stuff in over 9-, 12-, even 18-month periods?
Michael F. Foust: No. Usually not that extended a period, no.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.
James C. Feldman: I was hoping you guys could discuss the recent government announcement of shutting down a bunch of data centers and kind of what you think the impact will be on the competitive landscape and then what you think the impact will be on DLR specifically?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. Our initial sense is it's not going to have very much of an effect at all, positive or negative. I think it's more likely to be a positive effect because if the government is going to consolidate, then there could be a need to consolidate -- as we see in the corporate world, you need new facilities into which to consolidate. From looking at the preliminarily list -- I mean, they made this announcement about a year ago as well. It's kind of the second time around for this announcement. And from some of the additional comments that have been made, it sounds like a lot of these data centers are very small. 2,000, 3,000 feet embedded in office buildings or other facilities that aren't acquisition opportunities, and they aren't additional demand or additional supply, I should say, putting in place in the market. So it remains to be seen as GSA and DOD and NSA and some of these other department start kind of bringing out these facilities. Some of them -- I would guess that the great majority will never see the light of day to the broader market, because they're embedded in already operating facilities.
James C. Feldman: And then in terms of the opportunities set for you or your competitors?
Michael F. Foust: It's unknown. It's unknown.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of John Stewart of Green Street Advisors.
John Stewart: Mike, I was wondering, how much of the 16 megawatts of net absorption in New Jersey have you guys captured?
Michael F. Foust: Oh gosh. Oh let me think. I know it's probably close to 100,000 feet roughly. And let's see, it's probably between 10 megawatts, 11 megawatts.
John Stewart: Okay. And with respect to the competitive pricing environment for income properties, what are you seeing on pricing, particularly on properties that you are -- can't make work, they're are going to somebody else?
Michael F. Foust: Where we've lost business lately, it's really been for a lack of supply in our part, rather than pricing.
John Stewart: I'm sorry, I was referring to the acquisition pipeline.
Michael F. Foust: Oh, I'm sorry. So you're asking if deals have gone away from us on the pricing basis?
John Stewart: Right. What are you seeing?
Michael F. Foust: There have been a couple that have dropped either into low 7s cap rates or mid-7s cap rates. And then we've got -- our capital allocation model, it's more fruitful not to dip that low. But I think we'll see a number of opportunities that are kind of more in the 8s or 9s, depending on tenant mix and location and build-out. But yes, for us, on a couple of these deals, when they dip that low, it's better for us to maintain our discipline.
John Stewart: Sure. Well, what markets would those be in, and who is buying in the 7s?
Michael F. Foust: Private REITs primarily, looking for return, looking for cash flow or even at prices that we might consider 2x replacement costs. We've seen a couple deals in Texas markets like that.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Suzanne Kim of Crédit Suisse.
Suzanne Kim: Just calling about the -- you had a 24% retention for the Turn-Key properties. Where do tenants go if -- you can only retain 24%. Do they go and build their own facilities? Or they go into competitive product?
Michael F. Foust: No, no. We had 94%. 94%.
Suzanne Kim: Oh, I apologize.
Michael F. Foust: Yes, sorry.
Suzanne Kim: Yes, it's okay. And then the other question I had was in construction management costs. You talked about that 59% was unallocated in the second quarter. So I'm just trying to think of a good run rate in, like, in terms of modeling, construction management revenue and expenses going forward?
Michael F. Foust: Oh, It's going to vary widely from project-to-project. And I think in the particular case that Bill was referring to, a lot of our cost were upfront, so the revenues coming in will be largely cash flow to us, because our costs were incurred upfront. But it's going to vary so widely by project-by-project and geography-to-geography. I would hesitate to try to give you a rule of thumb on that.
A. William Stein: Yes, that's really lumpy income.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.
William A. Crow: A couple of questions. Any update on the government consolidation efforts in Australia and where your bid stands and maybe the timing of an announcement?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, there are -- the near term initiative is the state of New South Wales, and they've extended their decision-making timeframe by about another 6 months. We're hoping that they'll make a decision sooner than that. We are one of 2 finalists for that requirement. That would be in Sydney and then on a university campus north of Sydney. So we are hopeful, but we're not counting on it. So we're moving ahead with the first phase of the Erskine Park project regardless and planning on that to be multi-tenant, the first phase, if we're not successful on the government. Though if we are, then we'll start the second phase straightaway to meet the multi-tenant demand that we are seeing in the market.
William A. Crow: Can you just remind me of the scope of that consolidation effort?
Michael F. Foust: We would be -- it would take the entire phase-in over the entire 100,000-foot first phase. And then a smaller requirement on the university campus north of there.
William A. Crow: Then the second question is we recognize the redevelopment platform is a large driver of your same-store growth. Help us understand what the delivers are going to look like in 2012 versus 2011, so we can think about where same-store growth could potentially be?
Michael F. Foust: That's a really good question. We haven't published that information yet, and we probably will not kind of put that out there until later this year. No, probably with the third quarter call. But I would say -- my sense is that it's probably going to be at fairly similar, the same level of construction delivery as we're seeing this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Just another follow-up on the acquisition pipeline of income-producing. Can you give us a sense of how many projects that entails, just so we can get a sense of the size of the deals you're looking at?
Michael F. Foust: I'd rather not talk about that at this point, because we're in various stages of discussions. But I would say, a typical deal would be in the $50 million range.
Vincent Chao: And then just trying to get a better understanding too of how you're thinking about deployment between development properties versus acquisition and income. It sounds like the income-producing maybe is dropping off a little bit as pricing gets more competitive. Do you look at the development projects completely separately? Or is it sort of bouncing the entire pie?
Michael F. Foust: I tend to think of the build-to-suits and the income investments as kind of part of one category. Because we're -- it's not the spec development that our  construction program, development program is focused on. And if you look at combination, we've got $500 million to $600 million of offered active opportunities, combining the build-to-suits and the income properties. And then we'll complete about $550 million of construction this year we're planning in that range. That's more our spec development, ground-up, as well as redeveloping from our redevelopment inventory. So as I tend to -- I put the build-to-suits, because they income-producing upon completion, in a similar category as the income producing properties. And the returns are similar as well.
Vincent Chao: Okay. So I mean, if it's say, if the income-producing opportunity set includes the build-to-suits, it was looking even more robust than it is, it wouldn't have had any impact on your decision to go forward with the other development properties that you've been buying?
Michael F. Foust: No, no. Not at all. Because on our more kind of spec development, that $500 million, $550 million of construction. That's really delivering product where we're seeing demand in these various markets that we're active in.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Todd Weller of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Todd C. Weller: I have 2 questions. The first question is in Northern Virginia. Equinix appears to be marketing larger business suites, and they seem more akin to wholesale offering versus colo in their DC data center, which is leased from Digital. So I wanted to get your thoughts on this. Also, kind of latest thoughts on wholesale colo convergence and how you think about the potential dynamics where existing tenants could become more competitive with you guys?
Michael F. Foust: Yes. That's a good question, and it's really not a new phenomenon. For folks like Equinix, they have a lot of customers that continue to grow and expand and grow in their facilities in the larger customers. And so you're going to get overlapped, and sometimes we'll have customers in some of our smaller footprint requirements that they're more, kind of, smaller footprint colo types as well, though the great majority of our focus is on the larger footprint customers, and the great majority of somebody like Equinix is on the smaller footprint customers that need more hands-on and network services. So the dividing line oftentimes is more kind of what level of additional services does the tenant require, and how much hands-on requirements or network requirements do they require. And are they an existing customers as well?
Todd C. Weller: And then the second question is on the Silicon Valley market. If we rewind 2 quarters ago, a lot of concern around that market. I think you guys were pretty cautious and saying, "Look, we have some capacity, we'll lease it up and see how things shake out." It does feel like there's been a fare amount of healthy activity in that market, and it seems like you're a bit less cautious on that market. Is that the right read?
Michael F. Foust: You could say that. I mean, we're confident on the market, we're confident on the demand. There's certainly a lot of products come online, over the last quarter even, that had been under construction obviously for the past year. And we have been more cautious about bringing on a lot of Turn-Key space. In retrospect, we probably should have been more aggressive. And we'll maintain a reasonable pace of deliveries, because we are seeing demand grow. What's interesting about Silicon Valley is that new demand comes out of nowhere. And you'll see very large requirements from a lot of the technology companies, social networking, software services providers, and their businesses are growing so quickly that, that demand builds pretty rapidly in that market. So we think, while there's a lot of supply, it will get absorbed in an orderly fashion.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Dave Rodgers of RBC Capital Markets.
David Rodgers: Mike, can you update us on Savvis' activities in the market, I guess, since their merger? And have you been able to continue to do deals with them?
Michael F. Foust: Yes. As you know, now that Savvis is part of CTL, as we've seen in the press, the Savvis organization and management team is taking the lead for the data center business in CTL broadly. A lot of that was historically from the Qwest side, and Qwest has always been a very large top 5 customer of ours as well. So we continue to be actively engaged with the Savvis management team. They're a great customer of ours. And we're exploring different ways that we can continue to help them to grow. Because they certainly have a very strong growth plan for their portfolio. So I'm confident we'll continue to be -- see us doing more business with the Savvis team.
David Rodgers: Great. And then second question, I know you've never been a huge fan of the Chicago suburbs. It seems like some of the public and private competitors have had more success there recently with cloud applications and other services. Would you look more aggressively to Chicago, given your success in the CBD market, to expand there?
Michael F. Foust: Yes, both for the more CBD, as well as some suburban sites. We're virtually -- I don't know, we might be 100% full or 350 Sirmac [ph] at this point. We do have some space at Printer's Square on Federal Street that's more network-oriented type space. So we're definitely looking at new opportunities to expand in Chicago.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Chris Lucas of Robert W. Baird.
Christopher R. Lucas: Mike, just a kind of a bigger picture question. Some of the market dynamics you've described suggests that a number of the U.S. markets are just much more mature and in balance right now. And I guess I'm just wondering, as you look out, how you're think about capital allocation in the U.S. relative to Europe and Asia and how your incremental capital spend will look going forward?
Michael F. Foust: Certainly. We're seeing good opportunities in Asia and in Western Europe as well in the markets in which we've been active. So I think, you'll -- I'm confident you'll see more capital allocation in Asia-Pac, certainly because it's a new region for us. And the Singapore project is going extremely well, and we're confident on Sydney and Melbourne, and we're working hard to try to acquire our first opportunity in Hong Kong. So you'll definitely see us allocate more capital internationally on a dollar amount. As a percentage, it's hard to tell right now, because we've got so much great opportunity, development opportunity here in the States with a lot of different markets, Silicon Valley, Phoenix, Northern Virginia, northern New Jersey, Boston, if we find new opportunities in Chicago. So there's just a lot of markets here in the U.S. that are going to continue to keep us busy, but you'll certainly see a greater dollar amount invested in both Asia and Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Peterson of Jefferies.
Jonathan Petersen: I guess kind of piggybacking on the last question talking about the Sydney and I guess the Melbourne market as well. I just wanted to get some color on how you see the supply demand characteristics in those markets? Maybe compare them to some of the U.S. markets with, I guess, where do we draw the closest comparisons? And then what do rents look like there compared to other markets in the world?
Michael F. Foust: Sure. I mean, we like both Sydney and Melbourne because they are such major hubs of commerce, finance, technology. And that's where -- that's kind of our first priority when we're look at new markets or deploying capital in existing markets. Is there a lot of commercial activity and growth, and we're certainly seeing them in both of those markets. And what's interesting is that there's very little built-out space available. So for these new requirements that we're pursuing, space has to be built. There's literally no existing space for larger enterprise deployments. There's colocation space for smaller footprint deployments, but there's really existing today very little built-out space. So we see it as a really ripe opportunity for us. I think we'll see returns on our speculative builds, similar to what we're seeing in our North American markets, though lease rates and costs, development costs, are certainly higher in the Australian markets.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay, and then, I guess, looking at -- you guys sent Adobe to the development that you guys have going in Singapore. Do you guys see that as a niche focus for you as you expand to some of the new Asian markets to be able to market to some U.S.-based companies that are expanding internationally? And I guess, on the other side of that, do you find you have a difficult time being an outsider appealing to local tenants?
Michael F. Foust: Yes and no, to the first part and the second part. In terms of international customers, especially existing customers, U.S. multinationals, a lot of our demand in Singapore come from existing relationships and relationships that we have with customers in Silicon Valley and across the U.S. and a lot of existing customers. So that's almost half, probably, of our potential demand for Singapore, are existing customers of ours who are looking to expand, or companies with whom we have banking relationships. Singapore is a very interesting market because it is a hub of international commerce overall. Everything from shipping to finance. So it's a natural for us. And we don't feel any inhibitions or a bit that we're at a disadvantage at all by being an international firm in that market. And I think we have a great presentation and a great reception from international companies and in companies that are domicile in the region. Similarly -- well, actually, Sydney and Melbourne, or the Australian markets in general are different because those markets really are the -- a large amount of domestic, Australia domestic activity. And our reception there has been extremely positive. And we have a very good and, I think, well-deserved reputation internationally because of our platform, our ability to deliver high-end enterprise solutions. And frankly, our financial stability and strength is really what -- pretty widely recognized especially in Asia-Pac. I think at this point, we've come up against our hour time limit. So we're -- we appreciate everyone's focus and good questions today and focus on DLR. And I want to thank our team for continuing to perform in a very extraordinary way. And we're very, very positive about what we see ahead for our data center markets. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Explanations of such non-GAAP items and reconciliations to net income are contained in the company’s supplemental operating and financial data for the third quarter of 2009 furnished to the Securities & Exchange Commission and this information is available on our website at www.DigitalRealtyTrust.com.  Now, I would like to introduce Michael Foust, CEO and Bill Stein, CFO and Chief Investment Officer. Following managements’ brief remarks, we will open the call to your questions. To manage the call in a timely manner, please limit your questions to two per caller. If you have additional questions, feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Foust : I’ll begin with a brief overview of Digital Retail Trust. Then, I’ll review the success of our portfolio operations during the quarter. Following my remarks Bill Stein will discuss our recent financing accomplishments, our third quarter financial performance and our 2009 revised guidance. Digital Retail Trust is the leading owner and manager of technology real estate. Our portfolio currently contains 78 properties now totaling 13.8 million rentable square feet and this excludes one property, the Westin Building in Seattle that’s held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.  Our properties are located in 27 metro areas across North America and Europe. Our portfolio also includes approximately 1.9 million square feet of space held for redevelopment which continue to be a very important source of growth for the company. DLR provides a wide variety of datacenter facility solutions including our turnkey datacenter, our power based building and build-to-suit datacenters for domestic and international corporate customers.  Our properties serve a wide range of industry vertical markets including information technology, Internet enterprises, financial services, telecom network providers, energy companies and other Fortune 1000 firms. We are recognized as an industry leader in datacenter design and investment.  Moving on to our operating results for the third quarter, portfolio occupancy excluding space held for redevelopment increased slightly to 95.2% at quarter end compared to 94.8% at the end of the second quarter and 95.2% for the same period in 2008. The increase in occupancy is attributed to leases commencing during the quarter on new completed datacenter space entering the operating portfolio.  We completed three significant acquisitions during the quarter. In September we acquired a controlling joint venture interest in a very well located redevelopment project in suburban Dallas in Richardson Texas. Formerly known as Collins Technology Park, the new Digital Realty Data Center Park Dallas consists of seven very robust buildings totaling approximately 795,000 square feet of potential powered based building space. These buildings range in size from 15,000 feet to 250,000 square feet. The 69 acre property also contains develop land sites for ground up build-to-suits and our own private utility substation with 40 megawatts of immediate power availability which is really expandable up to 125 megawatts. With this high capacity substation in place, we are supplied with power at rates generally 25% below most customers in the Dallas region. Combined with our industry leading datacenter construction costs, we offer tenants very lower cost of occupancy in the Dallas region. In addition, we acquired 444 Toyama Drive, a highly improved 42,000 square foot 100% leased datacenter located in Sunnyvale California. We also acquired the remaining non-controlling interest from our partner in 1525 Comstock Street. This is a fully leased 42,000 square foot property located in Santa Clara. The two stabilized investments yield an annual NOI of $5 million and were acquired for a total purchase price of approximately $43.9 million. The blended cash cap rate is consistent with our 2009 guidance of 10% to 12% given on the last call. In terms of our leasing activities, for the quarter ended September 30, we commenced leases totaling approximately 101,000 square feet of space. This includes approximately 90,000 square feet of turnkey datacenter leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $187 per square foot and we leased approximately 11,000 square feet of non-technical space at an average GAAP rental rate of $25 per square foot. Year-to-date we commenced over 666,000 square feet of datacenter. This includes 317,000 square feet of turnkey at an average GAAP rental rate of $178 per square foot and includes 174,000 square feet of powered based building at an average rental rate of $62 including conversion for foreign currencies. In addition, we commenced 176,000 square feet of non-technical space at an average GAAP rental rate of $16.  Lease commencements year-to-date as of September 30 are estimated to contribute approximately $54.2 million of incremental revenue recognized in 2009. Leases signed year-to-date totaled approximately 278,000 square feet of space. This includes 216,000 square feet of turnkey datacenter leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $176, 5,000 square feet of power based building leased at an average GAAP rental rate of $32 per square foot and approximately 57,000 square feet of non-technical space at an average GAAP rental rate of $20. We continue to see longer sale cycles for lease approvals and signing often requiring customer board level approval because of the significant total capital commitment involved in these large IT deployments. In spite of the longer lead times we remain on track to meet our 2009 expectations and we see very positive leasing momentum heading in to 2010. As reflected in our year-to-date results the great majority of demand is for the turnkey product reflecting customer capital constraints also reflecting our extremely cost effective design and the very quick time to market delivered by DLR. Currently our sales team is engaged with direct discussion with over a million gross square feet of new datacenter prospects in nine of our primary markets. This is consistent with the level of demand we are tracking over a year ago. Overall, we have identified approximately four million square feet of potential requirements requiring new datacenter space in our markets. We continued to achieve unlevered NOI returns on all costs of 12% to 15% for our new [inaudible] and turnkey construction. Consistent with our last reporting period, the most active industry categories are IT service providers represented by Equinox, Telex and major network providers, system integrators such as IBM and financial services firms such as Nomura. Our lease renewal program is performing quite well with lease rents increasing on average and we continue to see a number of existing tenants choosing to renew their leases early. During the quarter we signed 418,000 square feet of renewals bringing the year-to-date total after adjusting for short term extension to approximately one million square feet. Overall, we’ve renewed approximately 86% of eligible square footage, 111% cash rent and 112% of GAAP rent for those renewals. This includes approximately 27,000 square feet of turnkey space and an average GAAP rental rate of $146 reflecting an 8% increase on a GAAP basis and 4% cash basis over the previous rates.  These statistics also include 751,000 square feet of power based building data space and an average GAAP rental of $32 per square foot. This reflects a 30% increase on a GAAP basis and a 17% increase on a cash basis over the previous rates.  Turning to our redevelopment program, we are currently underway on construction projects on high demand projects in [inaudible] and Europe on approximately 143,000 square feet of turnkey datacenter space in several locations. 47% of that amount is leased. We’re underway on 135,000 square feet of new power based building at our Ashburn Virginia campus. During the quarter we delivered 59,000 square feet of turnkey space and 8,000 square feet of power based building all of which is 100% leased. We currently have approximately 66,600 feet of turnkey space that had been completed and is available for lease.  As a result of our strong balance sheet, operating platform and technical expertise, we continue to see attractive investment opportunities that have the potential to contribute to our earnings and the growth of our company. As discussed on our last call, we expect income producing acquisitions to take a larger role in our investment strategy complimenting our internal growth through leasing and the development program.  In addition, we have signed our first POD architecture services design and project management contract with an existing customer to develop its new corporate owned facility. As a turnkey customer already this major financial services firm has already experienced the benefits of our cost effective POD design and our operational capabilities. They will recognize additional savings of tens of millions of dollars in both construction and ongoing operating costs for this new project. We believe this is a powerful value proposition that when combined with leased spaced [inaudible] our own buildings will further deepen our relationships with the enterprise customers.  I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO Bill Stein.
A. William Stein : I will begin with a discussion of our liquidity position and then review our third quarter 2009 financial results and finally discuss our revised 2009 FFO guidance. Following my remarks we will open the call to your questions. In addition to the new $30 million commitment under our revolving credit facility that we discussed on our last call, we closed two important secured mortgage financings for properties in our European portfolio.  In mid October we closed a five year $23.8 million Pound loans secured by two properties located in the United Kingdom Cressex 1 in suburban London and Manchester Technopark in Manchester. The interest rate is 5.68%. The second is a five year $30 million Euro interest only secured mortgage financing for Clonshaugh Industrial Estate 2 located in Dublin Ireland. This loan is scheduled to fund in early December. Based on the current swap rate the all in interest rate is approximately 7.37%. Year-to-date we have sourced $552 million of additional capital and are continuing our efforts to identify and selectively access capital when capital market conditions and pricing are favorable. Related to these efforts this morning, Moodys issued a press release announce it has rated DLR a BAA2 credit. We are currently awaiting ratings from the other agencies and plan to utilize our ratings to access the unsecured corporate bond market at the appropriate time. Access to the investment grade unsecured debt market will be an important component of our future funding strategy and will further differentiate us from our competitors.  Our total debt at quarter end was $1.6 billion and our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was 26.5% based on the September 30 stock price of $45.71. Based on yesterday’s closing stock price of $44.57 our ratio debt to total market value capitalization would be 26.9%. Our adjusted EBITDA to cash fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.9 times and our adjusted EBITDA to cash debt service coverage was 4.9 times for the quarter. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA multiple was four times for the quarter.  As of September 30th our weighted average cost of debt included interest rate swaps of 5.5% and the weighted average maturities was 4.6 years including debt extension options. A description of how we calculate these ratios and the other non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our supplemental offering and financial data report furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Turning now to our liquidity, we have approximately $691 million of liquidity through short term investments, funds that can be drawn on our revolving credit facility and pro forma for the Cloonshaugh loan funding in early December. If this capacity were fully utilized our pro forma total debt to market capitalization would be approximately 34.5% based on yesterday’s closing stock price and pro forma our net debt to adjusted EBITDA would be 5.8 times. If we were to utilize the full $691 million we would remain in compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility, Prudential Shelf facility and outstanding secure debt. Our remaining expected capital requirements for 2009 are between $210 million and $225 million and include $85 to $95 million of redevelopment cap ex, $25 million of portfolio level cap ex as well as $100 to $105 million for new acquisitions net of debt to be assumed. We have $3.2 million of ongoing principal amortization and no debt maturities for the remainder of 2009. Assuming that we fund all remaining cash needs through the end of the year on our revolver we’d have approximately $466 million to $481 million of liquidity without raising any additional capital. In 2010 we have $50 million of principal amortization and no debt maturing. In 2011 we have approximately $233 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities including $172.5 million for the 4 1/8ths exchangeable senior debentures which can be put to the company by the holders at 100% principal amount in mid 2011. Based on the conversion rate, the strike price is $32.22 per share. These debentures is currently trading at approximately 147% of principal amount.  Moving on to our dividend, yesterday we announced an increase of 25% or $0.09 to $0.45 per share per quarter for our common stock. This increase resulted from growth in taxable income and the need to meet our anticipated 2009 and 2010 REIT distribution requirements. Currently, we anticipate that a portion of the fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2010 will be pulled back to satisfy the 2009 distribution requirement. As we have previously stated, our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to minimize the payment of federal income taxes by the REIT and we expect that future dividend increases will be based on such policy subject to our board of directors approval.  Now, I will turn to our third quarter 2009 financial results. The third quarter FFO per diluted share and unit was $0.74, up 4.2% from the second quarter 2009 FFO per share and unit of $0.71. Year-over-year, third quarter 2009 FFO per share and unit increased 8.8% over third quarter 2008 recorded FFO of $0.68 per diluted share and unit. As we stated in our press release this morning there were no material non-recurring items impacting FFO or net income in the quarters ended September 30th and June 30th 2009. For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the FFO of $0.68 per diluted share and unit included additional FFO from certain significant items that do not represent ongoing revenue streams primarily, lease termination fees. Without these non-recurring items FFO would have been $0.62 per diluted share and unit in the third quarter of 2008. After adjusting for these items our results represent and FFO increase of 19.4% over the third quarter of last year. Adjusted funds from operations or FFO for the third quarter 2009 was $49.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share and unit. This compares to a second quarter 2009 AFFO of $41.8 million or $0.51 per diluted share and unit. The diluted FFO payout ratio for the third quarter of 2009 was 61% down slightly from the second quarter AFFO payout ratio.  EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and non-controlling interest was $97.3 million in the third quarter of 2009 up 4.4% from $93.2 million in the second quarter of 2009 and up 20.4% from $80 million in the third quarter of 2008. Same store NOI was $105.2 million in the third quarter 2009 up 5.2% from $100 million in the second quarter of 2009 and up 28.6% from $81.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. Same store adjusted for straight line rents and purchase accounting adjustments which we refer to as same store cash NOI was $92.1 million in the third quarter of 2009 up 5.4% from $87.4 million in the second quarter of 2009 and up 28.6% from $71.6 million in the third quarter 2008.  I will now briefly review specific items in the statement of operations to provide additional detail on the results for the quarter. For the third quarter rental revenues increased to $130.9 million up 4.4% from $125.4 million in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of leases signed in the previous quarters. G&A increased slightly during the quarter to $10.7 million compared to $10 million in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition activities which now have to be expensed.  Consistent with what we have been reporting on our previous calls, our accounts receivable aging and delinquencies remain in line with historic norms and we believe we continue to maintain adequate bad debt reserves.  Turning now to our balance sheet; during the quarter we capitalized 8% or $2 million of interest related to construction projects which compares to 9% or $2.1 million in the second quarter 2009. We capitalized approximately 26% or $3.3 million in compensation expenses in the third quarter compared to 27% or $3.5 million in the second quarter 2009. Total construction work in progress in the third quarter was $210 million of which $159 million is construction costs and $51 million is allocated to acquisition costs. This compares to second quarter construction work in progress of $219 million. As noted in our press release we are raising the lower end of our annual guidance range of FFO per diluted share and unit to $2.88. This revised guidance represents projected FFO growth of 11.2% to 12% over FFO per diluted share and unit of $2.59 for the year ended December 31, 2008. As discussed in our fourth quarter 2008 call FFO per diluted share and unit for the full year 2008 included additional FFO from certain significant items that do not represent ongoing revenue streams. After adjusting for those items our revised 2009 guidance represents projected FFO growth of 17.1% to 17.9%. Lastly we plan to provide 2010 guidance in November.  This concludes our formal remarks. We are now happy to take any questions that you might have.
Operator:
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Congratulations on the credit rating this morning. I just wanted to follow up on that and inquire what do you think the leverage capacity or debt capacity is in terms of sort of an unsecured bonds slug in your cap structure would be given sort of that rating?
A. William Stein : I think the initial bond issuance would be about $250 million. Moodys has said that in terms of their general sort of BAA2 ratings anything under six times debt to EBITDA is a BAA2 rating. I think that we can accommodate $250 million easily and still have full use of the credit facility. We wouldn’t take the credit facility up to the max just because that would not be prudent but we could comfortably do I’d say easily half of the capacity maybe a little bit more plus the $250.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: I guess based on that you probably have about $800 million in capacity if you were to keep it under six times but you’d do less than that?
A. William Stein : Yes, if we keep it under six times, that’s right. The indenture covenants might trip before that because indenture covenants tend to be booked based rather than EBTIDA based. Our EBTIDA relative to book value is quite robust as you know.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Given the new found capacity it seems like your maintaining the 2009 guidance which included a slug of acquisitions that you plugged in there and some that you announced this quarter. Can you maybe give us an update on acquisitions prospectively, what you’re seeing in the market.
Michael F. Foust : We are seeing a handful of opportunities as we had discussed earlier. Someone off opportunities from funds where maybe these assets are outliers and they’re looking to sell income producing properties to redeploy capital elsewhere or redeploy back to investors. So, we have a couple more investments that we expect to close, actually three more that we expect to close by the end of the year and we’re looking at other opportunities as well for 2010. There will be definitely more deployment of capital on an ongoing basis to the income producing acquisitions to compliment our leasing and development program.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: In the 10% to 12% cap rate is still doable?
Michael F. Foust : On average, yes. 
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Lastly, just on the leasing side, the signed leases as opposed to the commenced leases, signed leases year-to-date seem like they’re down on a dollar volume basis as opposed to space about 55% or so. Signed leases seem to be a better indicator of sort of the outlook if you will, or at least something of a leading indicator. Should we expect a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter or are things just slowing down somewhat?
Michael F. Foust : We’re seeing more interest and more real opportunities, more real requirements in the market so that’s definitely ticking up. The approval time frames are longer than they use to be. We’re looking nine to 12 months now even in some cases. I think we’ll start to see an uptick in the fourth quarter and a little bit higher velocity in 2010 in terms of volumes overall. 
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Higher volumes than 2009?
Michael F. Foust : Potentially in terms of signings, yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jamie Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: One quick accounting question, we noticed on the balance sheet that the deferred rent component is up. Can you just talk about what’s in there?
A. William Stein : It’s just new leasing with straight line rent.
Jamie Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Is there more free rent component to leases now that there has been in the past?
A. William Stein : Not necessarily free rent it’s just when – if you do a 10 year lease with 3% bumps you’re going to have in straight line rent that’s booked at the beginning of the lease that will burn off over the course of the lease term.
Jamie Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Then in terms of the fee business, can you talk a little bit about how you’re pricing it? It seems like you’ve had some successes but maybe the expectations for growth?
Michael F. Foust : The pricing is going to vary somewhat based on the nature of the nature of the assignment. In some cases we’re talking to folks in terms of a percentage of savings in terms of develop costs over and above certain expectations or certain budgeted amounts to give us a bit of incentive and in some cases it’s more on a fixed fee for design work. Then, the project management components or the technical operations components I should say, if we’re managing, would be based on more of a profit margin over costs.
Jamie Feldman – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Then in terms of just growth prospects, what kind of successes you’re having?
Michael F. Foust : I think this is an initiative that could lead to maybe about $10 million to bottom line next year, maybe more. As importantly, probably more importantly it’s helping develop deeper relationships for broader basis of business especially in a build-to-suit opportunity where we might do build-to-suit and actually own the building so it ties in very nicely with a lot of our other niches both leasing turnkey space as well as some of the build-to-suit opportunities that we’re seeing.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: I just wanted to first get your perspective on how you see the acquisition of Switch and Data by Equinox affecting your future business in particular and also I guess the overall datacenter landscape?
Michael F. Foust : I don’t think it has much of a direct impact. Equinox is our third largest customer and it further solidifies their position as kind of the preeminent interconnect and peering group out there. Switch and Data is a good customer of ours in several sites and I think it further enhances kind of our overall relationship with the combined entity. It seems to be a very positive event for them and I think it just shows a lot of the strength in the datacenter business and the kind of growth that folks are seeing overall.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: A couple of questions regarding your recent acquisitions regarding 444 Toyama and 1525 Comstock. I was wondering if the going in yields, I know you had previously guided the sort of 10% to 12% range as the goal, I’m wondering if that’s sort of commensurate with what actually occurred?
Michael F. Foust : If you look together the Toyama Drive property is a standalone datacenter facility fully leased, Comstock is also fully leased to two tenants. Comstock has been a joint venture with the [Apellio] Group here and we acquired their minority interest in the property. If you look at the yields that we were talking about earlier the two properties together yielded about a NOI of about $5 million and we acquired them for kind of total purchase price together $43.9 so over 11% NOI, cash NOI yield on those together.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Then you also at the same time gave the 10% to 12% you mentioned that some of the potential deals that you were looking at had shorter lease terms and I was wondering if you could discuss what the lease roll looks like particularly on Toyama and some of the dynamics I guess that are occurring in your potential acquisition targets for potential lease roll windows when eventual mature lease maturities do occur.
Michael F. Foust : Sure, the Toyama Drive was actually a long term lease. I believe it’s like about ’20 or ’22 is the lease expiration on that and it has annual uplifts so it’s a very nice cash flow stream on that asset. Other properties we’re looking at that we do have under contract have shorter, shorter being around five to 5.5 years in a couple of cases but with very mission critical facilities that we’re very confident they’ll renew. It’s a little too early to say what the uplift might be over and above current but I think at least there will be some uplift.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  I just had a quick question, not to give him any credit at all but Jim Cramer comes out and said that the [inaudible] datacenter following this Equinox deal last week and I think there were a lot of inaccuracies in that reporting but I just wanted to give you sort of an opportunity just to talk about why that’s not the case. Obviously, you’re bullish in the datacenter business or you wouldn’t be in it. But, can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics that you see relative, and I’m sure you’ve seen it or gotten a transcript of it, what they were advocating.
Michael F. Foust : He was really way, way off the mark and it kind of shows a lack of understanding of what’s driving the growth of datacenter applications and the deployment. Whenever you increase computing power dramatically in the hardware that computer power gets taken advantage of if you will and gets absorbed in to the applications. That computer power is utilized because as we’ve seen over the last 50 years, there’s always more uses for computing power, for the various applications whether it’s trading or database, search, derivative pricing, what have you, risk management computational platforms.  The whole world can always use more computing power. The demand is going outstrip the availability of computing power if you will. On the other side, on the physical side, these pipes of multiprocessor chips and boards use a lot more power. Our business is all about leasing access to power. The square footage is almost secondary in some cases. Your power requirements are going to be staying pretty steady and continue to go up. I think Cramer kind of just missed the whole dynamic of the industry and the IT world no his comments.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Was there any sense of – one of the other things he talked about was corporate is now almost bringing datacenters back in house rather than the whole outsourcing model that they’ve been following the last few years. Have you seen any trend whatsoever on that?
Michael F. Foust : No. That’s pretty much the opposite of what folks in the IT services outsourcing – if you talk to EDS or IBM or Capgemini or Equinox or SAVIS, all their businesses are increasing very well. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: This last question, you’ve made some growth areas in terms of on the services side, where do you stand today in terms of generating potential income off of those initiatives as you think about where you are this year and heading in to 2010?
Michael F. Foust : On the POD architecture services, I think we’ll see conservatively about another $10 million to bottom line earnings from that next year. It could be more. As I mentioned before, the fact that the synergy of driving more business with our turnkey leasing in addition to the POD architecture services as well as the build-to-suits, I think it will drive a lot of the associated income as well.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach – ISI Group.
George Auerbach – ISI Group: Just to go back to Jordan’s question, Bill where do you think you could price debt in the unsecured market today?
A. William Stein : Well, it depends on tenure and it depends on where S&P comes out and Fitch but assuming we’re a flat BBB with all the agencies, five year would be in the low sixes we think today, a seven would be around seven and a 10 year would be in the mid sevens.
George Auerbach – ISI Group: I guess how does that compare to the rate on secured debt? Also, if you could just comment on the availability of secured debt for datacenters in the US and Europe?
A. William Stein : It’s still challenging to obtain secured debt for datacenters both in the US and Europe. We were fortunate that we have closed these mortgages over in Europe. As I said, the UK deal is priced in the mid to high fives and the Irish deal is in the low sevens. We haven’t looked at doing a large mortgage for a little while because we’ve been in the middle of this rating agency process and clearly if we are successful in this regard as it appears we will be, that eliminates the need to rely on secured mortgage debt. We were in the market I’d say six months ago and looking to do a sizeable deal which I would say between $100 to $150. There is a limited number of providers. They want to deal with the top tier sponsors and the rates at that time were eight or higher but I can’t comment on whether those rates have come in. Leverage would be about 50%.
George Auerbach – ISI Group: I guess final, yesterday on their conference call Boston Properties mentioned some pretty aggressive pricing in the convertible debt market. Is that an area you are looking at? Or, if you were to do unsecured you’d do just plain vanilla unsecured debt at this point?
A. William Stein : I didn’t hear the Boston Properties call but I would agree that the convertible market looks very attractive right now.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer.
Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer: A couple of questions, Mike I think you mentioned in response to an earlier question that the pace of new lease signing should pick up as you go in to the end of the year and 2010. Is that based on the sales pipeline that you’re currently seeing? In the past you use to give a number, the total amount of square foot that you folks are currently tracking, if you could update that number that would be helpful.
Michael F. Foust : It is based on companies coming back in to the market for requirements especially now after Labor Day we’re seeing a good pickup in inquiries and searches in the market place. Right now we are tracking or in discussions and various levels of discussions with requirements totaling about one million square feet. We’re tracking potential requirements, folks that are in very early stages or corporates that we know that have their own requirements, that’s about four million. But, one million square feet that we’re engaged on in nine or 10 markets.
Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer: Mike, second question, I know you talked about going forward acquisitions would be a higher portion of your growth. I just want to make sure that you’re in no way implying that the internal growth rate of the company is slowing down here and hence you have to look at external acquisitions to keep the growth rate going forward?
Michael F. Foust : No, really it’s as we have always done. Our strategy as an investor is to look at where are the opportunities to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns and to the extent we can deploy capital in income producing properties and avoid the development and leasing risk that’s something that’s always been attractive to us and we really built our organization on. It’s more to augment and kind of diversify our deployment of capital where we see good opportunities. 
Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer: Just one last question, Bill I know there’s been a lot of talk about cloud computing and what it means for datacenter demand going forward. In your conversations with large technology companies or the large IT companies, to what extent are you seeing demand that’s being driven because of these new cloud offerings that these companies are potentially going to launch a year from now or two years from now?
Michael F. Foust : It’s difficult to quantify but our experience has been that a number of the new space requirements that we have been satisfying for customers have been cloud or grid computing type requirements whether it’s directly with corporate enterprise such as financial services or with our customers like SAVIS who are providing grid computing, cloud computing applications. We’re seeing it as another growth driver for our business and for our customers’ business.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: I think you had about 67,000 square feet or so of turnkey signings in the quarter. That was down a lot from 2Q and similar 1Q. Can you just speak to why those have been down so much, especially compared to last year and then is it possibly a reflection that you can get 11% type yields on buying now as opposed to only a little bit higher on building. 
Michael F. Foust : I think the level of signing is reflective of the fact that we did have such a slowdown in inquiries and companies having the inclination to pull the trigger on new facilities at the end of last year and beginning of this year. I think it’s just kind of a general slowdown and the longer time frames for the approvals. I think it will start catching up now as we go in to the next six months and new requirements are coming on the table and some of the requirements that we started working on earlier in the year will come to fruition and come to approvals. So, I think it’s more kind of the cycle catching up with itself over the next six months. In terms of the kind of our [spy] versus investment and income producing versus leasing, as I mentioned it’s purely on where can we get the most attractive risk adjusted returns and looking that way. But, I don’t think that reflects on tenant demand for datacenter space because we’re looking as an investor as opposed to a customer who’s looking for deployment of applications. If I understand your question.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Then just a follow up to that, what do you feel like the right spread is between buying income producing and building turnkey? It sounds like it is anywhere from 300 to 500 basis points, is that about the right spread?
Michael F. Foust : It might be somewhat tighter than that depending on tenant credit and location.  
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Any comment on the appropriateness of that spread?
Michael F. Foust : It’s going to vary quite a bit. I mean it could be, like I said it depends on credit. It could be 200 basis points but it’s just going to vary – and the size of the space and so on and so forth. It’s going to be a pretty broad range.
Operator:  Your next question comes from William Marks – JMP Securities.
William Marks – JMP Securities: A couple of questions, one on that Equinox acquisition, would REIT rules have prevented you from making that type of purchase or could you actually consider it?
Michael F. Foust : Well, it’s a little different business, I mean Switch and Data I believe leases virtually all their facilities in their 20 some markets so they’re not an owner of real estate. Their business is clearly in the co-location, peering, interconnection and they’re very strong in those areas which is very different from our more wholesale real estate based business. So, as a customer obviously they have been a very good customer but I think their type of business being in more the co-location interconnection fee based business is sufficiently different from ours that it would be an investment for us.
William Marks – JMP Securities: Second, I believe in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal the Toronto datacenter that sold, did you look at that property, is that something you’d be interested in?
Michael F. Foust : We did look at it back about a year ago and it’s a very good facility. At that time the pricing seemed to be higher than we were willing to pay at the time but it’s a good project.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Bill, I didn’t get the backlog from you, could you hook us up?
A. William Stein : Would you prefer I put that in the remarks or do you like asking the question?
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: I like asking the question.
A. William Stein : There’s obviously not much but the signings will be recognized in the fourth quarter just because of where we are in the quarter. Roughly 75% would be recognized in the first quarter next year and 25% in the second quarter.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: What was the dollar volume?
A. William Stein : Dollar volume for next year revenue recognition is about $7.5, $5.5 in the first quarter and $2 in the second. 
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Those are the full year contributions?
A. William Stein : Yes, that’s right.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: My other questions is just on the acquisition front. There was a portfolio kicking around last year, a west coast portfolio that I recall that I never saw cross and I was just curious if that’s still kicking around and if that would still be of interest to you?
Michael F. Foust : I’m guessing you’re referring to the Rockwood Capital 365 Main portfolio. That one has three properties in the west coast and properties on Phoenix and Virginia. They’re looking at various financing opportunities so they have not traded.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Would that be of interest to you, that portfolio, at the right price?
Michael F. Foust : Conceptually yes. I mean, it does have a very big component of co-location which is not our core business at all which we could execute and continue to manage as its been managed but it’s very different from the real estate business in their San Francisco facility, different valuation metrics.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: I had a question, just following up on one of your comments on the cycle catching up to itself a little bit over the course of the next six months, are you guys a little bit victims of your own success meaning things are so good and the profits been so good that capital has become somewhat available to good opportunities like your sector? It seems to be that despite the environment we’re in there continue to be folks who expand their datacenter business plans. Is that squeezing out some of the profit a little bit or the opportunity a little bit?
Michael F. Foust : You mean in terms of companies doing it themselves versus looking for an outsource?
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Not as much. I was thinking like the telcos actually getting in to the business a little bit more and maybe, I know the private guys aren’t as well capitalized but there are some that do have a little bit of access.
Michael F. Foust : Hopefully those kind of demands we can take advantage of. A good example, both with NTT and ATT, for their enterprise services solutions, we’re playing an important role as landlord of those facilities. We’ve seen this play out that it will lead towards more demand for our facilities as a landlord and facility provider.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: So more sort of a base building?
Michael F. Foust : Both base building and turnkey. But, we’re happy to accommodate either way.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: You did say that you think turnkey is going to be sort of the way of the future near term?
Michael F. Foust : Well, certainly this year turnkey is the great, great majority. I think this year it’s over 90% so far by revenue of new business. 
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: And you think that will continue, that dynamic?
Michael F. Foust : I think so, I think it will moderate a little bit especially with a couple of products we’ll be bringing on line in the next year but I think it will still be the great majority of new leasing will be the turnkey by revenue.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Did I miss anything on the markets? Any changes, positives or negatives?
Michael F. Foust : No, what we’re seeing is our IT service provider customer vertical, you know SAVIS, Equinox, Telex, IBM, system integrators as well included in there, their businesses are going quite well and demand from that customer base is very good. We’re seeing financial services continue to grow their applications.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Geographically that’s sort of silicon valley, DC and New Jersey?
Michael F. Foust : New Jersey, Dallas, Chicago, London, Paris would be I think our top activity centers.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer.
Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer: Mike, on the last call you mentioned going forward we should expect some consultancy related revenue because of the hiring of [Michael Manners]. Was there any contribution this quarter or is that something we should expect more in 2010?
Michael F. Foust : I don’t recall exactly from the quarter but we’ve had ongoing assignments with a couple of customers that are contributing revenues currently. I think in this year it will be $3 to $4 million of revenue from consultant services, POD architecture services this year I believe. 
Srinivas Anatha – Oppenheimer: Bill, in the guidance on the last call you guys gave from acquisitions it should be to $122 to $200 million. Looking at your acquisitions year-to-date the guidance is well above that. Does that guidance still hold good? Should we expect more on the lower end, mid range or higher end, what do you think going in to 4Q just with a few months left here?
A. William Stein : As is said it’s going to be between $100 to $105 with a few months left and that’s net of debt that’s going to be assumed on one deal.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Could you give an estimate of where you think your overall portfolio in terms of your mark-to-market is today in terms of your average in place rent per foot compared to where that would be at market?
Michael F. Foust : I think to be a little more accurate I would say on renewals we’ll continue to see and uptick of 10% to 15% on average I believe and I think that’s probably not a bad indicator on an average basis. 
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Bill, in the context of obtaining the rating from Moodys can you guys give us an update of what your target capital structure would be in terms of equity, preferred, unsecured debt, convertible, etc. 
A. William Stein : I think we’ll probably keep our debt to EBTIDA to sort of under 5.5 maybe under 5 and fixed charge coverage ratio I would expect to remain pretty much where it is in the mid twos. Obviously, it’s been a little higher recently and it could go a little lower. But, perpetual preferred market really isn’t open right now so that’s not an option and convertible preferred is really not open either except I saw that Grubb & Ellis did a small deal the other day but I don’t think that’s open meaningfully. As I said we’ll target based on fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA multiples.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors:  But the intent of accessing the unsecured market at some point is more broadening your capital sources not a move towards less conservative financial structure that you’ve employed during your time as a public company.
A. William Stein : No. In fact, the Moodys rating, one of the criteria is, you’ll see this in the Moodys release is the fact that we have had conservative financial policies. If we were to lever up that would work against us in terms of ratings.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Lastly, I’m just curious how you view your cost of equity here today given that the real estate cap rates for your portfolio seem like they are fairly high and the public market is appropriately given you plenty of value for your platform etc., above and beyond the real estate value. How do you view your cost of equity today? Any thought about raising additional equity?
A. William Stein : We consistently view our long term cost of equity in the low double digits. We think that’s an appropriate measurement over the long term. Obviously, if you look at the cost of equity on the basis of FFO yield leader this year or next it’s a lot less than that. But, that’s not how we prefer to look at it.
Operator:  There are no further questions at this time if you’d like to continue with any further remarks.
Michael F. Foust : Thank you everyone for joining the call. I appreciate the tracking us and I want to thank our management and our overall operating team here at DLR for another very good quarter. It’s much appreciated. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using ATT Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

To manage the call in a timely manner, questions will be limited to two per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Foust: Great. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call, everyone. I’ll begin with a brief overview of Digital Realty Trust. Then I’ll review the success of our portfolio operations during the quarter and the year and conclude with an overview of our annual US data center market demand survey that was completed last week. Following my remarks, Bill Stein will discuss in detail our liquidity position and our fourth quarter and full year 2008 financial performance. DLR is the leading owner and manager of technology real estate. Our portfolio currently contains 25 – 75 properties, totaling 13 million rentable square feet excluding one property, the Westin Building in Seattle that’s held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Our properties are located in 27 metro areas across North America and Europe. The portfolio includes approximately 1.6 million square feet of space held for redevelopment, which continues to be an important source of growth for the company. DLR provides a variety of datacenter facilities solutions, including Turn-Key Datacenter, Powered Base Building, and build-to-suit datacenters for domestic and international corporate customers. Our properties serve a wide range of industry vertical markets, including information technology, Internet enterprises, financial services, telecom network providers, energy companies, and other Fortune 1000 firms. In the space of unprecedented economic and market challenges, we are especially proud of the company’s performance in 2008. Our team finished the year by turning another very successful quarter, especially with respect to leasing, operations, and finance. Demand has remained high for our datacenter products and we continue to closely manage our balance sheet to maintain comfortable levels of liquidity. We are confident that we will continue to achieve good earnings growth in 2009. Portfolio occupancy excluding space held for redevelopment was 94.9% at year-end, a slight decline from 95.2% at the end of the third quarter. This was primarily due to timing of lease commencements including the previously planned termination of a portion of the Qwest lease for 350 East Cermak, the conversion of redevelopment space to operating portfolios at our Paris property, and the acquisition of a vacant building for a leading Internet enterprise company with lease commencement after the quarter-end in January 2009. Occupied square footage actually increased in the fourth quarter by 108,000 square feet to 10,810,000 square feet. Turning now to our acquisition and leasing accomplishments, on December 10, 2008 we acquired the remaining 50% interest in a joint venture that owns 1500 Space Park Drive and 1201 Comstock Street in Santa Clara, California for approximately $20.6 million. The portfolio – the properties are 100% leased respectively to a major Internet enterprise and to a global computing technology company. On November 20, 2008 we acquired an 110,000-square foot facility located in Manassas, Virginia for approximately $10.6 million. Upon completion of the acquisition, we signed a long-term lease with a leading Internet enterprise company, which commenced in January 2009. This brings our total acquisitions for the year to approximately $101.2 million. As previously announced, for the year ended December 31, 2008 we commenced leases, totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet, which represents a 50% increase over leases commenced for the year ended December 31, 2007. This includes first, nearly 696,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter space, leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $142 per square foot. Second, over 269,000 square feet of Powered Base Building space leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $42 per square foot, and third, approximately 180,000 square feet of non-technical space leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $22 per square foot. For the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we commenced leases totaling approximately 320,000 square feet of space. This includes nearly 164,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $154 per square foot, approximately 119,000 square feet of Powered Base Building at an average annual rental rate of $49 per square foot, and approximately 38,000 square feet of non-technical space leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $15 per square foot. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we signed leases representing over $1 billion in contract value, a 50% increase over the total contract value of leases we signed in 2008. Leases signed in 2008 totaled over 1.1 million square feet. This includes approximately 594,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter space leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $153 per square foot, over 299,000 square feet of Powered Base Building leased at an average annual rental rate of $56 per square foot, and approximately 242,000 square feet of non-technical space leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $18 per square foot. Now for the quarter ended December 31, ’08, we signed leases totaling approximately 276,000 square feet. This includes signed leases of 120,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter space at an average GAAP rental rate of $180 per square foot, approximately 8,000 square feet of Powered Base Building at an average rental rate of $54 per square foot, and approximately 149,000 square feet of non-technical space at $17 per square foot. Leases were signed in the fourth quarter with customers that include IBM, Cisco, Cigna Insurance, Facebook, and NTT America. Despite the challenging market conditions, we continue to see attractive pricing and strong demand for our top markets, particularly for our Turn-Key Datacenter product. This level of demand is consistent with the results of the US data center market demand survey that was completed for us last week and as well as the results of the European survey that we released last week. The surveys are conducted for us by Campos Research & Analysis. The US survey was conducted during January and February of ’09 and consisted of 300 senior level executive of firms with greater $1 billion of annual revenues and/or more than 5,000 employees. The highlights of the results are as follows. Firstly, 84% of respondents said that they will definitely or probably expand data center space in the next 12 to 24 months. Also, the average IT budget is estimated to increase 6% in 2009 with data centers representing about 35% of the overall budget. Average data center spending is expected to increase by 6.6% over 2008. 64% of respondents plan to expand in two or more locations. In addition, the average requirement for new data center space is 21,000 square feet, up 17% from 2008. And lastly, the average projected kW per rack is up to 7.8 kW, up 8% from 2008. Overall, results of the survey indicate that at this time, the current economic environment does not appear to be materially impacting demand. A more detailed overview of the survey results is scheduled to be released in an upcoming press release. Consistent with the results of the survey, the DLR sales team currently is engaged in direct discussions with over 77 megawatts of new data center prospects. In addition, we have identified 5 million square feet of active requirements seeking space in our top markets. Turning to our redevelopment program, we currently are underway in construction projects in high-demand markets in US and Europe that will add 490,000 gross rentable square feet of additional data center space to our operating portfolio in 2009 including the HSBC build-to-suit in suburban London. In addition, we have construction underway in London, Paris, Northern New Jersey, Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, and Silicon Valley. In 2008, we delivered approximately 605,000 rentable square feet of Turn-Key space and over 50 megawatts of IT load. Overall, our leasing and product delivery programs contributed to strong results in 2008 and remain on track into 2009. We are mindful of the many economic forecasts that predict slow or negative growth in 2009 and the global credit crisis shows few signs of abating in the near future. And we understand how these macroeconomic trends might affect our business. That’s why we have structured our business model with the operating flexibility to adapt to business cycles and with the financial flexibility to adapt to changes in credit and equity markets. Our confidence in our financial strength and operating platform is due to the talented dedicated people on our team who have consistently kept Digital Realty playing out in front. We thank all of them for a job well done and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the year ahead. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein. Bill?
Bill Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. I will begin with a discussion of our liquidity position and then review our fourth quarter and full year 2008 financial results. Following my remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Liquidity remains a critical concern for all businesses including REITs and maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility is a top priority for us. Since our last call, we have sourced approximately $141 million of additional capital that added to our liquidity position, further buttressing our balance sheet while providing potential growth capital for later this year or next year. At February 13, we completed an underwritten common stock offering of 2.5 million shares, resulting in approximately $83.3 million in net proceeds. At November 5, 2008, we funded a second draw from the Prudential Shelf Facility of $33 million at an interest rate of 9.32% with a five-year maturity. On January 6, we closed a third draw from the Pru facility for $25 million at an interest rate of 9.68% with a seven-year maturity. The proceeds from these transactions were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. On January 6, 2009, practical completion of construction was achieved on a datacenter facility located on London’s perimeter. After drawing down 9.2 million pounds today and putting in place an interest rate swap, there is a 42.8 million pound outstanding on this loan. The loan is a five-year interest-only financing with an all-in swap fixed rate of 4.18% and no amortization. As a footnote, clearly this is a loan from a different era. The total outstanding loan represents a 75% loan-to-value ratio based on an updated valuation prepared for the bank. In addition, we are in a documentation stage for a secured debt financing on a domestic property that would generate approximately $18 million of proceeds. The loan has a three-year maturity with a one-year extension at an interest-only rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% with principal amortization on a 15-year schedule. Our total debt at quarter-end was $1.4 billion and our ratio of debt to total market cap was 29.8% based on the December 31, ’08 stock price of $32.85. Based on yesterday’s closing stock price of $28.93, our ratio of debt to total market value capitalization would be 31.9%. Our adjusted EBITDA to cash, fixed charge coverage ratio was 3 times and our adjusted EBITDA to cash debt service coverage was 5.2 times for the quarter. As of December 31, ’08, the average cost of debt including interest rate swaps was 5.36% and the weighted average maturity was 4.9 years including debt extension options. A description of how we calculate these ratios can be found in the back of our supplemental operating and financial data report furnished to the SEC and available now on our website. Turning now to our revolving credit facility, we currently have approximately $100 million outstanding on the credit facility. We are holding $60 million of that in short-term interest investments, which represents our estimate of funding requirements for the next 30-day period. We have $623 million for immediate liquidity through short-term investments and funds that can be drawn on our revolving credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized our pro forma debt to total market cap would be approximately 39.7% based on yesterday’s closing stock price. We remain comfortably in compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility, the Prudential Shelf facility, as well as our outstanding secured debt. Looking ahead, based on our current plans, we expect our capital requirements for 2009 to total between $383 million and $433 million, which includes $275 million to $325 million of redevelopment CapEx plus portfolio level CapEx of $40 million and $68 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities. This assumes that we exercise the one-year extension option on 350 East Cermak loan in June of 2009. If we fund all of our cash needs through the end of 2009 entirely on our revolver, we would have approximately $190 million to $240 million of liquidity at the end of 2009. In 2010, including the $95 million loan at 350 East Cermak, we have a total of $109 million of debt maturing and principal amortization. The Cermak property is expected to generate approximately $40 million of NOI in 2009. Before moving on to our fourth quarter and full year financial results, I would like to briefly address our current dividend policy. As a reminder, last quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 6.5% or $0.02 per share to $0.33 per quarter, one of the few REITs to do so. We are currently paying approximately $26.7 million in dividends and distributions per quarter. We have done extensive internal analysis with the various dividend options other REITs have employed to preserve capital and/or improve liquidity including the stock cash dividend split. After our review, we have determined to maintain our current quarterly cash dividend distribution, but we’ll continue to monitor this as the year progresses and market conditions evolve. Now, I would like to turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2008 results. The fourth quarter FFO per diluted share and unit of $0.76 per share includes approximately $0.07 of additional FFO from certain significant items that do not represent ongoing revenue streams. These items consist primarily of the remaining $4 million from the net termination fee of $11.9 million from Qwest at our 350 East Cermak property and property tax adjustments for two properties totaling $3.1 million. This is offset by $700,000 in straight line rent expense related to facility leases. After adjusting for these items, FFO was $0.69 per diluted share and unit. As I discussed on our last call, third quarter FFO of $0.69 per diluted share and unit included approximately $0.06 per share of additional FFO from certain significant items that do not represent ongoing revenue streams. After adjusting for such items, third quarter FFO was $0.63 per diluted share and unit. After adjusting for one-time items in all quarters, fourth quarter FFO per diluted share and unit increased 9.5% over the third quarter and 30.2% over the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, FFO per diluted share and unit was $2.62 per share. When adjusting for one-time items plus $0.02 per share of additional non-recurring FFO discussed on our first quarter 2008 call, 2008 FFO per diluted share and unit was $2.48. This represents a 21% increase over reported 2007 FFO per diluted share and unit of $2.05. After adjusting for approximately $2.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share and unit of additional FFO from items that do not represent ongoing revenue streams in 2007, 2008 FFO per diluted share and unit increased 22.8% over 2007. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $44.3 million or $0.56 per diluted share and unit. This compares to a third quarter 2008 AFFO of $44 million or $0.55 per diluted share and unit. The AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 58.9%, up from third quarter AFFO payout ratio of 56.4%. EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and minority interest was $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, up 11.5% from $80.7 million in the third quarter and up 51.8% from the $59.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and minority interest was $303.9 million in 2008, up 34.2% year-over-year from $226.4 million excluding the $18 million gain on the sale of assets in 2007. We are paying considerable attention to the impact of the challenging economy on our tenants and business. At this time, our accounts receivable aging and delinquencies remain consistent with historical norms and we believe we maintain adequate bad debt reserves. One of our tenants filed for bankruptcy during the fourth quarter. That tenant leases approximately 12,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter space as its primary datacenter for US operations and 3,000 square feet of office space. This tenant is current on its rent and we believe that this tenant will affirm its lease in bankruptcy. The tenant’s current monthly tax rent is approximately $94,000. Same-store NOI was $76.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, up 9.3% from $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2008 and up 23.7% from $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and FAS 141 adjustments, which we refer to as same-store cash NOI, was $67 million in the fourth quarter, up 3.9% from $64.5 million in the third quarter of 2008 and up 25.9% from $53.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. These increases were primarily the result of new leasing commencing in our properties during the 12-month period ended 12/31/08. I would now briefly review specific items in the statement of operations and provide additional detail on the results for the quarter. For the fourth quarter, rental revenues increased to $111.4 million, up 8.8% from $102.4 million in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of leases signed in previous quarters. Rental revenues for the full year 2008 were $404.6 million, up 26.6% from $319.6 million in 2007, reflecting the commencement of leases signed during the year for Turn-Key and Powered Base Building space. G&A decreased during the quarter to $8.6 million, down from $11.3 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to the acceleration of the outperformance plan in the third quarter and lower audit and tax related fees and a state tax refund in the fourth quarter. G&A expense in future periods maybe higher as a result of audit and tax related fees, compensation expense, marketing spending, and other items. G&A was $38.6 million in 2008, up from $31.6 million in 2007. The increase was due primarily to the growth of headcount from 153 employees at the end of 2007 to 210 employees at the end of 2008. In addition, occupancy expense increased approximately 850,000 in 2008 relating to our San Francisco, Boston, and London office rents. Turning now to our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we capitalized 19% or $4.1 million of interest related to construction projects, which compares to 22% or $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. We capitalized approximately 25% or $2.4 million in compensation expense compared to approximately 26% or $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. Finally, as noted in our earnings release, we are not changing guidance at this time. This concludes our formal remarks. We would now be happy to take any questions that you might have. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Irwin Gusman – Citi: Good morning, it’s Irwin Gusman here with Michael. Mike, there was some news over the last couple of weeks about new data center technology being marketed by Dell that effectively allows data centers to run at higher temperatures, the purpose of which is to reduce obsolescence in legacy data centers. Can you explain that technology a little bit and how you see it sort of affecting demand for your product?
Michael Foust: Yes, it’s not a new technology at all. It’s marketing, trying to sell more Dell service, which is good. I mean, we already won our data centers at temperatures well into the 70-degree Fahrenheit up to the mid-70s depending on the circumstances. So, this isn’t really anything new and in that particular article, the ASHRAE and standard they were talking about being set was standards that our engineers participated on the standards setting committee. So, it’s no new news, but just good operating practices though that they are pointing out that you can’t run these facilities much higher and so at the higher temperature – so you can lower your cooling costs and run your data center more efficiently.
Irwin Gusman – Citi: Fair enough. And some of your publicly traded peers have talked about slower rates of bookings among enterprise tenants. Can you talk about what you are seeing and sort of layer that into the analysis that you did that was just published a week ago?
Michael Foust: Sure. We are seeing our velocity of signings and levels of demand staying pretty steady from what we have seen in the previous quarters. So, we haven’t seen any material change at all to our experience with our prospective customers. So, it’s kind of moving along at relatively the same pace.
Irwin Gusman – Citi: Would you say that financial services is still – I think you mentioned 30 to 40% of sort of external demand or the demand that you are tracking for your development pipeline?
Michael Foust: Probably around 25% or so roughly.
Irwin Gusman – Citi: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey, guys. Just – coming back to the construction, what’s under construction at year-end, I think you mentioned in your comments it’s in the supplement of about 408,000 square feet. Two questions about it. One, it doesn’t look like the Manassas property is included in there and just if you could confirm that and then second, could you tell me – characterize how leased this portion of the pipeline is or how leased that portion of the pipeline is?
Michael Foust: Sure. Yes, you are right. The Manassas property is not included in there and that property was acquired and leased to the tenant and the tenant is using their capital to build out the space. So, we identified the side and have the power and fiber and the tenant wanted to use their capital to build that out. So, you are right, it’s not included in that amount.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: How leased is the 409,000?
Michael Foust: I’d say it’s probably more than 50%, probably two-thirds or so is signed leases on it and we’ve got tenants under negotiation for virtually all the space.
Bill Stein: Jordan, for example, included in that number would have been the HSBC facility in Wayland [ph], as well as the Cressex [ph] facility, both of which commenced in January.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Just to get a segue into the question I have for you, Bill, which is what does the backlog look like?
Bill Stein: The signings that haven’t commenced?
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes, sir.
Bill Stein: Okay. Looking into the first quarter, there is about 85% of what we have signed, will commence. And then second quarter about 10%, and 5% in the third quarter.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: What’s the amount in terms of revenue?
Bill Stein: Revenue? Call it roughly $30 million in the first quarter of annualized GAAP rent and $5 million in the second and $5 million in the third.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Those numbers are the contribution to 2009 numbers?
Bill Stein: No, that is our annualized.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Those are annualized?
Bill Stein: Those are annualized. If you want the contribution of ’09, I’d call it like 28 plus in the first quarter, 3 plus in the second quarter, and between 1 and 2 in the third.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then lastly, on Manassas, I’m curious what shell rents look like these days?
Bill Stein: Yes, hey Jordan. Before we go on, all of those revenues are stated in dollars and some of the leases that commenced like the HSBC and Wayland lease in particular and there are some leases also in Paris that have some currency risk associated with them.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, makes sense. And just lastly, on Manassas, I’m curious what shell rents look like these days.
Michael Foust: Yes, that one because we didn’t make any additional Powered Base Building improvements, we really turned around and leased that more on a high-end industrial rent. So, the returns are good, but the rents are – don’t reflect the true Powered Base Building.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Low-20s?
Michael Foust: Actually lower than that just because it’s more of an industrial building rent, but the returns are very good for us.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Bill Stein: Returns are very good for an industrial building.
Michael Foust: Because we are able to play it right. So –
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, I’ll hop back in the queue. Thanks, guys.
Michael Foust: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Michael Bowen – Piper Jaffray: Okay, thank you. Nice quarter. I had a couple of questions. First of all, I guess first question for Bill. Bill, how do you think about going forward here when you make your decisions about doing either equity or debt offerings? I mean, obviously I know debt is expensive here, but one can make the argument that the equity is not necessarily cheap either. I just want to understand your methodology with regard to that. Second question, you guys had already pre-announced that – I believe your number of square footage for signed leases in the fourth quarter was I think 276,000 and one thing that struck me was that that was down sequentially and down year-over-year. So, I wanted to get a feel for it if you could now that we are two months into – almost two months into first quarter, how signed leases are progressing in the first quarter, whether you are seeing a pickup there and I guess that really dovetails off the other question with regard to some of your other non-REIT peers in the space are experiencing slowness in bookings. So, I want to get an idea on how things are tracking. Thanks.
Bill Stein: Okay, I’ll address the balance sheet and Michael will address the second question. So, we have plenty of capacity on our revolver as I indicated. But our objective is to maintain as much liquidity on that facility as we can. We also have plenty of capacity within our financial covenants to add more debt. So, I think given the choice today, we would look at debt rather than equity. The market is being a little stingy in terms of allowing company’s access to debt as you are probably – as you probably know. But we are in the market – as I said, we are documenting one small mortgage, the $18 million deal. Then we are going to market with another package or two in the US and we are looking at another secured financing in Europe as well. So, our bias at this point would be to achieve mortgage debt if we could get it at reasonable rates. Fortunately, we’ve got plenty of room on the credit facility and so, we are not in any dire need to go back to market in either case. I think in terms of whether or not we go back to the equities, we saw the last raise, it’s basically an opportunistic small raise, we were concerned that – in terms of timing, we were concerned that the announcements coming out of the administration might not be well received and that that might put a little downward pressure on the market. So, we thought it would be an appropriate time to take a little equity, not a lot of equity because frankly we didn’t need it, we didn’t know, I mean the stock price could go higher. So, in a sense, we were dollar averaging it.
Michael Bowen – Piper Jaffray: Okay.
Michael Foust: And then regarding your question on signed leases, a couple of things I think, leases in our world tend to be very chunky. They are sizeable square footages, sizeable dollar amounts, and we had an extremely high quarter in the third quarter, actually the highest quarter we ever had. So, I think some of those deals that may have been fourth quarter deals percolated into the third quarter and if you look overall for the year, it did – it’s quite good. Also, in November/December, I think almost all businesses really kind of pulled back their reins and took stock of kind of where their situations were going to be going forward and yes, there is definitely a slowdown in those two months. And then that we’ve seen mid-January – companies seem to have their budgets in place and seem to have their strategic and tactical plans in place. So, we are seeing that our leasing activity at a very good pace right now. So, I think there is a bit of a low there at the end of the year, last two months of the year that now has – activity has picked up again.
Michael Bowen – Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Sri Anantha with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Mike, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about this potentially 5 million of opportunity in the marketplace. Could you just maybe give us some color on that? How much of that demand do you think is coming from your existing tenants as opposed to new tenants? And second question for Bill. Bill, I know you guys have maintained the guidance, is it possible to give some kind of a breakdown? I know previously you guys talked about Turn-Key and Powered Base lease commencements of about 500 to 570. Just based on your recent plans, it looked like more of it is coming from Turn-Key as opposed to Powered Base. Should we expect that to continue in 2009? Thanks.
Michael Foust:
 :
Bill Stein: Yes, relative to guidance, as I said we are not making any changes there at this time neither to the output nor the assumptions, but having said that, there is I think going to be more leasing out of the Turn-Key space than Powered Base during the year. And I think that’s a fair assumption, Sri.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: Thanks, guys. Good quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with Banc of America. Please go ahead.
George Auerbach – Banc of America: Hi, good afternoon. Mike, you mentioned that demand to your markets was flattish quarter-over-quarter at around 5 million square feet. But if you begin to see tenants push back on rents just given the macro weakness and uncertainty as – which markets and industries seem most affected?
Michael Foust: Well, we haven’t seen pushback on rents thus far. So, we are being conservative and we are not projecting significant increases in rents. I mean, where rents are typically at that – providing good returns currently. In terms of what verticals might be slowing down, gosh, the one – our primary vertical market with some of the Internet enterprises and financial services and some of the broader corporate Fortune 1000s, we really – I couldn’t say that we are seeing a particular slowdown in any of them.
George Auerbach – Banc of America: Okay. Bill, what was your construction in progress for the year that you were capitalizing at year-end?
Bill Stein: Year-end, it’s a little over 400, 403.8 to be precise. But as I said, quite a bit of that includes Wayland and Cressex, which were coming out in January. That’ll all be that – but the numbers will be in the queue, which is (inaudible) on credit.
George Auerbach – Banc of America: Okay. And finally, have you seen construction costs on the redevelopment pipeline abate over the last 12 months, just given the pullback in some commodity markets and a general slackening in demand?
Bill Stein: Really no. With that said, our team has done a great job of standardizing and industrializing, if you will, our engineering design and construction and equipment purchasing. But I can’t say that there has been any kind of significant decrease overall in cost. And I think what you see is, for a lot of this electrical equipment and generators and what not, the equipment is billed to order not to inventory. So, as demand slackens manufacturers are also reducing their manufacturing capacity at the same time. So, they are holding on unit cost, but the good news for us is because we have our global purchasing programs in place, it gives us a lot of flexibility for equipment both here and in Europe. So, we can continue to enjoy a pretty significant cost advantage over other folks building these facilities.
George Auerbach – Banc of America: Okay, it’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Hey, guys. Can you just give us a little color on how you thought about deploying capital this quarter for the acquisitions that you did? Obviously, the one you talked about sounded opportunistic. What about the joint venture, how did you think about preserving capital versus going ahead to do that deal?
Bill Stein: It’s a very attractive yield, Michael, on acquiring the JV equity from our partner, and from an administrative standpoint, it was good to take full ownership of the asset. These assets, once they are fully owned go into our revolver borrowing base and in the case of these two, at least the one had a debt on it and the second one we are negotiating to put debt on it. But it’s still easier to put the debt on if it’s solely owned by Digital. So, bottom line it was an extremely attractive return.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Was that on par with development or was that –
Bill Stein: I’d say so. I mean, let me put it this way, a smidge under, but without any of the risk. I mean, it’s already leased. So –
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Can you just help us understand your thoughts on sort of the overall health of your tenant base in this downturn compared to what we may have seen had you been as big as you are today in the last downturn?
Michael Foust: Well, I think one big difference between 2000 to 2002 timeframe and today is that so many of these facilities were populated by ventureback.com type tenants who in many cases were really negative EBITDA startup type companies. Whereas today, the tenant base in these facilities – and this holds true for our IT services tenants as well, the (inaudible). Their customer base are corporate enterprise now for the most part and large Internet enterprises that have significant revenue, significant EBITDA. So, it’s a real different customer profile and I think it reflects the fact that these types of facilities and the Internet and data processing is really not just focused on Internet per se, but it’s utilized by corporations overall. And, I think we are seeing that both on our direct customers, as well as the customers of our system integrator and IT services tenants.
Bill Stein: Yes, Mike. Let me – and I would characterize these as essential facilities to higher-grade credits than what was taking place in the early 2000 timeframe. I think the economy is in worse shape today than it was then, but I think that the usage and the needs are very different.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Gutierrez with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Susan Gutierrez – JMP Securities: Hi, thanks. I was just wondering if you could discuss what you are seeing in the market in terms of cap rates and what the cap rate looks like on your fourth quarter acquisition.
Michael Foust: Cap rates are really hard to peg and I think similar for the – our datacenter niche as in other product types just because there is so few transactions occurring right now. Our investments in the fourth quarter, one was a building we acquired vacant for a customer in Virginia and we were able to lease to lease that at a very attractive return for ourselves, but it was a vacant building when we bought it and as Bill just mentioned, the buying of the 50% in the joint ventures, which worked out well. So, I’d have to say it’s really hard to peg cap rates today just because there is so few comps occurring.
Susan Gutierrez – JMP Securities: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Jordan Sadler. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Can you guys just clarify on the acquisition of 1500 Space Park and 1201 Comstock, I might have missed this, did the $20 million I assume that excludes – that’s just the equity?
Bill Stein: Well, 1500, you’re right; it’s just the equity. 1500 had debt in place, 1201 does not. 1201 is where we are working to put debt in place.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: So, the $22 [ph] million, roughly half of that was the JV partners, right. So, the all-in price was probably more like $42 million, that’s the right way to look at it?
Michael Foust: Yes, it would be the right way to look at. I don’t know if that's -- that’s not the exact number, but –
Bill Stein: Yes, because our investment in our half is less than what we paid our partner for his investment, if you follow what I’m saying.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: No, but I’ll follow up with you later. And then, you mentioned $623 million of immediate liquidity. Did that exclude what remains in terms of the commitment under the Pru facility?
Bill Stein: Yes.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And so, what’s – just remind me what’s left under there? Is it about $125 million to $150 million?
Bill Stein: It’s about $117 million, I think. That is an uncommitted facility though. So, when we look at our liquidity position, we don’t include that.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Wait, it’s committed or it’s uncommitted?
Bill Stein: It’s uncommitted. It’s always been uncommitted.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: I thought it was actually committed, but that you drawdown on an individual. I guess I’ll follow up with you on that one as well. And then, just I guess more a big picture, I was curious in terms of your thoughts and expectations as it relates to the stimulus bill and healthcare IT spending, how, Mike you think that may factor in and if you are seeing any evidence of what may come of that type of spending?
Michael Foust: Yes, it’s interesting that you bring that up, because that’s something that we are looking at pretty closely and our sales team and some of our analysts are looking at closely to try to discern where the spending is going to occur. A lot of it is supposedly targeted for on to buying records and access and records with tension and billing and those sorts of things, which would play very well into the strategy of providing increased data processing capacity and facilities for that. So, not clear how that’s going to play out, a lot of your large healthcare companies tend to own their facilities because they own large hospitals and again, clinic buildings, but I think we have a very good value proposition for these folks that we can provide some of this increased requirements and they could put their capital into the – directly into the healthcare facilities instead of in the data centers. So, that’s one, it’s not clear how it’s going to play out, but it’s definitely a vertical that our group is focusing on.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then, I just curious about what you are seeing and you may have touched on this a bit, just the mix of the 5 million square foot pipeline that you guys are tracking, Turn-Key versus shell.
Bill Stein: It would probably be – the great majority would be Turn-Key. Also I just want to reinforce that that 5 million fees, that’s requirement in the marketplace that we’ve identified. So, it’s not necessarily folks that we are negotiating with or have proposals out. We’ve got proposals, you are engaged on about 75 megawatts, which would translate to roughly 1.5 million, 1.7 million square feet or so on a kind of gross rentable basis, but what’s encouraging is that companies are seeking out data center expansion and new solutions. So, I think just in terms of kind of gross numbers it’s encouraging, but certainly folks need Turn-Key built-out space whether they do it themselves or whether they come to DLR.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then, on that – the part of the amount you’re engaged on, what's the typical or expected close ratio?
Michael Foust: I think probably around 30% to 40%.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then, you said that’s supposedly Turn-Key as well?
Bill Stein: Yes.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And last question just is on the roll. What is the mix of the roll for 2009, you have 5% of rent rolling roughly?
Michael Foust: Yes, I think we’ve got a pretty large portion is non-technical space actually.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Wasn’t that 2010 that you got non-technical spaces rolling or is that –
Michael Foust: Well, I think – in both years it’s about – I think about two-thirds of it is technical space and about a third is non-technical space.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And of the technical, how would you handicap it Turn-Key versus shell?
Michael Foust: I’ll have to take a look at that because a lot of leases are essentially Powered Base Building because of the tenant put be improvements in themselves.
Bill Stein: Yes, mostly shell.
Michael Foust: It would be more Powered Base Building type rents.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Any sort of process Bill, in terms of giving us maybe a little bit more color on the roll schedule given that it’s going to be a little bit more meaningful over the next couple of years in terms of the exposure?
Bill Stein: Well, we could do that. It’s in our guidance; it’s in the bottom line number.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: I know, but it just makes it easier for us to track and sensitize as we look forward.
Michael Foust: You want to model it or something?
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes, that’s what we do.
Bill Stein: You won’t accept our word for it, will you?
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: We think an awful lot of you guys.
Michael Foust: No, but I think what we will be able to do is as we start going through the year, we will be able to give more details and more clarity, but I think we’ll have a good renewal rate and in some cases where maybe tenants are not renewing or downsizing a little bit, we are getting space back that we are redeploying at good rates. So, it’s bit of a combination there, but –
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Anybody giving back space?
Michael Foust: We are working on one lease right now with one of the larger network providers and we are actually – in San Francisco and what we are able to do is renegotiate the space on the remainder that they are keeping and that’s actually going to be somewhat higher total revenues than we are achieving now and then we’ll have 40 or 50,000 feet that we can then redeploy in just one of our Internet gateway buildings at – where we expect good rents. So, kind of getting our – from the benefit of accommodating a customer, but still maintaining our revenue profile at the same time and with space to grow.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Bill Stein: Qwest was a big give-back too in the fourth quarter.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: There was one in the fourth quarter?
Bill Stein: Yes, that’s what Qwest was, the termination fee.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Right. Any prospects on backfilling that space?
Michael Foust: Yes, I mean we’ve signed one pod customer and we’ve got prospects that we are negotiating with for virtually all the space.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: So, leased by year-end safely?
Michael Foust: Yes.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Bill Stein: Signed.
Michael Foust: Yes, we expect to have signed leases for the floor by the end of the year.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Dave Rodgers – RBC Capital Markets: Hey, Bill, I just wanted to follow up. $380 million to $430 million is the number I wrote down for capital deployment. Was that just for ’09 or did that include all the finishing on the redevelopment and development spending and did that also include acquisition?
Bill Stein: That’s ’09, that includes redevelopment CapEx, that includes portfolio CapEx, that also includes debt maturities and amortization. That’s all capital outflows, not just CapEx for redev.
Dave Rodgers – RBC Capital Markets: So, if we just look at I guess the capital spending for redevelopment, development, TIs, other improvements that are planned from now till completion, what does that number look like?
Bill Stein: I mentioned that that was $275 million in the quarter.
Dave Rodgers – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. With respect to acquisitions –
Michael Foust: That’s part of our guidance that.
Dave Rodgers – RBC Capital Markets: Which was consistent with the – I just wanted to make sure that that was consistent. With respect to the acquisitions or opportunities, I didn’t hear you address this, and if you did, I apologize but with respect to distressed opportunities or similar to the Manassas acquisition, industrial other types of asset, can you just comment broadly on what you’re seeing?
Michael Foust: We’re really not seeing anything distressed leases, any assets that even might tend to being distressed are assets that aren’t built out. So, and there maybe some interesting opportunities as we need to fill-in in certain markets and bring online some incremental space, but by and large, assets that are leased are enjoying good cash flow and typically are under-levered and there is really – you don’t see distressed in our sector at this point. But we are keeping our eyes open for opportunistic – or I wouldn’t say opportunistic, but opportunities that we see where maybe on a risk-adjusted return an acquisition might look interesting or there might be some portfolio situations down the road, but – and then, the Manassas building that was more kind of a buy-to-suit if you will, we – one of our existing customers needed to expand and so we went out and found a building for them. And we will certainly look to do more of that and I’m thinking that perhaps finally maybe 2009 might be the year where sale lease-backs might be attractive to owners, especially corporates who would want to do sale lease-back on corporate-owned facilities. So, I have been saying that every year for the last five years, but maybe this year will be a year where we may have some opportunities there.
Bill Stein: We’ve also looked at some situations where mortgage debt was presented to us at a discount mortgage debt on data centers, but have not been able to come to an agreement on pricing on any of that.
Dave Rodgers – RBC Capital Markets: What type of discounts are being offered?
Bill Stein: Not big enough for us.
Dave Rodgers – RBC Capital Markets: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with UBS. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: Yes, good afternoon. I just wanted to push a little bit more on the acquisition environment. In the two acquisitions you did, one, who was the JV partner on 1500 Space Park again and just based on the pricing you guys paid, what exactly were the cap rates on those two deals?
Michael Foust: The partner in that market is Pelio & Associates and a very experienced Santa Clara developer and investor, and we are not disclosing the exact economics on that.
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: Okay.
Michael Foust: But it was consistent with kind of our risk-adjusted returns for that kind of a lease facility.
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: And then the Pru financing, could you kind of just walk us through the basic terms of that again?
Bill Stein: Which one? The one we did in the fourth quarter or the first quarter?
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: The fourth quarter.
Bill Stein: The fourth quarter was $25 million, I’m sorry that was the fourth quarter – the fourth quarter was $33 million at 9.32%, that was five years interest only, five-year book. And the first quarter was a $25 million draw for seven years interest only at 9.68.
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: And you said you still have $117 million of draw you can make against this, but it’s an uncommitted facility. Is that correct?
Bill Stein: It’s an uncommitted facility. So, Pru doesn’t have to make any of it available and the pricing is subject to negotiation every time we draw.
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: Got it, got it. Okay, thank you very much.
Bill Stein: So far they’ve made it available, but I think for the purposes of liquidity planning.
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: You guys don’t include it? Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from the line of Sri Anantha. Please go ahead.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: Mike, I know you’ve said on your comments that you haven’t seen any material slowdown in your leasing signing activity. Is it safe to assume that given that you are already through mostly two months in the 1Q that the pace of new lease signing in 1Q is at least on part of it what you have signed in 4Q?
Michael Foust: Probably not signing, negotiations are up, but I think a majority of the signings will happen early in the second quarter.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: Got it. And in the past you guys have made comments that Chicago was one of your strongest markets. Is that still the case today? At least it does seem to be that a couple of your peers seem to be in Chicago. They’ve generally been – market being slower than expected in that part of the market.
Michael Foust: Yes, there is a real dichotomy between our building and the central CBD type properties. Our building being 350 Cermak, really is the fortress Internet gateway that has a lot of financial services, a lot of the trading, commodity trading platforms, a lot of these applications need very low latency because of the power infrastructure and the network infrastructure in there. It’s very attractive for customers. So, our demand is very strong in that market and I think just reflects and suburban market is a different tenant base perhaps and I’m speculating it might be more of a tenant base that tend to do it themselves, some of the large insurance companies that already own big corporate campuses, I’m kind of speculating in my part, but why it might be a little bit significantly slower in the suburbs than at 350 Cermak.
Bill Stein: Sri, we are not able to tout or endorse any other third-party data source, but Tier One did a report on this within the last month. I think it was entitled The Tale of Two Cities if I remember it right.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: Got it. And Bill, on your guidance for 2009, does the lease commencements include any contribution from acquisitions? And secondly, I know previously you talked about average annualized gross rent of $125 per square foot. But so far, what you have signed is much higher, any reason why that could be lower in 2009?
Bill Stein: There is nothing in for acquisitions right now other than the deal that we talked about that we subsequently – that might even be in the leasing budget rather than the acquisition budget. We are not changing guidance on rents Sri, at this time.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: I know you don’t want to change, but I’m just curious why it would be only $125 rent, you are signing at much higher rates today.
Bill Stein: It’s a blend.
Sri Anantha – Oppenheimer: Got it. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thanks. Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Bilerman. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Yes. Bill, just in the supplemental on page 19 where you evolve the annualized base rents for 1500 Space Park, that’s $5.1 million of annualized rents. That’s 50% or is that listed at 100%?
Bill Stein: Which page are you, Michael?
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Page 19, whether you list these annualized rents at your share or at joint venture?
Bill Stein: I need to find it first. It should be the whole thing, Michael.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: If you take $5.1 million and you can put a margin on that and you look at the gross value implied by the $20.1 million, you get to a very, very low cap rate. I guess I’m just trying to put the pieces together, all right? There was a $44 million gross mortgage on it and your 20.1 would equate to an $85 million valuation for the asset and if it’s only $5.1 million of rents that would be a very low cap rate. Even if it’s 50% then you gross it up and apply your typical 63%, 64% margin, you’d still be in the $7 million.
Michael Foust: You’re talking two buildings now and you’re talking the equity only.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Right, I’m just trying to figure what the – I mean, which other building get – got paid for in the $20.2 million?
Bill Stein: 1201 Space Park.
Michael Foust: 1201 Comstock.
Bill Stein: 1201 Comstock.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: As part of the valuation for that?
Bill Stein: It was a buyout of both properties in the joint venture.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: And these were the original contribution properties?
Michael Foust: No. No, these were our joint venture properties that we developed over the last year.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: The 1201 and then there was a lease subsequent to signing I guess so there was no income?
Michael Foust: Correct. Yes, yes, 1201 – well, both of these were billed that we started out as spec builds, and then subsequently both properties were leased and 1201 Comstock was completed and then lease commencement in January.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: And so, what was that – what sort of rental income is coming off 1201?
Michael Foust: We haven’t provided it. That will be in the first quarter, but our supplemental is only through December of ’08.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Thank you. Can you give a sense of what the rents were on that square footage? And so, it was only 24,000 square feet, so?
Michael Foust: Not specifically, I mean we’ve got NDAs with the tenants in most of these cases. So, we’ll be providing that, but I don’t think we are prepared to give that right now.
Bill Stein: That Wells Fargo loan LIBOR was a very high loan-to-cost loan.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: $344 million [ph]?
Bill Stein: Yes.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Was there a by-sell in the joint ventures?
Bill Stein: No, not that I recall.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: And so, they approached you or you approached them?
Bill Stein: It was mutual I’d say. I mean, this is a private developer and –
Michael Bilerman – Citi: They seemed to get most of the prices out when you did the re-fi in September.
Bill Stein: Yes, we did very well on the re-fi.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: And is there any – we are clearly seeing on the retail side, there is a lot of tenants obviously asking for some rental lease and I was curious just given the high operating costs that the tenants would be paying in the datacenter and I recognize they are in many cases mission critical, but I got to assume that’s a big piece of the operating budget. I’m just curious to see how tenants are reacting in this sort of environment.
Michael Foust: Well, yes, certainly we are seeing lease rates holding at similar levels that we’ve experienced over the last couple of quarters. So, we are not seeing significant reductions at all.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: I’m just wondering if tenants – you are finding a lot in retail tenants are actually coming and asking for reductions on their existing space. You are saying that that’s not occurring with any of your tenants?
Michael Foust: Yes, that’s correct, specifically not now.
Bill Stein: And Michael, some of what flows through reimbursements here are utility costs, which are significant and the tenant needs the power to function.
Michael Foust: And just going back to the 1201 Comstock building, I don’t have the rents at my fingertips here, but you’re going to see that they are Turn-Key rents that are very consistent with what we’ve been achieving with lease signings on the previous couple of quarters.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Okay, thank you.
Michael Foust: And it’s a smaller building as well.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Knott. Please go ahead.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Hey guys, I just wanted to ask you about your assessment of the overall mark-to-market in your existing portfolio. I think you had said previously it was in the 20 to 25% range. Do you feel like the current environment has lessened that at all and if so, by how much?
Michael Foust: I think so, because at least up to this point, lease rates are consistent with where they’ve been in the past couple of quarters. So, I don’t think that would – on general terms, that would change.
Michael Knott – Green Street Advisors: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And management, at this time, I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing comments.
Michael Foust: Great. Well, I appreciate everybody being on the call and your interest in DLR and I want to thank our team members here for a great year in 2008 and we expect to keep the program rolling along at a very good pace. So, thank you everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today’s teleconference.

To manage the call in a timely manner, questions will be limited to two per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Foust:  Great. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of Digital Realty Trust, then I'll review the strong success of our portfolio operations during the quarter and conclude with a discussion of market trends and supply and demand conditions. Following my remarks, Bill Stein will discuss in detail liquidity, dividend increase, third quarter financial performance, and our outlook for the balance of 2008 and 2009. First, a brief introduction. Digital Realty Trust is the leading owner and manager of technology real estate. Our portfolio currently contained 74 properties containing 12.9 million rental square feet, and this excludes one property - the Westin Building in Seattle - that's held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Our properties are located in 27 metro areas across North America and Europe. The portfolio now includes approximately 1.6 million square feet of space held for redevelopment, a very important source of growth for the company. DLR provides a variety of datacenter facilities solutions, including Turn-Key Datacenter, Power Base Building, and Build-To-Suit Datacenters for domestic and international corporate customers. Our properties serve a wide range of industry vertical markets, including information technology, Internet enterprises, financial services, telecom network providers, energy companies, and other Fortune 1000 firms.  Turning now to our portfolio operations, our team turned in another very successful quarter, especially with respect to leasing operations and finance. Demand is high for our datacenter products and we are closely managing our balance sheet to maintain comfortable levels of liquidity.  Portfolio occupancy, excluding space held for redevelopment, held steady at 95.2% at the end of the third quarter compared to 95.1% for the same period in 2007. The record volume of leases signed during the quarter is a result of our successful leasing program, which continues to capture demand for new facilities by corporate enterprise customers and enterprise IT service providers. As previously announced, leases commenced during the quarter on approximately 351,000 square feet of space. This includes 190,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $142 per square foot. It includes 104,000 square feet of Power Base Building leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $30 per square foot, and 58,000 square feet of non-technical space leased at an average annual rental rate of $23 per square foot.  Year-to-date as of 9/30/08, we commenced 682,000 square feet of Datacenter at an average GAAP rental rate of $116 per square foot and 142,000 square feet of non-technical space at an average annual rental rate of $23 per square foot, which are all in line with our previously revised 2008 expectations.  Reflecting the demand we continue to see in our top markets, we signed a record amount of leases during the quarter, totaling 478,000 square feet of space signed consisting of 262,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $155 per square foot, 171,000 square feet of Power Base Building at an average rental rate of $47 per square foot, and 45,000 square feet of non-technical space leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $13 per square foot.  These tenants represent a wide variety of industries, including major financial firms such as JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade and Goldman Sachs, large telecom and IT service providers, including BT America, T-Systems and Equinex, a large health care provider in Dallas, and finally, leading international system integrators such as IBM. Year-to-date as of 9/30/08 we've signed leases for 766,000 square feet of Datacenter at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $112 per square foot and 94,000 square feet of non-technical space at an average annual rental rate of $19 per square foot. Despite the challenging market conditions, overall we continue to see very attractive pricing and strong demand throughout our top markets, particularly for our Turn-Key Datacenter product. Demand for Datacenter space continues to be very healthy in our primary markets. The DLR team currently is engaged in direct discussions with over 1.9 million square feet of new Datacenter prospects. In addition, we've identified over 5 million square feet of active requirements seeking space in these markets.  We continue to see significant lack of supply necessary to meet this demand and DLR remains one of the full Datacenter providers with the financial capacity and expertise to proactively build turnkey facilities.  A significant factor for our success is the depth and experience of our technical sales, design and construction and operations teams, who make DLR the preferred infrastructure solution provider for many large corporations and system integrators. Turning to our redevelopment program, we currently are under way on construction projects in high demand markets in the U.S. and Europe that will approximately 294,000 gross rentable square feet of additional Datacenter space to operating portfolio, including the HSBC BuildToSuit in suburban London. Approximately 531,000 rentable square feet of redevelopment plus 26,000 rentable square feet that previously was not classified as redev space were delivered as turnkey space in the first three quarters of the year. Overall, we plan to deliver approximately 50 megawatts of IT load in 2008. In addition, we were able to capture previously unutilized space of 120,000 square feet from Qwest in our 350 East Cermak facility in Chicago in exchange for a substantial payment to DLR. We are redeploying this space as Turn-Key Datacenter to meet the demands from our tenants, including securities and commodity trading customers at the property. No other space is available at the building. We expect to achieve significant added value at this flagship facility in what is likely our highest demand market. Overall, our leasing and product delivery programs remain on track to contribute strong results in 2008 and into 2009. We are carefully monitoring both the demand for Datacenter space as well as capital availability in the credit markets as we continue to meet our customers' requirements for mission-critical IT infrastructure. The DLR team will continue to manage liquidity closely and will maintain prudent levels of cash. We believe that our business model, unmatched organizational depth and breadth, strong balance sheet and proven ability to access capital will continue to drive above-market long-term FFO growth for DLR. I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein, who will discuss our third quarter 2008 results, capital program, our increased 2008 FFO guidance, and new guidance for 2009. Bill?
Bill Stein:  Thanks, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. I will begin with a discussion of our liquidity position and our dividend announcement, and then review our third quarter 2008 financial results, our revised guidance for 2008, and our outlook for 2009. Following my remarks we will open the call to your questions. Liquidity has become a critical concern for all businesses, including REITs, and maintaining a strong balance sheet with the financial flexibility to continue to fund our acquisition, redevelopment and development activities is a priority for us. Our ability to access capital from multiple sources is a critical component of our success.  In anticipation of what has developed into a significant economic downturn and global liquidity crisis, since the end of the second quarter of 2008 we have sourced and closed over $492 million of debt and equity capital, plus $142 million remaining on an uncommitted, unsecured private [shell] facility with Prudential. As a result, we have sufficient liquidity solely through borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet all of our planned capital expenditures and maturities through 2009 and most of our debt maturities in 2010. Our third quarter financings included a common stock offering in July which generated $211.6 million in net proceeds, the addition of a new $25 million commitment from Deutsche Bank increasing aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to $675 million, the initial draw of $25 million from the Prudential facility at an interest rate of 7% with a three-year maturity, a second draw of $33 million which we'll fund today at an interest rate of 9.32% with a five-year maturity.  We also completed the following secured debt financings on three properties, generating proceeds of almost $198 million:  We reported on our last call we closed an $80 million secured financing in July on our 3 Corporate Place facility located in Piscataway, New Jersey. This loan has a three-year maturity with two one-year extensions and an interest rate of 6.72%.  On September 11, 2008 we closed a $44 million secured financing for the joint venture at 1500 Space Park in Santa Clara, California. Our pro rata share of the total proceeds was $22 million. The loan has a five-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.15%, with principal amortization on a 15-year schedule. On September 2, 2008 we executed documents for a secured construction and permanent debt financing for a Datacenter facility located north of London in Welwyn Garden City. Practical completion of the project is expected later this month, and estimated proceeds on the permanent loan will be up to 53.7 million pounds, limited by a 75% loan-to-value ratio. The permanent loan will have a five-year term, no amortization, and an all-in swapped interest rate currently in the range of 5.5% to 5.75%. Approximately 28.7 million pounds has been funded to date on the construction loan. The proceeds from these transactions were utilized to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other general corporate purposes. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.3 billion and our ratio of debt to total market cap was 22.6% based on the September 30 stock price of $47.25. Based on yesterday's closing stock price of $34.05, our ratio of debt to total market value capitalization would be 27.7%. Our cash fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5 times and our cash debt service coverage was 4 times. As of September 30 our weighted average cost of debt, including interest rate swaps, was 5.76% and the weighted average maturity was 5.2 years, including debt extension options.  A description of how we calculate these ratios can be found in our supplemental operating and financial data report furnished to the SEC and available on our website. For additional information on our revolving credit facility, we have now added a new schedule to the third quarter supplemental package entitled Revolving Credit Facility Commitments, which lists the 17 participating banks and their corresponding commitments. Turning now to our revolver, we currently have approximately $106 million outstanding on the credit facility. We are holding $60 million of that in short-term investments which represents our estimate of funding requirements over the next 30 days. Including the $33 million Pru facility that we'll fund today, we will have $662 million of immediate liquidity through short-term investments and funds that can be drawn on our revolving credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, our pro forma debt to total market cap would be approximately 36.7% based on yesterday's closing stock price of $34.05. Looking ahead, based on our current plans we expect our capital requirements for the balance of 2008 and 2009 to total between $500 and $550 million, including $425 to $475 million of CapEx and $79 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities in 2009. This assumes that we exercise the one-year extension option on 350 East Cermak in June 2009. If we fund all cash needs through the end of 2009 entirely on our revolver, we would have approximately $70 to $90 million of liquidity at the end of 2009. By the end of 2008 we expect to have sufficient eligible assets in our borrowing base to be able to fully utilize the revolver and the remainder of the Pru shell facility.  In 2010, including the $95 million loan at 350 East Cermak, we will have a total of $108.7 million of debt and principal amortization. The Cermak property is expected to have approximately $40 million of NOI in 2009. Based on this level of NOI, some time over the next 18 months we expect to be able to refinance this loan with a new mortgage at Cermak. We could also issue notes through the uncommitted Prudential shell facility or raise secured debt at one of our other unencumbered assets.  Moving now to our dividend, yesterday we announced an increase of 6.5% or $0.02 to $0.33 per quarter for our common stock dividend. We currently estimate that the 2009 payout will represent approximately 103% of our 2009 taxable income based on the midpoint of our second quarter results guidance. We expect future dividend increases will be based on increases in the company's taxable income and the need to meet our redistribution requirements. Now I'd like to turn to our third quarter results. FFO of $0.69 per diluted share and unit includes approximately $0.06 per share of additional FFO from certain significant nonrecurring items consisting primarily of $7.9 million representing a partial lease termination fee of $9.4 million from Qwest at our 350 East Cermak property net of $1.5 million of non-cash expenses.  This was offset by $1.6 million of non-cash expenses recognized related to the acceleration of the 2005 outperformance plan and $576,000 in straight-line rent adjustments related to two leases. After adjusting for nonrecurring items, FFO would have been $0.63 per diluted share and unit for the third quarter of 2008, a 6.8% increase over the second quarter of 2008 and a 23.5% increase over the same period in 2007. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the third quarter of 2008 was $44 million or $0.55 per diluted share and unit. This compares to second quarter 2008 AFFO of $30.4 million or $0.41 per diluted share and unit. The AFFO payment ratio for the third quarter of 2008 was 56.4%, down from the second quarter AFFO payout ratio of 75.6%.  EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and minority interest was $80.7 million in the third quarter of 2008, up 18.5% from $68.1 million in the second quarter and up 41.3% from $57.1 million for the third quarter of 2007.  Net income for the third quarter was $18.2 million, up 31.9% from $13.8 million in the second quarter and up 256.9% from $5.1 million for the same period in 2007. Net income available to common shareholders in the third quarter was $8.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share, up $3.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the previous quarter, a net loss available to common stockholders of $0.2 million or zero per diluted share for the same period in 2007. Same-store NOI was $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2008, up 1.5% from $69.1 million in the second quarter of 2008 and up 15.2% from $60.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and FAS 141 adjustments, which we refer to as same-store cash NOI, was $64.9 million in the third quarter, up 6.4% from $61 million in the second quarter of 2008 and up 24.6% from $52.1 million in the third quarter of 2007. These increases were primarily the result of new leasing in our properties commencing during the 12month period ended September 30, 2008.  I would now briefly review specific items in the statement of operations to provide additional detail on the results for the quarter. For the third quarter, rent revenues increased to $102.4 million, up 4.5% from $98 million in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of leases signed in previous quarters.  G&A increased during the quarter to $11.3 million, up from $9.8 in the previous quarter, primarily due to the acceleration of the outperformance plan. G&A would have been flat quarter of 2005 if we had not accelerated the outperformance plan. Turning now to our balance sheet, during the third quarter we capitalized 22% or $4.4 million of interest related to construction projects, which compares to 24% or $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was due to additional construction projects coming online during the quarter. In addition, excluding the OPP acceleration, we capitalized approximately 26% or $2.8 million in compensation expenses compared to 27% or $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2008.  I would now like to discuss our revised guidance for 2008. With better visibility towards our full year results, we are raising FFO guidance to a range of $2.58 to $2.60 per diluted share and unit. This increase is due to stronger than expected leasing results for the second half of the year as well as the significant nonrecurring items previously discussed. Adjusting for the nonrecurring items mentioned that impacted Q3, plus an additional $4 million from the Qwest lease termination fee net of non-cash expenses that will be recognized in Q4 or $0.05 per diluted share and unit, FFO for the full year 2008 to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.49. This represents projected FFO growth of 20.5% to 21.5% over full year 2007 FFO of $2.05 per diluted share and unit. Moving on to our initial 2009 guidance, FFO per diluted share and unit for the year ending December 31, 2009 is projected to be between $2.75 and $2.90. This guidance represents projected FFO growth of 5.8% to 12.4% over the 2008 revised FFO range of $2.58 to $2.60 per diluted share and unit.  Excluding the implementation of APB 14-1, which increases our GAAP interest expense by $4 million, FFO per diluted share and unit and net income per share for 2009 would both be higher by approximately $0.04 per share. Adjusting for both the nonrecurring items positively impacting 2008 results and the adoption of the new rules negatively impacting 2009 projections, FFO growth from 2008 to 2009 would be between 12% to 19%. For the balance of 2008 and 2009, all capital expenditures are assumed to be funded through the company's revolving credit facility. As of today, the balance of the revolving credit facility of $106 million and the company has $93 million in cash and short-term investments.  The 2009 guidance is based on the following additional assumptions: Commencement of leases for approximately 500,00 square feet to 570,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter and Power Base Building space at average annualized gross rents of $125 per square foot; the commencement of leases for 150,000 square feet to 265,000 square feet of basic commercial space at an average annualized gross rent of $21 per square foot; total capital expenditures in 2009 of $275 to $325 million; total G&A of $47 million, which includes $500,000 of acquisition-related costs previously capitalized which now must be expensed under new accounting rules commencing January 1, 2009; an additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $4 million due to the adoption of SEP ABP 14-1.  In conclusion, with modest financing between now and the end of 2010, we have sufficient liquidity without issuing new equity to meet our current growth expectations.  This concludes our formal remarks. We would now be happy to take any questions that you might have.  
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Bilerman - Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup:  Mike, I have a question on the guidance for 2009 with regards to leases commencing. Based on sort of the volume of demand that you mentioned you were tracking in your prepared remarks and the sheer volume of leasing that you've done over the last several months, I'm wondering why the amount commencing next year, assuming a lot of the leasing you're doing now won't commence until then, I'm wondering why that number wouldn't be bigger considering you've commenced probably about 40% more this year than what you're projecting to start next year?
Michael Foust: It's really our amount of leasing activity and commencements is driven largely by capital availability and our desire to maintain a sufficient capital liquidity cushion. So we're taking a conservative view. If the capital markets loosen up a little bit next year, as we're hopeful they will, then we'll be able to beat those numbers. So really it's not a reflection of demand; it's a reflection of capital availability that we're seeing today in the marketplace.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: So are you holding back on pursuing some of this new demand because of capital constraints?
Michael Foust: Yes. Yes, I mean, there's business that undoubtedly we would like to do, but we won't be able to address in terms of capital available.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And one other question on the lease termination fees. Can you provide a little more background on the tenants, the reason for terminating and what the sort of run rate adjustment would be to your third quarter NOI if we were to back out the income that won't be coming in anymore.
Michael Foust:  So this is related to Qwest, as I mentioned in my remarks, and at 350 Cermak in Chicago, it's maybe our most highest demand building, highest demand market, and we're out of space there. So we have the opportunity to have Qwest pay us a significant fee to give back space to us that they were not utilizing, and so we can take that square footage and turn around the build out Turn-Key Datacenter space to satisfy the demand we have in the building. So it's a great value added opportunity to us. We'll substantially increase NOI coming from that floor and provide a lot of value add. Essentially the payment overrides and consisted of approximately two years of gross rent, giving us a real good cushion in terms of re-leasing capability timeframes. I don't have the numbers at my fingertips in terms of what the run rate is without that space. I will say we're planning on definitely replacing that and more in terms of new rents that are being captured in 2009.
Bill Stein: The average annual rent on the space that was given up was a little over $5 million - $5.3 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Just coming back to your comment, Mike, on the space you're tracking, you broke it up a little bit differently this quarter than in the last couple of quarters. And I think this time you said that you're in discussions for 1.9 million square feet of new prospects, with over 5 million square feet that you're tracking in the markets. And I think last quarter you talked about 4 million square feet that you were engaging, and I'm trying to bridge the two comments. Is the 5 million analogous to the 4 million you were tracking and the 1.9 is the more serious stuff, or what?
Michael Foust: Exactly. So the 5 million relates to that 4 million plus, and the 1.9 is more serious LOIs, you know, beyond just hey, we know you have space, why don't you talk to us. So more serious discussions in the 1.9.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And so what are you doing to your return requirements given sort of the capital constraints on new deals. How have you ratcheted them up?
Michael Foust: Yes, we've definitely been nudging up those unlevered returns we're looking at so, you know, I'd say today on projects, where we're building new turnkey space, we're definitely targeting solidly in mid-teen on levered returns for new projects whereas previously we might have been a little more broader ranged, dipping down into the 12% range, 12% to 15%. And now, you know, deals we're working on kind of range anywhere from 14% to 16%, 17%, and sometimes somewhat more. This is on specific projects that we're building and leasing on a spec basis.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Bill, just curious if you could give us the backlog in terms of space that's teed up but not yet commenced? 
Bill Stein: Sure. So on the signed but not commenced there's about $6.4 million of revenue that should come in in the fourth quarter, another $18.2 million that'll come in in the first quarter, and then a little over $700,000 in the third quarter of 2009.
Michael Foust: That's for the year 2009.
Bill Stein: Right, third quarter 2009.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Each one of those reflects the contribution to their respective year, right? So it explains the $4 million in 4Q is the additional revenue we'll see.
Bill Stein: Additional revenue to be recognized in 2008.
Operator: Your next question comes from [George Arach] - Merrill Lynch.
George Arach - Merrill Lynch:  Following up on Jordan's question, it sounds like the demand in the market has actually increased over the last three months, but wondering if the demand growth is real net demand growth or does it now include tenants who had planned to build out their own space but now can no longer fund this on their own balance sheets?
Michael Foust:  I think it's a little of both. We're seeing many more applications now, you know, across the board, across all the industry verticals that we address. We're seeing more outsourcing, and that's driving business from the system integrators and the IT service providers who are tenants of ours. And there are several larger companies who have previously been looking at do-it-yourself projects. These tend to be the larger-scale, longer-timeframe planning projects who are now engaging with us on potentially building out projects for them. And that's been actually typical kind of throughout our experience the last several years. Previously there really weren't many viable alternatives to building it yourself and still giving the operational flexibility and control that the DLR model provides. So it's probably a trend that we've seen all along that we're seeing continuing.
George Arach - Merrill Lynch: What percentage of the 5 million square feet of demand that you mentioned is new net demands in those markets as opposed to tenants relocating from older facilities or consolidating their operations?
Michael Foust: That is hard to say. I think the net new is probably a very high percentage of that, keeping in mind that we are seeing a lot of consolidation. We have been over the last three years, you know, financial services, energy companies, larger Fortune 1000s, and so this isn't a new trend. Where they need new Datacenter facilities to accommodate the new applications, especially the new server-based applications and trading applications that are more energy demanding. That's a trend that we continue to see and it definitely works in our favor because people need more new facilities.
George Arach - Merrill Lynch: And finally, Bill, what was the construction in progress balance at the end of 3Q?
Bill Stein: Okay, let me give it to you a couple of different ways. First, when you look at the Turn-Key product, we had 293,757 square feet of Turn-Key product under construction at the end of the third quarter. The work in progress total relating to that was $135 million, and that's broken up into $72 million for the actual construction work in progress and $63 million that's allocable to acquisition costs, so land and building. And then we have another 451,000, 452,000 square feet of Power Base Building. There's $146 million of work in progress allocable to that. $109 million of that are actually the acquisition cost, land and building, and $36 to $37 million of that is the construction part of it, construction work in progress. Was that clear enough for you? There's a fair bit of data there, but we'll have better - that'll be laid out in the Q as well, which is going to be filed on Thursday.
Operator: Your next question comes from Srinivas Anantha - Oppenheimer & Co.
Srinivas Anantha - Oppenheimer & Co.:  Mike, I know you talked about this Qwest, the existing revenue run rate is around $5.3 million that's coming. At what price do you guys expect to replace that and what do you think the annual run rate for that is going to be once it's fully leased out?
Michael Foust: We typically don't give out specific rental rates at specific buildings, but I can tell you that Chicago is our highest priced market in terms of the rates that we're able to achieve there, typically because of the connectivity in the building, the power and kind of the universe of trading platforms in that market. So we see oftentimes 20% to 30% higher rates than we achieve in our other markets.
Bill Stein: The other thing, Srinivas, as I mentioned in my remarks, our budgets assume approximately $40 million of NOI in 2009 [inaudible] property growth which is higher than the NOI today. 
Srinivas Anantha - Oppenheimer & Co.: And Mike, do you have any other instances of similar customers who have taken space in some of your key markets but not utilizing fully where you can take it back, especially with some of the leases still coming due later this year and next year?
Michael Foust: You know, we don't have very much rollover in the portfolio in terms of leases maturing this year or next year. There are a couple of instances in our Internet gateway buildings where we are talking to customers who might want to give back space that, you know, frankly, like in the Qwest position, they never really utilized the space, but the power is available and that's obviously very valuable when it's in one of our buildings with a lot of power availability and with the data center infrastructure already in place. So I think we're going to have some value added opportunities like that, maybe not on the same scale as the Qwest space. We have not factored those into our 2009 projections, but our folks will be pretty aggressive to be able to take advantage of those opportunities where we can redeploy space.  So there are a couple of instances, I think, on smaller spaces we'll be able to do in 2009 and we have not factored those into the guidance.
Srinivas Anantha - Oppenheimer & Co.: I know you guys haven't said anything about your prior guidance of commencement of leases from 2008. I'm assuming there's no change to it. But, anyway, your commercial space is already well ahead of what you have guided to, so anything that we should keep note of for 4Q '08?
Michael Foust: I think we're going to come in overall easily within that range that Bill had mentioned for our FFO guidance.
Bill Stein: Right now we're focusing the analyst commentary on the FFO per share numbers since there's so little time left in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets:  I was wondering on your comments regarding your own capital availability and how that may be limiting 2009 faster expansion. Could you prioritize as you sit here today between existing developments or existing redevelopments, new redevelopments and acquisitions kind of what your preference is or what you're seeing in the market relative to each of those opportunities today?
Michael Foust: Sure. I mean, our focus going forward right now is on deploying our existing portfolio of redevelopment inventory that 1.6 million feet that is in the portfolio today. And so we will be opportunistic in terms of new acquisitions, but we're definitely prioritizing looking very closely at return on investment, return on cost, in order to prioritize building out our current inventory redevelopment space versus new acquisitions versus new development.  So we're really not looking at any new out-of-the-ground developments at this point for 2009 and really focusing capital on the current redevelopment inventory that we own. 
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets: Given that final comment, do you anticipate slowing down any existing redevelopments due to the same capital issues or are the existing redevelopments still on track and how much space during 2009 will become available? Will it be the entire amount?
Michael Foust: Not the entire 1.6 million. I believe in our guidance we're talking about in the range of 500,000 to 570,000 feet of Datacenter space coming online, so that will reflect pretty closely what we're that is what we'll be projecting to bring online in 2009.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets: Is that fairly ratably throughout the year do you think?
Michael Foust: Probably more heavily weighted in the first half of the year, you know, probably 60% to 75% in the first half of the year.
David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets: Bill, you drew down on the Pru facility, you said, or I guess you will today the cost on that, obviously higher than your remaining sources of debt. Can you just explain why you elected to pull down on that? I'm sure there's a reason, but I was just curious as to the rationale for that.
Bill Stein: Probably a liquidity issue. The Pru facility, I want to emphasize for everyone on the call, is an uncommitted facility and we basically wanted to test the facility in a small amount to make sure that it was available as we entered into our planning process for 2009. And we were gratified that it was available.  While looking back historically, the 9.3% coupon is certainly higher than if we had issued maybe even 6 months ago. In today's environment it's actually not that bad at all. At the time that we issued or the time that we priced it, which was October 22 - even though we're drawing it down today, we priced it October 22 - the spread over the five-year Treasury was 674 basis points. And, of course, we don't carry a debt rating and just to give you some indicative spreads on that same day for debt of comparable maturities, where Vornado had a piece of debt maturing in 2011 and trading at 725 basis points over, Simon was at 675 over, and [Kempco] was at 725 over. Boston Properties was at 675 over. So basically the spread was at least as good if not better than obviously companies that are bigger, been around longer, and have debt ratings. And as a new issue, this actually should have traded at a higher spread in any event.
Operator: Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya - UBS.
Omotayo Okusanya - UBS:  Just to go back to the Pru uncommitted facility, if you needed to draw down on it going forward, each time you draw on it that's considered a new issue and then you need to come up with new pricing on that particular drawdown - is that the way the facility works?
Bill Stein: Absolutely. Its market based pricing at the time.
Omotayo Okusanya - UBS: And then how do I go about thinking of your taxable earnings versus FFO in '09? Is there a way you can give us a sense of what the big difference is between the two numbers, at least from that end, so we have a better sense of how to model dividend?
Bill Stein: That would be very difficult.
Omotayo Okusanya - UBS: I know like one or two major line items that are just helpful in regards to the difference. Does that recur every quarter?
Bill Stein: Well, I mean, it's basically depreciation. It's a very complex model, I will tell you that.
Omotayo Okusanya - UBS: Going back to the Qwest lease termination, net-net how much space are they giving up between this quarter and next quarter? 
Michael Foust: It's about 120,000 gross square feet. Essentially what we find desirable it's over - it's got 1.8 megawatts of IT load that we'll redeploy as Turn-Key - I'm sorry, 8.1 megawatts of IT load that we'll be able to redeploy as Turn-Key Datacenter space. And just to be clear, I mean, that's not all of Qwest's space in the building. They still have a very substantial operation in that building. It was just excess space that they, frankly, over the years never utilized. And so now that we're full we can take advantage of that.
Omotayo Okusanya - UBS: And they were paying $5.3 million on that 120,000 gross square feet?
Michael Foust: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from William Marks - JMP Securities.
William Marks - JMP Securities:  On sectors of the economy, are there any areas where you're seeing a real slowdown in demand?
Michael Foust: Not really. It's interesting. Financial services continues to be a strong demand area - and that's very broadly, everything from commodities, security trading platforms to major Wall Street firms. We're seeing continued demand from the Internet sector, companies that are operating, companies like the Yahoo!s and Amazons and Facebooks of the world still need space.  And the system integrators and IT outsourcing companies are seeing a lot of demand, and I think, if you look at a lot of the analysis that's coming out of kind of the co-location, hosting, managed services sectors who are a lot of our customers, their businesses are doing quite well and they continue to see expansion for 2009. 
Operator: Your next question comes from David Aubuchon - Robert W. Baird & Co.
David Aubuchon - Robert W. Baird & Co.:  How much redevelopment opportunity do you specifically see that is left at the Cermak property past the Qwest space?
Michael Foust: We're pretty much full at that point.
David Aubuchon - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And when you think about that asset and that redevelopment opportunity relative to your capital financing plans going forward, obviously the mortgage is due in 2010. Can you just provide your thoughts about where you may see financing at that asset over the next two years?
Michael Foust: The mortgage is quite small relative to the size of the building and the size of the income. So, in truth, we could refinance today that amount if we wanted to. It's just such a low loan-to-value that we'd rather hold off. 
Bill Stein: We were in the market this year looking for $200 million of debt against the asset and because of the nature of the market, you can't get a bank to underwrite that. You basically are forced to do what's called club deals. They bring in several banks in the $40 to $50 million size. And frankly, it's a little bit like herding cats; everybody has their hot points. We had $150 million that we could have done, but we just felt that the building would be grossly underlevered at that point. And we clearly have room. I mean, we have almost two years to wait for this market to open up. I mean, if you were to cap $40 million and actually the NOI would probably be higher than that in 2010, but if you cap $40 million at 8.5%, you're at $470 million of asset value. 
David Aubuchon - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And your current target on the Qwest redevelopment space, to have that space stabilized, would be 2010? 
Michael Foust: Probably, yes, first quarter 2010. 
Bill Stein: Yes.
David Aubuchon - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then just one last question relative to an earlier question about just demand and whether or not it's falling off, are you seeing anything differentiating the international side of your business right now?
Michael Foust: I'd say no. Now, with that said, we've been very focused on London, Paris, Amsterdam, and we're seeing good demand in all those markets. I would say in London there was probably a little bit of a slowdown in interest from financial services, but growing interest from kind of corporate, major corporates and system integrators easily taking place. And now we've got financial services coming back and showing interest again. A lot of interest from network providers, content delivery, corporates, system integrators, folks like IBM. We recently did a lease with them in Paris for their corporate customers. It seems more broadly based in terms of different industry verticals than maybe it was even a year ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: The lease termination fee, I just want to clarify - I don't know if I missed this - I think in your release you say there's another $4 million coming in the fourth quarter. Is that also from Qwest?
Bill Stein: Also from Qwest. It's an accounting recognition issue. It's being recognized over three months, but the fee has been received, the cash was received last week or the week before.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So you've received a total of $14 million or so?
Bill Stein: $14 million was the gross fee.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: $14 million is the gross. And that's all related to the same space at Cermak with Qwest?
Bill Stein: Right.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Now you would categorize this as an opportunistic lease termination, I would imagine. Are there prospects for this specific space and how much would you have to spend to bring this space online to re-let it?
Michael Foust: Yes, we definitely have prospect, Jordan. There are several folks in the building now that we're talking to who really want to expand and the Turn-Key product works really well for them here and for pretty critical operations. So we'll probably be deploying somewhere around $60 million or so in total to build out the entire space. If we build out the entire space as Turn-Key, probably in that range.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And why sort of a 15 to 18 month lead time on the turnaround? I mean, you guys have built buildings in 6 to 9 months. I'm just kind of curious.
Bill Stein: It's our usual conservatism. We're very, very positive about this space. It's in a great building, best market, high demand, so we're being conservative.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And the lease term is effective as of what date? When does it come out?
Bill Stein: November 1.
Bill Stein: Jordan, you know, we're going to be building on six pods in the building eventually, but we're only doing four of the six right now under this capital program. So that's why we speak about full stabilization in 2010. It assumes that the other two are built.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Bill, what did you assume in your guidance on next year's lease roll? I think 5.3% of rent is rolling. What's the bump and/or retention factor?
Bill Stein: You know, I don't have that in front of me, but I think we assumed flat.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Flat?
Bill Stein: Flat. Conservative. Flat.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Can you just maybe give us a little bit of color on who is rolling or what type of space is rolling? It looks like 200 and, I don't know, 481,000 feet at $40 rents?
Bill Stein: I don't have that.
Michael Foust: A substantial chunk of that is some office space, I believe office space in Boston and some office space in Philadelphia, that's rolling over. So those rents won't go up much. And I think we're being conservative, you know, and seeing the parts that are Datacenter probably going up about 20%. And so it kind of all blends out to a fairly - I think we actually have about a 10% roll up in that space is what we're projecting, I believe, in our pro forma. But a lot of it reflects the fact that a considerable portion is non-technical space. 
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So just to follow up, it sounds overall the guidance reflects your conservative nature, not to mention the environment and the ability to access capital. Could we maybe talk a little bit about what you guys are doing on the capital front to try and source new capital today? I recognize it's very difficult in terms of big denominations and the long-term debt markets are shot, but what are you doing nonetheless?
Bill Stein: Well, we're meeting with prospective lenders, both in North America and in Europe, with the expectation that we'll get hopefully some injection of liquidity in the first half of 2009. We have smaller properties that I think are going to be more easily financed initially than Cermak. The big mortgages are the tough ones to close at this point because of the illiquidity in the system, but I think, you know, there are still some banks in the U.S. that are open for business where you can get a $35 to $40 million loan, and that would be appropriate for some of our buildings. And we have a large unencumbered asset base that would support that.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So these are one-off type mortgages you're talking about with these lenders?
Bill Stein: Correct. And we continue to have discussions with potential joint venture partners as well. Obviously, that initiative has been affected by the illiquidity in the markets, too, but we have found some interest there which we're pursuing. 
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: One other thing, just on HSBC. Is that starting earlier than you expected? I think in the release you referenced November, and I remember you guys talking about like March of '09 or 1Q '09. Is it starting in November now?
Bill Stein: I think we have it in at December 1.
Michael Foust: Now, it might be a couple months earlier than we had projected before based on construction completions.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So it's going to put you well above the commencements, the high end of the commencement number of 2008 that you were expecting, 900 or whatever that number was.
Bill Stein: It would.
Michael Foust: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman - Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Yes, Bill, I just wanted to come back. You said something in your opening comment about having [inaudible] eligible assets in your borrowing base to be able to fully utilize a revolver under the remainder of the Pru facility. What time period were you referencing in order to do that?
Bill Stein: That would be at the end of this year.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And how much more needs to be put in and then sort of how do you get there, to be able to tap this facility? 
Bill Stein: It's pretty insignificant. I mean, basically what we do, our borrowing base consists of two groups of assets - the leased or stabilized assets and buildings that are under construction. Now that's only in the U.S. It's not in Europe. Only domestic assets are eligible for the borrowing base. And we've done so much leasing in the last few months that we're basically going to be converting assets that had been in the borrowing base at their cost, you know, their construction cost, and putting them in as leased assets. And our leased assets, if you think about the math on it, Michael, let's assume that we have a going in yield of - let's make it 16% to make it easy - and our cap rate that we use for calculating the value of the borrowing base is around 8.25% - we'll make it 8% just to make the math easy. You know, if you spend $100 million and you've signed a lease at 16%, it goes in at $200 million rather than $100 million, so you've created value within the borrowing base. And then we have a 70% advance rate against that borrowing base asset. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: So how much, I mean, what's the - take me from why you're not getting it today and what sort of rolls into the fourth quarter to be able to - 
Bill Stein: Well, you know, I think we maybe even could meet it today. It's really paperwork, so we just need to do the paperwork to submit it to the borrower to convert assets to borrowing base. But we most certainly have it at the end of the quarter due to the expected leasing this quarter.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And that gives you up to the full capacity of both of those lines?
Bill Stein: It does. And we also have to count the convertible debenture against that as well because that's another unsecured issuance.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And then going on to Cermak, what's the NOI today after giving due affect to the Qwest going out, that $5 million?
Michael Foust: You know, I would have to look. I think the run rate NOI without that would probably be in the I'm guessing $33, $34 million. But that's not a totally precise number.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And so you think about getting to that $40 million of getting a 10% return on the $60 million?
Michael Foust: It'll be much higher than that.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: I'm just trying to figure out - you threw out a number of a $40 million NOI number.
Michael Foust: Yes, and that's not a run rate NOI. That'd be the NOI that we would achieve next year, so it wouldn't reflect the full year of lease up.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: So the $40 million is not even a stabilized number. The $40 million is just an '09 number?
Bill Stein: It's an '09 number because we're building out the space in '09 and we'll be signing leases in the back half of '09. So yes, that's right. It's definitely a partial year.
Michael Foust:  And we also have some leases on the fourth floor that are commencing in the second half of '08 that we don't have the full impact of until next year.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: So when you were talking about going out and getting that $200 million that obviously was with the previous NOI. What sort of loan-to-value was that part of it - was it like 50%?
Bill Stein: It was around 50%, exactly. I mean, even that wasn't a robust LTV compared to what you could have gotten a year ago.
Michael Foust: Yes, so we're really confident. We don't see, at minimum, refinancing the current loan balance as a particular hurdle for us. As I mentioned, if we wanted to we could refi that today. But it would just be such a low loan-to-value that it just doesn't make sense. We don't see a liquidity issue on that refinancing at all.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And just going back to Jordan's question on the expirations, those [482,000] expiring. What you list as technology office total is only 670,000 out of your 11.2 million square feet, so I'm just trying to figure out, I mean, how much of that 42 is really just technology office space in that it shouldn't be that high of a percentage given you only have 670,000 square feet of it. 
Michael Foust: We've got a large part, I believe, in Boston we've got a lease maturing there that's probably about 380,000 feet or so. 
Bill Stein: 2,010.
Michael Foust: Oh, that's 2,010?
Bill Stein: Yes.
Michael Foust: I would need to look at that and look at it line item by line item and get back to you.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Yes, I mean, it says there's 127 leases, so I wouldn't think that there would have been that one large lease in there, but maybe we can go over it afterwards.
Bill Stein: That's looking like [inaudible] space at 127 leases.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Yes, that's what I was just trying to understand, the lease distribution, to be sure we understand what's going on. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Tom Lamb – Weybosset Research and Management.
Tom Lamb – Weybosset Research and Management:  Just a question about the capital structure. Did I understand you correctly that the new line of credit cost 9.3%?
Bill Stein: Well, there's not a new line of credit. The line of credit was put in place in August of 2007. 
Tom Lamb - Weybosset Research and Management: Oh, I'm sorry. That's more than a year ago. 
Bill Stein: And that's priced today at LIBOR plus 110.
Tom Lamb - Weybosset Research and Management: And that's the term of the line, LIBOR plus 110?
Bill Stein: It's [grid] pricing, so as leverage increases, the spread increases. But currently it's at LIBOR plus 110.
Tom Lamb - Weybosset Research and Management: What I'm trying to understand are opportunities for refinancing assuming that the credit markets come in and improve somewhat, both on that line and then we have some preferred issues outstanding that carry pretty high coupon. Can you tell us what the opportunities are to refinance it?
Bill Stein: Well, we wouldn't. I mean, when we put secured debt on properties, we use the proceeds to pay down the revolver. That's just how we conduct business here. The revolver's basically our source of growth capital until the term debt markets reopen as well as the equity markets.
Tom Lamb - Weybosset Research and Management: And at that time you'll replace the revolver. Is that what you're saying?
Bill Stein: Well, it's a revolving credit facility, so you pay it down and you borrow against it. That's the basic nature of it. And it's essentially a five-year facility, so we put it in place in August of 2007. The initial term is three years, and then it has two one-year extensions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Did you guys punt on Telex?
Bill Stein: Yes.
Michael Foust: Just so people know that Bill and I realized that we had an option to exercise warrants for a small percentage of ownership in Telex, which is one of our tenants, and we declined to go ahead with that.
Bill Stein: It just didn't seem like a prudent use of capital at this time in this environment.
Operator: And thank you, sir. At this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn it back to management for any closing remarks.
Michael Foust: We're very pleased with the progress that our entire team has and the accomplishments that our team has made this year, and we're very positive going into 2009. And I appreciate everybody's taking the time. It was a long call today and a lot of good questions as well. So we appreciate everybody's focus on DLR. Thank you very much.
Bill Stein: Thank you.

Michael Foust:  Great. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call everyone. I will begin with a brief overview of Digital Realty Trust, then I'll review the success of our portfolio of operations during the quarter and conclude with the discussion of market trends and supply-demand conditions. Following my remarks, Will Stein will address our financial performance and our revised guidance for 2008.  First, a brief introduction. Digital Realty Trust is the leading owner and manager of technology real estate. Our portfolio currently contains 74 properties containing 12.9 million rentable square feet of property excluding one property, the Westin Building in Seattle that's held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Our properties are located in 27 metro areas across North America and Europe. The portfolio now includes approximately 1.9 million square feet of space held for redevelopment, a very important source of growth for the company. DLR provides a variety of datacenter facility solutions including turn-key datacenter, power base building, and build-to-suit datacenter. For domestic and international corporate customers, our properties serve a wide range of industry political market including information technology, internet enterprises, financial services, telecom network providers, energy companies, and other Fortune 1000 firms.  Turning now to our portfolio operations. Our team turned in another very successful quarter in all fronts. Leasing, operations, acquisitions, and finance. Portfolio occupancy excluding space held for redevelopment, increased to 95.2% at the end of the second quarter, compared to 94.7% for the previous quarter, and 94.6% for the same period in 2007. Our leasing program continues to capture demand for new facilities by corporate enterprise customers and by I.T. service providers.  During the quarter, leases commenced an approximately 138,500 rentable square feet of space. This includes 86,200 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter space, leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $185 per square foot, and also includes 52,000 square feet of non-technical space, leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $26 per square foot. In addition, we signed leases during the quarter, totaling 121,800 square feet of space consisting of 106,700 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter leased at an averaged GAAP rental rate of $173 per square foot. We leased 600 square feet of Powered Base Building at an averaged annual GAAP rental rate of $67 per square foot, and 14,500 square feet of non-technical space at an averaged annual GAAP rental rate of $25 per square foot.  Tenants include major financial institutions, a large international telecom network provider, and a major tech-component manufacturer.  After June 30, we assigned additional leases totaling 60,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter at an averaged annual GAAP rental rate of $150 per square foot. New tenants include a major financial services company and a large system integrator. Overall, we continue to see a very attractive pricing and strong demand for our top market, particularly for our Turn-Key Datacenter product.  The sales team currently is engaged with well over 4 million square feet of new customer prospects, representing over 420 megawatts of data center demand. We continue to see a significant lack of supply necessary to meet this demand and DLR is one of the few data center provider to actively billing speculative Turn-Key space across our major markets. The depth and experience of our technical team makes DLR a preferred infrastructure solution provider for many large corporations and system integrators.  Turning to our redevelopment program. We currently are underway on construction projects in high demand markets in the U.S. and Europe. These projects will add approximately 510,000 gross rental square feet of additional Turn-Key Datacenter to our operating portfolio in the second half of 2007 – I'm sorry, second half of 2008, including 124,500 square feet for Aircom in Dublin. Approximately, 428,000 rental square feet of Turn-Key space was delivered in the first two quarters of 2008. Overall, we plan to deliver a total of 57 MW of new Turn-Key space in 2008. Our leasing and product delivery programs are on track to contribute strong results this year and end of 2009.  Turning now to our acquisitions program. In June, we acquired 650 Randolph Road in Franklin Township, New Jersey. The recently completed purpose built datacenter cell totals 128 7,800 square feet and is capable of supporting approximately 70,000 square feet of raised floor. We contribute the property to our redevelopment inventory and are making additional improvements to the building to meet our powered base building specifications. We are marketing the facility to financial services company, system integrators, and every Fortune 1,000 companies looking for large blocks of high-quality space in the very active metro New York/New Jersey market.  Also in June, we acquired Reynolds House Datacenter located in Manchester, England. The 38,000 square foot income producing facility was purposed built as a data center in 2001 and contains nearly 23,000 square feet of raised floor with a potential for an additional 7,000 square feet of raised floor. The facility is fully leased to three tenants on long-term basis. On June 30, we acquired a 50% interest in 1201 Comstock Street a site in Santa Clara, California, continuous to 1,100 Space Parks and next to the 1,500 Space Park Drive joint venture property. We immediately began construction on a 24,000 square foot data center which will contain approximately 14,000 square feet of raised floor. Concurrent with the acquisition, we signed a lease with a leading technology company for the entire building. The tenant is scheduled to take occupancy in January, 2009 upon completion of the facility.  On last quarter's call, I discussed results of a study we commissioned that focused on the current drivers demand for datacenters in the U.S., including immediate and longer term growth prospects. Consistent with these results, and despite the challenging economic environment, Fortune 1000 companies, Internet enterprises, and the system integrators continue to make significant investments in IT infrastructure. And this reflects the critical nature of these assets to today's corporations. Our teams are experiencing strong demand in the major markets in the U.S. and Europe especially for our Turn-key product. Our ability to deliver this highly improved product quickly and consistently continues to drive our performance and will be an important source of growth per DLR over the coming years. We believe that these important trends combined with our business model, strong balance sheet, and proven ability to act as capital for multiple sources, will drive strong, long-term FFO growth for DLR. I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein, who will discuss our second quarter financial results, the success for our capital program, and our revised 2008 FFO guidance. Bill?
Bill Stein:  Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon everybody. I'd like to begin with a review of our second quarter 2008 financial results and then discuss our liquidity position and finally conclude with our revised guidance for 2008. Following my remarks, we will open the call to your questions.  FFO on a diluted share in unit basis was $0.59 in the second quarter of 2008, up 15.7% from $0.51 in the same quarter last year and up 1.7% from $0.58 in the first quarter this year. As I discussed on the last call, in the first quarter of 2008, non-recurring items accounted for approximately $0.02 per diluted share in unit of additional FFO. When adjusting for these items, the quarter-over-quarter increase was 5.4%. Adjusted FFO or AFFO for the second quarter of 2008 was $30.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share in unit. This compares to our first quarter AFFO of $27.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in unit. The AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter was 75.6%, down from the first quarter AFFO payout ratio of 83.8%.  EBITDA adjusted for preferred dividends and minority interest, was $68.1 million in the second quarter, up 4.4%, from $65.2 million in the first quarter and up 23.8% from $55 million in the second quarter of 2007. Net income for the quarter was $13.8 million, up 24.3% from $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2008 and up 76.9% from $7.8 million in the same period in 2007. Net income available to common shareholders in the second quarter was $3.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, up $2.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the previous quarter. Net income available to common shareholders in the same period in 2007 was $2.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.  Same-store NOI was $69.1 million in the second quarter of 2008, up 0.6% from $68.7 in the first quarter of 2008 and up 16.3% from $59.4 million in the second quarter of 2007. Same-store NOI adjusted for straight line in FASB 141, which referred to as same-store cash NOI, was $61 million in the second quarter, up 1% from $60.4 million in the first quarter of 2008 and up 17.1% from $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. These increases were primarily the result of new leasing in our properties commencing during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2008.  I will now review specific items in the statement of operations to provide additional color on the results of the quarter. For the second quarter, rental revenues increased $98 million, up 5.7% from $92.7 in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of leases signed in the prior quarters. Tenant reimbursement increase 17.9% to $25.7 million from $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in tenant reimbursement was partially offset by property operating in maintenance expenses which was $36.4 million in the second quarter of 2008, up 15.2% from 31.6% in the previous quarter due to new lease commencements. Approximately 75% of the increase in reimbursements in property operating and maintenance expenses were related to utility cost of the properties. G&A increased during the quarter to $9.8 million, up from $8.8 million the previous quarter due in part to local business taxes, occupancy expenses related to our new London office, IT professional fees, and a full quarter of amortization expense related to our long term incentive compensation plans.  Turning now to our balance sheet, during the second quarter, we capitalized 24%, or $4.5 million, of interest related to construction projects which compares to 23%, or $4.4 million, in the first quarter of 2008. The increase was due to additional construction expenditures during the quarter. In addition, we capitalized approximately 27% to $2.9 million in compensation expenses compared to approximately 29%, or $2.6 million, in the first quarter of 2008.  Liquidity continues to be a significant concern for real estate companies and maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to continue to fund our construction activities is a priority for us. Accessing capital from multiple sources even more critical in time such as we are experiencing today. We recently completed the following transactions. On July 17, we closed an $80 million secured financing in our three Corporate Place facility located at Piscataway, New Jersey. The loan is a three-year maturity with two one-year extensions at an interest-only rate of 6.72%. On July 21st, we completed a Common Stock offering of $5.75 million shares, which generated $211.6 million in net proceeds which were utilized temporarily repaid borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions development and redevelopment activities, and for general corporate purposes. On July 24th, we successfully closed on the $200 million uncommitted, unsecured Prudential Shelf Facility. The three-year, multi-currency facility provides for draws, from time to time, as approved by Prudential, with an average life and final maturity up to seven years and ten years, respectively. Concurrently with the close of the Facility, we made an initial draw of $25 million at an interest-only rate of 7% with a three-year maturity. The Prudential Shelf Facility is subject to covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility. When we executed the Prudential Shelf Facility, an amendment to our revolving credit facility permitting the execution of the Prudential Shelf Facility became effective. Finally on July 25th, we increased the commitments under our revolving credit facility to an aggregate commitment of $675 million by adding a new $25 million commitment by Deutsche Bank through the accordion feature of the revolver. In Europe, we are currently negotiating and documenting a secured construction current debt financing for Datacenter Facility located on London's perimeter. Estimated proceeds are up to £53.9 million with a five-year term, no amortization, and a swap interest rate on the permanent debt currently in the range of 6.5% to 6.75%. The loan is subject to completion of documentation, various closing conditions, and is expected to close within the next two weeks.  We are also negotiating and documenting another secured financing of a domestic property held by Joint Venture. This financing will generate total proceeds to the Joint Venture of approximately $44 million with a 5-year term subject to 15-year amortization and an interest currently ranging from 6.25% to 6.5%.  Currently, we have $67.8 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility including letters of credit. Based on the covenants in our credit facility and the new shelf facility, we have total borrowing capacity of over $957 million, consisting of $607 million of immediate liquidity under the credit facility without any future additions to the borrowing base and additional secured debt capacity of approximately $350 million. If this capacity were fully utilized, our pro forma total debt-to-market value would be approximately 45%. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.4 billion and our ratio of debt to total market value was 27.2%. Our non-GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5 times and our non-GAAP debt service coverage was 4.6 times. As of June 30th, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.3% and the weighted average maturity was 5.3 years including debt extension options. A break down of how we calculate these ratios can be found in our supplemental operating and financial data report furnished to the FCC and available on our website.  I would now like to return to our – like to turn to our revised guidance for 2008. With better visibility towards our full year 2008 results, we are raising FFO guidance by $0.05 to a range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share in unit. The new guidance reflects a shift in our leasing mix towards our Turn-Key Datacenter solution and is based on the following assumptions. Total acquisitions for the full year in the range of $115 million to $200 million, consisting of $65 million to $100 million of vacant properties for our redevelopment program and $50 million to $100 million of income producing properties with an average cash cap rate of 8%. I'd like to note that these represent a slight change from the assumptions that were in the earnings release.  The commencement of leases were approximately 840,000 square feet to 950,000 square feet of Turn-Key Datacenter and powered-based building space at an average annualized gross rent of $115 per square foot. You will note that there's a slight increase here in the assumed rent per square foot, from $90 to $115 per square foot. The commencement of leases for 100,000 square feet to 125,000 square feet of basic commercial space at an average annualized gross rent of $23 per square foot. This is an increase from $19 per square foot and total CapEx for our redevelopment program of $600 million, of which $237 million was spent as of second quarter end. Finally, G&A will remain, we believe, at $41 million. This concludes our formal remarks. We would now be happy to take any questions that you might have. 
Operator:  Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen at this time we will conduct the question and answer session. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup: Good afternoon. It's Irwin Guzman here with Michael. Mike, you talked about, I believe, finding 2000 square feet of Turn-key space delivering in the second half. Can you talk about how much that is leased and what the timing of commencement is between the third and the fourth quarter?
Mike Foust: It's coming online fairly well distributed – I would see more slanted toward the fourth quarter. About 124,500 square feet of that which would represent the Aircom building in Dublin. That is fully wrapped, and – I don't have a break – I would say probably about a third of that space overall is leased, maybe 40% and the rest is – 
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup: That's including Aircom or excluding it?
Mike Foust: Let's see, that'd probably be excluding Aircom.
Bill Stein: Irwin, in terms of our signed but not commenced – the backlog, we've got 215,000 square feet that will commence in the third quarter, 30,000 in the fourth quarter, and 132,000 in the first quarter of 2009. 
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup: And are you – in the redevelopment pipeline in general, are you seeing more of a shift toward Turn-key spaces as opposed to powered based building in terms of demand? You previously talked about a 50-50 spread. Is that moving more toward Turn-Key?
Bill Stein:  Yes. The last quarter particularly was almost 100% Turn-Key space in terms of leases that we signed and now that trend will balance a little bit but we're seeing for the year should be significant majority of Turn-Key space.
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup:  Can you talk a little bit about cloud computing? A lot of telecom and internet enterprise companies are out there offering cloud computing reduce sort of Datacenter storage demand? When you think about the 420 mega watts demand that you said you're tracking, how much of that do you think could be served by this type of product?
Bill Stein:  Well, cloud computing means – it's private different types of applications. So, you have cloud computing or utility computing within a company, and that's what we're seeing a lot of the demand especially from the financial services industry where they are ratcheting up and down computing power for different applications, especially highly computational type applications and risk management and derivatives pricing in to such. You also have cloud computing referred to where you have online applications where instead of running your Microsoft applications on your PC, they'll be run out of a datacenter that Microsoft would host. That's another type. Sometimes, people call the software, the service.  It's very hard for me to break out what amount our sales force funnel right now is cloud computing per se but we are seeing a lot of the demand driven from the financial services industry for these internal grid computing, cloud type computing applications. 
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup:  You don't see that being a negative to the business?
Bill Stein:  No. It's driving demand. 
Michael Foust:  It's the opposite, Michael. 
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup:  Yes. It's going to drive more demand into your assets. 
Bill Stein:  We think so. Yes. We are seeing it.
Irwin Guzman – Citigroup:  Okay. Great. Thank you. 
Bill Stein:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Will Marks from JMP Securities. Please go ahead. 
Will Marks – JMP Securities:  Thanks. Hello, Bill. Hello, Mike. Questions. Some questions. One on – I may have missed this, but on your guidance that you compared to after the first quarter on the commencement of leases. you took the square footage down but the rate is up substantially and does that have to do with you leased more space in the second quarter than you would have thought and is the rate up because of the difference between turn-key and power base? 
Bill Stein:  It's a shift towards more turn-key, Will. 
Will Marks – JMP Securities:  Okay. 
Bill Stein:  There's more turn-key in the blend rather than power base build. 
Will Marks – JMP Securities:  Great. Okay. And then, general thoughts, Will, on the rate side of things. Are rates continuing to go up for datacenter space in general and along the same lines, I've heard that in Silicon Valley there's basically – or San Francisco south, there's very little, if any, datacenter space available. Can you comment on that? 
Bill Stein:  Sure. We're seeing – we really sell out pricing in almost all of our markets today. It varies – our rates that we're quoting on our per square foot basis vary by quarter-by-quarter, especially for the Turn-Key because of different utilizations and the way the spaces are laid out. On a kilowatt – per kilowatt basis, rates have gone up for us over the last four quarters. On an accumulative basis, about 30%. Now we don't see that trend continuing quite that same pace, but what we're seeing good trending and pricing on a kilowatt basis, and we think we'll continue to see good returns. On Silicon Valley, going to your question there, right now there's not much space at all available and we're actually working on a couple of buildings on our Space Park Drive site that will be coming on online here in the next nine months – six to nine months or so. – So, we're hoping to get ahead of the market there for that. There are some large projects that are on the planning side that I will be coming online second-half of '09 and 2010, but right now there's definitely a lack of supply.
Michael Foust:  Supporting that, Will, we've a large project that is leased to a major internet provider that leased before it finished. Still under – well I guess it's finished now. And then we leased a property simultaneously with a close down there, I read about in the property, to a tenant, and we've mentioned that I believe in our earnings release.
Will Marks – JMP Securities:  Right. Okay. Couple other things, on page 11 of your Supplemental, the run rate NOI, is that straight line, the rental revenues?
Michael Foust:  Yes.
Will Marks – JMP Securities:  Okay.
Bill Stein: 
Yes.: 
Will Marks – JMP Securities:  It is. Really? Okay. And then on – in terms of your comment Mike, about rates being up 30% or so in the last year, I guess, we should have see you of about 10% of your portfolio turning '08-'09, I think, and I guess, we can read into that. That would be – those leases have been through upside in market rates even above probably the straight line now?
Mike Foust: Yes. Well, we should see some good uplift in those rates. And we've seen them with some of the renewals we've done where rates are going up 20% – 30%. And they vary, some of the spaces is turn-key that's up for renewal. A lot of it is more priced at powered base building level. Because their space is where the tenants had put the improvements in themselves. And – but regardless, in the right buildings, our rates uplifts to 20% – 30%. I think that they're going to be typical.
Bill Stein: And Will, the straight line – since the straight line is the midpoint, it's typically lower than the end of term rent. So, it's actually a – the increase is substantially higher when you're comparing a straight line versus cash. 
Will Marks – JMP Securities: Got it. Makes sense. Okay. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning, all. It's Jordan Sadler, here with Craig. Going back to the backlog, Bill, I didn't – you went rent to that real quick. It was 215 square feet in 3Q, 30,000 in 4Q, and 132 in 1Q? 
Bill Stein: Yes. 1Q, correct. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Do you have – sorry. 
Bill Stein: I'm sorry. 132.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Do you have the rents on those commencements?
Bill Stein:  Yeah. We'll give you revenues. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay.
Bill Stein:  Roughly 8.7 Q3, 1.2 Q4, about 12.5 Q1.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  And those are the annualized numbers? Right?
Bill Stein:  No, those are the revenues that are expect – the first one I gave you, the revenues expected in 2008, that (inaudible) expected 2009.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay, the full – contribution for 2008, got it, versus the contribution for 2009. Got it.
Bill Stein:  Correct.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  And then, the leases, well, that leases that were commenced during the second quarter, the 86,000 square feet at 185, what was the timing of that?
Bill Stein:  Let me see. You know, I don't think I have it.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Was it that one – was there one sizeable lease in there?
Bill Stein:  I have a very small (inaudible) spreadsheet here. This may take a little while given my eyes.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  You could come back to me on it if you like. I'll ask another one.
Bill Stein:  Yes, I know it's here. It's – it looks like it's spread more or less into the quarter. I'm trying convince (inaudible) date in the call.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  So mid-quarter would be fine?
Bill Stein: 
 :
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. And then, what is the planned use of proceeds for the – quite the offering that you guys completed in July. Just kind of continue to build out the redevelopment pipeline or is there anything more imminent?
Bill Stein:  Immediate use proceeds was to pay down the revolving credit facility.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Sure.
Bill Stein:  And I think we had – we had some of our borrowings in Pounds and Sterling. So, we actually have something of a cash position too because we're waiting for the U.K. construction loan to fund – to match fund the pay down there. And then other than that, right now it's to continue to fund our CapEx, although as you might imagine that from time to time we see some interesting opportunities on the acquisition side.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. There's nothing teed up above and beyond your guidance at this point. Its kind of what you are saying?
Bill Stein:  Nothing that we would deem improbable.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. And then, I think in the third-quarter your option on telex comes due or potentially expires? And, I'm just curious what your plans are.
Bill Stein:  Yes, we're looking at that. We haven't made a determination yet whether we're going to exercise that are not. I mean they're doing quite well. As a company it represents more of a private equity type investment in the company. So, we just have to determine if we want to move ahead with that option. But, we haven't made a determination yet.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  And, how does their leases in your media room sort of play into your decisions? Meaning wanting some participation in the upside there. 
Bill Stein:  The leases really, I guess I personally viewed as kind of a separate topic because, I think, we really have to look at the investment in terms of we'd be making a kind of strategic private equity investment in a company that we think is strong and has really good business plan. But it really doesn't affect the income coming from those leases at all. So, it's more kind of a separate capital allocation analysis for us. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. That makes sense. Last question. Just coming back to the $4.2 million square feet of prospects you identified on the demand front.
Bill Stein:  Yes. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  What is your typical – I wasn't clear if that's what your tracking or how much your entertaining and bidding on or what but maybe you can clarify that and then maybe talk about the potential capture rate. 
Bill Stein:  Sure. Bill, those are prospects. Potential customers have various levels of interest in discussions that our team is tracking and talking to. So, kind of, represents some – kind of the demand that we're seeing, that we're touching today in our various major markets in the U.S and in Europe as well.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  How's that like (inaudible) 
Michael Foust: 
 :
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Maybe it would be more useful. Do you know what that prospect pipeline look like three months ago, in the last call?
Michael Foust:  Actually, the price – three months price similar size [ph].
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay.
Michael Foust:  Probably similar size.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Great. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Siri Anampra [ph] from Albert Heimers and Company [ph]. Please go ahead.
Siri Anampra – Albert Heimers and Co.:  Good afternoon, thank you. I'll try to limit to two questions anyway. On the demand front, I know Michael, you talked about pretty healthy demand, but there's still few to be held (inaudible) of skepticism. Maybe if you could just give us – talk about what kind of a sale cycle are you guys seeing and how has that changed, let's say maybe three months ago, or six months ago, and also on the competitive front, are you guys seeing any new players out there, or any new bills obviously there's talked about the credit markets had definitely now not helping any kind of speculate or supply to come online. And also, do you see an instances where enterprises are taking some of the outsource data centers in-house, just because of the macro concerns? Thank you.
Michael Foust:  Sure. Really not seeing a trend on going in-house and if anything, we're saying much more of a trend of outsourcing, either outsourcing on wholesale basis, like we provide or outsourcing to system integrators who are customers of ours, or other IT service providers, like the EquaNet [ph] and Savitzes [ph]. So we're seeing – I guess I would say, we definitely see more outsourcing than insourcing. Also, you ask about kind of a sales cycle, we're working with many larger corporate enterprises, and large international companies, and the sales cycle pricing with those types of companies, could be anywhere, 6 to 12 months to complete all these transaction and that's fairly – that's pretty much the same what we've been seeing for the last nine months or so, so I don't think that trend has really changed. I'm sorry I think you had another question about demand?
Siri Anampra – Albert Heimers:  Yes. On the demand, maybe if you can just give us a little more color. Are there any particular verticals that you guys are seeing increase demand or has that pretty much remain the same during the past six months?
Mike Foust:  It's been pretty much the same and with a large emphasis on the financial services and system integrators. I'd say – I think I've mentioned this before probably that our current revenues are about 12% financial services, and financial services probably represent about a third of our current prospects. So a lot of demand from the major international services, Wall Street trading platforms. We're seeing a lot of demand there, and the system integrators, and broadly Fortune 1000.
Siri Anampra – Albert Heimers:  Good. And then just one follow up question. On the lease expirations, I know you guys have recently good size of space that expiring over the next two years. Could you guys give us a mix of how much over this is Turn-Key, and how much of this is Power Based?
Mike Foust:  I don't have that at my finger tips. I think probably it's – this year '08 and '09 has a very small number. It's a larger number I think around 14% or so of square footage in 2010 but I think most of it, even though it's built out, a lot of it would be priced as power based building because the tenants put the investments in themselves. And so, if they want to renew, now, ironically because a big upside in some of these spaces is that the tenants move out and we can release it as Turn-key space. So then take advantage of the improvements that the tenants have put in but that typically not the case. The tenants usually when they have built out space that they've invested in, they usually like to stick around. 
Siri Anampra – Albert Heimers: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks a lot guys. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya. Please go ahead. 
Tayo Okusanya – UBS: Thanks. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the great quarter. A quick question in regard to – can you talk a little bit about in the shift in mix between the power based versus the turnkey. What's driving client demands towards more to the – of the turnkey solutions right now? And if you expect that saving of that particular product to continue over the next two quarters?
Mike Foust: I think, Kale, I think, we will see it continue with the emphasis on the Turn-key space. I think, customers are – like the idea of being able to utilize our capital to fit out and, I think, as importantly, are recognizing the quality of our development engineering schemes and our ability to lever the space. So, besides being a good financial solution, I think operationally and engineering wise, we're very good solutions for these large corporate. So, I think, we continue to develop that level of security and reliability with the customer. So, it seems our turn-key base is a very good solution. And also willing to customize spaces for customers too that might have some more specialized applications. So, I think that plays into it as well. 
Bill Stein:  And Tayo, the nice thing about the Turn-key space is, from our standpoint, there are significant barriers to entry. And the most significant barrier to entry is capital. So, for a private developer, they simply – unless they have a lot of access to equity, they really can't provide this product. 
Michael Foust:  And because where we are, we do have financial wherewithal and engineering capability to build the space and to do some speculative space. Speed the market is very important. We can provide that speed to market to get the customers up and running in a much shorter timeframe than virtually any one else out there. And that's a really good competitive advantage for us. Because the tenants, as I've mentioned, recognize that engineering expertise and in our operational capabilities of our running the properties cost effectively. 
Tayo Okusanya – UBS :  Sounds great. Thank you. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Hi, guys. This is Jordan. Could you just – talking about the Turn-key leasing, what is sort of the range of size of space that you're leasing in terms of raised floor, square footage, and sort of where's the sweet spot for you guys right now?
Michael Foust:  We're ranging, typically, from 5,000 feet to 40,000 to 50,000 feet. I think that sweet spot we are seeing good demand. We can really track in that 20,000 foot range.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. And separately, and those in the sales cycles on those in the larger transactions are in that 6 to 12 month range that you uploaded early?
Michael Foust:  Yes.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. Its in the larger corporate who are taking that space.
Michael Foust:  Exactly.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. And then, could you talk about markets and where you're seeing the most significant dislocations in terms of demand outweighing supply? Just give maybe your – give it a rank currently.
Michael Foust:  I mean this isn't exactly in exact rank order but we're seeing Silicon Valley and these are all kind of favorable from our perspective in terms of high demand and lack of supply right now. Chicago certainly. We're seeing it in – well, even more in Dallas now is starting to turn. But even more so, Northern Virginia, a very strong market for us. New Jersey and Northern New Jersey, and then Paris and London. So, those markets are probably the ones that have kind of the strongest supply-demand imbalance in our favor. 
Bill Stein:  and Jordan, when we say Chicago, we're talking about downtown Chicago, not the suburbs. 
Michael Foust:  Yes, Pacific Park [ph] 350 Cermak building.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. Do you guys have anything on the suburbs?
Bill Stein:  No. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Well, you wouldn't have any demand in the suburbs then?
Bill Stein:  That's right, no. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  I follow you Bill.
Bill Stein:  But, we are just addressing downtown demand.
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Right. And, has there been any transactions used in the investment market? Have you seen anything to point to? Have there been more or less transactions or properties for sale?
Mike Foust: Well, it's been pretty quiet. The large Lockwood Capital 365 main portfolio has not traded at this point. And really – 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Is that going to trade?
Mike Foust: I couldn't speculate. I know they're still working on a deal. 
Bill Stein: And Jordan, just access to that insignificant quantities is a challenge for any asset class. Well, I think that what's involves in any large portfolio deal. You basically – .
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: (inaudible)
Bill Stein: Pardon me?
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: I was saying that's not forcing anybody to bring portfolios to market though for sale? 
Bill Stein: Well, we'd only force it if you have a debt maturity. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And you're not seeing much of that?
Bill Stein: No, not at this point. 
Mike Foust: When these assets are stabilized, it usually flow very strong cash flow. I mean, we have seen folks – individual development opportunities where folks are buying sites or buying shell buildings that they trying to market as data centers but we – I can't think over the last quarter of any stabilized data center assets that have traded. 
Jordan Sadler – KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: I want to come back to some of your comments on capital and Turn-key space. You keep on talking about how you're well positioned because you have access to capital relative to others or private developers who can't do it. Have you shifted from your own, given how precious your capital is, not knowing if the debt markets or the equity markets are always going be open for you. Are you pricing your capital differently today than you were three months ago, or even six or twelve months ago before these build outs?
Bill Stein:  Well, we certainly – we are pricing it differently on the acquisition front for sure. We've re-established much higher thresholds there, and on the development front, I think our returns are going up too, as rents go up. So, the answer is yes to in both product sense.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Just give me a sense, I mean is it up 100 basis points, 200 basis points?
Bill Stein:  On the development front, I think its a couple 100.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And so you, you think your returns that you're getting are north of 15% at this point, on re-development?
Bill Stein:  Typically.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Okay. And then,
Mike Foust:  I would say averaging in mid-teens, on average.
Bill Stein:  And then on the stabilized – I think to do a stabilize we'd probably prefer to be mid-nine-ish.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Okay. And then, the 415,000 square feet of – this is that are signed but not yet commenced that are going to roll in 3Q, 4Q and 1Q. How much of that is coming – is that all other than redevelopment out of the 1.9 million square feet?
Bill Stein:  Yes.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And has all the capital been spent on that space yet?
Bill Stein:  No.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And so, can you just breakout how much – what's the total capital spend to build out that space, and how much has been spent to date, as of June 30?
Bill Stein:  I can give you the June 30 construction work in progress which, for redevelopment, is $364 million that will show up on our 10-Q. We've got another $11 million of construction work in progress is unrelated to redev. And then the best I can do is give you the – you know what we've spent to date and what our revised CapEx program is for the year which is roughly 600.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  How much of that relates to this 400 – I mean, you've already delivered some space, and your working on space that's going to deliver in 2009-2010. So I'm just trying to get a perspective of a bottom line impact of this 415,000 square feet of space coming online. 
Bill Stein:  When you say bottom-line impact, you mean the – 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  The FFO. Right. So you talk about revenues what I'd like to get to is an NOI less interest as that serves the flow back on to the income statement.
Bill Stein:  I think that, as Mike said, if you do a mid-teen unlevered return on the capital invested. Granted it's trending more towards Turn-Key so the dollar is per square foot, on average you're going to be higher. In terms of the blend, no, I think you'd have to work with a range there.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And the 360 foreign CIT, that's on a whole 1.9 million square foot pipeline right?
Bill Stein:  Correct.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And does that include land basis?
Bill Stein:  Yes. But not all that's currently sort of under construction, you may have it in the redevelopment pool but it may not be an active – 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Why? 
Bill Stein:  Because there's a portion of that redevelopment, I think it's about 35%-40% that are in income producing buildings so, it's space that we've shown. We bought the building and we may not be currently building.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  What's the volume of redevelopment space that you – that is delivered but not yet renting. 
Bill Stein:  Very little. I don't have a number at my fingertips. But it's going to be a very small number. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And is that included in your run rate NOI? In other words, is that adjust for a couple of thousand square feet you might have you delivered over the last couple of weeks that might not be paying rent yet?
Bill Stein:  I don't think that would be in the run rate NOI because I think that's of June 30. 
Michael Foust:  June 30 is the cut off. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  But presume you have 415,000 square feet in space, that's near term deliveries. Some of that has to be fully built out waiting, I mean, that we are – you've spent the capital but you haven't – the rents haven't commenced? Right, so, there is that – 
Bill Stein:  That's a backlog. 
Michael Foust:  That's the backlog but I mean the backlog is basically a situation where leases commence as soon, for most part, as soon as the product is finalized and commissioned. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  You're not sitting on any vacant fully built out Turn-Key space as of June 30th where you are – where you sort to have rolled the interest expense from that capital spent on to the balance sheet. 
Bill Stein:  Very little. It might be well under 100,000. It might be 50,000 feet. I'm speculating. 
Michael Foust:  I mean, I think, there's – we have some that was vacant at June 30 where we signed the lease yesterday or expected to sign this week, later in the week and that will basically take up all of it.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Okay. And none of the vacancy that's on the core portfolio has been leased or pending lease commence? The 500 basis points of vacancy you have in the core – 
Bill Stein: I'm not aware of anything there that's out for lease. What's out for lease is really redevelopment.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Okay. Thank you.
Bill Stein: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Craig Mailman – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Last one, sorry. The mix on the commencements is or used to be I think 50-50, and with this update, it's now closer to Turn-Key versus shelf?
Mike Foust:  Right. So the commencement in the second-quarter of Datacenter space, all but 300 feet were – 
Craig Mailman – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  I just mean the guidance of 900,000 for the full year.
Mike Foust:  On the blend?
Craig Mailman – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Yes. I mean you get 900,000 square feet of commencing, I guess I could back into how much – or in the different buckets year to date. And then you guys could give me the amounts on the stuff that's commenting in the back half but maybe it's just be easier to back of the envelop. What do you think the mix is for Turn-Key versus shelf for the full year?
Bill Stein:  Eyeballing it, on a square footage basis, it's a little more than 50-50. Basically – 
Craig Mailman – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  60-40?
Bill Stein: Yes. 60 – 40, but we drive so much more revenue through the turnkey product that from a revenue standpoint, it's much higher. 
Craig Mailman – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Now, that makes sense. It just gives me a better idea of what you're spending CapEx per foot. 
Bill Stein: Right. 
Craig Mailman – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phillip Gutfleish from Elm Ridge Capital Management. 
Phillip Gutfleish – Elm Ridge Capital Management: Yeah. Just a quick question. If I look at these supplements, it looks like you have a contract with – a lease with JP Morgan that expires in three months and in the last one, it was about 100 and some odd months, and I'm wondering, is there a typo in this supplement or has there some – had something changed. Also, because if I do it on a per square foot basis, it's about $250 per square foot on that contract. 
Bill Stein: What page are you?
Phillip Gutfleish – Elm Ridge Capital Management: 20. 
Operator: Thank you. And gentlemen, I'm sure that we have no further questions at this time. Please continue with any closing remarks that you might have. 
Mike Foust: Wait, we will still need to answer the gentleman's question. 
Bill Stein: I'm not sure what was in the last supplement but this would be space most likely at 1118 in New York and it's a short term lease that is at a high rank per square foot, and will likely renew. 
Mike Foust: Yeah, it's turn-key space. It's a data center, operating data center space. 
Bill Stein: Hello?
Operator: It seems that Phillip's line has disconnected. 
Bill Stein: Okay. 
Operator: And gentlemen, I'm sure that we have no further questions in the queue. Please continue. 
Mike Foust:  Okay, well we appreciate everyone's time and focus on DLR and look forward to following-up with everyone as we go through time here and appreciate taken the time to join us today. Thank you very much.
Bill Stein:  Thank you.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Now I’d like to introduce Michael Foust, CEO and Bill Stein, CFO and Chief Investment Officer. Following management’s brief remarks, we will open the call to your questions. To manage the call in a timely manner, questions will be limited to two per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Foust – Chief Executive Officer: Great, thank you Pamela. Welcome to the call everyone. I’ll begin with a brief overview of Digital Realty Trust, then I will overview our significant first quarter 2008 accomplishments and we'll conclude with a discussion of new research data about a number of emerging Datacenter trends from the survey we recently commissioned. Following my remarks, Bill Stein will address our financial performance and our revised guidance for 2008. First a brief introduction, Digital Realty Trust is the leading owner and manager of technology real estate. Our portfolio currently contains 71 properties containing 12.7 million rentable square feet, excluding one property, the Westin Building in Seattle that’s held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Our properties are located in 26 metro areas across North America and Europe. The portfolio now includes approximately 1.9 million square feet of space held for redevelopment, a very important source of growth for the company. DLR provides a variety of Datacenter facility solutions including turnkey facilities, Powered Base Building, and Build-to-Suit Datacenters for domestic and international corporate customers. Our properties serve a wide range of industry vertical markets including information technology, internet enterprises, financial services, telecom network providers, energy companies, and other Fortune 1000 firms. Now I will detail highlights from Digital portfolio operations during the quarter. Our team turned in another very successful quarter on all fronts, leasing, operations, acquisitions, and finance. Based on that success, we are raising earnings guidance for the year as Bill will discuss in detail. In addition, market trends and conditions are very favorable for customers demand and Datacenter supply in our major markets. Portfolio occupancy excluding space held for redevelopment held steady at 94.7% at the end of the first quarter, the same as the previous quarter and compared to 94.8% at same period in 2007. Note that total lease space actually increased in the quarter, and newly completed vacant turnkey space were approximately 98,000 feet we’ve added to the portfolio from the redevelopment inventory. During the quarter leases commenced on approximately 334,800 square feet space. This includes 256,200 square feet updated of turnkey datacenter space leasing an average annual GAAP rental rate of $119.25 per square foot, and also includes 46,300 square feet of powered base building space that was leased at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $52.42 per square foot and 32,300 square feet of non technical space leasing an average annual GAAP rental rate of $19.31 per square foot. In addition we signed the leases during the quarter totaling 260,200 square feet of space, consisting about 106,400 square feet of turnkey datacenter space leasing an average annual GAAP rental rate of up $100.05 per square foot. Nearly 120,000 square feet power base building space in average annual GAAP rental rate $67.60 per square foot, and 33,800 square feet of non-technical space that was leased an average annual GAAP rental rate of $25.93 per square foot. We expect lease rate to fluctuate somewhat quarter-by-quarter due to varying rates with different products and different markets. In particular, in the first quarter, a unique and highly accretive transaction in already occupied space were the average lease weight for turnkey space on the previous quarter. Excluding this transaction, the average turnkey rate would be above a $114 per square foot. Overall, we continue to see very attractive pricing product half market by the strong demand for our new turnkey and powered base building products. Turning to our development and redevelopment program, we currently are underway on construction projects and high demand markets in the US and Europe that will add approximately 5 47,000 rentable square feet of additional datacenter to our operating portfolio. We expect the space come online through the first quarter of 2009. Of this space, approximately 330,000 of turnkey data center, and 217,000 square feet of built to suit datacenter facilities. Overall we are pleased that our leasing and product delivery program are on track to contribute for improved 2008 results, as reflected in our increased guidance. Tuning now to our acquisitions program. In February we acquired 365 Randolphville road a 265,000 square feet redevelopment project located in Piscataway, New Jersey, next towards our 3 Corporate Place facility. This new property is capable of supporting the development of up to 150,000 square feet of improved data center space, bringing new [more] product to a market experiencing strong demand. We plan to make base building improvements and upgrades to the power with plans for an initial build out of two turnkey data centers, totaling about 20,000 square feet of raised floor in building.
 : Our key initiative for Digital Realty Trust has been to gather research and the annualized market trends for data center demand and that continues to be significantly underserved by independent research. In response again this year we commissioned our own research data focused on the current demand for data centers in US, including immediate and longer term growth prospects. Consistent with last years study the survey was conducted in March 2008 by compos research and analysis, and examine critical issue such as power cooling, space requirement in the drivers of in facility expansion. The metrics reported in the results are drive from web based service of over 150 IT decision makers in a wide range of large corporations in North America with revenues of at least $1 billion or at least 5000 employees. All survey participants are involved in the process of managing corporate Datacenters, implementing new facilities, or expanding existing Datacenters and our senior level executives including C level management in MIS and finance. The result did not only confirm our understanding of today's market trends but more importantly provides specific data from users on the underlying demand characteristics for Datacenter space. While we plan to release the results of the study in greater detail in a press release later today, I wanted to discuss a few key findings now with you this morning. First 86% of respondents in the 2008 study noted that they will definitely probably expand their number of Datacenters in the next 12 months. This indicates an active phase of Datacenter expansions during the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. Second, 45% of respondents plan to expand in three or more locations. This is an increase of nearly 20% over the 2007 result indicating that the scope of Datacenter projects has increased along with the number of projects. Third, the planned square footage requirement for an average expansion site went up 50% from 10,000 feet in 2007 to 15,000 square feet in 2008, another indication that the scope of Datacenter projects has increased significantly in the past year. The results of this study confirms of our teams are already experiencing in the market that demand Datacenter space is increasing and being driven by the growing IT infrastructure needs of companies across the industry sectors. Despite the challenging economic environment, companies are making significant investments in IT infrastructure reporting the critical needs of these assets for today's corporations. We believe that these important trends coupled with our proven business model and flexible capital structure will continue to drive strong long-term FFO growth for DLR. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO Bill Stein who will discuss our very positive first quarter 2008 financial results and our revised 2008 FFO guidance. Turn over to Bill.
Bill Stein – Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon everybody. I’d like to begin with a review of our first quarter 2008 financial results and our revised guidance for 2008. Following my remarks, we will open the call to your questions. FFO on a diluted share on unit basis was $0.58 in the first quarter of 2008, up 16% from $0.50 in the same quarter last year and up 9.4% from $0.53 in the fourth quarter of 2007. The first quarter 2008 one time items accounted for approximately $0.02 per diluted share and unit of additional FFO. These items include additional capitalized interest related to a prior period, fee income from development services, and energy incentive payment from an electric utility, and a reversal of previously recognized bad debt expense. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the first quarter of 2008 was $27.5 million or $0.37 per diluted share and unit. This compares to fourth quarter 2007 AFFO of $27.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share and unit. The AFFO ratio for the first quarter of 2008 was 83.8% which was the same as that of the previous quarter. Reconciliation of FFO to net income, AFFO to FFO, and FFO and EBITDA to net income for these periods is included in our supplemental operating and financial data furnished to the SEC and available on our website. EBITDA was 56.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 65.7 million for the first quarter of 2007 which included an 18 million gain on the sale of two properties. Excluding the gain on sale, EBITDA for the first quarter of 2007 would have been $50.7 million reflecting an increase in 2008 of 11.6%. The net income for the first quarter was $11.1 million up from 5.6 million in fourth quarter of 2007 and down from 22.1 million for the same period of 2007, which includes the $18 million on the sale to assets. Net income available to common shareholders in the first quarter was $2.9 million or $0.4 per share up from $254,000 or zero per diluted share in the previous quarter. Net income available common shareholders in the same period of 2007 was $18.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share reflecting a non-recurring gain on sales to properties. Excluding the gain, net income available common shareholders would have been approximately $3.6 or $0.6 per diluted share. Gains on assets sales are not included in our FFO. Same store NOI increased 10.8% to $16.7 million in the first quarter of 2008 from $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and increased 17% from $58.7 million in the first quarter 2007. Same store NOI adjusted for straight line and FAS 141 adjustments which we refer to as same store cash NOI increased to $60.4 in the first quarter, up 13.5% from $33.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and up 17.3% from $51.5 million in the first quarter of 2007. These increases were primarily the result of new leasing and our properties commencing during the 12 month period ended March 31, 2008. I will now review specific items in the statement of operations to provide additional detail on the results for the quarter. For the first quarter rental revenues increased to $92.7 million up 8.9% and 85.1 million in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to the leases signed in 2007. Likewise tenant reimbursements increased 5.8% to $21.8 million from $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to the new lease announcements. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $89.3 million, up 5.2% from $84.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily due to a one time property tax credit of $3.1 million that we received in the fourth quarter and impart to the new lease commencements. Turning now to our balance sheet, during the first quarter we capitalized23% or $4.1 million of interest related to construction projects, which compares to 21% or $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition we capitalized approximately 29% or $2.6 million in compensation expenses compared to approximately 25% or $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Liquidity continues to be a significant concern for real estate companies are access to capital has become increasingly constrained over the past year. As I have said in previous calls we believe that our track record of accessing well priced debt and equity capital from several different sources, particularly in difficult markets is a powerful competitive advantage. We also believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our currently planned acquisition and the redevelopment plan program for the year when combined with our planned activities in the debt markets. In February in underwritten public offering of 13.8 million shares of series D cumulative preferred stock which generated approximately $333.6 million of net proceeds. We utilized the net proceeds to temporarily repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to fund acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities and for general corporate purposes. Currently we have $175.2 million outstanding on our credit facility including letters of credit. Based on the covenants and our credit facility we have a total borrowing capacity over $724.8 million consisting of $474.8 million of immediate liquidity under the credit facility and additional secured debt capacity of approximately $250 million. This capacity were fully utilized our pro forma total debt-to-total market value would be approximately -- our total debt at quarter end was $1.2 billion and our ratio of debt to total market value was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.1 times and our non-GAAP debt service coverage was 3.2 times. You should think of those items as more of a cash coverage test. As of March 31, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.5% and the weighted average maturity was 5.7 years including debt extension options. The breakdown of how we calculate these ratios can be found in our supplemental operating and financial data report furnished to the SEC and available on our website. We've exercised the first of our two options to extend the maturity on the 350 E. Cermak mortgage. The maturity date on the mortgage subject to completion of legal documentation is now June 9, 2009. The current amount outstanding on the mortgage is $97.5 million and the interest rate as of March 7, 2008 assuming the extension were effective will be 4.82% a 141 basis point reduction from the current swap rate. We continue to work on a number of financing options in support of our growth and development. In the US we are exploring the opportunity to access the unsecured product placement debt market. This potential financing vehicle would supplement our capital structure with medium to long term unsecured debt while providing further diversification of our capital sources. In addition, we are in various stages of due diligence in documentation on two standalone secured financings of domestic properties that would generate total proceeds of over $120 million with terms ranging from 3 to 5 years and interest rates ranging from 6 to 6.5%. In Europe, we are also in various stages of due diligence and documentation on two standalone secured financings. The first transaction is for a datacenter facility located on London's perimeter. Estimated proceeds range from 50 to £55 million with a five-year term and an interest rate in the range of 6.5 to 6.75%. The second transaction involves two datacenters located in Dublin. Estimated proceeds range from to 50 to €55 million with a five-year term and an interest rate in the range of 6 to 6.25%. All these loans are subject to the approval of the respective banks credit committees and other conditions. I would now like to turn to our revised guidance for 2008. We are increasing FFO guidance by $0.05 on each end to a range of a 235 to 245 per diluted share and unit because of the results of our leasing activity and a reduction in expected G&A expenses. The new guidance is based on the following assumptions: Total acquisitions for the full year in the range of 125 million to a 185 million consisting of 65 million to 75 million of vacant properties for redevelopment and 60 to $110 million of income producing properties at an average cap rate of 8%. The commencement of leases for approximately 190,000 square feet to 990,000 square feet of turnkey Datacenter and Powered Base Building space at an average annualized gross rent of $90 per square foot. The commencement of leases for 100,000 square feet to 125,000 square feet of basic commercial space at an average annualized gross rent of $19 per square foot. Total capital expenditures for our redevelopment program of $550 million and total G&A of $41 million. These new assumptions reflect a shift in the mix of investment capital, increasing capital expenditure for our redevelopment program, and reducing capital allocation for acquisitions, as well as a $3 million reduction in G&A due to the elimination of third party acquisition and disposition related professional fees from FAS 141R G&A line items which will not become effective until next year. We established 235 per diluted share and unit as a low end of our 2008 FFO guidance, primarily due to our foreign currency translation loss. As of May 8 2008, 81.4 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility is denominated in foreign currencies. Where we to repay these borrowings today? Depreciation in the US dollar since we borrow these funds would cause us to recognize its charge to earnings in FFO, using yesterday's exchange rate of approximately $5 million in foreign currency translation losses. We expect to repay some, if not all of these borrowings over the next several months with proceeds from the new secured loans that I mentioned earlier. This concludes our former remarks. We would now be happy to take any questions that you might have. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you and good morning out there. First question is for Mike regarding, I guess the results of the survey and just your thoughts in general regarding datacenter demand from what you’re seeing. Just maybe you could characterize it in terms of innings, what inning as a ball game do you think we’re in here today?
Bill Stein: You know, that's the good question. Certainly demand continues to be strong and by all indications yeah, the datacenter facilities for many corporations really are not discretion, I mean, they required for continued productivity and continued expansion of the businesses, and I think they cut across virtually all vertical markets. I don’t know, I mean, I would think that we’re maybe in the, I am guessing third inning, fourth innings perhaps in the middle of the game, I think we’re going to continue to see leasing our foreseeable future with the next 24 months, 36 months hopefully, we are going to continue to see pretty strong demand.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And what are you seeing on the supply side?
Bill Stein: Supply, doesn’t seem to be picking up to the expense to meet, the forecasted demand that we’re seeing. We are redoing some other analysis in house on the market by market basis, looking at kind of 7 or 8 top markets, and leasing a pretty lease from all our own research, we’re seeing a pretty significant supply demand, shortfall of supply, as much as perhaps on a 50% less supply then for the demand that we’re seeing forecasted over the next 24 months. But that’s kind of our own internal analysis of settle this top markets. So we’re pretty comfortable that it’s a pretty favorable environment for us today.
Jordan Sadler: And then the second question is just on the capital side Bill you outlined the secured financing, but you have done domestically, I suppose those would represent the $250 million as secured debt capacity you mentioned in your opening commentary?
Mike Foust: That's right.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. So any other plan?
Mike Foust: Hi Jordan, one point Bill. For that $55 million financing on the facility in London, that’s a construction loan. So it won’t go out all at once, it will go out as the facility built. But for most part it should funded this year.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And so, so on the capital sided things, any other plans either into asset sales or joint, sales on joint venture, in terms of joint venture transactions you could may be update or some?
Bill Stein: Nothing really on assets sales plus point. We are looking at several joint venture situations ,one of which would be for European development, and the second would be for stabilized asset sin the portfolio.
Jordan Sadler: Domestically?
Bill Stein: Not so gap.
Jordan Sadler: Are those await events sort of not necessarily?
Bill Stein: Not necessarily. The development JV might happen this year. I think the stabilize is when you take it little longer. And that’s the – we’re generating build to suit as well throughout development platform and we would see the stabilized as an exit vehicle for delta.
Analyst: It’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead
Michael Bilerman: Hi this is Micheal Bilerman in this line as well. My first question is about the assets the you have been, especially, the vacant assets that you have been borrowing such as the purpose build datacenter, I am wondering who are the sellers of these completely vacant assets and why the previous owner which used to sell rather than trying to lease the space himself?
Mike Foust: Yeah I didn’t give you some insight on there too, lie the last couple of transactions that actually we mentioned today the property scat away that’s adjacent to what free corporate place. That property is a warehouse facility that we will -- that were actually in the process of creating our powered based building and then one or two turnkey partners. So right now the building is warehouse. So its nothing marketed datacenter and engineering work has to be done both on some structural work as well as power and communications fire were being brought into the building. The second one I mentioned Franklin township there will be closing on in the next week or so that building is actually a brand new shell building, that’s being developed for us by a local developer, and so, that’s being build on a shell basis towards specifications on land that the developer own and then with the closing this week we will takeover and then market that building and potentially view some turnkey part later this year depending how the marketing goes on, on the other property.
Michael Bilerman: And just to clarify you said that you might setup the development joint venture something in the next 18 months?
Bill Stein: That’s right European assets.
Michael Bilerman: I am wondering why what sort of driver decisions that develop within a joint ventures as oppose to developing on balance sheet given sort of the yields that you’re getting on that?
Bill Stein: Its really a function of balance sheet capacity versus the opportunities that we see out there, as well as the amount of risk that we think its appropriate to have and development assets so within the portfolio at any one time. 
Michael Bilerman: And sort of in keeping with that you mentioned the $800 million of debt capacity that you have to fund developments for this year, but at the same time you mentioned the fixed charges are turning it around two times. I am wondering if you’re considering doing anything to sort of shore up the equity side of the balance sheet to fund developments potentially in '09 to keep that charge off?
Bill Stein: Well, I mean the interest rates, when we lease these assets with un-levered in the low-to-mid high teens even with a interest rate of 6 to 6.5%, its not going to be dilutive to the fixed charge coverage ratio basically in two times. But having said that, if you look at our needs, we could make it, I suspect to the first quarter of next year, but I think that would be pushing it, I think that be more likely that we brace equity before the end of the year, this year, and once we do something on the private sign with our joint venture, but we are price sensitive basically and so we are in no rush to raise equity.
Michael Bilerman: Fair enough, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes form the line of Will Mark with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Will Marks: Hello Mike, hello Bill. Couple of questions that I guess, to start with, can you give us a little more detail on how you are able to bring down G&A, you gave some comment I think your prepared remarks?
Bill Stein: Sure. Well there was a proposed FAS B that would have required all real estate companies to expense third party acquisition cost and disposition cost. So you know, that basically any consultants or anything like that are involved in the acquisition process that -- were those fees have been historically capitalized, it was proposed that those would be expense. We put that in our G&A assumptions for this year feeling that FASB would be effective, and its not going to be effective this year, its going to be effective next year. So that’s a significant component of the G&A reduction, and then other pieces of just growing to continuing to try to manage our business more effectively and efficiently.
Will Marks:  Great, okay. Couple other things, one is, I believe when you referred your survey, I said one of the questions related to, I think you said definitely, probably, two thirds will be expanding their data centers, did I hear that correctly?
Bill Stein: Actually what that will is that 86% of respondents in the definitely and probably category said they will expand in the next 12 months.
Will Marks: Okay. So it’s a combination of those definitely and probably?
Bill Stein: Yeah.
Will Marks: Okay. Sorry. I was just little confused by that, thank you. And one other question, I don’t think Savvis isn’t brought up yet. Can you just give us an update on their business, how it relates to you if there is potential upside or downside?
Mike Foust: Sure, obviously there were very important customer wars and we have good insight into their activities in our buildings obviously, and they are selling up on a space with at a pretty good pace. You know its kind of interesting if you look at kind of their filings, and conference calls it had, their data center based business has freeze very nicely and very similar to how other companies like Equinex, rack space and switching data continue to do. So there are data center based business that goes on our building has done very well and I think there has been some drag on growth for them its been on their network side, because they have a pretty extensive private network business. The larger center is underway that the data center that goes on in our building. So we are seeing them actually do quite well in the business well that operates in our facilities.
Will Marks: Okay. So, in terms of more exposure, is that now completely out of the question or could you possibly lease more space to them?
Mike Foust: No, I mean there is not anything, any discussions going on now in that way. But I could see we will look at it on by circumstance basis depending on the market and who the customer base is.
Will Marks: More importantly you are not worried about collecting (Inaudible).
Mike Foust: Not at all. If you look at there cash flow and balance sheet you know, they’re pretty healthy company.
Will Marks: Great. That’s all from me thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next questions comes form the line of George (Arabaugh) with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George: Hi good afternoon guys. We gotten the increase in redevelopment CapEx, is this purely an increase in the amount of square footage you plan to develop or are you spending more per foot into turnkey space?
Bill Stein: It is more square footage that we will continue to build out, both on the turnkey as well as in the powered based building, but our construction budgets are coming in within our parameters and our guys and girls are getting more cost effective all the time in this construction project.
Mike Foust: George, it basically reflects the fact that we’re north – somebody had to schedule on our leasing plan, and so, we are going forward into 2008 some of 2009 plans.
George: Okay. And for the past two quarters your redevelopment schedule has not shown that you had a shale product in the construct pipeline , are you just seeing less demand for that product type? Are you focusing your efforts on the higher yields in the turnkey products? 
Mike Foust: Well. I mean, it really does continue be both products that we’re leasing to customers. So in the same building you will have suites that we’re building out as turnkey as well as space that we’re leasing in multi tenant facilities on a powered based building situation, so its really both. Our products are being absorbed. You know I think we are – leases commenced in the quarter it was much more heavily weighted toward the turnkey facilities, I am assuming in terms of total dollars being expended. If it's going to be the dollars expended in the cap are going to be much more weighted toward the turnkey, it’s just because of nature of that product.
George: Thank you.
Operator: Thanks our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with UBS. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. Looking at the guidance I just had one question in regards to the cap rate assumption is 8%, it seems a little high to me. I am just wondering what you guys are seeing in the acquisition market at this point?
Bill Stein: Right now the projects that we've looked at and that we've been closing on we're in excess of 8.5, so between 8 and 8.5 on the income producing properties. So we think 8 will be pretty consistent for us and maybe a bit conservative.
Omotayo Okusanya:  That’s interesting thank you. And who (Inaudible) cap rates on this product were a little bit higher like in the mid seven. So, I mean, I know you guys do a lot of off market transactions at the 8.5 cap rate transactions or off market transactions that you continue to find out there?
Mike Foust: Yeah. I mean, firstly everything we are doing is been off market. And a lot of these properties they may have an income producing component and a non-income producing component for redevelopment as well. If you look -- so not all the properties where we’re buying anymore are property that strictly fully leased income producing. Some might represent portions of buildings that were splitting out. With that said, we have seen over the past year a number of sales occurring well down into the sevens. But those just aren't opportunities that are very interesting for us because we can get in more better returns I would say of our development and redevelopment programs.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got it.
Bill Stein:  And we've been quite selective in the acquisitions area. So when we look at capital allocation if we have the opportunity to have high teens levered, mid teens levered, the development versus a seven or so on acquisition clearly we’re going to lean towards the higher yielding opportunity, particularly in a capital constraint environment such as this. And that’s really we think what our investors are looking for us to accomplish.
Omotayo Okusanya: Great thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your question is a follow up from the line Jordan Sadler with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler:  Thanks guys. I just want to like clarify the mix. Based on the affirmed leasing guidance the 890 to 990 on the datacenter space turnkey and shell staying at $90 bucks, I assume is the spending rate on those commencements expected to stay the same and is the mix expected to stay the same?
Bill Stein: No. 50/50 turnkey shell.
Mike Foust: Yeah that’s what we are continuing to project right now. Kind of the best of our forecasting. I mean, what's happening also is that we’re leasing and thus commencements are occurring a little more quickly than we forecasted. So the same amount we are forecasting on a square footage but we’re little ahead of schedule.
Jordan Sadler: Right. In terms of booking revenue for the full year…
Mike Foust: Exactly.
Jordan Sadler: But your spending on that same square footage went just to go back to an earlier question. And so, but you’re saying the cost you are actually being contained. So it's implicit and that is that you’re going to be pre-funding I guess as Bill alluded to next year commencement?
Bill Stein: That’s right.
Jordan Sadler: It’s a function of this years leasing activity accelerating?
Bill Stein: Right. We basically need to fund inventory this year for next year's growth.
Jordan Sadler: Can you -- what is the expected spend on HSBC in that guidance in the 550?
Bill Stein: Well I assume that’s already have been spent. So, but the loan is ₤55 million.
Jordan Sadler: What's baked into the 550, which will be in – it attributable to that property?
Mike Foust: Probably about, I want to say around in ₤55 million, ₤57 million.
Bill Stein: I will call it a $110 million.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. That’s helpful. And then there is a larger size portfolio out there for sale that we have talked about previously, any expectations on pricing that you guys might have or whether or not you are still looking at it?
Mike Foust: It appears that from what we are hearing in the market place, is that the pricing is getting very aggressive on that portfolio, which I think at the end they will probably be a very favorable comp for us, if it proceeds as we are hearing.
Mike Foust: It should be helpful for NAV focused owners of DLR.
Jordan Sadler: But that means you are -- is going to get very expensive, but probably goes away from Digital, it’s down with the digital?
Bill Stein: I would say that likely.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that’s helpful. Lastly, Bill, overall expenses sequentially and is total real estate operating expenses ex real estate taxes, sequentially they went from 33 million last quarter to 31.5 million this quarter. What was that decrease attributable to and what's a good run rate?
Bill Stein: I think I mentioned in the last call, where we hired a new contractor to do maintenance across our portfolio and there is significant amount of deferred maintenance last quarter and so, this quarter you are seeing I think more normalized rate.
Mike Foust: Yeah there was ramp up with the portfolio wide contract and as well we are able to tighten the speck once we got them up and running. I mean also then there is some cases where we were able to tighten the scope of the contract and reduce ongoing cost there as well. So it shouldn’t be really cost effective and there is a couple of other broad vendor contracts like that that we have been able to fine tune and reduce ongoing costs.
Jordan Sadler: Were any of those one time you discussed that were in the numbers in the operating expense line, meaning like either energy item or the reversal of bad debt?
Bill Stein: No. You will find those in revenue and you need to find it in the capitalization issues would be in the interest expense.
Jordan Sadler: So the reversal of bad debt and revenue and the energy is both in revenue?
Bill Stein: Right.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Mike Foust: Towards the fee.
Jordan Sadler: Towards the fee. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Dave Rodgers: Hey, Bill question for you. In relation to the acquisition guidance being lower is that a function more of acquisition pricing which you have mentioned it can be aggressive or more a function of capital? And then the second part of that is at what point do slower acquisitions begin to potentially flow the funding or the opportunity for the future growth through redevelopment et cetera?
Bill Stein: I think it’s a function of relative yield opportunities between the two buckets of capital. And we are at the point now where we are commencing leases every quarter. So you know, if you are starting a development program afresh you might have to wait a few quarters before you recognize revenue, but we are commencing revenues every quarter. So we don’t have a -- we are not hurting in that respect in terms of the delays you otherwise might see with the de novo development project. And then when you compare with the accretion factors of an 8% cap investment versus lets call it 15% yielding development project that is clearly no comparison.
Dave Rodgers: I would agree with that I think the -- that same dynamic been through you know, say last quarter, I guess when you gave the guidance originally, and just I guess function of the leasing demand and your ability to capture that today through the redevelopment faster, is that all?
Bill Stein: I think that’s right.
Mike Foust: And what you are also seeing is kind of a continuous process where we are developing step out of the -- that resides in the redevelopment inventory, developing and putting it into the operating portfolio and then in selected markets where we’re refreshing space through acquiring sites and/or existing buildings that we can redevelop, like we just discussed about in Northern New Jersey. So, we’re adding in on an incremental basis to maintain our inventory in those markets where we see a lot of demand. So it doesn’t work for us to add so much more square footage as perhaps we have added in past years.
Bill Stein: In some of these assets that have yield when we acquired them they have internal growth opportunities, really are we buying totally full assets.
Mike Foust: We were still taking advantage of a lot of growth out, for example 350 Cermak in Chicago or 600 West 7th in LA which we've held for few years now and continuing to build out and then getting good same store growth out of those assets.
Dave Rodgers: And really get to a follow-up to that with relation to your comments on Northern New Jersey, give us just a brief thought on the different strategies between those assets and maybe waiting to go the route of the turnkey space on the asset you are likely to close on here in the next week?
Mike Foust: We are likely for the time being finalize or finish reselling improvements in terms of power and fiber that will completed the building and we will hold for you know, likely for larger power based building or kind of custom build situation for users who maybe want larger footprint or standalone facility. And we can utilize the Piscataway asset we just bought next two or three quarters place and utilize that as more of a multi tenant opportunity and will build out a couple turn key pods in that building at Piscataway and have the inventory and Franklin for individual users perhaps or a couple of larger users.
Dave Rodgers: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Foust for concluding comments. Please go ahead sir.
Mike Foust: Very good. Well I appreciate everyone's focus and taking the time to come on the call. And we look forward to following up with you in the future. Thank you very much.

To manage the call in a timely manner, questions will be limited to two per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Foust:  Great, thank you Pamela [audio interrupt], good morning and good afternoon and welcome everyone. I’ll begin with a brief overview of Digital Realty Trust then I’ll discuss the current state of our industry, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2007 accomplishments. Following my remarks, Bill Stein will address our financial performance and overall liquidity. First a brief introduction, Digital Realty Trust is the leading owner and manager of technology real estate. Our portfolio currently contains 71 properties totaling 12.6 million rentable square feet.  Excluding one property, the Westin Building in Seattle that’s held as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture, our properties are located in 26 metro areas across North America and Europe. The portfolio now includes approximately 2 million square feet of space held for redevelopment, a very important source of growth for the company. DLR provides a variety of data center facilities solutions including turnkey data center powered base building and build to suit data centers for domestic and international corporate customers. Our properties serve a wide range of industry vertical markets including information technology, internet enterprises, financial services, telecom network providers, energy companies and generally Fortune 1000 firms.  DLR has delivered strong earnings growth resulting in attractive shareholder returns and earlier this week, DLR was recognized by The Wall Street Journal as a top performing REIT based on the three year average shareholder return. It is clear that two major concerns face the commercial real estate industry in light of the current economic environment, namely tenant demand and access to capital to finance growth. The good news for DLR is that corporate demand for new data center space remains very strong and due to the coordinated efforts of our technical sales, engineering, design and construction and operations teams, this market demand is being converted into strong absorption of our turnkey data center, powered base building and build to suit products.  Representing a variety of industries, DLR tenants continue to take significant amounts of new space in our facilities. Recent expansions and new customers include Computer Sciences Corp, Facebook, CBS, HSBC and Aircom, Irelands incumbent telecom service provider. Contributing to our growing portfolio is the expansion of our European presence. In January we announced a ground breaking for a major new build to suit facility for HSBC on a development side of suburban London that we acquired in early 2007. In Dublin, Ireland, we recently executed a new lease with Aircom for both turnkey data center and powered base building space in the new 124,500 square foot facility that is nearing completion. In addition, we acquired two new properties in suburban London, adding approximately 150,000 gross square feet of redevelopment space in a very important market.  Looking more broadly at DLR customers who are a top IP service of the [co-location] providers, both Savvis and Equinex expressed similarly positive views on demand outlook for their data center based services. Savvis reported solid revenue growth, expanding margins and strong EBITDA growth. They expanded their operating footprint significantly in 2007 in DLR owned properties and their customers are absorbing space in their new data centers at a good pace. Equinex reported strong results for 2007 with over 30% organic growth in revenue, a large increase in EBITDA and strong absorption. The company increased its 2008 guidance based on its outlook for continued customer demand in the US and internationally.  Both companies appear to have experienced little impact to date from the current capital market’s challenges. In fact, several of our customers report increased interest in potential cost savings and enhanced productivity from outsourcing data center facilities. In addition, fundamental business needs drive demand for expanding IT services and corporate data center facilities. These include the complexity and cost to build new facilities, regulatory and securities compliance requirements and the increase in adoption of online applications, including securities and commodities trading, risk management analysis, content distribution social networking and webhosting in general. Further underscoring the steady demand for data center space was the pace of our leasing activity during the fourth quarter, with over 429,000 square feet of new leases signed, our biggest quarter to date.  These leases included 245,000 of turnkey data center, 112,000 square feet of powered base building and over 72,000 square feet of non technical space. For the full year 2007, we signed leases totaling 998,000 square feet, including 435,000 square feet of turnkey data center space, 419,000 square feet of powered base building and 144,000 square feet of non technical space. Note that our leasing shifted towards a more even mix of turnkey and powered base building in the second half of the year and we expect that trend to continue into the first half of 2008.  Leases commencing in the portfolio in the fourth quarter totaled over 150,000 square feet of which over 125,000 square feet was data center space, including 16,000 square feet of turnkey and approximately 109,000 square feet of powered base building. The remaining 25,000 square feet was non technical space. For the full year, leases commenced on approximately 761,000 square feet, including nearly 134,000 square feet of turnkey space, over 550,000 square feet of powered base building and 77,000 square feet of non technical space. Key to our success is our proven ability to identify and acquire value add opportunities in top tier markets and to convert the redevelopment inventory in the high quality turnkey and powered base building data centers.  We currently are underway on construction projects in high demand markets in the US and Europe that will add approximately 637,000 rentable square feet of additional space to our operating portfolio and this space will come online through the third quarter of 2008. Of this space, approximately 533,000 square feet is turnkey data center and 104,000 square feet is build to suit data center space. In addition, the HSBC build to suit of 120,000 square feet is projected to come online mid 2009. Portfolio occupancy excluding space held for redevelopment was 94.7% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 95.1% for the previous quarter and 95% for the same period in 2006. As of February 25 this month, occupancy was back up to 95%.  We expect the occupancy to fluctuate slightly quarter to quarter, primarily due to the lag in commencement after lease execution as we convert redevelopment space into value add turnkey and powered base building data centers and added to the operating portfolio out of the redevelopment inventory. At times, facilities will be completed during the quarter, added to the portfolio and then leases might commence in the next quarter. Turning now to our acquisition program, during the fourth quarter 2007, we acquired three properties in Europe totaling $83.5 million.  On December 10 we acquired Cressex 1 located in suburban London. This property totals approximately 52,000 square feet of redevelopment space of which 21,000 feet will be converted into a turnkey data center. On December 12 we acquired Naritaweg 52, a fully leased 63,000 square foot data center facility in Amsterdam. On December 21 we acquired units 1, 2 and 3 in the Foxboro Business Park, a three building complex also located in suburban London. Unit 1 consists of a 20,000 square foot data center facility fully leased to a global geophysical company.  Unit 2 is fully leased, a 31,000 square foot warehouse and unit 3 consists of over 96,000 square feet of redevelopment space, capable of supporting about 58,000 square feet of turnkey data center. This brings our 2007 full year acquisitions to $363 million which added 1.6 million square feet to our portfolio, including 615,000 of redevelopment space.  The weighted average cap rate for the income producing properties was 8.52%, slightly higher than our 2007 guidance of 8.25%. Subsequent to the end of the year in February, we acquired 365 Randolphville road, a 270,000 square foot redevelopment project located in Piscataway, New Jersey, very near our 3 Corporate Place facility. This new property is capable of supporting the development of up to 150,000 square feet of improved data center space, bringing new [more] product to a market experiencing strong demand. We plan to make base building improvements and upgrades to the power with plans for an initial build out of two turnkey data centers, totaling 20,000 square feet of raised floor.  Overall we’re very proud of our success that we achieved in 2007 which is clearly reflected in our strong financial results. We believe that our expertise and financial strength will continue to produce superior results in 2008 and we greatly appreciate the efforts of our outstanding team of professionals as well as the supportive comments of our investors and business partners. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, in addition to demand, access to capital is the second major concern facing our industry. I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO Bill Stein who will discuss our capital requirements, the success of our capital market activities and our strong fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial results. Bill.
Bill Stein:  Thanks Mike, good morning everybody. I’d like to begin with a review of our fourth quarter and year end 2007 financial results and will conclude my comments with a discussion of our overall liquidity. Following my remarks, we will open the call to your questions. EBITDA was $53.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 17.9% from $45.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year 2007, EBITDA was $221 million, up 36.7% from $161.7 million in 2006.  FFO on a diluted share and unit basis was $0.53 in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 10.4% from $0.48 in the same quarter last year and up 3.9% from $0.51 in the third quarter of 2007. For the full year, FFO was $2.05 per diluted share and unit, up almost 26% from $1.63 in 2006. Let me remind you that our most recent FFO guidance for 2007 was $2.02-$2.04. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the fourth quarter 2007 was $27.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share and unit.  The AFFO ratio for the fourth quarter was 83.8%, this compared to a third quarter AFFO of $24.5 million or $0.35 per diluted share and unit. The AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter was 81.8%. The increase in the fourth quarter payout ratio reflects the 8.3% increase in the dividend in the fourth quarter and an increase of $1.3 million in capitalized leasing commissions in the quarter due to the increased number of lease signings. Reconciliation of FFO to net income, AFFO to FFO and FFO and EBITDA to net income for these periods is included in our supplemental operating and financial data furnished to the SEC and available on our website.  Total operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $105.9 million, up 1.1% from $104.8 million in the third quarter of 2007 and up 29.1% from $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Total operating revenues for the full year 2007 were $395.2 million, up 45.2% from $272.1 million in 206. This increase, the increases in rental revenues and [tenal] reimbursement revenues for the quarter and the full year compared to the same periods in 2006 were primarily due to properties that we acquired during the 12 month period ending December 31, 2007 and overall leasing activity.  Net income for the fourth quarter was $5.6 million, up from $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2007 and down $6.4 million for the same period of 2006. Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $254,000 compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $224,000 in the third quarter of 2007 and net income available to common shareholders of $3 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the same period in 2006. Net income available to common shareholders for the full year was $21.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to $17.6 million in 2006 or $0.47 per diluted share. Net income in both 2007 and 2006 includes gains on sales of assets. We do not include gain on sales of assets in our FFO.  Same store NOI increased 5.4% to $49.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2007 and increased 12.6% from $43.9 million in the fourth quarter 2006. Same store NOI adjusted for straight line and FAS 141 adjustments which we refer to as same store cash NOI increased to $43.4 in the fourth quarter, up 6.4% from $40.8 million in the third quarter of 2007 and up 13.9% from $38.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases were primarily the result of new leasing and our properties commencing during the 12 month period.  I will now review specific items included in the statement of operations to provide additional detail on the results for the quarter. For the fourth quarter tenant reimbursements decreased to $20.6 million from $22.1 million in the third quarter of 2007 due to the yearend true up of common area maintenance and a reduction in property taxes resulting from a favorable tax assessment at our 350 East Cermak property in Chicago. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $84.9 million, up 1.8% from $83.4 million in the third quarter of 2007 due primarily to a recently launched domestic property maintenance program.  These increases were partially offset by the favorable tax assessment at our 350 East Cermak property in Chicago. Total operating expenses were up $23.8 million in the fourth quarter or 39% versus the fourth quarter of 2006 due to new properties acquired during the year, the domestic property maintenance program and increasing utility expenses. Utility expenses increased because of rate increases and higher utilization by our tenants at several properties. G&A which is a component of total operating expenses was $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2000, up from $7.8 million in the previous quarter.  The increase was primarily due to higher consulting and legal expenses. G&A increased $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 primarily due to higher marketing expenses, travel expenses resulting from our expansion in Europe and the increase in the number of our employees. At year end we had 153 employees compared to 109 at year end 2006. Turning now to our balance sheet, during the fourth quarter we capitalized $4.2 million of interest related to construction projects, excluding our share of a consolidated joint venture which compares to $3.1 million in the third quarter. In addition we capitalized approximately $1.9 million in compensation expenses compared to approximately $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2007.  In this year’s 10K, we are including a disclosure of construction work in progress as of December 31, 2007, we had $289 million of construction work in progress. As Mike mentioned in his comments, the availability of capital is a significant concern for real estate companies as access to capital has become constrained over the past year. Digital Realty Trust is in a capital intensive business and capital is essential to our ability to continue to acquire and redevelop properties. Over the course of 2007 and through early 2008, we were not only able to maintain our capital base and financial flexibility, but enhance it.  As I mentioned on previous calls, in April 2007 we raised $169.1 million of net proceeds from a convertible preferred stock offering. In August of 2007, in anticipation of liquidity challenge that were then affecting the capital markets that became much more severe later in the year, we increased the size of our credit facility to $650 million, obtained more favorable covenants, lower pricing and a longer maturity. One October 22nd the company completed a follow on public offering of a little over 4 million primary shares of common stock generating net proceeds of approximately $150 million. And subsequent to year end, we just completed an underwritten public offering of 13.8 million shares of series D cumulative preferred stock which generated approximately $333.6 million of net proceeds.  We also utilized net proceeds from both of these offerings to temporarily repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to fund acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities and for general corporate purposes. As of Tuesday, yesterday, we have $44.7 million outstanding on our credit facility, including outstanding letters of credit. Based on the covenants in our credit facility, we have a total borrowing capacity of over $780 million consisting of $605 million of immediate liquidity under the credit facility and assuming we first borrow this entire amount, additional secured debt capacity of approximately $175 million.  If this capacity were fully utilized, our pro forma debt to total enterprise value would be approximately 36.5%. Our total debt at year end was $1.4 billion and our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was 30.6%. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.4 times and our debt service coverage was 3.4 times. Pro forma for the convertible preferred offering, our leverage ratio would be 23.1% and debt service would be 4.1 times. As of December 31, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.8% and the weighted average maturity was 5.8 years including debt extension options.  A description of how we calculate these ratios can be found on our supplemental operating and financial data furnished to the SEC and available on our website. During 2008, we have three scheduled mortgage maturities. The 350 East Cermak mortgage had a balance of $97.9 million at December 31. The initial maturity of this mortgage is June 9 and there are two, one year extensions available.  Currently we are exploring refinancing options which include both secured and unsecured debt. The 375 Riverside mortgage had a balance of $8.6 million at December 31 and matures on December 1, 2008. We are currently planning to repay this mortgage and add this property to the borrowing base [put] in the revolving credit facility. Finally, the 1500 Space Park Drive mortgage had a balance of $5.5 million at December 31 and matures on April 15. We are currently planning to repay this mortgage with funds from the revolving credit facility.  We believe that our track record of accessing well priced debt and equity capital from several different sources, particularly in difficult markets is a powerful competitive advantage. We also believe that we have sufficient equity capital to fund out currently planned acquisition and redevelopment program for the year when combined with your planned activities in the debt markets. Finally, as noted in our earnings release, we are not changing guidance at this time. This concludes our formal remarks. We would now be happy to take any questions that you might have.
Operator:  Thank you sir, ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder if you have a question, please press the star, followed by the one on your touchtone phone. If you’d like to withdraw your question, press the star followed by the two. If you’re using a speakerphone, you will need to lift your handset before making your selection. Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with Keybanc Capital Markets, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Good morning, first question is regarding leasing activity, I know you did a good job disclosing it before this release and you’ve got a little bit more color around the edges this time around. I’m curious to know what the total leased but not yet commenced space was at January 1, 2008. Is that the 403,000 or might there have been something else that was leased and not commenced from a prior quarter?
Mike Foust: Let’s see, I believe the 403,000 is just leases from actually the fourth quarter and I think our actual backlog is something more kind of around 435,000, I’m sorry, 530,000 square feet of total backlog. So I believe the 403,000 square feet of backlog were just leases signed in the fourth quarter, but there are some other leases from the third quarter that will be commencing in 08.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Okay and then on top of that there were some additional leases signed year to date I could presume?
Mike Foust: Yeah and we’ll have more activity as we go through the rest of the quarter as well obviously.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  No, understood, but the 530 just to be clear does not include anything that was done since January 1, 08?
Mike Foust: That’s correct.
Bill Stein:  Yes, just signings in 07.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  That had not yet commenced. And the average rate and expected timing of those commencements? 
Bill Stein:  Well roughly we’re expecting about 80% of that will commence in the first quarter at an average rate of, average GAAP rate of around $95.00, another 6% in the second quarter at an average cap rate of $85.00 and then the balance in the third quarter at an average cap rate around $70.00.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Okay around 70. And just to stay with this for a second, the timing is mid quarter convention safe and then the margin.
Mike Foust:  Mid quarter convention is fine I suppose for your forecast if that’s…
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Is that what you guys are, I mean is that kind of a pretty safe number I mean for the first quarter, 80% of it is in the first quarter?
Bill Stein:  Let’s see, that’s safe, I mean that’s safe.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  And then just the margin on the and maybe you could break it out if you want to break it out if it’s easier just to say margin on the turnkey space, because I know the other stuff is triple that.
Bill Stein:  Yeah the power base is triple that.
Mike Foust:  You know, we’d have to go back and look at that and maybe include that in supplemental because every site is different, I don’t think we’ve aggregated them together to look at the margin on an aggregate basis. Because primarily what we’re looking, I mean besides looking at our operating margin, operating cost, we’re looking at return on investment and of invested capital and you know primarily we’re looking at on average mid teen returns on invested capital of these projects. 
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  And that 530, does that include HSBC?
Mike Foust:  No.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  It does not. Last question is just on, in your commentary Mike you mentioned that sometimes you move some of the redevelopment space I guess on the books and the timing is different, it comes on the books in anticipation of the lease commencement. Was there anything special about this quarter in terms of the amount that was moved on the books that was vacant space? Meaning was it more sizable than what you would traditionally move on?
Mike Foust:  It’s probably been a little more as, approaching, it’s around 95,000 square feet or so that moved into the operating portfolio from the redev inventory. And so about 53,000, about 93,000 square feet moved into the portfolio and since the end of the year about 53,000 of that has been, you know have leases commenced on it. So our convention is when we complete a turnkey space, we move it into the operating portfolio regardless of whether it’s leased or not and so you know as you can tell that backlog if you will gets or that new operating portfolio space gets leased up quickly.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Okay I’ll jump back in the queue.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Ian Wiseman of Merrill Lynch.
Ian Wiseman – Merrill Lynch:  Yes, good afternoon, a quick question for you, you talk a lot about the demand in the marketplace. You’re seeing a pretty broad level of demand across a number of industries, can you just talk a little bit about the trends in market rents you’ve seen you know over the last year or so and are you getting any pushback whatsoever on rents in this environment today from tenants.
Mike Foust:  Sure, you know we’re seeing you know I would say 2006 and 2007 through the end of 2007, we’ve probably seen rents increase by about 20% on average. And that would be both powered base building as well for turnkey stays. I don’t know if I’d necessarily continue to expect 20% growth in 2008. But I could see rates you know being pretty steady and at this current level and you know maybe going up 5-10%.  You know with that said, the biggest pushback for us is kind of the trade off where customers may look to build their own space rather than outsource the facility if rates get too high. But you know with that said, there’s a lot of benefit for expediency in having the space available as well. So we’re not seeing pushback and in some markets like Chicago especially, London, you know New York metro area, we’re seeing a lot of strength in lease rates.
Ian Wiseman – Merrill Lynch:  So where would that put your mark to market today?
Mike Foust:  You know I would say and this is a real guesstimate, probably around 25% uplift.
Ian Wiseman – Merrill Lynch:  And second question, obviously you talk about the difficult financing environment and you know we’ve seen a dearth or lack thereof of trades in the marketplace, can you maybe just talk to us about your underwriting process today and what your return expectations are today on an unlevered basis for new acquisitions.
Mike Foust:  Sure and you know we’re being really targeted, looking at opportunities where you know there might be an attractive turn on a stabilized asset as well as looking you know to fill in our inventory of redevelopment space as we lease up in the high demand markets. You know, this year our guidance is around 8% on a cash cap rate. You know I could see maybe that going up somewhat. You know we’ve got a combination of you know this property type becomes more accepted in the marketplace. So you know we’ve seen some stabilized assets trades you know even the second half of the year at 6.5-7 caps. So you know I don’t see stabilized assets jumping up to 9 cap areas in many cases. But you know I could see some creep up, 8.25-8.5%.
Ian Wiseman – Merrill Lynch:  That’s on an unlevered basis?
Mike Foust:  Correct.
Ian Wiseman – Merrill Lynch:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Michael [overlay]. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Hey guys, [Irwan Guzman’s] on the phone with me as well. I wanted to go over the capital issue and you talked a little about how precious capital is for you and done a good job at sort of getting the balance sheet and getting the capital on the books to be able to go out and fund acquisitions and redevelopment and new development. Obviously a piece of your, big part of your business is funding tenants and tenants being able to use your balance sheet and your capital as you build out their space. So the question that I have is has there been a change in the tenant’s desire for you to be funding more of the improvement? And how are you in sort of this difficult financing environment looking at the rate at which you are charging for tenants being able to leverage your balance sheet?
Mike Foust:  Sure, we’ve seen the mix kind of move more toward kind of a 50/50 breakdown between the powered base building which is the more highly improved shell versus the full turnkey whereas in the first half of the year, especially skewed by the Savvis leases, it was much more to a powered base building. So we are seeing a trend at least in the short term where tenants are looking for more turnkey space where it’s about equal to the amount of powered base building. And I think that trend is going to continue into the first half of 2008 based on our pipeline. You know in terms of amortization of and how we’re pricing overall, you know it varies by project, varies by tenant credit if we’re doing a build to suit. Bill you might want to address that in a little more detail.
Bill Stein:  Well it certainly has made, led to some interesting discussions with build to suit tenants because as our, as cost of funding goes up we obviously go back to them and say well guess what we’re going to have to bump this a little bit. So and it’s totally a function as you might imagine of the credit quality of the prospective tenant.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Right and so how much have you, I mean we’ve seen a complete widening out of spreads, probably 2-300 basis points at least. Is that what you’re sort of going back to these tenants and have deals fallen through because you’re charging excess rates or they’re happy to pay whatever it is?
Mike Foust:  We haven’t seen deals fall through and we have been at least in our internal imputed amortization rates, we’ve definitely increased them you know between 100-200 basis points depending on the circumstance. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Right and just clarity on this 530,000 square feet, how much of that is coming out of the 1.7 million redevelopment space, how much of its vacant sort of normal just out of the core portfolio and then how much maybe you know new development and does any of it relate to future roll as occurring in 08?
Mike Foust:  None of its related to future roll, so it’s all incremental new.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay.
Bill Stein: Probably in redevelopment.
Mike Foust:  Yeah, it’s all…
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  So the 530 is out of that 1.7 million square feet of redevelopment space that you show?
Mike Foust:  Right, which is now run at 2 million feet with a couple of the recent acquisitions.
Bill Stein:  Keep in mind that redevelopment space goes up and down based on you know new properties acquired and completions.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Right but I’m just trying to isolate this 530 that you’ve already leased.
Bill Stein:  It came out of redevelopment.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And have you spent the capital to build out that space already or the capital still needs to be spent?
Bill Stein:  Again, some cases the capital needs to be spent.
Mike Foust:  But it’s in large part, it has been com, you know I don’t think we have much left to complete for that tranche of lease out.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  But you know this is, it’s pretty significant in terms of annualized rental income, it would just be helpful to sort of get a picture of whether the capital has been spent or not.
Bill Stein:  Well you know for the 80% that is commencing in the first quarter, you know logically most of that would be spent.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Right.
Bill Stein:  That balance, we’re positioning up projects for these guys before the leases are commenced.
[Irwin Guzman] – Citigroup:  Okay and then [Irwin] just had one question. Yes I was wondering the 300,000 square feet, you previously mentioned that you were expecting to deliver 300,000 square feet of redevelopment space between the first quarter and the second quarter and the 92,000 square feet that came in implies that there’s a total over 200,000 that would be starting in this first quarter. Is that still on pace?
Mike Foust:  I think maybe those numbers might be off a little bit that you just mentioned. 
[Irwin Guzman] – Citigroup:  Well maybe another way of asking is the 600,000 square feet plus that you have under active redevelopment right now, is that sort of apples to apples with the 530,000 square feet of leasing as yet to commence? [Overlay] that 600,000.
Mike Foust:  No, that’s additional. That’s additional product that we’ll be bringing online the first three quarters of the year.
[Irwin Guzman] – Citigroup:  Okay so that’s right now un-leased right?
Mike Foust:  Correct.
[Irwin Guzman] – Citigroup:  And I’m just wondering you know as the amount of redevelopment activity you have has grown, has your sort of attitude on preleasing changed a little bit and how much are you comfortable building out on spec at one time?
Mike Foust:  You know in a typical asset, we’ll build one or two pods, which is roughly 10,000 square feet of raised floor space, roughly 18-20,000 feet of rentable square feet. And that’s been, that’s served us pretty well. It validates the building and it provides a quick time to market for the corporate users who invariably needed the space yesterday and it’s pretty powerful in the marketplace to be able to move people in you know expediently.
[Irwin Guzman] – Citigroup:  Okay since that 530,000 is in addition to the 600,000 that you’re currently building, is it safe to assume that that’s pure occupancy growth from here forward, those leases that will be commencing?
Mike Foust:  Yes.
[Irwin Guzman] – Citigroup:  Okay, thank you that’s it.
Bill Stein:  Let me add a little bit to that question or to the answer. The downturn or potential downturn in the economy, we’ve found so far has led to increased interest in our product. When you think about the financial institutions as a vertical, clearly they’ve lost a lot of capital in the last couple quarters which you know they still have needs, they still have IT application needs that need to be housed somewhere but they now really don’t have as much capital as they once had for capital investment. So they’re far more interested in an operating lease solution which we can provide.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with UBS, please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya – UBS:  Ian has actually asked my questions already, so thank you very much.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, if there are any additional questions, please press star followed by the one at this time. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift your handset before pressing the numbers. Our next question is a follow up from Jordan Sadler, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Thanks, Bill just another way of sort of slicing the capital question, I think the guidance this year was for $700 million of capital spending and I think that was roughly split almost evenly between acquisitions and capital and other capital spending on redevelopment and I guess recurring cap ex. How much of the $350 odd million for capital spending outside of acquisitions has been spent?
Bill Stein:  Given where we are in the year [overlay].
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Let’s maybe in the context of your $44 million outstanding on your line of credit.
Bill Stein:  Yeah, not very much at all, but I do think maybe where you’re going is at this point we are anticipating a shift in the mix. So there will be more of our investment capital directed to redevelopment we think than acquisitions. Now if we see cap rates suddenly back up, we may change that again. But right now I think that there could be, there’s likely would be more than 340 headed towards redoubt but we would just back off the acquisition budget. We still plan to stay within the 700 at this point unless there’s some significantly, a very attractive opportunities out there.
Mike Foust:  Yeah, that’s a good point. Our leasing pipeline continues to expand and you know we’re seeing a lot of good opportunities and very attractive returns to continue to build the organic leasing out of the redevelopment inventory. So we’re keeping a very close eye on that and I think we’re being very prudent how we’re allocating capital to the best returns. And as long as that demand profile continues to remain strong we have no reason, that it won’t be, we’ll allocate more capital to the higher returning activities.
Bill Stein:  That does affect the timing of revenues since you know you have to build it generally before you can recognize but if you notice a lot of the signed leases from last year are commencing the first quarter so. We think they balance each other out which is why we’re not changing guidance.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: You think the capital goes out the door pretty evenly though?
Mike Foust:  It’ll be front end loaded, I think we said about 60% in the first half on cap ex.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Yup and then just coming back to the 530,000 feet, Mike you said that’s basically going to be an occupancy gain rather than out of the redevelopment inventory. Does that mean that the expense load is already being reflected in the 4Q numbers and so there will be no incremental expenses?
Mike Foust:  No, I think the way to look at the great majority of that space is coming out of the redevelopment inventory. So you will have an uptick in occupancy but remember your denominator is going to get bigger now because it’s space coming out of the redev into the operating portfolio. 
Bill Stein:  And also the expenses on all of that right now is being capitalized. It’s not being picked up in the [overlay].
Mike Foust:  And I think further is that a lot of this, a great majority of this is turnkey data center space which are gross leases, plus electric. So our operating, as those come online our operating expenses will go up but revenues will go up significantly to much, much obviously to cover that and because returns are quite attractive on these. So the, keeping in mind the turnkey space carries with it operating expenses net of electric and utilities that you know that will add to operating expenses but will be you know obviously way more than covered by the very attractive rents we’re getting.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: But if 80%, so 400,000 square feet in the first quarter, okay, comes online leased, should we also expect a light amount of redevelopment space to shift from that redevelopment column over to the net rentable square footage that’s in the stabilized column?
Bill Stein:  Its 340,000 square feet, so the percentages are by revenue, not by square footage.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay, what’s the aggregate revenue represented by the 530?
Bill Stein:  By the 530?
Mike Foust:  Yeah, I mean it’ll be, you know we’re projecting to be during the year around $38 million of revenue recognized in the year.
Bill Stein:  $37-$38.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: From the backlog you mentioned, from the [overlay]. Okay.
Bill Stein:  And so those percentages I gave you reflect the revenue contribution in each quarter. 
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: That’s really helpful, thank you. Alright that’s it.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Frank [Greywitt] with [Reeve], please go ahead.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  Hey guys, were there any one time items on the JV line this quarter?
Bill Stein:  No.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  The 289 of construction and progress, does that include land, redevelopment and development declared?
Bill Stein:  Yes.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  And then how about some of buildings that aren’t under, that were purchased that aren’t currently under development, do you throw that in that bucket as well or are they sitting somewhere else?
Bill Stein:  No those wouldn’t be there.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  Okay so that would be in addition?
Bill Stein:  Yeah.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  I’m sorry if you said this already, but is there a breakdown between the power base building and the turnkey for that 530,000 square feet?
Bill Stein:  There is a breakdown, I don’t think we’ve disclosed it.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  Do you wish to?
Bill Stein:  We’ll think about it. [Overlay].
Mike Foust:  I will say it’s definitely the trend and if you look at our fourth quarter leasing, you’ll see that trend on leases executed much more toward 50/50 in terms of the data center space between turnkey and powered base build out.
Bill Stein:  It’s heavily weighted [unintelligible] and I could give you a percentage.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  And you were nice enough to give the GAAP revenue numbers, do you care to provide what the cash number is?
Bill Stein:  By the way it’s 85% turnkey of the 500 plus.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  And actually as far as thee expenses go, that’s just a normal building expense right of roughly a $10 per square foot number?
Bill Stein:  For the turnkey?
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  Yeah.
Mike Foust:  On a per square foot basis annual?
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  Yeah.
Mike Foust:  Well no for the turnkey you’re going to see operating expenses higher. Now that might be, the $8-$10 would be your taxes, insurance, cam, your traditional real estate and then if it’s turnkey that we are operating for the customer, then you’re probably going to see probably another $20-$25 on top of that per square foot annually to cover managing the space, the preventative maintenance programs, you know that sort of thing, staffing. Now you know you’re also getting rents you know that are $150-$180 a foot for that.
Frank [Greywitt] – [Reeve]:  Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question is a follow up from Michael Bilerman, please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Yeah, Bill the $37-$38 million, that’s an annualized number or that’s just for the full year?
Bill Stein:  That’s the expected contribution for 08 so it’s not annualized. You know I’m going to hedge a little bit on that because these, that amount is going to be a function of when leases commence and that’s a function of when projects are delivered.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right, so thinking about this from another perspective, you walked [out] through $95 for 80%, $85 for 6% and then the 14% balance at $70, so let’s say the weighted average is sort of in the mid $80’s gross revenue. Does it effectively go down to the 70% margin to NOI? Is that a fair sort of number to start running for this 530,000?
Bill Stein:  You’re doing a blend or just on turnkey?
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: On the blend on the 530,000 space that will contribute $37.5 million of revenues this year, what does that drop down to the NOI line? I mean is fair to assume a 70% NOI margin on that space?
Bill Stein:  Yeah, it’s close enough.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And then from the perspective you talked about that $290 million of capital that’s been invested in redevelopment, development and land today, how much of that $290 million relates to the 530,000 square feet?
Bill Stein:  By the way, that at year end and I think that would be virtually all [for] 530 because it’s construction work in progress. So none of that stuff’s been delivered.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: But don’t you have, don’t you have land, other money that you’ve spent on development that would be in the $290?
Bill Stein:  That part’s separate. You know there may be some of that $290 may be for space that doesn’t have signed leases but I’d say most of it is. Just given you know when you look at the…
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: But you also had I mean if you look in your supplemental page 26, the redevelopment space under construction in the quarter, the 637,000 square feet. I thought in a previous response you said the 530,000 is not part of that? So wouldn’t that have costs associated with it in the $290 million?
Bill Stein:  Well that’s space under construction in the quarter.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right, which I thought was separate from the 530,000 square feet of leasing, of leases that are going to commence. I just don’t want to make sure we’re, you know, I don’t want to keep on double counting and I want to make sure that we’re parsing it out right and really get a clearer picture of what.
Bill Stein:  Well I think that the 530 is space that’s included in the signing on the quarter that will commence in the year.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right but then it’s all coming out of the redevelopment square footage. And this says there was 637,000 square feet under construction in the quarter. Is the 530 in there or it’s not in there?
Bill Stein:  It is, you can see it on the page 26.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: So this turnkey data, this 533 is what we’re talking about now, turnkey data center, doesn’t include any of the built to suit?
Bill Stein:  Well there is one, well. Some of that, so within the 637 that’s under construction, you know there’s, let’s call it 100,000 that doesn’t have signed leases I think would be the best way to of looking at it. Clearly the built to suits are signed so within the 533 there’s 100,000 that’s sort of unaccounted for at this point.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And then if you do the math, your return of the $290 relates to the 533,000 square feet and you take an $85 revenue number and you put a 70% margin, your return would only be about 11%. So what am I missing, how does that not compare to the 15 plus returns that you’re talking about?
Mike Foust:  A couple of those projects are build to suits for Aircom, build to suits for a couple of our smaller spaces. Now the Aircom build to suit, you know we’re probably looking more at you know 10-11% on that one for example.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: But the built to suit is not in the 533,000 square feet, I thought the built to suit was…
Bill Stein:  The built to suit is in it.
Mike Foust:  The Aircom is.
Bill Stein:  All of the signings are in the 637 and clearly when you talk about build to suits of 103, those are all signed leases.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right.
Bill Stein:  So really we’ve got 100,000 roughly of…
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Turnkey data center space.
Bill Stein:  Turnkey that we don’t have signed leases, I think that’s the best way to think about it.
Mike Foust:  Yes, yeah and I think it’s like 98,000 feet.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: So then if you think about 100 being in sort of the you said what the 10% range? The balance of that square footage should give the returns, you’re saying underwriting close to a 15%?
Mike Foust:  14-15%, yeah.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay so there must be some other things in the $290 million that don’t relate to the 530 I guess is what it comes down to?
Bill Stein:  Well for example I think, I think [Wellen] would be in that number which you know doesn’t commence until 2009.
Mike Foust:  Because we have engineering costs, A&E, engineering which are very high and the land acquisition which was a pretty substantial number for and that’s the HSBC build to suit.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right. And then when you’re saying you were capitalizing some of the op ex, you’re also capitalizing the interest so when most of this 530 comes on, bring on the revenues and then start charging you interest on the space, on the capital that you spent.
Bill Stein:  You’re saying operating expenses?
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And the operating expenses. You talked about the Cermak, the property taxes and the benefit that you got. Was there any offset, how much was that gain and was there any sort of negative offset to that benefit in the quarter?
Bill Stein:  Negative, it was, some of it was passed through.
Mike Foust:  So I think about two-thirds fell to the bottom line for us.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And there was nothing else negative in the quarter that would have taken the numbers down?
Bill Stein:  No, I mean that took numbers up actually because that reduced operating expenses.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right so two-thirds and it was about $3 million?
Bill Stein:  Yeah I mean I mentioned in my remarks that we had an initiative that we started in the year picked up in the fourth quarter for a new maintenance contract in our turnkey data centers. That added some expense line item.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from [Shri Anaka], Oppenheimer, please go ahead.
[Shri Anaka] – Oppenheimer:  Yeah, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. A couple questions, yes could you talk about the demand environment out there, I know you guys had you know this not being a whole lot of impact with respect to on the from the macro concerns but has there been any changes with respect to the verticals that you’re seeing in demand during the past six months or during the past one month. And my second question is about pricing.  You know I’m just trying to understand the difference in pricing that you guys disclosed here on a per square foot basis. If I’m seeing the rental rate per square foot for power based or turnkey data center space that has been commenced during the quarter as opposed to that have been signed during the quarter, it appears that the pricing per square foot for the ones that have been signed is slightly lower than what has been commenced. You know am I reading this correctly or you know what exactly is the difference there? Thank you.
Mike Foust:  Well I think you’re seeing snapshots in time with different product in different markets so I think it’s helpful to look at kind of the trend over the entire year and if you look at where we are with leases that were signed in the quarter, you know that could represent some space that’s in markets where we’re getting low 30’s offset by markets like Northern New Jersey where we’re in the low 40’s, so it’s kind of more of a timing market by market. But overall, you know we’re seeing that significant uplift where markets where we were maybe in the low to mid 30’s today were in the high 20’s a year before. Markets like Northern New Jersey where we’re in the low 40’s with our latest deals done. A year ago we were in the low 30’s. So it’s kind of more the mix of the specific spaces that are coming on line at any one time.
[Shri Anaka] – Oppenheimer:  Got it, what about on the demand front?
Mike Foust:  Oh yeah, well you know it’s really interesting, we’re seeing a lot of demand from a variety of verticals, content distribution, social networking represented by Facebook and expansions of CBS, are quite strong. The system integrator IT services companies, you know folks like Computer Sciences and some of the other major companies that we have in our pipeline with whom we’re working. You know the increase Savvis portfolio and their absorption and then interestingly we’re seeing a lot more inquiries over the last three or four months from financial services. And I think that’s being driven because a lot of the applications are regulatory requirements, a lot of companies are still trying to catch up from believe it or not, Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC requirements that were promulgated a couple years ago.  There’s a lot of trading applications that we’re seeing, both from Wall Street and Chicago based and London based financial institutions where you know securities trading, commodities trading are coming online. And we’re also seeing some grid computing applications for Wall Street firms that are looking to expand their risk management computational capability in this environment that’s driving need for more space on the data center side. So you know we’re seeing some other corporates too where in light of reducing headcount, they’re making further investments in their data processing capabilities and increasing productivity in that way. So you know it’s interesting to see that you know there’s a lot of ways that companies may actually be saving money through expanding their data centers and through outsourcing to Digital Realty.
[Shri Anaka] – Oppenheimer:  Got it, just one other question. Could you talk about how many bandwidth providers on an average do you have in some of your turnkey data centers and how important is that to customers who are signing up with you apart from power?
Mike Foust:  So when you look at our internet gateway portfolio and those are the building that are the hub telecommunication network locations for a city, for a region. And there, the large number, the 30-40 carriers or more in a particular building such as 350 Cermak, another good example would be 2323 Brian Street in Dallas, 600 West 7th in LA, 200 Paul Avenue in San Francisco.  I mean those, that high density of carriers creates a very interesting value proposition for customers both other carriers as well as corporate trading platforms and the like. In our standalone corporate data center facilities, typically two to four carriers is sufficient and desirable. So there is redundancy and some pricing power on the part of the customer. Where you really get the unusual situations which are the internet gateways, you know those are very high value added for the customers and for our pricing.
[Shri Anaka] – Oppenheimer:  Got it and is that a major driver for customers to come and co-locate in your data centers or you now do they really care about it or no?
Mike Foust:  They definitely care about it and we’re seeing you know reflected in premium pricing that we have you know especially in places like 350 Cermak and 200 Paul Avenue, even in Dallas, because being able to access you know directly without going through third party carriers is pretty attractive and for some of these very low latency applications, such as someone who’s creating applications, it’s very desirable.
[Shri Anaka] – Oppenheimer:  Great, thanks so much.
Operator:  Our next question si a follow up from Jordan Sadler, please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Just one point of clarification again, sorry to beat a dead horse here on that 530. Do you have a capital number that ties back to the 530,000 feet, what the total cost of redevelopment was?
Bill Stein:  No, I can’t give you that right now.
Mike Foust:  I mean we do but we don’t have it aggregated that way.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay, I assume interest was capitalized on that 530 throughout the full fourth quarter on the cost of it? There’s, all the full capital that was spent and that remained in construction work in progress.
Bill Stein:  Interest was capitalized yes to the extent that construction work was done. Some of these signings might have occurred later in the quarter and at that point we might have started construction on our projects, so that’s why it’s hard to say.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: At what point do you stop capitalizing on redevelopment space?
Bill Stein:  At commissioning basically, [unintelligible] occupancy so but you know the commissioning of the data center is a fairly elaborate process.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Do you not have the flexibility to kind of hold that over for a little while until or is there any wiggle room there or are you kind of as soon as it receives the full CO or commissioning it comes off the capitalization ticker.
Bill Stein:  Not really, we don’t. We’ve taken a conservative approach here on capitalization of interest [unintelligible] operating expenses.
Jordan Sadler – Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  This does conclude our question and answer session, I’d like to turn the call back over to Michael Foust for concluding remarks.
Mike Foust:  Great, really appreciate everyone’s interest and the good give and take on the call and as always we’re available for follow up and just want to continue to emphasize that we see ourselves in a very strong demand environment for our product and a little but unusual relative to some other areas of the economy but I think our product does create cost savings and efficiencies for companies and helping with productivity. So thanks very much everyone.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Digital Realty Trust’s fourth quarter 2007 earnings call. ACT would like to thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.
