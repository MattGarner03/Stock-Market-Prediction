===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-30 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: You may begin. Welcome to Essex first quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover highlights from the quarter, our near term outlook and provide an update on the investment market. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We reported a healthy first quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Additionally, we are pleased to start the year with $345 million in acquisitions in Northern California, which were funded by dispositions in Southern California. This reallocation into higher rent growth markets and further optimization of our operating platform will enable us to generate above market returns. Turning to operating highlights. First quarter results trended slightly ahead of plan with 2.8% blended net effective rent growth. And new lease rates improved sequentially from the fourth quarter for the same property portfolio. Two key factors contributed to our performance. First is delinquency improvement to a level close to our historical average, mostly driven by Los Angeles, where delinquency improved to 1.3% of scheduled rent compared to 3.9% for the same period last year. Second, we executed our operating strategy, which contributed to a notably low turnover rate of 35%, while achieving positive new lease rate growth and stable occupancy levels. Great job, Team Essex, on these accomplishments. From a regional perspective, in the first quarter, new lease rates turned positive in all three major regions, led by Northern California at 1.5%, Seattle at 1.3% and Southern California in last place, as expected, at 20 basis points. On a more granular level, San Mateo led the same property portfolio with 4.8% and Oakland lagged with negative 1.2% in new rate growth, primarily due to elevated supply. Fortunately, Oakland has begun to demonstrate incremental improvement as supply abates and concessions moderate. Moving on to the full year outlook. With our solid performance today, under normal circumstances, Essex would consider revising our guidance upward. But lack of clarity on the US and global trade policy have led to macroeconomic uncertainty, including the impact on business investment and job growth. As we navigate this complex environment, we will be nimble with our operating and investment strategy, remain focused on our objective to maximize revenues and to generate long term accretion. Ultimately, the West Coast multifamily fundamental is well positioned for a wide range of economic outcomes. Total new housing supply delivery as a percentage of stock in 2025 is exceptionally low at only 50 basis points in the Essex markets and is expected to moderate throughout the year and to decrease further in 2026. Accordingly, rents should continue to grow even in a low job growth environment. This downside protection is a key reason why our supply constrained markets have outperformed over multiple economic cycles. Furthermore, the cost to own versus to rent remains prohibited at over 2.5 times more expensive. Overall, we remain excited about our portfolio's growth potential as our markets continue to lead in innovation, which provides a solid foundation for economic growth. Concluding with a transaction market update. Deal volume in our markets was higher in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, totaling $2.5 billion with cap rates consistently in the mid to high 4% range. With the onset of broad market volatility in early April, we have limited data points as to the impact of cap rates from ongoing policy changes. However, several deals in our markets have recently been awarded or had contingencies removed, and the valuations have remained consistent with what we've seen over the past year. Our year to date transaction activity has been balance sheet neutral, where we have allocated capital into newer assets in submarkets with the best supply demand fundamentals and rent growth potential. We look forward to more opportunities to continue our expansion and enhance accretion for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter results and full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report first quarter core FFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.05 There were three factors that led to this outperformance. First, our consolidated portfolio performed ahead of plan, primarily driven by same property revenues, which grew 3.4% compared to one year ago. This was 40 basis points ahead of plan, driven by lower delinquency and higher blended net effective rents. Second, our co investment portfolio exceeded our forecast due to better NOI growth from our joint venture properties and higher preferred equity income. And third, interest expense came in favorable to our forecast. As for our full year outlook, we are reaffirming our same property growth and core FFO per share guidance ranges. While we have gotten off to a solid start to the year and are trending slightly ahead of plan, we felt it prudent to further into the year before making any adjustments to our forecast given the heightened economic uncertainty that has recently developed. In regard to the cadence of same property revenue growth at the midpoint, we expect the first quarter will be the highest growth followed by the fourth quarter. The second and third quarters are expected to be our lowest year-over-year growth due to tougher delinquency comps compared to the prior year. Turning to investments. We've made progress on our growth strategy year to date, while match funding these investments on a leverage neutral basis. While these investments are net neutral to our 2025 FFO forecast, they further position the company for long term outperformance. We'll continue to remain disciplined as we seek further opportunities to deploy capital, utilizing the most attractive capital sources available to maximize core FFO and NAV per share growth, while preserving our balance sheet strength. As it relates to the preferred equity portfolio, we received around $27 million in redemptions so far to date. One of the redemptions was on our watch list that we stopped accruing on over a year ago. Since we were fully redeemed on our investment, we realized $1 million in incremental interest income this quarter that won't repeat next quarter. As it relates to the rest of the year, we expect the remaining $125 million in redemptions will be split evenly between the third and the fourth quarters. Lastly, a few comments on the balance sheet. We are pleased to have refinanced the majority of our 2025 debt maturities earlier this year with the unsecured bond offering in February. Overall, our balance sheet remains a source of strength and has proven durable throughout all economic cycles. With minimal refinancing needs remaining in 2025, access to a variety of capital sources and over $1 billion in available liquidity, we are well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Thanks.
Nick Yulico: First question is just on in terms of the guidance, I think the original guidance for the year assumed some modest acceleration on your blended rate growth in second half versus the first half of the year. Can you just talk about sort of the confidence level today of still achieving that? And if you didn't get that, kind of where it puts you on the range for the year?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Nick, it's Angela here. Thanks for your question. And yes, you're correct. Our original assumption includes a slight increase or incremental increase in the second half. And our current view is that relationship should remain intact. And keep in mind that we didn't revise our guidance. So what happened here is that first quarter we outperformed. And the rest of the year and when you look at our second quarter blended lease rate growth, it looks more incremental and it looked like maybe we had some concern. But it's really a function that the first quarter outperformed and we did not change our guidance.
Nick Yulico: And then second question is just on tech. It's something that comes up a lot from investors in terms of the impact on your portfolio. There has been some headlines and concerns about tech sector not growing jobs the way maybe they have been they may not grow going forward. Just any perspective, clearly, it's not your entire portfolio, but any perspective on that and any trends you're seeing on the ground related to tech?
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. Now that's an important data point that we track closely. And when we look at the third party reports, what we're seeing is that the opening jobs of the top 20 tech companies, that's the most meaningful indicator of the health of that sector, has remained steady and incrementally increasing each month. So it troughed in around November, December, but that's typically seasonally low period. But since then, every month it has increased. And that gives us an indication of the hiring to come. And if we were seeing any softness there, we would have seen either plateau or a decline, and we're not seeing that.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citibank.
Eric Wolfe: Could you just talk about your occupancy strategy in the second quarter? I think typically you push a little bit more on rate and let occupancy come down a bit. Just wondering if that's also the case this year or if you're trying to be a little bit more conservative than normal given the current environment?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, no, that's a good question and a good observation on how we think about the business. What we're seeing right now is that our occupancy strategy is consistent with our approach as we head into the peak leasing season. But it's going to be nuanced as it should be. So for example, in April, we are pushing occupancy in Northern California. In Seattle, it's transitional. It depends on where you are because supply in Seattle is heavier in the first half. We're talking about 60% of the delivery. And then, of course, Southern California, we are not I'm sorry, Northern California, we're pushing rent, not occupancy. Seattle is in transition. And Southern California, we are still holding or focusing on occupancy, mostly because of two reasons. Southern California peaks later than Northern region. So naturally, that would mean that you start pushing rents at a later point in time. But also Southern California, over 60% of the supply is occurring in the first half. So that is going to ebb and flow as we see the market conditions. But once again, what we're experiencing now in the ground is consistent and the fundamentals are solid.
Eric Wolfe: So I guess in aggregate in terms of sort of the demand statistics that you look at and the important things you look at and thinking through sort of forward demand, whether that's renewal rate or your exposure, like all of that looks relatively normal for this time of year? Basically, there's no signs like of incremental winking since we had sort of the tariff announcements or other announcements that have come over the last month?
Angela Kleiman: No, we haven't seen any signs of weakening or cracks. And the tariff announcements have not had any impact. What we're trying to anticipate is all the different policy changes, what does that mean for the rest of the year, which is why we've taken a more cautious approach on holding any revisions to guidance until we have better visibility. But it's certainly not because of any concern with what we're seeing on the ground in our markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
Sanket Agrawal: Please go ahead. Hello, this is Sanket on for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question around blended net effective rate growth assumption that you guys have given for second quarter and it just assumes like 20 basis points of acceleration at the midpoint. Can you help us think through that? And also what are the new lease rates you are achieving in April you have achieved in April and May and renewals as well?
Angela Kleiman: Let me make sure I'm asking or answering your question. You're talking about our second quarter blended of 3% and how we thought about that. Okay. And then, of course, new lease rates. So as far as the second quarter blended lease rates guide of 3%, that is consistent with our original plan because we have not changed guidance. And so I understand that it looks like, oh, there's not that much acceleration because first quarter landed at around 2.8%. But keep in mind, our first quarter guidance was 2.5%. And so we had expected or planned for 50 basis points acceleration. And so the incremental increase, it's once again not because we have a different view of what we're seeing on the ground. It's really, we outperformed in the first quarter, and we have not changed our guidance. As far as where new lease rates are landing in April, it's consistent with plan. It's consistent with what we saw in around March. And there's nothing there that's unusual. Makes sense?
Sanket Agrawal: And can you give us some color around what renewals you are able to achieve in April and what are your prospects for renewal rates?
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. So renewals, once again, very steady. In April, we send out renewals in the low 4s, landed around high 3s, so once again consistent with plan.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Angela, there are third party data providers out there that publish information on how the different companies, different regions are doing. Do you guys participate in helping those entities get their information? Or are those entities merely scraping data off your website and thus you have no control over how they're aggregating their data or how it's being processed?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, it's a good question. We have absolutely no control over what gets published, and we do not participate in what the third party providers generate. Okay.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then the second question is, in Sacramento, they're debating trying to rein in Sequoia to encourage development in the urban areas. Just sort of curious your take on this AB-609, if it seems like finally Sequoia could be reined in and we could see some improvement in investment or if there look to be some workarounds where Sequoia will not relinquish their power and thus remain the inhibitor that they've been?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, Alex, we view that trend as a positive, it's going the right direction. I think it will take time for these policies to ultimately get to where they need to go. And I do think that the legislators recognize that regulation does not solve the housing crisis. In fact, it's been proven that regulations actually make things worse. And it's really not tenant advocacy as they think, it's really anti-growth. And so once again, we're pleased that these conversations are being discussed. We're pleased with that California has begun to move toward a better environment and heading the right direction. We just need to see how this plays out in the end and how long it takes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks. Maybe just digging in a little bit to the initial assumptions, I think the 3% market rent growth was comprised of Seattle and San Diego being close to 4% range. I'm just curious, I know it's still early, but how are kind of the respective regions or markets tracking, which are tracking a little better and are any tracking a little worse at this point?
Angela Kleiman: Thanks. Hey, Austin. Generally speaking, the Northern California, especially Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties and parts of Seattle are leading our portfolio performance and that's consistent with our expectations. And Southern California is softer, especially LA. And so we're talking about range of possibility. You can safely say that the submarkets I mentioned in the Northern region are maybe slightly toward the higher end of our range and Southern California, particularly LA is toward the lower range and averaging out to be about the same spot where we will ultimately land.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then given you guys typically tie your renewal rent growth pretty close to your view on market rent growth, and I think you referenced renewals are still coming in kind of in that mid to high 3% range. Should that be sort of an indication of how market rents are tracking maybe relative to your initial expectation?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. And ultimately, if you look at our first quarter performance, which blended came in a little bit higher than expected, and that was in both cases, both renewal and new lease rates slightly higher. But it wasn't a huge acceleration, right? These were incremental benefits. And so I think in the current economy where we had originally forecast a moderating economy, it’s playing out that way, slightly better, and then you throw in tariffs in the mix, not sure what happens. But we do view that as far as our guidance is concerned, the downside risk is quite low.
Operator: The next question comes from Yana with Bank of America.
Yana: Good morning to you guys and congrats on the first quarter results. Angela, when you say you would have raised the guidance kind of barring the macro uncertainty, would you be referring to FFO or the same store revenue or both?
Barb Pak: Hi, Yana. It's Barb. It's really more on the side on the core FFO side. We do have a few items, like I mentioned, we got some preferred equity income this quarter that is one time that is real to the bottom line. So that's really where we would have focused on. I think on same store, we would have waited until more mid-year after we get further into peak leasing season.
Yana: Thank you. And then switching to transactions, just kind of curious if we should continue to expect to see some trading from Southern California to Northern California and if you're kind of continuing to potentially review any new markets?
Rylan Burns: Rylan here. Yeah, we're really pleased with the execution of our first quarter transactions and we'd love to replicate it. Obviously, we're making all of our investment decisions on an investment by investment basis and it's not always easy to do, but we're pleased with our first quarter transactions and to the extent that we can drum up additional opportunities to execute on that strategy, we will continue to pursue it.
Yana: Any comments on new markets?
Angela Kleiman: As far as the new markets are concerned, we of course continue to study other markets to make sure that we're making the best long-term decision. But at this point, when you look at the potential upside in our markets, especially with Northern California just starting its recovery, it's a lot more compelling than to go to markets where you have over 20% to 30% rent growth and with supply headwinds. And so for the foreseeable two to three years, it wouldn't make sense in terms of a trade, absent of course major distress that changes pricing. But based on what we're seeing right now, the majority of the upside is in our markets, and that's why we're so excited about our northern regions.
Operator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig deeper into LA, which sounds like it's slightly disappointing from your initial numbers. Can you just talk about what do you think is going on there? And then just thinking about the wildfire impact, any thoughts on what that's going to look like for occupancy rents and just kind of behavior patterns for people's housing needs since we're several months out now?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Jamie. LA is a huge county and it's more complicated than something we could easily dissect. But the big picture here with LA is that in order for us to see pricing power with LA, two things need to happen first, starting with delinquency recovery. Delinquency levels need to return to near historical average. Right now, we're making great progress, but we're not there yet. I mean, delinquency of 1.3% is still well above the historical average in LA. And so that's one piece. And once you get that delinquency close to the long term average, then we have occupancy, then we can build occupancy. And after that, you can have pricing power. So that's ultimately where we see the path to improvement in LA. As far as the market is concerned, labor market remains soft. And I think that is a lot of things happening there, I don't think that's too dissimilar from a national level in terms of just a generally soft employment economy. But the film industry has not yet rebounded. And we had hoped that the tax incentives that were implemented would revitalize their industries quicker. But obviously, we didn't plan for it. It was just something that would have been a nice upside for us. And it's just going to take more time. Okay.
Jamie Feldman: And then in terms of the wildfires, any kind of final thoughts on impact, whether it's central occupancy rent growth or just submarkets that are more or less in demand?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. The wildfire, it's an interesting situation in that the market does have a shortage of housing, but the wildfire impacted mostly single family homes. And these are high end single family homes and people are and a lot of the people there have other means and would want, say, a three bedroom or larger. So the unit mix really isn't conducive to what we have offering and nor are those types of customers would be our typical tenants. And so we really didn't expect to see a meaningful impact on either occupancy or otherwise in LA, and which is basically what has happened.
Jamie Feldman: So I guess, Rylan, with the new development start, do you think this is something we'll continue to see more now that you're seeing supply really drop off across the country? And then also the acquisitions that either you've underwritten or others have won, what are people underwriting in terms of growth? It seems like you got some negative leverage deals going on right now. Like what's the typical outlook?
Rylan Burns: Hi, Jamie. Yeah, I'm going to address those one at a time. As it relates to our seven South Wind and South San Francisco project, as you know, our development team underwrites, call it 100 sites a year and it's been over five years since we found a project that meets our return hurdles relative such that we're getting compensated for taking that development risk. We'd like to find more because when we look out a few years in the future and we see the supply pipeline, we do think there's a really interesting opportunity here, but we need to remain disciplined. And it's just challenging to find deals that really underwrite and meet our return thresholds, but we continue to look and we're hoping to backfill for others. As it relates to the transaction market, it depends on the submarket and we get some color from brokers about what other participants are underwriting and it's a wide gamut. But I would say consensus sentiment on NorCal has improved materially over the past year and we do think that we are losing out to some deals where people are getting a little bit more aggressive on the rent underwriting side. So trying to be prudent and take swings where we see a fat pitch. In the past month since April 2, there's been limited data points, but the feedback from the brokers and several deals we're tracking is that there's really been limited changes in terms of market participation. Several deals have removed contingencies or first term underwriting. It's been consistent with what we've year to date and over the past year. So we're tracking it closely and expect to be active in the second half of the year.
Jamie Feldman: Thank you for that. Can you quantify at all like some of the deals you've lost out on what kind of growth people are assuming?
Rylan Burns: There's a wide range. So I don't know if I can provide specifics as to what other people that are winning deals, but obviously some of these cap rates we're assuming that they're underwriting mid-single digit rent growth in some of these markets.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: On Oakland in the prepared comments, you said it started to show improvement. I think a lot of us had sort of given up on that submarket. I guess, do you think in the medium term that could turn into a positive contributor? Or what's the outlook over the next couple of years there?
Angela Kleiman: Brad, good question there. Yes, on Oakland, we finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. And Oakland, what we're showing is that 75% of the supply is delivering in the first half. So by midyear, we expect Oakland to start to revert back to a more normalized market dynamic. I don't think it's going to happen overnight, but it's finally going to turn. And we waited for a long time for this, so we're pretty darn happy about it.
Brad Heffern: Yes, okay. And then I saw you dusted off the ATM this quarter. I know it's not a meaningful amount, but I guess is that supporting development? Sort of why do that now? And how do you view the cost of equity right now in comparison to the opportunity set?
Barb Pak: Yeah, this is Barb. You're correct. We did a small issuance and when we issue equity, we need to have a premium to NAV and we do need to arbitrage not only the cost of equity, but what we're pairing up with on the investment side. And as you mentioned, we did start the development. We do have equity needs for that. And so we felt it prudent to take a little bit a few chips off the table and issue a small amount. But when the stock moved away from us, we stopped issuing. So we will be prudent and match fund for that development that we started.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Good morning. Barb, you gave the best and worst quarters, I think first and fourth, we're going to be the best on same store revenue based on delinquency comps. But I was wondering if you could provide the same metrics, best numbers of quarters on blended lease growth for this year?
Barb Pak: Well, the first half of the year, we expect to be at around 3%, and that's the same in the second half of the year. So we don't expect too big a deviation to hit our 3% rent growth, all else being equal. We do expect the second and third quarters will be the highest in terms of blended rent growth. So kind of the opposite from what we said on total revenue growth.
John Kim: And then maybe for Rylan. Can you just talk about the attractiveness of South San Francisco as a multifamily market? Will you be targeting workers in the area and therefore have a more corporate housing or higher corporate housing component to it? And how do rents in that submarket compared to others in the Peninsula?
Rylan Burns: We've done a lot of work obviously in the submarket, high level, close proximity to the largest biotech hub in the world. We do know that the three existing institutional grade apartments in that submarket do draw a lot of demand from that Oyster Point submarket, but there's a lot of people that commute up and down the Peninsula as well. So this is really targeting those types of workers, a little bit higher compensation that are looking for good quality of life, nice community, easy access to the city or down to the peninsula. And so rents in this submarket are comparable with some submarkets you see a little bit further down. There it's a higher rent market given the quality of this product and it's a discount to some of the higher quality submarkets within San Francisco. So again, we feel really comfortable with where we've underwritten rents today on a untrended basis. And we do think given limited supply outlook over the next several years, there is an opportunity for that rent to move.
John Kim: Will the product be different as far as more corporate housing or furnished apartments?
Rylan Burns: No, no, that is not part of our business plan.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time here. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the blended rate growth kind of cadence over the course of the year. You guys have been really helpful in providing the disclosure and the detail here. The 20 basis points acceleration, I think I have that right from 1Q to 2Q. How does that compare to kind of typical year or how does that compare to history if we go back even pre COVID? I don't know if you have those numbers in front of you. But just wondering kind of how does the cadence look this year compared to normal? What might be some of drivers here? Is there a bad debt impact here? Is there anything else that's kind of impacting the sequential cadence here?
Angela Kleiman: Adam. On the sequential, I probably wouldn't get too concerned about this 20 basis points delta just because I know that it looks like it's de minimis. And once again, I just want to reiterate, it's a function of us not revising guidance for the rest of the year. It's not a commentary or concern about Q2 or thereafter. If you look at our performance last year between first quarter and second quarter, obviously, the spread was larger. But first quarter last year was only 2.2%. So it's going to vary from quarter to quarter depending on market conditions. But I would encourage you to look at full year expectation. So if you look at our full year expectation of the blend is three at midpoint, it's not that different from what the sector is seeing in the market. And I think that's probably a more relevant number than these quarter by quarter or month by month variations.
Adam Kramer: No, that's helpful. And then just wanted to ask about this kind of commentary around kind of not raising the guidance, but feeling really good about the 1Q results. Mean, a little bit of a theoretical, I guess, conceptual question here. But if you're sitting here in 90 days, you have another good 2Q just like 1Q, what would you need to see from a macro perspective or some of these other things you track that could kind of give you the confidence that, to kind of raise at that point? What would kind of need to be different versus where you are today after a good 1Q?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, Adam, that's a good question. And so essentially, this conversation is really what are the range of possibilities. And if the conditions on the ground is consistent with what we had expected heading into the year, we certainly will have a higher level of confidence in raising. Now here are the variabilities. So for example, on something like tariff impact, we don't expect that to have too much of an impact on the top line, for example, because with low supply, we don't need a lot of job growth. But if there is a significant increase in material cost, which will have a direct impact on our operating expense, we're not seeing it yet, but that outcome depends on the timing of that policy and how it gets implemented. So that's why it's so difficult to predict. And you saw that I know a couple of people published and noted that we pulled our macro guidance on jobs. Once again, it's very opaque on that if we're looking at the BLS data. And so, for example, BLS just is not as reliable anymore. The participation has fallen. So pre COVID, survey participation was 60% of the company. Today, it's only 30%. And so which is why we started looking at other sources, other third party sources and trying to look at job hiring. So everything would point to that the market and the fundamentals are healthy and we certainly won't have reservations on raising, but for this pesky little thing on public policy and what that means on the expenses, which is why we wanted to just get another few months under our behind us to be able to set a number that we can really count on.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. In the prepared remarks, you said that ultimately the West Coast multifamily fundamentals are well positioned for a wide range of economic outcomes. Why do you think that? And do you see it better than other markets such as the East Coast or the Sunbelt?
Angela Kleiman: One of the reason for that comment is that the downside risk is lower in our markets and it's primarily because of supply. And when you have supply and you can see even within the quarter to quarter movements, while it's temporary, fortunately with our low supply environment, even if you have a large number that's coming, it only takes us typically a quarter or two to get through it. So in an overall low supply environment, you don't need that much job, which means we're not as reliant on the broad economy and the performance thereof. Relative to the East Coast, from obviously, we're looking at it from afar, so our peers will have better clarity on that. But New York seems particularly strong because it also has a similar low supply environment. Sunbelt is a little bit harder to sort out, right, because you have a much higher supply. And what that means is the job growth there is required in order for you to have pricing power. And so it's not a view that we don't like the Sunbelt, it's just a view that at this current environment, it needs a better macroeconomic performance, whereas we don't need that out here in the West Coast. The other anecdotal that I'll share with you is that we had talked about this return to office, and I had said you know, we were in the seventh inning and that there's not going to be, oh, extra innings. I don't know. Barb's looking at me because I kept calling overtime and that's the wrong analogy. In any event, so I would have to modify that in that we actually potentially could have more upside because my comment didn't anticipate companies changing their policy. And we recently learned that Google has changed their remote policy. They originally had grandfathered remote workers, and they have said they basically said, no, that is no longer available. And remote workers that have been grandfathered are getting eliminated, and hiring is occurring in our markets. And that, of course, doesn't show up in the bailouts or anywhere else as a new job ad. So frankly, at the end of the day, now we're looking at that there's more upside potential in our West Coast market relative to downside.
Michael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, have you seen any changes in migration for international residents or any changes in migration trends from domestic markets?
Barb Pak: No, we haven't seen any noticeable changes. We do track our international residents within our portfolio and it's less than 2%. So we have a small number of residents, but it's remained consistent. New move ins are consistent with prior years, and so no impact. What I would say on the migration front, what we've noticed is San Francisco and San Mateo have actually turned positive from domestic migration perspective in the last few months. And I think that goes to what Angela was talking about, Northern California region is performing slightly better than planned. I think that all kind of triangulates.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Looking at the development schedule, you have about $44 million of other projects. Do you expect to start any of those and where are they located?
Rylan Burns: Yes, we have a couple of other projects in the pipeline. I'd say they're still a couple of years away, but they are in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. So in the markets that we have the highest conviction in future rent growth.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then looking at the JV, the Westco joint venture has some debt maturing within the next two years. Will any of that occur this year?
Barb Pak: Wes, it's Barb. No, none of that is expected to occur this year. Some will occur in '26 and then the rest in '27.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Haendal St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good morning out there. A couple of quick questions from me. First one is on the looks like the mezz book asset you assumed full managerial control of in Oakland this past quarter. I guess, I'm assuming that's a fancy way of saying you bought the asset or exercised an option. So maybe you can add some color on the events that led to this. Was this something that was previously contemplated? And perhaps some color on the underwriting cap rate or IRR on that.
Barb Pak: Yeah, so this was the asset where in the fourth quarter we paid off the senior mortgage because the sponsor was going to default and we effectively stepped in and took back the property. We had stopped accruing on our preferred equity investment back in 2022 and impaired the property in '23. So we've got a long history. As we talked about, Oakland has been a market that suffered for quite some time. We do see light at the end of the tunnel though, as Angela said, on the supply side. So how we came up with the valuation though is we did a third party assessment on it. Our value at $95 million is around $390 a door and it's about 30% below replacement cost today. The yield is in it's low, it's in the mid-3s, but that's because we have assumed three months of concessions. And once those concessions burn off, we'll be closer to a 5% cap rate.
Haendal St. Juste : And then one more maybe on the conversation around capital recycling, selling some assets out of SoCal into NorCal given the better growth option outlook that you mentioned. I guess I'm curious how much more appetite there could be for that? How much more exposure perhaps you would want in NorCal? And how do you think about Seattle as another option for reinvesting capital?
Rylan Burns: I mean, as we've been saying over the past couple of years, we feel pretty good about the rent fundamentals in those northern regions. So we'd obviously like to skew the portfolio to capture that. Realistically, there's only limited transaction volume that you're able to participate in and or generate on our own. So we'd like to move that up by a couple percentage points if we could all else equal. But it goes back to the broader picture of us not doing deals just to do deals. This has to be FFO accretive over the long run. We're really focused on driving more durable and improving cash flows for our shareholders. So we are out there working to create that opportunity for us and in the current environment given really cap rate parity across the vast majority of our markets, we think that trade makes a lot of sense. So we're going to continue to actively pursue to increase in those markets that you mentioned.
Haendal St. Juste : If I could squeeze in one more, just curious on the loss to lease and maybe concession activity across some of your major markets. I'd love to get an update.
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. On the concession market, we've seen terrific improvement between fourth quarter to the first quarter. So fourth quarter, we're about one week. And in the first quarter, we're about half of that. And so April level compared to March is pretty darn consistent. And as far as the loss to lease is concerned, it also has continued to improve. So just to give you an example, for April, current loss to lease is about 40 basis points better than last year's level in April.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Good morning. So got the negative 0.3% GDP growth for the first quarter. So we're one quarter away to least a definitional recession should that turn negative as well. You mentioned how West Coast does better in tougher times because of low supply. But do you can you prove that? I mean, have you looked back at recessions and note that there's a very clear win in the West Coast, whether it's multifamily or anything, investing in the West Coast is the place to be if we are in a recession. Is that something you can provide or share?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. So Rich, the data that's available to all of us is the long term rent growth. And so if you look at the West Coast markets, and of course, every major region has a slight nuance, but the Northern region, the long term CAGR is higher than Southern California. For example, in Southern California mirrors the US with a slightly higher level. And so those are CAGRs that's available and proven out. But what I also want to mention as it relates to the potential recession in this year that's being talked about, tech, which is an important component to our portfolio, that industry has already retrenched. And it went through the major layoffs back in early 2023, late 2022. And so it's already repositioned and it's ready. And if you look at, for example, the '08, for example, or even during COVID, tech continued to hire. So, we do view that that's a good anchor for our portfolio and it's been proven through multiple cycles.
Rich Anderson: That's great color. Thanks, Angela. And then maybe for Rylan, the trade from Southern California, Northern California, you guys are sort of once removed from downtown, that's the model. But at what point do you start to look at some of the improving conditions in Downtown San Francisco and start to maybe dance a little bit more there than you do. Is that something that's on the radar? Or are you sticking to your sort of guns outside of downtown?
Rylan Burns: Rich, when you say at what point, we've consistently been underwriting all the product that transacts through our market and that includes some of the urban areas that you're referring to. We've only seen a handful of trades in San Francisco in particular and as it relates to the Northern California market over the past year or so. And it felt like a lot of that upside was already priced in. Those were transacting at pretty low cap rates. So we've seen better relative value in the Peninsula. But as I said, we're going to be looking all up and down our markets, suburban and trying to make the best risk adjusted return investments.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs.
Julien Blouin: Maybe digging in again in Los Angeles. I appreciate the comments you gave Angela around what needs to happen for LA pricing power to improve. But is there a scenario where things actually weaken from here, maybe due to tariffs, just given the importance of the ports to the local economy and employment in the region?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, probably as far as the tariff is concerned, it's probably going to be an impact nationwide on all the markets and more on the cost side than on the top line, on the revenue side. And it won't be an Alley specific situation just because our tenant base really isn't port driven. And frankly, the ports are so automated that it's not a - we don't expect the employment thereof to have a huge impact on the performance. Now, as far as the tariff impact, what we would expect that as LA specific, the potential offset or benefit is the improvement in delinquency. And so, at least it has that to balance the net impact. And what we're seeing right now as far as the impact on consumers, for example, if we thought that the tariffs would have a negative impact, we're certainly not seeing that because the overall portfolio delinquency has remained steady. And so people are paying and we're not seeing the consumer weakness that you would have thought if we're in a recessionary environment, for example.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Barclays.
Rich Hightower: On the West Coast I'm going to revisit, I think an often asked question on this call. But just so you can confirm or just confirm the way that I'm thinking about the blended lease growth numbers for the first quarter and the second quarter. You've done a good job, I think, sort of stating that the fact that you did not increase guidance doesn't really indicate anything about what you're actually seeing on the ground. It's really just more of a kind of a general risk overlay based on all the other things we've been talking about on this call. So is that effectively true where normally you did better in the first quarter than you thought, you're not seeing weakness on the ground, which would imply some sort of increase related to the second quarter? And so that's really kind of the way that we all should be thinking about it at this point?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, I think that's an excellent summary. And when I mentioned some of these statistics, for example, April lost lease, it's actually better than the same period last year driven by Northern California. And when we look at occupancy, it compared to- sequentially, it dipped a little bit, but it's also that's driven by Seattle because it was unusually high last year. It was 97.4%. So once again, we're not seeing any cracks on the fundamentals, and the business is in good shape.
Rich Hightower: That is very helpful. And then maybe a new topic that we haven't talked about on the call, but just on turnover, 35% in the first quarter, which was probably normal for the way you guys run the business. But if I'm comparing it to EQR is extraordinarily low, 8% number for the first quarter, that's an enormous delta. And so maybe just help those of us who are not in the apartment business day to day understand what sort of decision making goes into how you run revenue management in that context, just given the huge delta there that I think is just something that stood out to me?
Angela Kleiman: Rich, I think some of the confusion may be definitional. And so even, for example, how we look at lender lease rates is slightly is defined differently than some of our peers. And on lease rates, we look at 9 to 15 months like for like. And EQR, for example, they use all leases. What that means, you could have short term leases and that's going to change the numbers. So that's why I encourage people to look at full year and relative basis. So I do know that the definition is different on the turnover statistic as well. But as far as for our portfolio, 35% is a little bit lower than typical historical average. It's usually closer to the high 30% to maybe to 40% range. And right now, it's really a function of us. The goal is, as I said in the past, to maximize revenues. And we want to make sure that we are renewing in such a way that we can have and generate positive new lease rates whenever possible. And so if we look at our blended, we have really solid blended number in the first quarter of 2.8%. And which is- so turnover ultimately is an output number. It's not a strategy that is used to form an execution plan.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Segall with Green Street.
David Segall: Hi, thank you. I want to get your thoughts on Washington State's rent control proposal. And if you could kind of relate, how California similar rent control has impacted your operations and investment decisions over the last several years as kind of a guide for thinking about the Washington State proposal?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, sure thing. Obviously, legislation generally is not something that helps multifamily or housing cost. Doesn't achieve what the intention is or the misguided notion that it's going to somehow allow cost of housing to be cheaper. So it's too bad that Washington is taking this route. Having said that, this rent cap of CPA plus 7 max at 10 is similar to what we've seen in California. So we're obviously accustomed to operating in this environment. And we want, obviously, a little more time to assess the details to make sure we understand the full impact. Having said that, when California passed AB-1482, it did not have a meaningful impact to our business because Essex had a self-imposed 10% rent cap for many decades. I mean, I think since I've been here and well before I joined the company, and so that has not impacted our performance. So at this level, it's really an antigouging. And so it's we certainly don't expect an impact to our business. It's really just the intention of the legislature legislation. I don't think it's going to create the desired results that legislatures want.
David Segall: And then just finally on bad debt, you've made a lot of good progress on that. And I'm just curious like how what the timeline would be to finally reach full normalization? Would that be by the end of this year or probably more in 2026?
Barb Pak: Hi, David, it's Barb. Yeah, we're at 50 basis points in the first quarter. Our long term average is around 40. So we're not that far off from it. But yeah, I think by year end, it's a realistic possibility.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kim with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kim: I wanted to ask about kind of the lower turnover that you've enjoyed for this quarter as well. Just curious, is this a primary driver to the lower repair and maintenance expense as well? Just as part of that, have your expectations for this expense bucket changed for the full year at all?
Barb Pak: No, this is Barb. The R&M cost is lumpy from quarter to quarter. It really depends on what happened in the prior year, what projects were being completed and things of that nature. So the R&M cost, we still expect to be up 2.5% to 3% for the full year. The first quarter was just an easy comp that drove that, nothing to do with the turnover.
Alex Kim: Got it. That's helpful to note. And then just sticking with the expense side. If I remember correctly, you renew your insurance policy in December, and it looks like insurance costs still remain slightly higher on a year-over-year basis from 1Q '24. Could you talk through the prior expectation for being roughly down 2% for the full year and then again if there's been a change for insurance expectations?
Barb Pak: Yeah, you have a good memory. Insurance is still down 2% for the full year. There is other stuff in that line, primarily related to tenant litigation, and that was a little bit more elevated this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2024, which drove that number up 5%. That tenant litigation is lumpy and when we settle claims, it can be lumpy. So we do still expect the insurance premiums to still be down on a year-over-year basis. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that ends our question and answer session. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-05 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2024 earnings call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust, Inc. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman. You may begin.
Angela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex Property Trust, Inc.'s Fourth Quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks, and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. Before we begin, on behalf of the entire company, I want to express our condolences to those affected by the tragic wildfires in Los Angeles. While our properties did not incur any loss, my gratitude goes to the Essex team for proactively helping those displaced as we adopted several policies to ease the transition into new housing within our Los Angeles portfolio. As for our earnings call today, I will cover our full year and Fourth Quarter 2024 results followed by our outlook for 2025, and an update on the investment market. We are pleased to achieve same-property revenue growth of 3.3% and core FFO growth of 3.8%, both exceeding the high end of our original guidance. Our strong performance was the result of improving demand, including return to office and migration patterns, combined with attractive affordability and delinquency resolution by our hardworking associates. With this backdrop, we experienced a typical seasonal rent curve for the first time in several years. Additionally, we successfully shifted the company into growth mode, acquiring and consolidating thirteen properties at above-market yields. As for operation highlights, Fourth Quarter results were generally consistent with expectations. We achieved 1.6% blended lease rate growth, and concessions averaged one week for the same-store portfolio in the Fourth Quarter. On a more granular perspective, Orange County and Santa Clara County led the portfolio with 2.7% blended rate growth, while LA and Alameda counties lagged with 20 basis points of blended rate growth. In January, demand picked up in line with our operating plan, lifting occupancy by 40 basis points to 96.3%, and concessions improved to less than half a week on average. Turning to our 2025 outlook, detailed on page F16, consensus GDP and job growth is forecasted to moderate for the US overall but remain at a healthy level. The West Coast is well-positioned with improving economic fundamentals as job growth is forecasted to outperform the US after lagging in 2024. Job growth in the technology sector is the key driver of this outlook as we anticipate job postings to convert into new hires in 2025, resulting in better overall growth. Steady demand combined with a low level of supply deliveries at only 50 basis points of total housing stock and attractive affordability relative to home ownership leads to our base case forecast of 3% market rent growth. Seattle and San Jose are projected to lead the portfolio at approximately 4%. As far as the range of outcomes, the low end of our guidance is mainly attributed to policy uncertainty and timing of delinquency recovery. Our optimism for the high end of our guidance is supported by solid fundamentals and based on past precedent that tech job postings still have a runway to grow for this phase of the innovation cycle. It is notable that recent office expansion announcements demonstrate the intention that the majority of new hiring will be focused in headquarter locations, which favors the West Coast economy, particularly the northern regions. Over the long term, we see a path for the West Coast apartment markets to continue to outperform the US average with better job growth and wealth creation driven by centers of innovation combined with limited levels of supply growth. Lastly, on the investment market, in 2024, the West Coast experienced a meaningful uptick in volume, reaching a level close to the pre-COVID average. Although interest rates increased in the Fourth Quarter, there remains a deep pool of capital eager to acquire properties on the West Coast, and cap rates in the Fourth Quarter for high-quality properties remain consistent at around the mid to high 4% range. In 2024, Essex was opportunistic in its acquisition efforts, successfully generating significant accretion by consolidating joint ventures and acquiring several communities in close proximity to our property collections where we can enhance the yield on day one by operating these communities more efficiently. In 2025, we expect to be net acquirers again while optimizing our cost of capital. Our focus remains on being creative and opportunistic to drive FFO and NAV per share growth for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss our Fourth Quarter results, key assumptions to our 2025 guidance, followed by comments on the balance sheet. We are pleased with our Fourth Quarter results, which were slightly ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by higher income from our joint venture entities. As it relates to same-property operations, we saw a continued reduction in delinquency during the quarter, which improved to 60 basis points of scheduled rent on a cash basis. For the year, we've made substantial progress on the delinquency front, reducing our bad debt by over 50% from one year ago. As such, we are pleased to be in a position to fully eliminate the remaining accounts receivable balance during the quarter, which resulted in same-property revenue growth of 2%. Without this non-cash adjustment, revenue growth would have been 3.2% for the quarter. Turning to our 2025 outlook, same-property revenues are forecasted to grow by 3% at the midpoint. The key drivers of this growth are outlined on page S6. Continuing on with Angela's comments, stable economic conditions, low supply, and expectations for increased hiring among key West Coast industries lead to our forecast for blended rent growth of 3%. In terms of the cadence, we expect blended rent growth in the first half to be below the full-year midpoint and improve in the second half of the year as hiring accelerates and translates into increased demand for housing. Our guidance assumes a 50 basis points improvement in delinquency as we continue to make progress returning to that long-term run rate. Rounding out the remaining components, we anticipate a 30 basis points combined contribution from higher occupancy and other income. Moving to operating expenses, we forecast 3.75% same-property expense growth at the midpoint, a significant improvement from what we've experienced the past two years. The biggest factor driving this outcome is lower insurance expense. We renewed our property insurance in December and saw a small reduction in our premium as compared to the prior year. Regarding controllable expenses, we are forecasting growth of less than 3% as we continue to seek ways to enhance our operating efficiency. Putting it all together, same-property NOI growth is expected to increase 2.7% at the midpoint. As for core FFO, our midpoint of $15.81 equates to 1.3% year-over-year growth. The modest increase is driven by two factors, which combined represent around 2% headwinds to growth. The first relates to higher interest expense, primarily driven by the recent $500 million in unsecured bonds. Our guidance assumes we refinance this debt in the first half of the year, and given the current interest rate environment, the all-in rate is expected to be meaningfully higher than the 3.5% rate on the maturing bonds. The second factor is lower structured finance income as a result of redemptions in 2024. Our guidance assumes $150 million in redemptions at the midpoint, of which approximately 50% is expected to occur by midyear. As previously communicated, we expect to reinvest the proceeds into new acquisitions, which will offset a portion of this income and result in better NAV and core FFO growth for our shareholders over the long term. In total, the structured finance book is expected to represent around 4% of our core FFO in 2025, consistent with our target range of 3% to 5%. Turning to investments, the midpoint of our guidance assumes we acquire $1 billion in new apartment communities. As for funding, it will be dependent on market conditions and our cost of capital, utilizing the most attractive equity capital source available at the time and executed on a leverage-neutral basis consistent with our track record of disciplined capital allocation. Concluding with the balance sheet, the balance sheet and credit metrics remain strong, and with over $1 billion in liquidity and ample sources of available capital, the company is well-positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. And for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question is from Nick Joseph with Scotiabank. Please proceed.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Hi, Angela. I believe you said that the low end of guidance assumes some sort of potential regulatory impact, and I'm assuming that's in LA. I just want to be clear on that. And also, if you could provide what is the same-store revenue growth range that is assumed in guidance for LA specifically.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Nick. Good morning, and thanks for your question. Yes, legislation is an unknown factor at this point. It's a little too early to predict the outcome. And so as it relates to our guidance, we didn't factor that component into our guidance, but that's why we have a range. So a downside is contemplated if something gets enacted that's more extreme in nature. What we are aware of is currently there is an eviction moratorium being considered in LA, and a rent freeze proposal. And as far as the eviction moratorium is concerned, what we are hoping for is a more sensible approach, unlike what was enacted during COVID, and that the legislatures understand that eviction moratoriums are punitive only to housing providers and that they hurt policy for LA because it deters investments in LA and housing production in an area that already has an extreme shortage in housing. Because we all know that the best path to affordable housing is to produce more homes. And so that conversation is ongoing, and we are working closely with our organization to get better visibility on that at some point. As far as the rent freeze is concerned, Governor Newsom declared a state of emergency related to the fires that triggers the existing California law to limit rent increases to 10% above pre-emergency levels. And since there's already an anti-gouging law in place, which we also support, we're hoping that nothing more extreme will be passed. And so once again, that's the reason for the downside scenario, and that's what is related to the impact to the lower end of the range.
Nick Joseph: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Is it possible to get just a specific number for LA in terms of what's assumed for the same-store revenue growth this year?
Barb Pak: Hi, Nick. It's Barb. So for LA, we have assumed that it will improve from where we are in 2024. As you can see in our supplemental, we were at 2.3%. LA was very challenged in 2024 with low occupancy and negative rent growth. And we think that occupancy improves to a stabilized level of 96% and that rent growth is modest at about 2%. So that's what's baked in. No impact from the wildfires has been forecasted in our numbers. It was just we had assumed the market starts to recover from some of the eviction noise that occurred in 2024.
Nick Joseph: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Wolfe with Citibank. Please proceed.
Eric Wolfe: Hey. Thanks. As part of your guidance, you gave an expectation for 3.5% renewal rate growth through this year. I'm just trying to understand why it wouldn't be a bit higher given the low turnover you've been seeing. And I think you did about 4% last year with market rent growth. I'm just trying to understand how you came up with the estimate and why it would be lower than last year.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Eric. It's Angela here. It's a good question. And our approach generally has been to essentially be market appropriate with our renewal rates. And what that means is over time, you would expect the renewal rates and market rents to converge. Now it could be lumpy year over year depending on lease terms, the concessionary environment, and timing of the renewal cycle, which is why you saw we experienced a 4% renewal in 2024, even though the market rent growth was quite a bit lower. But net-net is that our focus has been and will continue to be on maximizing revenues rather than individual rates. And these renewal rates can be lumpy from year to year.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. And then you mentioned that you expect the second half to be better from a blended spread perspective. I don't know if you want to give sort of what you expect for the first half and second half. Sort of what gives you that conviction that you'll see that increased hiring trends? Obviously, you can look at the listings, but just curious what gives you the confidence that you'll see that incremental demand in the back half of the year.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. It's really a function of two factors. It's both demand and supply. And so as far as the cadence, we're anticipating that the first half to be in the high twos, so say around 2.75%, and the second half to be above the midpoint, you know, and below 3%, say about 3.3%, around there. And from a supply perspective, I think that's more straightforward, so I'll cover that first. We are anticipating that the first half delivery to be heavier. So when we look at our supply cadence, about 60% or so of the supply is coming in the first half. So that, of course, will impact our pricing power. And as far as the job growth, we assume that to happen in the second half because what we're seeing is the job postings that have been gradually increasing and have been steady. It takes time to actually hire. And we're also seeing that especially in the Bay Area, a meaningful number of tech companies have taken on office expansion. And just from the leases signed, if you just take the actual square footage, that would imply somewhere around 5,000 new headcounts. Well, that's not all gonna happen at the same time, and certainly, it's not possible for it to all happen, you know, or the most of it to happen in the first quarter because once again, it takes time to recruit and interview and put people in place. And so that is why we're assuming the second half, and of course, our conviction is coming from the leading indicators such as job openings and, of course, the office leasing activities.
Eric Wolfe: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah. Great. Thank you. Barb, Angela, I know you mentioned the one-half blends will be lower than the second half for the reasons you just cited. But I guess digging into that 2.5% new lease rate growth assumed at the midpoint of same-store revenue growth guidance, I guess, should we expect kind of another year of a gradual ramp into the peak leasing season and then kind of the shoulder periods being a little softer? And also curious in your market rent growth assumption, if any, or how much benefit there is from kind of, you know, I guess, a more normal year where you don't have long-term, you know, as many long-term delinquent units coming back to market. Just wondering if there's any kind of concession burn-off benefit in that number. Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Austin. No. That's a good question. We do expect the leasing curve to continue to normalize. So in 2024, it's the first time in several years we saw a normal leasing year. And so what we're expecting in 2025 is that it will continue. We haven't really seen anything else in the economy that would provide a meaningful disruption to that. And as far as, you know, our market rent is concerned, what happened last year is if you look at our actual market rent, it was slightly lower than our forecast. But that's really driven by LA and Alameda delinquency that created a lot of noise. And so once you factor that in, you know, we are assuming that that's now behind us, and the market rent curve is much more steady.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then just touching on the bridge from the Fourth Quarter result to the First Quarter guidance, you know, after you remove kind of the four-cent noncash charge, you know, in the Fourth Quarter you did $3.96 of core FFO in the 1Q, you know, guidance assumes that that dips. Yet you do have some reacceleration in the blended rate growth. You cited January occupancy pickup versus where you were in the Fourth Quarter. So I guess, you know, what's kind of driving that sequential decrease in core FFO? I'm just wondering if there are any items to highlight there. Thank you.
Barb Pak: Yeah. So there's really two factors. It's really timing on OpEx, so sequentially between the Fourth Quarter and the First Quarter, we're seeing a little bit more in OpEx spend. And then the other big driver is just higher interest expense as we have a higher line balance and various other assumptions in the guidance. So that's really the two key drivers on the sequential change in core FFO.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Steve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. I guess I just wanted to come back to that kind of blended number and really more of the spread between new and renewal. I guess many of your peers just have a much wider, I guess, delta between the new and the renewal. And I'm just wondering if there's something going on this year as it relates to the comps, and, you know, whether some of these renewals are turning into new leases or lack of renewals and there's more pricing power there, I just was a little surprised at the narrowness between those two.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Steve. It's Angela here. A good question because I think what is causing the variation from one company to another is really more related to the operating strategy. And, you know, for us, what we have been focusing on is bringing our renewal rates as close to market as possible. And, you know, we're sending these ahead of time, and there's some negotiating, so it's not gonna be exact. And because ultimately, if we price our renewals appropriately and run an optimal occupancy, then the new lease rates will benefit. And so, ultimately, that all relates to how we can maximize revenues. And so what that means is, you know, for Essex, the renewal and new lease spread will really, that range or the spread is really subject to market conditions. And in an environment where market rent growth is accelerating, that spread would be much wider. But in an environment where there's been prolonged moderate growth, that spread is going to be narrower. And, of course, there's other factors like concessions and timing of leases signed which, you know, makes it, I understand, hard for all of us to pinpoint exactly what the spread would be, but that's how we're running the company is probably driving the spread difference.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Again, other income for you guys is only growing ten basis points. I know for some of your peers that are doing more of this connectivity in the WiFi, that number is more like fifty, sixty, seventy basis points. So is there something kind of holding you guys back on that other income? Are you doing something differently? Or have you maybe not taken the same steps that they have to kind of roll this out and that's coming for you? We're just trying to understand that ten basis points.
Barb Pak: Yeah. Hi, Steve. So this is Barb. So, you know, there's a couple of factors that are at play here. So in 2024, we had some outsized what we would consider outsized lease cancellation fees, and we talked about that on our last call. And that, we think, moderates in 2025 to kind of a more normalized level. So that's muting growth a little bit on the other income side. And then the second factor is the full benefit in 2024. In 2023, we rolled out some initiatives and we got some benefit from that. And right now, we're piloting a few things. We're not sure we're gonna roll them out. We need time to vet to make sure it's really gonna pay off. And if we roll them out, it likely will benefit 2026. And so we're kind of in that piloting phase right now on a few different initiatives. So that's what's leading to that ten basis point growth this year.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you. First question, Angela. In your opening remarks, you mentioned the company is in growth mode. I know you've been talking about that the past year, but really, can you just dive into that a little bit more, the impetus and in terms of acquisitions, you mentioned cap rates are in the mid to high fours again. How do you plan to acquire as I guess, again, if you could just talk about that as well as maybe IRR expectations. Thank you.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Jeff. No. Good question. On the, you know, I'll just cover some high-level strategy and then turn it over to Rylan. As far as generating accretion, of course, in an environment where our stock price isn't as attractive, you've seen us do so in other ways. We can sell assets, obviously, that, you know, offsets the growth. But the growth of the company. But in terms of the growth of the portfolio, it actually will benefit that. And it would generate accretion. Because if you see what we've done is we acquired pretty heavily in 2024 in the northern region where we were expecting and have seen outperformance relative to the rest of the portfolio. At the same time, we sold a $250 million 1970-built property at an attractive value. So ultimately, you'll continue to see us transact in a way that is going to be accretive and as you're aware, we have multiple funding sources in addition to dispositions. We, of course, have some cash on hand from operations and joint venture opportunities. Rylan, you want to talk about returns and other stuff.
Rylan Burns: Yeah. Hi, Jeff. This is Rylan here. You know, I think market to high fours for well-located high-quality properties. I think, you know, the marginal buyer today is underwriting around an 8% unlevered IRR expectation, and we are obviously trying to do better than that.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. And then my follow-up is you mentioned that there was a pickup in January. Can you talk about that in a historical context? Was it a normal pickup that you see in January? Was it stronger than normal, weaker than normal?
Angela Kleiman: Oh, yes. Yes. This is consistent with our expectations. And so it's typical. You know, the occupancy pickup in January was all in Northern California. Which, you know, was what we had expected. Because that strength is finally starting. And when we look at just generally from a new lease rates, it also gradually improved as well. And so on all fronts, generally, it is playing out exactly as what we have planned.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So your portfolio tilts more heavily suburban, which has performed better since COVID given some of the challenges we've seen in urban submarkets. We're wondering if you expect the same theme of suburban outperforming urban in 2025, and maybe to put a finer point on can you talk through your views on rent growth in your urban versus suburban portfolios?
Angela Kleiman: Hi, Jamie. That's a quick question and a thoughtful one. As far as our portfolio allocation is concerned, we have favored the suburban location for a specific reason. Yes. From time to time, you know, a particular area might outperform for a short term, but our suburban portfolio is where all the major companies are located. So unlike, you know, the East Coast or even the Midwest, you have Apple in Cupertino. Google is in Mountain View. And Facebook in Menlo Park. And so, you know, these major hubs are not in the downtowns, and so that is a key reason why we have, you know, favored, you know, the suburban locations. But in addition to that, the downtowns are more challenging in terms of the quality of their lives. There's the homeless issue that still needs to be addressed. And, you know, I think crime is hopefully getting better. And so I do think that, yes, the urban centers should rebound, but we do not expect for those areas to outperform the suburban because they just have not done so over the long term.
Jamie Feldman: So can you quantify, I know you've talked a lot about, you know, your rent growth in the first half versus the second half. I mean, how would you compare your urban rent growth versus your suburban in your 2025 outlook?
Angela Kleiman: Oh, I don't have that final of a detail in front of me. We are expecting the suburban to continue to outperform the urban, but it's gonna vary differently. So, for example, downtown LA is gonna be very different than downtown San Francisco because downtown LA has more supply. And so I don't have that exact spread.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then maybe for my follow-up, I even think you had commented you've seen some office leasing in the Bay Area. Some expected rent growth in the Bay Area, but, you know, we've seen a major hiccup to the AI industry with DeepSeek. I'm just curious, you know, did you guys change your outlook at all for demand on that? Seems like the AI business will be in cost-cutting mode. Just, you know, how did that impact your outlook? How are you guys baking that into your expectations for a pickup in the back half of the year?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. We don't expect DeepSeek to materially impact the business. And now, first of all, you know, when we look at all the leases that have been signed, it's not dominated by AI. It's, you know, companies like Snowflake that's a data company. We have some fintech. We have some software companies. So it's pretty well diverse. But that said, as far as DeepSeek is concerned, we do think that ultimately more competition will spur more innovation and investments in this sector. And DeepSeek, you know, there's a disconnect between what they provide and what the end users need. And you still need these companies to come in and create products and tools on top of it for the end users. And so that business will remain robust as far as what we can see.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. Thanks for your thoughts.
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Obviously, a lot of political uncertainty right now, but can you talk about how you're thinking about the potential impact of shifts in immigration policy? And it would also be great if you could talk about how much of your demand comes from H-1B visas. Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hi. Yes. Immigration question is an interesting one because it can change from hour to hour from what we can see. But as far as the immigration part of it, fortunately, that's been pretty steady. In terms of how the administration has communicated their stance. Their focus has been on illegal immigration. And so we don't expect that will have a meaningful impact on our portfolio. Especially since we have a chronic shortage of housing at a level greater than the national average. And anecdotally, I think we've all heard of comments such as we want the best and the brightest. And so from what we gather, the administration is actually pro H-1B visa. And wants to provide a path for foreign college students to stay in the country. As far as our business is concerned in the past, we do have a small portion of tenants from H-1B visas. They tend to be more transient and they tend to double up more. And so once again, when they exited early on during the Obama administration, we didn't see any impact on our portfolio.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Barb, I'm looking at the 2025 core FFO walk on S16.2. You have a larger growth contribution from the non-same property NOI than you do from same property. Can you just go through that? I think potentially maybe the non-same property is being offset some by the interest bar, but just wondering why it's so large. Thanks.
Barb Pak: Yeah. The key takeaway there is the acquisitions that we did this year, and that's they, you know, we consolidated several JV properties and then we bought out others. So it's really that. It's the contribution. It's the big component of it. So there's a lot of movement within the financials from consolidated to or unconsolidated to consolidated. And that's what's driving that.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you. And I'm happy to go offline with you on more details if you need anything else.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask about it. And I think, Angela, you mentioned a pickup in January. Although maybe not so much in the LA region. And I guess just wondering first, you know, obviously, given these unfortunate wildfires and obviously thoughts with everyone there, you know, maybe just if there's been any kind of contribution to the portfolio, be it on the rate side or maybe more likely in the occupancy side in January. It seems like, again, based on your earlier comments, that's not been the case, but just wondering there.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Adam. We have not seen any increase in lead volume. It's not from the fires. I mean, we've seen inquiries, but the actual activities have not translated. It's really because what we heard was that these fire victims, they're waiting for clarity from the insurance providers before making housing decisions. So it's going to take a lot more time to work that through the system before it has any impact. And, you know, secondarily, in terms of the tenants that may be looking for new housing, the impact was mostly on single-family homes, and they're going to need larger units, multiple bedrooms, and so once again, I just don't see that as a huge impact in the near term.
Adam Kramer: Got it. No. That's helpful, Angela. And then just wanted to ask about kind of the same-store expense growth guide, maybe just taking the midpoint of it. If you can maybe just walk through the key drivers, their taxes, utilities, you know, operating expenses, just the kind of contribution to that overall expense growth guide.
Barb Pak: Yeah. This is Barb. So as I mentioned in my prepared comments, insurance is kind of the biggest driver of our reduction in same-store expense growth this year from 4.9% to 3.75%. Insurance, we expect to be down 2% based on our December renewal. That's a big reduction from what we saw last year. And then as it relates to real estate taxes, we do think that they're up a little bit from where they were in 2024. Even Seattle is a wild card. We do think Seattle may come in high again in the double-digit range this year. And then utility, there's also been the wildcard. We have seen outsized pressure there. And above inflationary increases, we think it still is elevated in terms of increases in 2024, maybe a little bit more moderate than what we saw in 2025 versus 2024. But, overall, real estate taxes, utilities, I've learned to about the same number next year in total. So core the non-controllable piece will be up about 4.5%, we think. And then the controllable piece will be up just under 3%. It's how we kind of get to our 3.75% blended number.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thank you, Barb.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning out there, and Rylan, congrats on selling a 76-year-old asset at a pretty surprising price. So well done. Just, Angela, want to follow-up on Jamie Feldman's question. On the urban markets and suburban. You know, the big narrative, and you guys have talked about it, that tech is trying to make a push to come back, return to office, and, you know, people, you know, the tech job openings and people coming back to San Francisco, Seattle. But you also made a comment about the urban areas still dealing with crime, homeless, and yet we hear positive things out of the changing political, you know, landscape with as a result of elections in both markets. So, you know, when you cut through it, how do we interpret a rebound of those two markets versus the comments that there's still, you know, work to be done? Obviously, I know stuff takes a while, but are the positive changes being implemented, like, is that real-time or that's the hope, but right now it's not much really has changed on the ground as far as quality of life, and that's why you still prefer, you know, the suburbs versus the urban.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Alex. Great question. It's really two things. One is that when it comes to talk and public policy, I think that's heading in the right direction, and we are hopeful that they can get there. But, you know, I think we've all experienced this, especially you went through this in New York. Once you have a political plan, then you have to set policy. And you have to find funding, and you have to implement it. And these things just, it just, it's not even a short term. It's a multiyear program. And so that's one of the reasons why, you know, our view is we are hopeful, but we believe it's going to take some time. As far as the rebound in jobs, and the, you know, and the expansion that's taking place by these tech companies, I'll share with you what we've seen. The leasing activities have all been in the suburbs. Snowflake is in Menlo Park. Robinhood is in Menlo Park. XAI and, you know, we have a couple of small companies that are in South San Francisco, which is great. But, you know, another AI company is in Mountain View. I mean, it's predominantly in the suburbs. Maybe one or two small companies in, you know, in close to the CBD, not San Francisco, but close to it. And so, and that's pretty consistent with historical patterns.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, just on the regulatory front. There's also, you know, the governor's actions with CEQA and the Coastal Commission, which I imagine both of those entities are very protective of their powers. As part of this larger conversation about rebuilding LA and accelerating the process, is there any discussion about, you know, dialing back the ultimate powers that both these entities have to improve construction, or is the view that this is a one-time alleviation of those rigorous, you know, sort of permission slips, if you will, and that once LA has rebuilt, those entities go back in full force.
Angela Kleiman: Well, Alex, I wish I had a crystal ball. I think, you know, what we're seeing right now is there's an interest and also the need to focus on a massive rebuilding effort that needs to take place. Having said that, how to go about it is complicated. As you mentioned, there are multiple agencies in play here, and I think, you know, what I think is people want to do the right thing, but everyone has their own process. And so I think it's gonna take a little bit more time to play out. As far as the approval process and the rebuilding process, you know, what we can hope for is that the legislatures are going to try to be more efficient. But keep in mind, you know, LA is a very large and densely populated area, and the economy is huge. And while these, you know, they're home lost, the jobs remain intact, and it's still in the LA area. The county is the largest county in the US with close to a trillion in GDP. And so we are optimistic that LA will figure itself out. And that, you know, they will benefit from the catalyst of growth with infrastructures and investments coming for the World Cup and Olympics and film industry tax credit. By the way, it's, you know, the Fourth Quarter is the first time we saw jobs in the film industry improve for the first time in several years. So these things do give us hope about LA.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Please check and see if your line is muted.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good there. So I guess the, yes. I'm here. So I guess my first question is on the development starts. Here. It first starts in about five, six years. Can you expand a bit more about the opportunity set you're seeing here in development, the markets you've a bit more focused on, and how we should be thinking about, you know, how you're thinking about yields, IRRs, and potentially, you know, appetite for where you might want to grow the development book to.
Rylan Burns: Hey, Haendel. Rylan here. So as you mentioned, we haven't started the development over five years because the risk-reward really just didn't make sense as you're all aware. It is very challenging to develop on the West Coast. And what we're trying to do at a high level, we're seeking with our limited capital to highest risk-adjusted returns. So we feel like we have an opportunity today. This is in a location adjacent to Oyster Point, one of the largest biotech hubs in the world. Land at a very low basis. Our costs are down in the high single digits from 2022. And the rents have started to show some momentum in 2024. So we are looking for at least a 20% spread to where we think we can buy, and we think we have that today on untrended rents. This project is projected to achieve a mid to high 5% cap rate, and that's with fully negotiated GMP and a healthy contingency buffer. And we think this project will stabilize in the high 6% range.
Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. Appreciate that color. I want to follow back up on a comment I think you made about concessions. You mentioned seeing some decline there recently, but I don't think your 2025 guide reflects any improvement in concessions this year versus last year. So maybe you can give us a sense of where concessions in the portfolio are today and whether it's fair to think this could be a source of upside with the demand improvement you're seeing in Seattle and San Francisco, where markets, I think, you've had a bit more concessions of late.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Haendel. That's a good question on concessions. Today, the portfolio is sitting at less than half a week, and that's an improvement from December of a little over a week. But having said that, normally, you know, you would see concessions tick up if we have supply deliveries in the slow season, like December, and which we did. We saw in San Jose and, of course, Seattle. And fortunately, San Jose, it's a smaller market in terms of the number of deliveries, and so it quickly abated. Seattle, the supply delivery is comparable to last year. And so we don't expect a meaningful change in terms of the concession environment. And in fact, some of the supply actually is moving to the east side where we have the bulk of our portfolio. And so even though I think Northern California will be better, there's an offset with Seattle. At the end of the day. So net-net, our concessionary position from year to year is going to be about the same.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
John Kim: Good morning. So your cash delinquency improved sequentially, but it looks like your gross delinquency went up. I'm not sure if the reported and gross is the same number. But I was wondering if you can comment on that. And then when you talk about the 50 basis point improvement for the year, does that include the impact of the accounting change?
Barb Pak: Hi, John. Yeah. As far as the reported this quarter does factor in the noncash charge for eliminating the accounts receivable balance. So that impacted the numbers this quarter, and it did show a slightly higher number than what we have been reporting. Cash, on the other hand, did improve from Q3 to Q4. So we're seeing that consistent pattern that we've talked about over the last couple of years. And then as it relates to the impact of 2025, we have assumed a 50 basis points impact to our guidance for delinquency, of which 20 basis points is related to the accounting charge in Q4, and we expect 30 basis points improvement on a cash basis. So for cash for 2025, we expect delinquency to be around 60 basis points, which is where we were in the Fourth Quarter.
John Kim: And remind us where it was pre-COVID.
Barb Pak: Pre-COVID, it was around 40 basis points. So we do expect for 2025 that the first half will be slightly above the 60, and then by the back half of the year, we'll be at that 40 basis points level. So back to pre-COVID levels.
John Kim: And, Barb, on the debt maturities that you have this year, can you update us on where you could raise ten-year unsecured notes today and what's incorporated in your guidance for the year?
Barb Pak: Yeah. So in terms of where the ten-year unsecured bond market is for us today, we're in the mid-fives. And unsecured debt is slightly cheaper than secured debt agencies that four or five-year papers around the mid-fives as well. So, you know, we do like the ten-year unsecured bond market. But when we go to look to refinance our debt, we'll look at all options to see what's the most attractive at that point. In terms of what's in our guidance, there's a variety of assumptions in terms of timing and rates in the numbers. So I'm not gonna go into that specifically. But where we are today is kind of consistent with where we were most of last year. We're kind of bouncing around the mid-five range for most of last year as well.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed.
Wes Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick question on the structured finance book. I think you said you have about $150 million redeeming this year. Do you have the timing of that? And then on a multiyear look, it looks like it has about 1.6 years of term for the just under $500 million of investments. Will most of that mature next year?
Barb Pak: Yeah. This is Barb. That's a good question. So in terms of the timing of the $150 million redemptions, we do expect about 50% to be by midyear. So most of that's in the second quarter. And then one maturity later in the year in 2025. And then in terms of that timing is obviously subject to some movement as a couple of our redemptions in 2025 are early. So sponsors are looking to term us out as, you know, getting permanent financing is cheaper than their construction loan. So some of those that timing does move around a little bit or could move on us. That's our best guess based on talking to our sponsors. And then in terms of the maturities, yeah, there is the short duration. A couple of them are maturing in the next year, but do have some extension options. So it may or may not get redeemed. It depends on market conditions.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then do you expect to invest more? I think you mentioned you wanted 3% to 5% of the business to be in the structured finance. Will you replenish this or just timing may not be right now?
Barb Pak: I think it depends on the opportunities. Right? So if we see a good opportunity that's appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis, we'll look at it. We haven't seen a lot of those. There is a lot of money raised for this product type, and so it's become very competitive. And so we focus more on buying hard assets. We think that's actually better long term for shareholders. So but it will be dependent on market conditions and what we see in terms of opportunities out there.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.
Rich Anderson: Hey. Good morning out there, guys. I'm just piecing together, I guess, a couple of comments made related to the broader transaction market. So Rylan, I think you said, you know, for high-quality products, you know, cap rates in your markets are maybe in the mid-fours. And if I heard correctly, agency financing perhaps in the mid-fives. So I just want to make sure that I guess that implies negative leverage going in. And maybe outsized growth, you know, as you kind of, you know, push the model forward. So is that pretty consistent with what you guys are seeing in the marketplace and just, you know, maybe a little more color on the transaction market in general.
Rylan Burns: Hey, Rich. Yeah. That's a fair question, and I think your assessment's correct. I think a lot of buyers, they are assuming negative leverage in year one and trying to solve for how quickly they can get out of it. You know, as it relates to the transaction market at a high level, there was around $16 billion of transactions in California and Washington, our product type in 2024 compared to $7 billion in 2023 and 2021 and two high water marks in the low 20s. So there was a lot more volume traded last year. It feels relatively healthy. There's a very competitive bidding process. Again for the product that I mentioned that we are targeting. So it feels healthy and it feels the bidder pool is deep. And we just came from NMHC where there was a similar message. There's a lot of capital out there looking to deploy and, you know, people are, I think, growing more increasingly optimistic about the West Coast. So that is the challenge for us in 2025 is to figure out how we can accretively grow despite, you know, the competitive market.
Rich Anderson: That's very helpful. Thanks, Rylan. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the insurance side of things. I know you said you, Angela, you said you renewed the policy in December, and so, you know, maybe in relation to the timing of the wildfires, you know, happening after that. But also before most, I think, other companies renew their insurance policies, Essex is in a little bit different spot there. So, you know, if you guys could maybe forecast out how you feel like the next round of negotiations and pricing might go later in 2025, on the other hand, you know, Equity Residential yesterday said they did not anticipate too much of an incremental impact to the way insurance gets priced based on the wildfires alone. So just, you know, help us understand how that might play out, as we think about even 2026 at this point.
Barb Pak: Yeah. Hi, Rich. It's Barb. So you are correct. We did renew our property insurance in December. So we're locked in for eleven months of 2025. So really, no risk on our insurance renewal to this year. It's way too early for us to see what the outcome will be. And, you know, we had no damage from the fire, so we're not actively in discussions with our insurance carrier on any claims or anything like that. So we'll just have to see how it plays out as the year goes on. One thing I will note is over the last two years, our insurance is up 50%. So we have, you know, we have seen a steep increase unlike in, you know, the residential home market where it was more limited. So that's the only comment I would make on that. Otherwise, I would say we'll know more as we enter the fall of this year.
Rich Anderson: Very helpful. Thanks, Barb.
Operator: Our next question is from Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Julien Blouin: Yeah. Thank you. You sort of touched on this a little bit earlier, but sort of Angela, you commented that Seattle and San Jose are projected to lead the portfolio to approximately 4% market rent growth this year. Those were also the markets where you would sort of previously warned about the supply pockets. I guess as you looked at the Fourth Quarter and so far what you're seeing in the First Quarter, how is sort of rent growth compared to your expectations? I guess what is sort of giving you confidence that those markets will sort of hold up this year?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Julien. On the supply landscape, as far as San Jose is concerned, what we experienced in the Fourth Quarter was that there was an uptick in terms of the supply delivery, which, of course, put pressure on rents for about two months. And then the supply got absorbed, and we are back to a normalized environment. And so what we expect is that to occur, but the difference with the northern region is that we see a stronger demand relative to the southern region. And that, of course, is going to provide, you know, pricing power in an environment where there's low supply. So even though you have supply delivery, it's gonna cause some interim disruption, but it's not permanent. And similarly with Seattle, what we're seeing is the supply delivery, the level is similar to 2024. And what we're expecting is that the cadence to occur in the first half of the year, which is much better than the second half, because when, you know, supply delivery comes during a period of strong demand, that absorption happens quickly, and the disruption is really minimized. It's when they come in December or November, then it lingers on and takes more concessions and takes longer to work through it. But all in all, net-net is that the economy and the fundamentals are quite healthy, and therefore, we expect, you know, these supply deliveries to be absorbed similar to a typical pace, and so there may be interim lumpiness from month to month. But overall, we are well set up for the year.
Julien Blouin: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And following up on John's question on bad debt, so the 50 bips of same-store benefit in 2025 excluding the noncash charge, it doesn't seem like you're sort of baking in much improvement from where you ended the year. I guess just wondering if absent eviction moratoriums, if we could see some improvement in the LA Alameda delinquency levels, which still sit above 100 basis points right now.
Barb Pak: Yeah. This is Barb. I think that's where we need to see the continued improvement. It's taken us the longest to improve LA Alameda. We've made a lot of progress in 2024, but we still need to make further progress to get us back to our long-term run rate. And so that's why we're not making as much progress in 2025 relative to prior years because we've made the vast majority of it already. So we think it'll be incremental, but we've had most of the tailwind already in the prior year.
Julien Blouin: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We've seen pretty good improvement in operating conditions over the last year with return to office, low supply, available affordability for apartments, turnovers, low. Yet we're still forecasting, you know, blended growth of 3% at the midpoint. This growth is off of relatively muted 2024. And this 3% growth is generally in line with kind of the long term, yet the conditions seem pretty favorable. So over the next few years, like, are we thinking about growth rates continuing to expand at really or is this kind of, like, as good as it gets given the favorable environment? Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hi. Yeah. No. That's a good question. We do see that the fundamentals will continue to build strength. And one of the reasons why it's more gradual and improvement this year is that the overall economy is moderating from 2024, and that's by consensus forecast. And so we can't disconnect from that too much. Now we do expect the West Coast to outperform, given all the fundamentals that, you know, we talked about earlier. And that is we expect that to build and to be gradual. So for example, you know, October was the first time that we saw job openings from the top 20 tech companies to reach pre-COVID average. And since then, it has remained steady. That's fantastic. But that's three months. And so you will want that to continue to build and gain momentum, and we are seeing that. So it's going to be more gradual for this year, and we'll see what happens in the following years.
Michael Goldsmith: That's helpful context. And just a quick clarification, are you assuming a normal seasonal curve of blended growth in the first half of this year?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. Our budget does assume a normal seasonal curve for the entire year.
Michael Goldsmith: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.
Rich Anderson: Thanks for hanging with me. So on the kind of the pie chart of the company, in terms of its geographic footprint, I wonder if you'd be leaning more into northern regions in light of some of the regulatory things that they've brought up in this call in LA and, you know, with President Musk, I guess, running point in driving tech potentially. I wonder if we could start to see your aggressive, you know, more offense on external growth, leaning more into northern areas and selling out of Southern California.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Rich. Glad you hang with us as well. On our investment activities, you actually saw that our activities in 2024. And it was heavily focused in the northern region and the Bay Area. And we, you know, that dominated our focus because really of the supply and demand and affordability drivers. It was the most favorable. You know, lowest supply relative to all the other regions, and, of course, with all the centers of innovation and technology companies expanding and growing and the Bay Area. Yeah. In recovery in the midst of recovery. So Southern California is growing rent by 20%, 30% since COVID, and Bay Area is still in the low single digits as an average. So it has the most upside potential, and you throw in affordability metrics, boy, it gets really compelling. And so our focus will continue to be, you know, in the northern regions really for the reasons that it has the most upside. If nothing else, just from the recovery. As far as the legislation, we've been dealing with legislation our entire lives. And so, you know, that in itself would not be a reason to significantly pivot from one region to another. And so when we're talking divestitures, which is, you know, you're asking us if we're gonna just sell out of LA, for example, we've approached it more property-specific rather than a particular city. We like all our markets. They have all generated above US average long-term returns. And so it's gonna be driven by asset-specific reasons. So for example, when we sold, you know, the $250 million asset in the Bay Area that Rylan talked about earlier, it was at an attractive valuation, and it was super, super old. So super duper. Hopefully, that helps.
Rich Anderson: Like, technical terms, super duper. The other, the second question for me is, on structured finance. It was said earlier today that redeploying the proceeds from the redemption would be NAV accretive. And you kind of said this, the shorter-term nature of structured finance is FFO accretive, but relative to fee simple ownership not as accretive to NAV. You mentioned also that you're targeting 4% of your business in structured finance for 2025, the selling point being if low. So if that's the case, then why doesn't that trend lower? Why don't you sort of step out of this business longer term? Or is there some reason why a rounding error amount of it in the portfolio matters to you, you and the firm? Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hey. Well, let me just provide you with a little context. You know, we got into this business at a time where construction costs were growing in double digits. And rents were nowhere near. And so preferred equity business provided a very attractive risk-adjusted yield and complemented our development pipeline because we had respectively stopped developing during those times. And that was really the primary thesis for being in that business. So it's not that we don't like the business. It's that over time, it's grown in such a way that, you know, it's lumpy. It's not as predictable. And it made sense to right-size that platform. But we still like the business, and having a small percentage of that also gives us additional visibility into the activities of the local developers as well and keeps us connected that way. So overall, it's still a decent business. But, you know, in terms of fee simple, I mean, I just, you know, went through the compelling fundamentals on the Northern California region. And so, you know, owning fee simple and having that durable growth to our NAV per share is really the key focus for us at this cycle.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks very much for that color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Teo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Teo Okusanya: Yes. Thanks for hanging in there. Just a very quick one. Barb, again, the AR noncash charge-off, can you talk exactly about why you decided at this point to charge it off? Is it purely an accounting thing where it needs 90 days or more? Or is there some particular reason why you kind of thought that AR was not going to be collectible going forward?
Barb Pak: Yeah. No. That's a good question. Let me just step back and give you kind of our history. So pre-COVID, Essex always had a cash policy. So if the rent wasn't collected in that month, we reserved against it and had no uncollectible revenue on our books. When COVID hit and we had unprecedented delinquency, in 2020, we accrued a small amount of revenues that we had yet to collect because we knew we would collect revenue over time. And that, you know, is not uncommon in the industry. I mean, most of our peers actually have some on their books. And over the last few years, we've slowly taken that accounts receivable balance down. And given where we are in 2024, given the improvements we've seen and, you know, we feel like this is all behind us, and we felt it was prudent to take the charge and just write off the remainder. And, you know, get back to our historical accounting policy of cash basis accounting on revenues. And, you know, that was always the goal to get back there. And, you know, four years later, we're finally there. So we're pleased with it. We're happy to be back there. There's no risk to the financials in terms of we've booked any revenues that we haven't collected. And so we feel good about our conservative accounting policy on that front.
Teo Okusanya: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question is from Alex Kim with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed.
Alex Kim: Hey. Morning out there. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your assumptions for renewals and market rents to converge. Is there any timeline that you're assuming for this spread to tighten? And then I guess, just with supply easing on a year-over-year basis in your markets, is there any risk, you know, into mid to late 2025 even in 2026 that this spread actually widens once again?
Angela Kleiman: Hi. No. That's a good question. It's tough to predict on timing just because it does relate to market conditions. So for example, if we see a much stronger demand than expected, we're actually, we get better market rents. What that means is that spread would then widen, you know, the renewal and new lease spreads, which is a great thing. Because that means we have, you know, more upside on our renewals. But as far as it relates to our base case, we are very confident in what we can achieve given the supply is knowable. And with this supply landscape, you don't need a lot of job growth to achieve our numbers. And so, you know, our view is that we are in good shape on that point.
Alex Kim: Got it. Thanks for the color. That's all for me.
Operator: And that is all the time we have for today. This will conclude today's conference. Essex Property Trust, Inc. would like to thank you for joining them for their Fourth Quarter earnings call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.
Angela Kleiman: Goodbye.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 13:00:00) =====
Angela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex third quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report our third guidance raise this year as a result of another healthy quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Today, my comments will focus on our performance year-to-date, preliminary considerations for 2025 and an update on the investment market. Starting with highlights to-date, notable milestones this year include record low turnover, excellent progress resolving delinquency and positive inflection points in several key demand drivers. These factors combined with muted level of new housing supply have enabled Essex to deliver results exceeding the high end of our original 2024 expectations. Year-to-date, we've achieved solid results with market rents generally trending consistent with historical patterns as shown in the chart on Page S-13.2. In the third quarter, rents peaked in July and remained resilient through August before moderating in September. As we expected, the blended rate growth of 2.5% for the quarter was tempered by the combination of seasonal moderation in rents, which started in September and difficult year-over-year comparison. Especially since last year, our rents did not moderate until late October. As we enter the fourth quarter, our market remain stable. We shifted our operating strategy to focus on occupancy as we've done in prior years in anticipation of slower demand characteristic of normal seasonality. Moving to regional highlights. Seattle has been our top performer this year, delivering a strong 3.8% blended rate growth in the third quarter. The East side, where we have approximately 70% of our portfolio, was our strongest markets with 4.7% blended growth. For the rest of the year, we anticipate a heavier supply delivery and thus more concessions usage in this region. Northern California has performed well, achieving 2.3% blended rate growth in the third quarter, led by Santa Clara County with 3.6%. The overall supply for this region remains very low but we anticipate most of the deliveries for San Jose this year to occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we plan for higher concessions to address this short term impact. On to Southern California, which achieved 2.1% blended lease rate growth in the third quarter. Lease rates in this region were tempered by headwinds related to delinquency recovery in Los Angeles. Excluding LA, this region produced 3.5% blended rate growth for the third quarter. While the exact timing is difficult to pinpoint, we are cautiously optimistic that new lease rates will begin to recover next year in LA as volume of delinquent units continue to subside. Heading into year end, we are well positioned at 96.1% financial occupancy for October with year-over-year comps easing in November and December. Turning to our expectations for 2025. We've provided high level revenue drivers on Page S-16.2 of the supplemental. We expect our earnings for next year to surpass what was achieved in 2024, ranging from 80 to 100 basis points. Additionally, we anticipate a 40 to 60 basis points tailwind from delinquency improvements. Combined, these two components should generate approximately 120 to 160 basis points of same property revenue growth in 2025. As for market rent growth, supply and demand will ultimately be the key building blocks. The fundamental backdrop remains stable and continues to gradually improve. On the supply side, detailed on Page S-16 of the supplemental, we expect total supply growth of only 50 basis points in 2025. This is consistent with the low level of supply in 2024 and well below our long term average of 1% for our markets. On the demand side, we've seen positive inflection points and several major demand drivers this year. Job postings at the top 20 technology companies have been steadily recovering, demonstrating a sentiment shift from retrenchment in 2023 to positioning for future growth. Additionally, these same companies continue to increase their return to office requirements, which has resulted in increased demand to San Jose and Seattle regions. Related to this is migration back to our markets, which has steadily improved and is rebalancing toward historical patterns. Given the low supply environment in the Essex markets, we are well positioned to achieve new lease rate growth with incremental demand. Lastly, on the transaction market, strong investor interest for multifamily properties on the West Coast has resulted in cap rates trading consistently in the mid 4% range with numerous transaction in the low 4%. Within this competitive landscape, our investment team has done a terrific job originating several opportunities at better than market yields, acquiring over 1,700 units to date, totaling over $700 million at our pro rata share. We continue to execute transactions with attractive returns relative to our cost of capital and we are confident in our ability to generate opportunities to drive NAV and FFO per share accretion for our shareholders. Finally, I'll conclude with a brief comment on California Proposition 33. It is no surprise to anyone that excessive regulation dramatically restrict housing production in California, leading to high cost of housing. As such, we have joined Governor Newsom in endorsing a no vote on Proposition 33. We all know that building more housing is the only solution to the state's housing shortage. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin by briefly discussing our third quarter results, followed by comments on the remainder of 2024 and conclude with investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report third quarter core FFO per share of $3.91, a $0.04 beat to the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher same property revenues. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO for a third consecutive quarter by $0.06 to $15.56 per share, which represents 3.5% year-over-year growth. A key contributor to the full year increase relates to same property revenue growth, which has outperformed our expectations. As such, we are raising our midpoint by 25 basis points to 3.25% growth for the year. The increase is driven by lower delinquency and higher other income. With no change to our expense outlook, we expect same property NOI growth of 2.6%, a 30 basis points increase at the midpoint. Turning to investments. Year-to-date, we've acquired approximately $700 million in multifamily properties at pro rata share, which has been funded on a leverage neutral basis with $200 million of dispositions, $450 million of proceeds from structured finance redemptions and free cash flow and $25 million in OP units. As it relates to our structured finance book, we have received $106 million in cash redemptions through October and anticipate an additional $40 million for the balance of the year. We've reinvested these funds into new acquisitions, which offer the most attractive risk adjusted return today given the growth potential in our markets. While this strategic reallocation results in short term FFO dilution, growing the company via apartment acquisitions improves the quality of our cash flow and the long term growth profile of our portfolio. This in turn drives better NAV and core FFO growth for our shareholders. Looking to 2025, we expect between $100 million to $150 million of redemptions with up to 50% expected by the end of the first quarter. Barring a change in the investment landscape, we are most likely to redeploy these proceeds into acquisitions, resulting in a continued reduction of the structured finance book and better alignment with our target range for this business at 3% to 5% of core FFO. Finally, a few comments on the balance sheet. Over the last several years, we have opportunistically refinanced our debt maturities early when we see an attractive issuance window. We continued that trend this quarter as we issued $200 million in 10 year unsecured bonds and an effective rate of 5.1%. With a manageable debt maturity schedule next year, we have ample flexibility to be opportunistic. Overall, our balance sheet remains in a strong position with low leverage as defined by net debt to EBITDA at 5.5 times. In addition, with over $1 billion in liquidity and ample sources of available capital, the company is well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.
Daniel Tricarico: This is Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. I wanted to ask a question on bad debt, with the 50 basis points of improvement in 2025. What gives you the confidence LA Alameda County will normalize like your other markets? And just to confirm your comment, Angela, from your prepared remarks, this assumption would imply maybe broader supply/demand fundamentals should improve in those markets as well.
Angela Kleiman: With respect to LA Alameda, a couple of things are happening on the ground that gives us also some confidence that things are improving. So for example, delinquency in terms of just the volume, let's start there, it has really improved. In fact, at year end, last year in December, our delinquency as a percentage of rent for LA was almost 5%. Today, it's 1.6%. So that is significant progress. And we've seen a direct correlation with the courts continue to move through the eviction and that's been a key to continuing that trend. But as far as just general economic viability for LA, a couple of things that actually has given us a positive sign. So for example, we have, of course, the World Cup coming in the Olympics. And so what we are anticipating is that there will be benefits from economic investments, both domestically and internationally to this region. But further, just this week, Governor Newsom proposed to double California's film and television tax credit program from current $330 million to about $750 million. So these are all great signs that we're seeing that gives us that level of optimism, if you will.
Daniel Tricarico: As a follow-up, you mentioned signs of -- I think you mentioned signs of improving tech job backdrop, not something you necessarily heard from office landlords. So maybe you could expand a bit more where and what you're seeing specifically related to that?
Angela Kleiman: So we track the openings of the top 20 tech companies. And that is -- it's just the closest thing to apples-to-apples that we can see and they're really the drivers of the overall health of the technology sector. And so we follow that and we use a third party independent report. And we have seen that for the first time in almost two years the job openings have reached pre-COVID averages. And it's a good start, because openings is an indication that these companies will be positioning to hire in the future. The one thing that I'll ask that you keep in mind is that this is a lumpy trend and it's not an immediate impact. But obviously, things are going in the right direction here.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Eric Wolfe from Citi.
Nick Joseph: It's Nick Joseph here with Eric. Appreciate the '25 building blocks. I guess my question is just around pricing strategy going forward. I mean, you've laid out kind of the improving bad debt situation, particularly in Southern California, continued low supply. So half percentage point next year. How are you thinking about the ability to actually push on the new lease side and how are renewals going out over the next 30 and 60 days?
Angela Kleiman: In terms of our operating strategy, we have shifted to an occupancy strategy in the fourth quarter and that is typical to address the seasonal slow demand that's characteristic of our business, that's not anything unusual. What we are expecting is the deceleration that we have seen in September and October, which we, of course, have factored into our guidance to the headwinds that caused those to start to abate. And so for example, in October last year, just to give you one data point, our concessions was only half a week and this year, it's about a week. Well, that doesn't seem like a big number, half a week is -- represents 1% of rent. So you can see the year-over-year impact on the financials. But as far as the renewal is concerned, we're sending renewals out in the mid-4s. So a strong number consistent with our plan. And early indication is that we're landing around the high 3s, once again, also well within the range. Typically, the negotiations range from zero to 100 basis points, and this is kind of in the middle of that. So these are all good indications for the rest of the year and our ability for pricing power in next year to come.
Nick Joseph: And then just on, I guess, the potential repeal of cost on to understand all the arguments on the policy side. But if it were to pass, right, so if the repeal occurred, how do you think about what could happen kind of over the following few months? And what is your exposure to municipalities that have some form of rent control currently?
Angela Kleiman: We kind of battle internally on how to think about this risk. Let me just start with a couple of data points that I think may be useful in an assumption like this, because it is a very difficult hypothetical question to answer. And the reason that's the case is because right now every city in California can enact rent control on buildings that are on 1995, we have about 483 cities in California. And believe it or not, only about 8% of these cities have been active rent control and with a lot of these cities where the rent control is actually quite moderate. And so as far as Prop 33 is concerned, 23 mayors have actually came out and announced that they were against Proposition 33. And some of these mayors are the same ones that out have in that the rent control like San Jose, for example, and Santa Ana. So for us to try to interpolate something that is so unlikely -- it's just it's too difficult to predict. But more importantly, on the campaign itself, what we're seeing is that this is following the same pattern as the 2018 and the 2020 pattern and both times, they were defeated by a landslide. And so I understand that there's an overhang in our stock just because it isn't unknown. But what we're seeing is that the public and the legislators they understand the impact of something this onerous. And in fact, this is evidenced by the most expensive cities in California are the ones with the most onerous rent control like San Francisco and Santa Monica and the ones with the highest brands. So the net-net is that the campaign continues to gain momentum and we are confident this will be defeated.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho Securities.
Haendel St. Juste: So a couple of questions from me. I think in your prepared remarks, Angela, you mentioned that rents last year did not moderate until October. So you had tough comps this year in September and October, but it looks like the comps are getting easier ahead. So I guess I'm curious what you're sending out for renewals here today and any color on October new lease rates? But more broadly, is there a scenario where we can see a reacceleration in blends on these easy comps? Just curious what's kind of embedded in your near term outlook here.
Angela Kleiman: So we are sending new renewals out in the mid-4s. And so far, the early indication and those who have signed leases are lending in the high 3s, so say 3.9%, 3.8% on average. So these are definitely good trends and positive indication. As far as the possibility of a reacceleration, it's certainly possible just because, as I mentioned, rents continue to increase through October last year. So that's one factor, renewals remain strong. And if nothing else, we just don't have the same headwind in November, December this year as we did last year. And so that is a possibility.
Haendel St. Juste: And then you also mentioned again this quarter seeing positive immigration, more employees enforcing return office mandates and now tech job growth for the first time in years being back to pre-COVID levels. So I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any of that translate into better demand applications, things which could forebode kind of more demand or pricing power rent growth into early into next year?
Angela Kleiman: A couple of things on the immigration front. We are seeing that this year has benefited our numbers and especially if you look at the job growth environment, it's generally not robust for the US and the West Coast. It's stable and it's moving along. And so for us to be able to outperform, it's demand coming from elsewhere relative to our original forecast. And so in terms of predicting how that is going to impact next year, it's too early to tell really for two reasons. One is that we do believe most of the return to office benefit were captured this year. And I'll give you a point -- one data point, which is our immigration. Our immigration as a percentage of our total leases, it's not yet to pre-COVID level but it's pretty darn close. So that's one good indication. So maybe you can say we've captured 70%, 75% of the return to office. So there's some left for next year but it's not going to be as robust as this year. But what will really drive demand for housing next year is going to be all about job growth. Fortunately, for us, with low demand, our base case is very low risk. Having said that, we'll need better indication on a macro level where the consensus job forecast is going to land and what that will mean for the West Coast, because we are still all somewhat interrelated to the entire economy.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Could you provide a little bit of color on the cap rate pricing on the sort of different acquisitions that you did as well as the dispositions?
Rylan Burns: We were pleased to buy out two of our joint venture partners in the third quarter and these were long running negotiations. In both cases, we had debt maturing, which necessitated conversation. And we believe we were able to buy those at very attractive basis, probably 20% to 25% discounts to replacement cost today at yields in the high 4s. So we think better than market pricing. In one instance, we were able to also negotiate an OP unit transaction at a 305 strike price, which was, when we negotiated, it was -- stock was around 270. So that was a necessary requirement for us to make that deal [pencil] an accretive basis. Subsequent to quarter end, the portfolio transaction that was noted in the release, this is similar to the portfolio that we did earlier in the year where market cap rates are in the low 5s, given this is a slightly older portfolio but one that we've owned for many, many years. We've invested in we know very well. And with our basis as we were already majority owners is going to cap rate to Essex -- closer to a 6. The disposition subsequent to quarter end in San Mateo, this was a 76 year old asset and approximately a 5 cap to Essex inclusive of capital. And the thinking there is that we are seeing better risk adjusted opportunities elsewhere and we're able to redeploy that capital into higher returning investments.
Steve Sakwa: And I realize development maybe still a bit of a dirty word. But how are you guys thinking about future developments and where would developments perhaps pencil today on current costs and in-place rents? I'm trying to just figure out how far away you think you might be from being able to start some new projects?
Rylan Burns: It's something we've been really focused on here over the past year. So as you know, we haven't started a new development for almost five years. The risk adjusted returns just really didn't make sense. What we've seen more recently is that I think others are recognizing the challenging return environment and we've seen capital pullback. So permits are starting to come down, hard costs are starting to come down. So if you can secure land at an attractive basis and design an efficient building, I'd say we're getting closer. So we have a history of being a counter-cyclical developer. And I think with others pulling back, we are sharpening our pencils. And we'll have more to come here in the next several quarters.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Two questions. First, Angela, you mentioned some comments around supply on the east side of Seattle and I think you also mentioned maybe with San Jose. But just big picture collectively, can you just sort of outline the supply picture that you're looking at? How much of the portfolio you think it impacts? And if it's just sort of in the next six months or if you think it's something that extends longer and impacts more of '25?
Angela Kleiman: On the supply landscape, we do see that the San Jose impact should only really be more concentrated in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit leads over in the first quarter, because it all really depends on how the delivery occurs. So for example, if they all come at once or if they going to go pro rata over the next several months, it'll have a different impact. But having said that, San Jose as far as -- or the total stock is still very low. We're talking about, for the full year, 2,400 units that's supposed to be delivered. Unfortunately, about 1,100 of those happened in the fourth quarter but it's still very low and this is why we expect that absorption to occur quickly. And well, yes, there will be some concessions involved. It's not going to be as challenging as what we've seen, for example, in Downtown LA or Oakland. It's a very different beast. And it should -- we should get past it within, say, three months or four months or something along those lines. Seattle is a little bit more in terms of the supply overall. I mean, generally, it has been a higher supply delivery market with stay a little bit above 1% of total supply. And so having a shift from the east side, we believe that impact will start in the fourth quarter and probably continue in the first quarter. What has helped Seattle in the past and what we continue to see the benefit is that Seattle has also generated the highest level of demand in the market. So with a higher level of job growth, we expect that the demand or the supply will be absorbed timely. And so while there will be a temporary concession environment, it shouldn't be prolonged because that's how it's been every year with Seattle.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then, Barb, a question for you on the recycling. As you guys whittle down the preferred and debt book and recycle into assets, sort of in aggregate, especially as we think about '25. Is there some sort of pennies or some sort of way that we can think about the dilution impact, is it $0.05, $0.10, is it more than that? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the redeployment from the preferred and debt book into income producing assets?
Barb Pak: I think what you can do is we're losing at 10% on the preferred and we're redeploying it around 5%. And so that's kind of the impact that you're seeing from an FFO perspective. But what I did talk about on the call was we're targeting 3% to 5% of our core FFO per share. In 2024, we were at about 5.5%. So structured finance is about 5.5% of our 2024 core FFO. We do expect that will moderate to the low 4% range next year as a lot of our redemptions this year were back end loaded and then we have some front end loaded redemptions next year. And so we do expect it to moderate throughout next year. But we should have higher NOI as well as we are redeploying this money back into acquisitions.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: Just wanted to ask about the kind of advocacy expense, lobbying expense that was disclosed this quarter. Maybe just quantify kind of what it was this quarter and maybe what it's been year-to-date as well and then if there's more to come here in 4Q still given kind of the timing of the election versus the timing of the quarter end?
Barb Pak: So in the third quarter, we spent $10 million. Year-to-date, we're at $16 million and for the full year, our guidance assumes a little over $30 million on the advocacy front.
Adam Kramer: And are you able to split out whether that's kind of Prop 33 versus Prop 34 versus maybe, I don't know, the other legislative lobbying efforts?
Barb Pak: No, it's all related to mostly Prop 33 and 34, but we don't have -- I don't have that breakout in front of me.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman: So I think you renewed your insurance policy in December. Can you give us your initial thoughts on how that's looking and maybe just frame what you're seeing and hearing on the commercial property insurance market overall?
Barb Pak: We have a good memory. We are in the midst of our insurance renewal right now. It's a little too early to know how it's going to play out. But what we have seen in the industry this year is a moderation in insurance premium increases. So just to give some history, the last two years, we've seen our premium increase 20% to 30% annually. And we do expect that it will moderate from there next year, but the level is a little difficult to discern at this point. We'll obviously have more color on our fourth quarter call.
Jamie Feldman: And I know you're not obviously in Florida. But are you hearing like that spills over everywhere in the country or do you think you'll be relatively isolated from the impact?
Barb Pak: It's something that is playing out as we speak. And the November renewal didn't see too big of an impact that we heard. But obviously, we're going after both hurricanes hit. So a little tricky to answer that question right now and we're in the midst of those discussions at this point.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America.
Josh Dennerlein: I was looking at a Exhibit or I guess Page S-16.1 in the supplemental. Could you just kind of go over that earn in? I see that you added [Technical Difficulty] concession impact. So I just kind of want to clarify what that means and maybe how we should think about it versus like our models out here?
Barb Pak: So the earn-in is consistent with how we calculate it last year. It's really just taking the leases that we've signed through October. And and then our projections for November, December and what does that kind of carry forward next year, assuming no market rent growth next year. And it doesn't include concessions because concessions are below the line. I mean this is just that gross rent not including any concessions. I don't think it's too dissimilar from how the industry calculates this number but 90 basis points is our projection at this point based on the leases signed. Does that answer your question or…
Josh Dennerlein: And then maybe just why have you, just kind of thinking about like the capital recycling. Do you guys think you'll lean into maybe taking out or consolidating additional JVs versus just like outright open market purchases of income producing assets or is it just kind of opportunity set driven?
Rylan Burns: The joint venture business has really been an efficient source of capital. And so it has and will continue to benefit the company through various points of the cycle. We have great partners who want exposure to West Coast housing and they like investing alongside a company like Essex that's financially aligned and can provide a best-in-class operating platform. So in 2024, from Essex's perspective, we saw an opportunity to purchase communities that we knew well, we had invested in for many years and most importantly, was accretive to shareholders. Going forward, we still have 7,700 units that are owned in joint venture partnerships and it's going to be a function of our discussion with partners, our cost of capital and the opportunity set in the market. So we are open and eagerly looking at all avenues to grow.
Operator: The next question is from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I wanted to ask about the spread that you have between renewal and new leases this quarter. It was 330 basis points, over the last two years, it's been 350. A lot of your peers are at 600 basis points or more in some cases. So it seems like your renewals are a little bit more sensitive to market rents than maybe some others. And I'm wondering why that's the case?
Angela Kleiman: I don't know if our renewals and market rent sensitivity is really what's driving the spread. I think it's more the operating strategy that's driving the spread. And so what we focus on is maximizing revenues. And so we try to send renewals out where we anticipate what the market is going to be a month or two from today. And negotiate as needed along the way. And of course, that strategy is influenced by whether we're focusing on occupancy and what else is happening, the supply landscape, the job landscape. And so we try to factor all of that with our maximizing total revenue in mind. What we have seen is some of our peers are more focused on, say, getting a higher lease -- new lease rate and some are more focused on just getting higher renewal rates, for example. And when you focus on one, of course, there's going to -- it's going to impact the others. And if it's not a rate impact, it's going to be an occupancy impact. So ultimately, I know it's -- I'm probably giving you more color than what you're asking for. But ultimately, I do think that we all have different levers that we are pulling. And our business objective is focused on maximizing revenue, not a specific rate per se.
John Kim: But I mean, in the case of some companies, the move out to buy a home is at all-time lows. I'm wondering what that ratio is for you right now. But because of that all-time low, they're able to push renewals maybe harder than one would expect versus new leases. So I'm wondering because home prices are so high in your markets, does that present potential upside for you going forward as far as, I don't know, pushing on a little bit more renewals?
Angela Kleiman: For us, the move out to buy homes has not been a meaningful factor in our pricing strategy, whether it's now or in prior cycles, primarily because it's a smaller percentage. So for example, pre-COVID, during say more -- even when interest rates were at very low, our move out to buy homes was somewhere around 10 percentage range. So it's already very low. And the cost to own a home is back then almost 2 times. I think it was 1.8 times more expensive to buy a home than to rent. Today, the move-out ratio is about 5%. So it's about half. Having said that, we're talking about almost 2.8%, so almost 3% or 3 times more expensive to own than to rent. So that incremental increase on that cost of ownership really isn't going to move the needle on our pricing strategy because it's already so expensive.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: Maybe just related to some of the topics you covered earlier. Just with comparisons getting a little easier from here, would you expect new lease rates to inflect more positively for the last two months?
Angela Kleiman: That's what we are anticipating. And so new rates obviously went negative in October and this started in September. But with the easier year-over-year comp, we do expect a inflection point where it either becomes neutral or turns positive.
Linda Tsai: And a quick question for Barb. Could you provide some color on your refinancing plans for the upcoming 2025 maturities and maybe what kind of impact that would have on earnings for next year?
Barb Pak: We're constantly monitoring the market. And most of the maturities that are due next year is $500 million in unsecured bonds. So we'll be looking at the bond market to refinance that in the near term. I think it depends on the tenor and where the treasury is at. When we issued the 10 year paper in August, we were at 5.1%. Today, we're probably 30 basis points wide of that today. And so there will be an earnings impact because we're rolling off a 3.5% coupon bond and going up into the low 5s. But in terms of opportunities to refinance it, we'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's a window, that's a more attractive opportunity.
Operator: The next question is from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street.
John Pawlowski: I wanted to drill into the return to office theme some more and use Seattle as a case study. So can you share any specific metrics to help us understand how the leasing conditions have improved since Amazon and a few others have announced stricter return to office policies and now ostensibly housing choices need to change ahead of those mandates becoming effective? So would love to hear how either foot traffic or leasing spreads have shifted in recent weeks and months.
Angela Kleiman: So in Seattle, what we have seen is our demand increase or in fact spike when Amazon and some of these other companies first announced return to office and I think back then it was three days. And so we saw that direct correlation and usually, it was within, say, 30 to 45 days of that announcement. And as far as we're -- fast worded today, with the announcement of Amazon going full time in January, the question here is going to be, when do they start enforcing it, because that's when we will see the benefit. So when Amazon first announced their return to office, they also said they were enforcing it right away. And this time, we're waiting to see how -- if that's going to hold true as well.
John Pawlowski: And then last one from me, Angela, Barb, I want to talk about the exclusion of the advocacy costs from core FFO. I just get frustrated when a lot of money gets excluded from these metrics. So as these regulatory efforts become more recurring in nature, they're episodic but they're definitely not onetime. How do you guys just deliberate internally as they become more recurring, still excluding meaningful expenses from core FFO?
Barb Pak: I mean we don't see them as recurring every year. And in this case, we haven't had any cost since 2020 on this front. So it's been four years. And so we do have a plan in terms of how -- what we define as nonrecurring costs and this is one of them. I think it's pretty standard in the industry but it's something that we do revisit regularly, and we've been transparent about how much we're spending. And so we're not trying to hide from it but we don't see it reoccurring every year.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Julien Blouin from Goldman Sachs.
Julien Blouin: Rylan, maybe digging into your comments on the JV acquisition front. I guess, how many of those 7,000 plus remaining JV units would you ultimately be interested in consolidating if you had the opportunity? And do most of those have sort of significant Prop 13 benefits that help your yield as a buyer sort of come in closer to that 6% buyer cap rate you've been getting?
Rylan Burns: Julien, the fact that we've made these investments to begin with would suggest that we would like to own all of them if we had the opportunity, and several of them are structured in such a way that we would have a Prop 13 benefit. But that being said, we have great partnerships and our strategy or plan is not to consolidate all of them. We will continue to evaluate opportunities as joint venture maturities come forward or as debt maturities come forward. So it represents an opportunity. But we are committed to this business and we're committed to our partners that want to be in this business with us. So just manage expectations about how many of those could be consolidated in the near term.
Julien Blouin: And it sounds like a lot of these are older assets. I guess, does that bring any sort of value add redev opportunities to sort of accretively upgrade these assets at attractive yields, maybe putting in capital that would have been difficult to secure from partners but that maybe now is a little more straightforward for you to do on your own?
Rylan Burns: I would say that there was one asset that was part of the initial portfolio earlier this year where we had significant development opportunity that we continue to explore. Typically, these are business cases that we discuss with partners. And more often than not -- again, we have got great partnerships that see the value that we can create that those are rarely gating issues from our partners' capital. However, as you can imagine, it is a little bit more efficient when we're doing it internally on a consolidated basis. So these are assets that we've owned for a long time. We invested in our assets. So we know what we're stepping into. And in some cases, there is some value add opportunity but nothing significant to highlight from the most recent acquisitions.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Alex Kim from Zelman & Associates.
Alex Kim: I wanted to ask about your blended rent growth outlook. I noticed that you referenced remaining on plan for your full year outlook of around 2.5%. Could you talk through some of your expectations in November and December that allow you to remain on track, I guess, especially with the seasonal moderation that occurs in these upcoming months?
Angela Kleiman: In terms of what we're looking at for November, December, I'll just give you one example that hopefully can give you the appropriate color. So in last year, in October, we were giving out half a week of concessions in San Mateo. And by November and December, concessions went up to 3.2 weeks. So currently sitting at two, we don't see that increasing dramatically because last year, we had supply in San Mateo, for example, and some other influences. And so just from the fact that there is going to be no headwind on the concessions that in itself is a beneficial pickup. The second factor is, of course, with LA working through the evictions in a meaningful way that overhang on new leases will continue to abate. So that will be another beneficial factor. And of course, the third piece is lease rates. New lease rates in October and November last year, they went down to about, say, average negative 2.5%. And so once again, this year in October, we're sitting here at about 1.5%. We have plenty of room and certainly not a new lease rate headwind on that front, so -- and multiple fronts, we actually have either a tailwind or no headwind and which is why we have talked about a potential reacceleration on the new lease rates. And of course, the last component is our renewals have performed stronger than our original forecast. And so on a blended basis, we see a path to achieving our plan.
Alex Kim: And then just to follow up, wanted to ask about bad debt. And some of your assumptions for delinquencies, not for '25 but for this upcoming fourth quarter, as well as any other specifics you could provide for like the other income piece that helped drive the upward revenue guidance revision?
Barb Pak: In terms of bad debt, year-to-date through October, we're sitting right around 1%. We think we'll be right around 1%, maybe slightly under for the full year with the fourth quarter being not too dissimilar. In terms of the other income drivers for the quarter, in the third quarter, we did have higher lease break fees related to corporate tenants, which hit the other income line but it's not going to reoccur in the fourth quarter, which is causing some sequential decline that you're seeing in the numbers, fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Amy [Indiscernible] from UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: A follow-up to a previous question, and sorry if this is coming a little too close to asking for guidance. Are you able to discuss how we should be thinking about the impact of concession burn-off in '25? It seems like San Jose and Seattle could see some tailwinds in the second half of the year. But wondering if there is a way that we can think about quantifying some of this impact.
Angela Kleiman: What we're seeing is that the concessionary level, while it may vary in our submarkets, is essentially moving from one area to another when it comes to supply. And so last year was heavier in downtown Seattle this year -- I mean -- or this year, I should say, 2024, not over yet, is so heavier in downtown Seattle. Next year, it's going to be a little heavier in East side. And so it's going to shift from one to the other. And therefore, overall, we really don't expect the concessionary environment for the full year to vary all that much from one year to the other.
Unidentified Analyst: And just a quick one on the transaction environment. Do you think that the current transaction levels are kind of back to a pre-COVID norm or are we still trending lower in terms of absolute volume?
Rylan Burns: Amy, transaction volumes year-to-date in California and Washington, and it actually is approximate for the national average, are around of what we would call pre-COVID average, say, 15% to 19%. It's still well below approximately a third of what we saw in '21 and '22. So we've had an uptick versus last year, which there was very limited volume. It's picked up that includes some of the large portfolio transactions that I'm sure you're aware of but we're still below the level of volumes that we've seen in previous years. So there's a good chance of capital markets continue to trend favorably that we'll see an uptick in transaction volume next year. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we take the last question from the line of Conor Peaks from Deutsche Bank.
Conor Peaks: Maybe sticking on the acquisition opportunity front. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about what kind of regional differences you're seeing in your markets, maybe in regards to available stock for sale or movements in cap rate pricing?
Rylan Burns: We're not seeing a wide differentiation in terms of cap rates for core product, well located newer product in all of our submarkets continue to be well bid. I think you're seeing some -- the most aggressive pricing is along the Peninsula where I think people are more likely to be underwriting above average rent growth for the next several years. But the spread difference in terms of cap rates for high quality product is de minimis. We've seen limited transaction volume in the downtown centers and particularly LA to start the year that has picked up. We've seen several transactions in Downtown LA this year. So they feel like relatively healthy markets. But again, as I mentioned earlier not to the level of volumes we've seen in previous years.
Conor Peaks: And then it could be a tougher comp kind of driving this a little bit. But if we were to look at the higher expenses in the Northern California portfolio and the drivers behind that?
Barb Pak: It is somewhat comp related. There is -- expenses are lumpy quarter-to-quarter and does depend on what happened a year ago. I would say utility expenses were a little higher there than in some of the other regions and that represents 20% of our OpEx. So that can have sometimes a meaningful impact. And so nothing to be alarmed about, nothing that's really outside the norm. It just really does depend on the comp from the prior year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. And it also concludes the conference of Essex Property Trust. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-31 13:00:00) =====
Angela Kleiman - President and CEO:
Barb Pak - CFO & EVP:
Rylan Burns - EVP and Chief Investment Officer:
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman. You may begin.
Angela Kleiman : Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex's second quarter earnings call. Our pack will follow with prepared remarks, and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report a strong second quarter, with core FFO per share exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $0.05. As a result, we have our second notable increase to our full-year guidance. Today, my comments will focus on underlying drivers to our outperformance and operational highlights, followed by an update on the investment market. Starting with operating fundamentals. Year-to-date, demand for West Coast multifamily housing has exceeded our expectations, particularly in Northern California and Seattle regions. While we've traditionally relied on the BLS to assess housing demand, the reported data have not correlated to the strength we're experiencing on the ground. As such, we've analyzed alternative demand indicators from third-party sources for better insights into the key drivers supporting housing demand. The first of these is job openings at the top 20 technology companies. In June, openings in the Essex markets totaled over 17,000 jobs, which represent a 150% increase from the 2023 trough. While we have yet to return to the historical average of 25,000 jobs, the steady improvement so far has generated incremental demand in our markets and is a good precursor of the recovery, particularly in Northern California and Seattle. Another factor contributing to West Coast housing demand is migration. Real-time data using Placer AI shows a gradual improvement in domestic migration patterns on the West Coast. This is illustrated on page S16.1 of our supplemental. This data suggests that workers are relocating back to the coastal headquarters, generating a shadow demand similar to a new job being added. Additionally, this year, Northern California has positive net domestic migration for the first time since pre-COVID. As for supply dynamics, limited new housing combined with favorable rental affordability continue to underpin our market fundamentals. For example, the rate of income growth has outpaced rent growth, which has improved affordability metrics in our markets. Additionally, it is 2.8 times more expensive to own than to rent in our markets today, compared to 1.7 times back in 2019 when interest rates were near the historical low. Even if mortgage rates were to revert back to the 2019 level, homeownership in our markets will still remain significantly less affordable than renting. Turning to property operations, we experienced a solid peak leasing season with blended rent growth for same property portfolio of 3.4% for the quarter. Blended rent growth would have been 4.5%, so 110 basis points higher if we exclude LA and Alameda, the two counties with elevated delinquency-related turnover. As for regional highlights, Seattle has been our best-performing market today, achieving a 4.9% blended rent growth while maintaining strong occupancy level of 97% in the second quarter. The east side, which has been less impacted by supply than the CBD, led this region with 5% blended rent growth. There are two key factors that contributed to this strong performance. First, relative to our other regions, Seattle has the strongest job growth. Second, the new supply has been less impactful as timing delays resulted in fewer deliveries in the first half of the year. These two factors have led to a prolonged seasonal peak, in that this market typically peaks around late June, but this year the peak occurred a month later, around the end of July. Northern California was our second best-performing region, achieving a 3.3% blended rent growth in the second quarter, an occupancy of 96.3%. San Mateo and San Jose were the notable outperformers at around 4% growth, with Alameda County pulling down the regional average by 80 basis points due to delinquency turnover and the continued elevated supply in Oakland. Generally, rents in this region peaked around early July, consistent with historical patterns. Lastly, Southern California continues to be a steady performer. We achieved 2.8% blended rent growth for the quarter, which would have been 200 basis points higher if we were to exclude LA. In similar fashion, Southern California's average occupancy of 95.7% for the quarter was tempered by Los Angeles, with all other markets at or above 96% occupancy. Excluding LA, Southern California's rents peaked in late July, consistent with historical patterns. As we begin the third quarter, our portfolio is well-positioned, with average concession of less than two days, and occupancy is healthy at 96.2%. We are prepared to shift to an occupancy strategy as appropriate, while maintaining the optionality to minimize rental growth. Finally, on the transaction market, in the second quarter, there was a significant increase in investor demand for well-located, newer multifamily properties on the West Coast. In contrast, the number of marketed properties for sale remained low. This combination has resulted in a highly competitive bidding process, and a compression in cap rates in some markets. Over the past few months, Essex has selectively procured three high-quality communities in the Bay area. All three of these investments have significant upside potential, based on the favorable fundamental backdrop and efficiencies from our operating platform. We are pleased with the progress to date, with over $500 million in acquisitions closed, and are optimistic more opportunities will arise in the near future. As always, we remain disciplined and focus on maximizing shareholder value and enhancing the growth profile of the company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.
Barb Pak : Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter results, followed by the key components of our full year guidance raise, and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. Beginning with our second quarter results, we are pleased to report core FFO per share of $3.94, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.11. The outperformance was primarily driven by $0.05 of higher same-property revenues, which was largely the result of stronger net effect of rent growth. In addition, this quarter benefited from $0.04 of one-time revenues and lower operating expenses, which are timing related. Turning to our full year guidance revision, our strong second quarter results and healthy peak leasing season have enabled us to increase the midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 75 basis points to 3%. Our improved outlook is largely driven by blended rent growth outpacing our initial forecast, resulting in a 50 basis points increase to revenue growth. We now forecast blended rent growth to be 120 basis points higher than our initial forecast, driven by outperformance in Northern California and Seattle. As for same property operating expenses, higher utility costs and legal fees are the primary drivers of the 50 basis points increase in our midpoint to 4.75%. As it relates to controllable expenses, we have been effective in managing this aspect of the business despite the elevated cost environment. For the year, we expect controllable expenses to increase less than 3%. In total, we now expect same property NOI to grow by 2.3% at the midpoint, representing a 90 basis points improvement to our prior guidance and 170 basis points improvement from our initial outlook. Based on our strong second quarter results and the revision to same-property growth, we are raising full-year core FFO by $0.27 to $15.50 per share, which represents 3.1% year-over-year growth. In total, we've raised core FFO a notable $0.47 per share so far this year. As it relates to our third quarter guidance, we are forecasting $3.87 at the midpoint. The sequential decline from the second quarter relates to two factors. First, same-property NOI is expected to be $0.05 lower, which is driven by elevated operating expenses given the typical seasonality and spending for repairs and maintenance, taxes and utilities. And second, we had $0.02 of one-time items in the second quarter. Turning to the preferred equity portfolio. For the year, we expect between $125 million to $175 million in redemptions, of which we received $50 million to date. Our intention is to redeploy the proceeds into acquisitions depending on market opportunities. In terms of the watch list, we started the year with five properties on the list, of which three have been removed so far to date. Two of the properties were acquired and consolidated on our financials, and one of the investments had a significant equity infusion, which puts us in a better position in the capital stack. In total, the reduction in the watch list added approximately $0.04 to our full-year core FFO. The rest of the portfolio is performing as planned. Finally, our balance sheet metrics remain a key source of strength. We have no remaining consolidated maturities in 2024, our leverage levels remain healthy with net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times, and we have over $1 billion in available liquidity. As such, we are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt : Hi, and good morning, everybody. Angela, you mentioned that you're prepared to shift to an occupancy strategy, so just curious if we should view kind of the pullback and renewal rate growth in recent months as a tactical move to drive occupancy, or are you getting some pushback on the increases and kind of seeing retention moderate? What's sort of driving the pullback? Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Austin. Good to hear from you. This is more in line with our approach to address seasonality in our business, and so typically as we approach the seasonal peak, we would push on rents, and now as we shift toward the seasonal, you know, slower time of demand, we start to migrate toward occupancy, ultimately, the goal is to maximize revenues. So it's not so much of anything we're seeing that is, you know, any red flags on the fundamentals. It's more of how we normally run our business to maximize rents and revenue.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it, and then could you break out how new lease growth has trended across the three regions as you get into July, and just curious where you're seeing kind of the most moderation and what's kind of holding stronger, maybe a little longer than you would have anticipated? Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: First thing, so on the new lease rates, net effect new lease rates, we are seeing Southern California holding steady, slight deceleration, but, you know, nothing material like 10, 20 basis points. Northern California is the more deceleration, about 200 basis points, and then Seattle about 50 to 60 basis points of deceleration. And once again, on the new lease, you know, activity here, it's pretty much what we had expected. There's nothing here that's giving us any alarm. This is normal business, you know, with us. Normally, Northern California peaks earlier than Southern California, and so this is on plan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Eric. Maybe just following up on that pricing strategy, but more specific to LA and Alameda, you know, are you getting closer to the point where you can be pushing pricing more right now, or do you need to get to a certain occupancy level first?
Angela Kleiman: That's a great question, Eric [ph]. We are not quite there on LA Alameda in terms of our operating strategy. We pretty much ran a occupancy-focused strategy starting late last year that has continued throughout the year. We've been able to kind of switch back and forth a little bit, but it really didn't last long. At this point, we made really good progress on delinquency, and essentially, it improved by almost 50%. We reduced by another 50% from beginning of the year, so we're making good traction there. We probably will not be able to have pricing power until we get through the rest of this year in LA and Alameda.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on your gross bad debt, it looks like it came down to 80 basis points in July. Is your expectation that it will hold around this level for the rest of the year?
Barb Pak: Hi, Nick. It's Barb. Yes, our guidance has about 1% baked into the rest of the year. Remember, the number can bounce around month to month, but we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far and feel comfortable that we'll continue to make progress. If we do make more progress in the 80 basis points, I'll just be upside to the high end or be to the high end of the guidance range.
Nick Joseph: Makes sense. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Song: Hi, this is Steven Song on for Josh. Thanks for the time. And then my first question is on the bad debt assumption. Seems like that's progressing better than expected so far. I wonder if you can give more color on how it will trend for the second half.
Barb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. It is a difficult number to predict because it does bounce around month to month, and we are pleased with the progress. Keep in mind, we did take that -- we did increase our guidance in the first quarter by 40 basis points because we did lower bad debt to 1.1% for the full year. And through July, we are at 1.1% year-to-date. So we're in line with our forecast. And we do expect -- we're working hard to make progress, but it does depend on when tenants leave and when the courts process evictions. And so it's a little out of our control. So we've got 1% budgeted in the back half of the year.
Steven Song: Okay, got it. That's very helpful. And then my second question is on the concession. If I hear this correctly, you said it's less than two days across the markets. I wonder, like, whether you separate that -- you can separate that for different regions and how that's trending so far?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. We have that detail, concessions. So generally speaking, so Southern California has a heavier concession in L.A. for the most part, no surprise there. And Northern California concession environment is driven primarily by Oakland because of the higher -- the elevated supply. And so Southern California DQ with L.A. and Northern California, Oakland with supply. And those are the two primary drivers of higher concession levels. But ultimately, we're talking about, say, closer to for five days in those areas versus rest of the region where Seattle has essentially zero and everywhere else around one to two days. So that averages to the two days in July.
Steven Song: Okay, got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Sanket on for Steve. We were looking at the same-store revenue guidance that you guys updated. And we were just surprised that you didn't update like -- you didn't raise the low end more because year-to-date, you guys are trending at 3.5%. So we were just curious about how do you get to low end or in the lower range of the guidance range in terms of same-store revenue?
Barb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. Yes, there's a lot of factors that go into it. And at the low end, it just does depend on how steep the decline is in the back half of the year in terms of the peak leasing season. We expect a normal season, but we've seen air pockets in the past. And so that factors into the low end, and that could impact occupancy and concessions. And then delinquency has been a wild card. It feels like it's less of a wildcard this year. But once again, that is something where we've seen blips every now and then. And so those are the factors that really led to the low end where it is. But we feel very comfortable with where our midpoint is at this point.
Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And if -- as a follow-up, are you guys sending out renewals for the month of August and September?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, for sending out renewals at around low 4% portfolio-wide. And based on the negotiations that we're seeing, we'll probably land somewhere between mid-3s to high 3s on the renewal side.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Tricarico : Hey, good morning team. It's Daniel Tricarico on for Nick. Can you talk to your expectations around pricing through the back half of the year with respect to your comments on a normal seasonal pattern and pricing peaking later than typical? And would you say there's any conservatism in the new guide related to any macroeconomic or political related factors?
Angela Kleiman: That's a great question. Well, let's start with -- we have expected that full year our blended rents will be about 2.7%. And we achieved 2.9% in the first half. So there's an implied deceleration about 35 to 40 basis points and this is actually quite moderate. It's not seem to be nothing to be concerned about. But aside from what's going on out there in the political realm, the key drivers to our anticipation is really that we have tougher year-over-year comps. So last year, our seasonal peak actually occurred one to two months later, Northern California, a month later and Southern California two months later. And so that tougher year-over-year comp is a primary driver. And then the secondary factor is the renewals ultimately will converge toward market rate over time, and that's normal.
Daniel Tricarico: Very helpful, Angela. My follow-up is you've been a bit more active in the transaction market and with your JV partners recently. Obviously, it seems to imply a vote of confidence in your markets. You also mentioned the competitive bidding and compressed cap rates. So just curious if you're considering any new on-balance sheet development today with the supply and demand outlook you're communicating?
Rylan Burns : Yes. This is Rylan here. It's a good question. I'd say working in our favor, we've started to see hard costs come down a little bit from a year ago. The vast majority of development that we underwrite, however, does not meet our return expectations. We're looking for a significant premium to where we can go purchase today given the risk inherent in development. But I would say the trends are favorable, and we are pursuing several opportunities that could lead to an increase in our development pipeline in the near future.
Daniel Tricarico: What would be the spread you're targeting versus market cap rates?
Rylan Burns: Yes, it's case-by-case dependent, but a general rule would be in our markets today for a shovel-ready site entitlements. We'd be looking for at least 100 basis point spread to where we can go and buy a comparable product.
Daniel Tricarico: Thanks, Rylan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Heffern : Yes. Thanks. Hi, everyone. So for L.A. and Alameda, when you do get pricing power back, do you see those markets just returning to kind of a normal level of growth? Or should there be some sort of catch-up given incomes have gone up much more than rent has gone up?
Angela Kleiman: That's a great question, Brad. I think that's going to depend on demand. So how quickly do we see job acceleration as we return back to that normal state to the pre-COVID level. And so fortunately, for us, we don't need much, right, given such low level of supply and which is one of the reasons we've been able to produce solid results, even though we are in a low demand growth environment. But the magnitude, if we're talking about, will be really dependent on job growth.
Brad Heffern : Okay. And then, Barb, on the new guidance, I think the fourth quarter implied core FFO number is down slightly from the third quarter. Normally, the seasonal pattern with you guys is that the fourth quarter is the highest FFO quarter. So I'm just curious if there's something that's offsetting that? Or are there something timing-related that's falling into the fourth quarter?
Barb Pak: Yes. It's most of the timing on the preferred redemption. So we've got $50 million to date. Most of that occurred in July. And then the rest of it is slated for beginning of the -- end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So we'll see the biggest impact from those redemptions then, and that's what's causing that anomaly.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste : Thanks for taking my question. I was intrigued by some of the comments you made about seeing positive migration into Northern California for the first time since I think pre-COVID and hearing more of employees enforcing return on office mandates. So I guess I'm curious, are you seeing that translating at all into more demand or applications, anything tangible that you can point to. And if that's perhaps something that could drive perhaps some rent or any upside over the next couple of quarters?
Angela Kleiman: Haendel, that's a great question. Ultimately, we're seeing pricing power and that's translating to our outperformance and you've seen us raise guidance twice and primarily driven by demand because we've always seen that having that low supply environment, we're in a really good position here. As far as where that's going to land, it's hard to say because it depends on the weight of the return. And so just to give you some data points, during COVID, about 400,000 people migrated out of our markets. And what's interesting is the majority of the out migration was to tertiary markets within Washington and California. And so say about a third, 35% of them actually went out to the Sun Belt and East Coast. And so what we're seeing right now is about 1.25 of that has returned. So about 100,000 has come back. And it's generally in line with that proportion of one-third out of Washington and California and two-thirds within the tertiary markets. So there's still some legs here. The question here is when and how much. And that is -- we just don't have enough visibility on the timing about that one.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. No, I appreciate that. And I guess we'll be watching. And I think you also mentioned -- I guess, there was an earlier question about transaction activity. And I think you mentioned in your comments that you bought assets with some occupancy or perhaps some repositioning upside. So I guess I'm curious overall just to the state of seller psychology in the marketplace. Are you seeing more potential sellers willing to engage the assets that you're underwriting, what IRRs are you looking for and your overall level of interest in deploying more capital and what cap rate range you're broadly seeing in the market?
Rylan Burns: Hi, Haendel, this is Rylan here. Several questions in there. So if I forget one, please follow up. But in general, we've seen volumes pick up in the second quarter compared to a year ago as well as the first quarter. Cap rates are fairly consistent across our markets for high-quality, well-located buildings in the mid- to high 4 cap range. So we are looking for unique opportunities that we can put it onto our operating platform and generate some additional accretion just from operating a little bit more efficiently. We're always looking for ways that potentially can add incremental yield on the top line. So we are, again, pretty excited about the investments we're able to make in the second quarter. The one that was noted at the Elan was a high 4 cap. We're expecting some additional benefit from putting it onto our operating platform. This is a building probably 20% discount to replacement cost and with rents that are about 15% low pre-COVID levels. So those -- given our fundamental outlook for some of these submarkets, if we can find more opportunities like that, we will pursue as we have always aggressively but with great discipline as well.
Haendel St. Juste: Any color on potential the IRRs that you're underwriting?
Rylan Burns: Yes, I don't want to provide too much detail just for competitive reasons, but back of the envelope math would suggest that these are above 8.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. I appreciate that. And last one, if I could squeeze one in. Just broadly, if you can give us a sense of where the loss or maybe gain to lease is across the major regions of the portfolio?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, Haendel. For you, yes, you could squeeze another one in. So July loss is about 2%. And so it's certainly a good position, especially when we compare to last year July, it's a 50 basis point improvement. Last year, July was only at 1.6%. So things are moving in the right direction.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Kramer : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask about competition from new supply in the market. I think looking at the kind of supply disclosure in the supplemental, really helpful, by the way. And it looks in multifamily supply is maybe lower than it was in the prior disclosure, but that there may be kind of more single-family new supply in kind of the way that you guys tabulated. So just wondering if you've kind of seen that have any effect in the market kind of competition from great or new single-family supply.
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela. The best indication of new supply competition is looking at our concessionary activities. And with where we are today at two days and the concessionary environment has progressively improved over the past six months. We certainly are not seeing competition from the single-family side.
Adam Kramer: Got it. That's helpful. And I just wanted to ask about kind of modeling and puts and takes with regards to the kind of the pref equity investments and then kind of buying those assets out. I know you did one in the quarter, maybe on subsequent to the quarter end. So just wondering how to think about kind of the trade-off there, right? You're buying needs a kind of fairly tight cap rates and you're losing yield that's a bunch higher. But just kind of the modeling puts it takes or how to think about kind of the short-term impact in terms of kind of gain of NOI and maybe lost equity income.
Barb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. And I might have to follow up after with the puts and takes on that. What I will tell you is that on the two investments that we didn't acquire and we had preferred equity on, there was -- we originally forecasted in our guidance for 2024, no FFO impact. And so by buying them out, we actually gained about $0.01 for this year in terms of core FFO because we didn't have any preferred equity income baked into the model given they were on the watch list and given where values were at the end of last year, we took a conservative approach on accruing on those two. And so net-net, it did add about $0.01. So -- but I can follow up with you after and go through the NOI and the other various metrics.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
James Feldman: Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe a question for Rylan. It sounds like you're getting more active on potentially the acquisition front. Your markets are at the leading edge or in the headlines probably the most in terms of rent control regulation. Obviously, Prop 13 is always out there. How do you underwrite potential long-term rent growth or at least handicap those risks to the top line and I guess the expense line? As you're looking at new assets going forward, especially given big election coming up and a lot seems to be on the table.
Rylan Burns: Jamie, yes, that's a fair question. I mean, at a high level, we believe the -- the cost of Hawkins regulations coming up this November. Again, we can go into some more detail. But historically, that has been resoundingly defeated and there's our base case that, that is going to happen again this year. Now we will look at -- there are specific submarkets that have rent control and that occasion will propose specific rent control, and we'll certainly factor that into our rent growth assumptions. But at a high level, our expectation is driven by our economic research model, and we are not anticipating any change to statewide rent regulation in the near term.
James Feldman: Okay. So you'll underwrite greater than 5% growth over the long term across any of your markets?
Rylan Burns: Assets, it's all on a case-by-case basis, but that's certainly feasible. And given AB-1482 that is certainly achievable. So we know that that's certainly possible. I would say, a possibility that is not our base case typically when we're looking at these market rent growth, we are thinking over the long term. And so they're closer to our long-term averages. And then in some instances, where again, some submarkets in Northern California where the affordability metrics, the future look on supply as well as some positive traction we're seeing in terms of potential demand. Those are the types of investments where we might be a little bit more aggressive in the near term as a catch-up on rent.
James Feldman: And then just thinking about your comments on the urban markets getting a little healthier on the turn. Like do you think you might get more -- you could get more aggressive, find better value buying in the urban markets now given what you think you're seeing or do you think you'll keep the portfolio balance? I know you kind of buy what you can get that hits your IRRs. But is there a play there of getting more aggressive in the cities, given that they've been more challenged?
Rylan Burns: It's certainly something that we're evaluating. We've seen much fewer transactions in the urban core across our markets, but they're starting to see some more product come to market, and that's something that we're certainly evaluating. Again, the majority of our portfolio located in great suburban markets near transportation nodes. That's kind of our bread and butter, but we will look at anything and everything has a price. So we are excited to potentially see some more opportunities throughout all of our markets in the coming quarters.
James Feldman: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Connor Mitchell : Thanks for taking my question. So there's been a lot of discussion on the bidding wars and cover environment and a lot of transaction activity. Just thinking about that and then maybe also the prospect of Fed rate cuts. Just wondering, does that increase opportunities for the preferred and mezzanine business investments? Or are you guys kind of weighing more on the acquisition opportunity still.
Rylan Burns: Yes. As you can see from our activity to date, we've been very focused on acquiring high-quality fee simple ownership properties and not that's kind of our base case. We are open to the preferred and the mezz investments, and we are pursuing several. So it's not that we've shut that off. That's really a large portion historically of our mezz investments have come as a result of development opportunities. So as the development pipeline has slowed considerably in the past year. There's just fewer opportunities for us to deploy in the prep space. So we are open, and I think we're well known within our markets as being a great partner for that product, and so we will continue to pursue. But as a result of supply coming down and the new development starts coming down, there's just been fewer opportunities.
Connor Mitchell: Okay, appreciate it. And then in the opening comments, I think it would discuss the strength of Seattle. It's seeing less of an impact from supply and some more return to office. Just wondering if you guys can give an outlook on those two items for the Seattle market going forward in the back half of the year?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, thanks. Seattle is an interesting market in that it's one of our more evolving markets because of supply. And what's interesting here is we originally had expected Seattle to continue to outperform in the second half. But now the supply got pushed it's going to end up being an offset because Seattle last year in the second half had fallen quite a bit. And so it has this odd combination of easier year-over-year comp, but now more supply. So it probably often to something neutral and slightly better.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim : Thank you. I wanted to follow up a couple of times rather than mentioned cap rates in mid- to high 4% range and rent growth expectations Rylan, I think you mentioned with a lot the rents were 15% pre-COVID levels. Is that the level of rent growth that you and competitive buyers are looking at today on acquisitions?
Rylan Burns: Just for clarity, those rents are about 15% below pre-COVID levels, and we are not anticipating that snaps back tomorrow, but we know that given the strong income growth we've seen in this submarket as well as what we feel is coming through the COVID and slowdown in the tech market that the fundamental setup is attractive, and I wouldn't be surprised if we recovered those rent growth within several years. So that is a factor. As to what our peers are doing, we are seeing some assets trade that we're not -- we're staying disciplined on at levels that don't make a lot of sense to us. So I do think there are other participants in the market underwriting even more aggressive rent growth in some of these submarkets. So it's difficult to parse through exactly what our competitors are underwriting. But in general, it feels like there's been a lot of capital demand and excitement about Northern California, given the fundamental setup that we've been talking about for a couple of years now.
John Kim: And it seems on this call, there's been a lot of discussion on pricing power and some favorable trends your rent-to-income ratios are improving in your markets, and it seems to be some of the lowest in the country. Should we think about renewal rates exceeding the 5% that you've been getting recently?
Angela Kleiman: John, if we had reached our peak, then that would be more of a likelihood. But at this point, what we're seeing is renewal rates trending downward. And relative to the prior months, it's been gradual. So the good news is it's not a huge deceleration. But from June to July, it's about 30-ish basis point cell and renewal ultimately will converge toward market rent. So that will be possible if suddenly there's a massive amount of job growth and demand and that -- and then the market rents take off, but that's not a likely scenario that we are seeing at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David [indiscernible] with Essex Property Trust.
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. I was curious if you could provide some color on what is changing with the multifamily supply forecast and whether some deliveries are being pushed into next year. And to the extent that you can comment on the outlook for 2025 supply growth relative to this year. Thank you.
Barb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. So in -- as it relates to our 2024 forecast for supply, some properties in really Southern California were delayed more than we thought. And it's about 2,700 units effectively were pushed into next year. And in Seattle, some of our delay adjustments were too hard and they're delivering this year. So we pushed up some of the Seattle supply by about 2,000. So there's net a small reduction to our supply for multifamily this year. And then as we look to next year, we think Southern California will be slightly higher because of the delays that occurred this year. Northern California will be pretty neutral to this year, San Jose up slightly, but offset by lower supply in Oakland and then Seattle pretty neutral. So overall, it's going to be up a little bit, but our forecast right now calls for supply to be very muted 50 basis points of total stock, similar to this year, so no material change.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And I'm curious, how does the delinquency issues in your portfolio compared to the broader market? And to what degree could delinquencies and the rest of the market still create some overhang in terms of competition for newly listed units.
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. We have very little visibility when it comes to the broader market. The one thing that we can tell is that when the entire state of California was going through the -- started going through the delinquency process, the court had a huge backlog, and it took about 12 months to process it and now it's down less than six months. And that's been a direct correlation to our ability to recover delinquent units and the related improvement in that area. And so as we see this improvement continues and as Barb mentioned, it could be lumpy. But if you look at it over blocks of time, say, a three-month period, it has continued pretty steadily. It wouldn't -- it would be surprising for that delinquency to increase suddenly and it's extremely. Obviously, the core processing time is key. And so as long as that whole study, then we should be in good shape.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hello everyone. Just want to talk about the developer environment right now on the West Coast. It's been a very tough cycle. Are you seeing any developers exit the market permanently?
Rylan Burns: Yes. I think there was news actually just last week of an Atlanta-based developer that's decided to pull out of the West Coast. And given this is not surprise to us given what we've long said is a very challenging environment to develop in. So we're aware of it. And to be honest, we're not that concerned, fewer developers means less competitive product in the near future and should create additional opportunities for Essex.
Wes Golladay: Yes, that's what I was kind of going with. I mean I think you mentioned you had a -- you're targeting 100 basis point spread versus acquisitions as I figured you might be able to develop more countercyclical at this time. Can you comment on where your spread would be today, how much further it has to go?
Rylan Burns: That estimate is current today. Again, it's all dependent on our fundamental outlook for the specific submarket where we can acquire land at a regional basis that can really drive the numbers. And then we're tracking hard costs very closely. So I'd say we're closer today than we've been in many years. We haven't started a new development in almost four years. And so -- we've been really disciplined. We know it's very challenging to effectively develop and create value for shareholders through that process. So we're going to continue to be very disciplined. But the company has a long history of stepping in at bottom of the cycle, and we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to rebuild that pipeline in the near future.
Wes Golladay: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ami Probandt with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Ami Probandt: Hi, thanks. Bad debt ticked up a bit in Southern California, excluding L.A. County. So I'm wondering if that's lumpiness or if you're seeing residents potentially having difficulty paying or potentially signs or resurgence and bad actors.
Barb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. The numbers do bounce around month-to-month, that's why we tend not to like to publish the monthly numbers because there is noise every month. So we're not overly concerned about it, nothing to flag there. It's just monthly noise.
Ami Probandt: Great. Thanks for confirming. And then in terms of move-outs, have there been any notable changes recently in reasons for move out?
Angela Kleiman: This is Angela here. Our reasons to move-out has remained steady. It's mostly job changes or change in households and that's remained relatively consistent.
Ami Probandt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Angela for closing remarks.
Angela Kleiman: Well, thank you all for joining the Essex call and for all your questions, and we look forward to seeing all of you real soon.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. 
 Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer; for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman. You may begin. 
Angela Kleiman: Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex's first quarter earnings call. Barb Park will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. 
 We are pleased to kick off our 2024 earnings with a notable increase in our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by solid first quarter results with core FFO per share of 4.9%, exceeding the high end of our original guidance. Barb will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment.
 Today, my comments will focus on market fundamentals and operational highlights, followed by an update on the investment market. Heading into 2024, consensus forecast was a slowdown for the U.S. and so far, U.S. job growth has trended better than initial forecast. Job quality, on the other hand, has been concentrated in government and low-wage service sectors. 
 In the West Coast, the tech industry is a primary source of high-paying jobs and job growth in this industry has led because of evolving business strategies as companies reallocate resources to artificial intelligence opportunities. However, we have seen encouraging signs, including a steady increase in job openings in our markets by the top 20 tech companies. As for our near-term outlook, recent information data and Fed commentary have resulted in elevated uncertainty regarding the path of interest rate cuts. 
 With this in mind, we do not anticipate an imminent improvement in job growth in the high-paying sectors, which is typically the key catalyst to accelerate demand for housing and rent growth. While job growth on the West Coast has remained soft. Our steady performance year-to-date is attributed to 2 factors: first, limited housing supply. This is a significant structural benefit and a pillar of our California investment thesis.
 Lengthy and costly entitlement process effectively deters housing supply. To this point, total housing permits as a percentage of stock continues to remain well below 1% in Essex, California markets. Our performance today demonstrates this supply advantage. It is a key stabilizer during soft demand periods and a driver of rent growth outcomes over the long term. 
 The second positive factor is rental affordability which is driven by wages growing faster than rents in FX markets. Additionally, the cost of homeownership continues to rise. The median cost of owning a home is 2.5x more expensive than renting in our markets. Likewise, the percentage of our turnover attributed to purchasing a home has fallen from around 12% historically to 5% today. Accordingly, rental affordability supports a long runway for rent growth in the FX markets.
 Turning to first quarter operations. We achieved a 2.2% growth in blended lease rates, which consists of 10 basis points on new leases and 3.9% on renewals. Our new lease rates are tempered by delinquency-related turnover in LA and Alameda, which comprise of approximately 25% of our total same-store portfolio. If we excluded these 2 regions, new lease rates would have been 150 basis points higher at 1.6%. 
 Moving on to regional highlights. Seattle was our best-performing region, achieving blended rates of 3.6% with new lease rate growth of 1.3%.  New lease rates turned positive in February, led by the east side and the positive trend has continued. Northern California was our second best performing region with 2.1% blended rate growth and flat new lease rates. San Mateo was our strongest market, offset by the east side, which remained challenged, primarily from delinquency impact in Alameda County. Excluding Alameda County, new lease rates in Northern California would have been 70 basis points. 
 As for Southern California, this region continues to be a steady performer, generating blended rate growth of 1.7%, with negative 30 basis points in new lease rates caused by delinquency in Los Angeles. Excluding Los Angeles, average new lease rates would have been positive 3.1% in Southern California. Along with the improvement in eviction processing time, our operations and support teams have done an excellent job recovering long-term delinquent units at a faster pace, which has led to lower delinquency. We welcome this trend and continue to proactively build occupancy in anticipation of recapturing more units in this region. We view this temporary trade-off as net beneficial to long-term revenue growth.
 As for current operating conditions, at the end of April, we are in a solid position with 96% occupancy heading into peak leasing season. Concessions for the portfolio averaged only 3.5 days. And aside from areas with delinquency headwinds discussed earlier, we see opportunities to increase rental rates throughout our portfolio.
 Lastly on the  transaction market. Deal volume remains thin compared to recent years, and we continue to see strong investor demand for multifamily properties in our markets. with cap rates ranging from mid-4% for core to mid 5% for value-add communities. Against this backdrop of limited transaction volume, we have created external growth opportunities, generating FFO and NAV per share accretion through our joint venture platform. 
 In the first quarter, we purchased our partner's interest in a $505 million joint venture portfolio that will produce almost $2 million of FFO accretion for us in 2024. In fact , since inception, our private equity platform has delivered a 20% IRR and over $160 million to promote income for our shareholders and remains an attractive alternative source of capital. 
 In conclusion, we intend to pursue growth through acquisitions while maintaining our disciplined capital allocation strategy and our core principle of generating accretion to create significant value for our shareholders.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb. 
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter results, provide an update on key changes to our full year guidance followed by comments on investment activities, capital markets and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 in the first quarter. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher same-property revenue growth, which accounted for $0.06 of the $0.09 [ beat ]. The first quarter also benefited from onetime lease termination fees within our commercial portfolio totaling $0.02, which are not expected to reoccur for the remainder of the year. 
 Turning to our full year guidance revisions. As a result of the strong start to the year, we are increasing the midpoint of same-property revenue growth by 55 basis points to 2.25%. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, delinquency has improved faster than our original expectations, which accounts for 40 basis points of the revision. We now project delinquency to be 1.1% of scheduled rent for the year. 
 The second factor relates to higher other income as we have been successful at optimizing our portfolio through various initiatives, which has led to 15 basis points of better growth. While we are trending slightly ahead of our expectations on blended lease growth so far this year, especially on renewals, we have not factored any revision into our guidance as we want to get further into peak leasing season when we sign the bulk of our leases. 
 The other key driver of our full year guidance revision relates to the consolidation of our partnership in the BEXAEW joint venture, which accounts for $0.03 of FFO accretion. And as Angela highlighted, this acquisition reinforces the value Essex has created for shareholders through our joint venture platform as well as our ability to grow externally in an otherwise challenging market. In total, we are raising core FFO by $0.20 per share, a 1.3% increase at the midpoint.
 Turning to our preferred equity investments. Subsequent to quarter end, we assume the sponsor's common equity interest affiliated with a preferred equity investment. This investment was previously on our watch list and was placed on nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2023. As such, this transaction is beneficial to our 2024 core FFO forecast. The property is located adjacent to an existing Essex community, which will allow us to operate it efficiently within our collections model. Overall, we view the outcome favorably given that quality of the asset, our initial yield and our long-term view on the growth in the Sunnyvale submarket.
 Turning to Capital Markets. In March, we issued $350 million in 10-year unsecured bonds to refinance the last remaining portion of the company's 2024 debt maturities and to partially fund the BEXAEW transaction. We are pleased to have locked in 5.5% fixed rate debt in today's volatile interest rate environment.
 As it relates to equity, the company did not issue common stock to fund our year-to-date investments nor do we plan to issue equity at our current stock price. We have alternative sources of equity capital, such as retained cash flow and preferred equity redemption proceeds from last year and expected this year that can fund up to $400 million in investments, including transactions completed to date without the need for new equity.
 We will continue to look at all our sources of equity capital, including disposition proceeds or joint ventures in order to maximize growth in core FFO and NAV per share while preserving our balance sheet strength. We have been prudent stewards of shareholder capital over our 30-year history, which has served our shareholders well. 
 In conclusion, Essex is in a strong financial position. Our leverage levels remain healthy with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.4x, and we have over $1 billion in available liquidity. As such, we are well equipped to act as opportunities arise. 
 I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: You guys flagged the impacted select submarkets are having on your new lease rate growth this year, but I'm just curious if that overhang has been lifted in L.A. and Alameda or if you think that the continued improvement in sort of the long-term delinquency continues to have an impact or impacts others in the market, and you could continue to see kind of that weighing on -- are those markets weighing on new lease rate growth moving forward? 
Angela Kleiman: Austin, it's Angela here. You kind of cracked up in the earlier part of the question, but I believe you're asking whether the LA Alameda overhang is going to continue on new lease rates? 
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, that's correct. 
Angela Kleiman: Okay. Great. What we're expecting is that L.A. is going to continue to provide -- be an overhang on the delinquency. Alameda improvement is steady, and it's a smaller part of our portfolio. So the heavier influence is really coming from L.A. just because when you have such a large volume that we're working through, it's going to take a longer period of time. The good news is that we are not seeing that bleeding into other markets. So it's really more focused in L.A. and our other markets are doing quite well. 
Austin Wurschmidt: So how should we think about, I guess, when you guys underwrote at the beginning of the year, you had a relatively tight spread in your new versus renewal lease rates. You flagged renewals are trending better, but that's been a little bit volatile, which I suspect is due to some factors on the comp month by month. But can you just give us a sense of or kind of updated thoughts on how you think the 2 of those trend from here? 
Angela Kleiman: Yes, sure thing. No, we have not reforecasted yet just because it is important to see how peak leasing season activities progress and because that's where the bulk of our leases occur at that point in time. So our data is with a few months into the year and a smaller set of leasing terms is turning. It's more limited. But having said that, what we're seeing right now is that Seattle and Northern California are trending slightly ahead of our original market rent forecast. Southern California is generally planned, but there is an LA drag.  
 And so because it's not a huge outperformance relative to plan at this point. The outperformance is really mostly in the benefits from delinquency that we're getting the -- recovering the units much faster in other income, it's once again, it's just too early to try to reforecast where market rents is going to be. I do want to say that with our performance on delinquency and our ability to essentially turn those units quickly. It speaks to the underlying fundamentals of our market, so that is quite solid. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Maybe more specifically, I mean trying to get to this in the question a little bit, but can you just give us a sense where renewals are going out for the next couple of months? That would be helpful. And then that's all for me. 
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. So renewal rates for, say, May and June, they're going out in kind of that low to mid-4% range. They average for the portfolio around 4.3%. And we do -- there is some negotiations there. And what we try to do is anticipate where the market is going to be. And because we are seeing that we are trending slightly ahead, we, of course, are going to push renewals wherever possible. But keep in mind, our approach on renewals is still same as before. We are setting market appropriate pricing and with the goal of maximizing revenues. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. 
Daniel Tricarico: It's Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. Angela, you talked about the jobs backdrop in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could expand on the tech hiring trends in your markets? Are you seeing any green shoots from AI companies starting to take office space? Or general tech companies more active in return to work. Just want to understand the current state of the demand backdrop that many are hoping, obviously, including yourselves to drive an acceleration in the recovery within the Northern California and even Seattle markets. 
Angela Kleiman: Daniel, it's a good question there. We are seeing anecdotally hybrid workers moving closer to the office to essentially trying to reduce the commute because traffic has picked up. And -- we are seeing also the top 20 tech openings increasing, although it's very gradual. And so what we're seeing is that these job openings bottomed last year during the first quarter, and the opening was only about, say, 8,000 jobs. Today, in March, it's about 16,000 jobs. So it doubled but it is well below our pre-COVID average. The 3-year run rate was about 25,000.
 So hopefully, that gives you some sense of how things -- what we're seeing is that the fundamentals are moving in the right direction. But in order for acceleration to occur, we really need to see a more robust pickup on the high-paying jobs. And we do believe that we have the fundamental backdrop for that to occur. It just it's all about when, and that's the big question on our mind. 
Daniel Tricarico: Yes. I wanted to follow up on the Seattle market. It saw a nice sequential increase in occupancy and revenues in Q1. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing throughout the different submarkets, maybe give a breakdown of your portfolio, urban versus suburban exposure? And where you're expecting to see the greatest magnitude and timing of new supply in that market? 
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing, Daniel. We are predominantly in -- on the east side, so over 60% of our portfolio is more suburban in nature and the east side. And what that means is because supply is predominantly in the CBD, we are more insulated from that. And we -- so we're seeing much better activities coming from the east side of our portfolio. And where things are trending right now, we are seeing some demand -- some demand growth, which is healthy, which is a good indicator at this point.
 Downtown seems to be doing okay. It's holding its own. And what we expect is the cadence of supply to occur some more time between now and next quarter in terms of the bulk of the delivery. But as we've all experienced in this market that can get slightly pushed by a month or 2 in our markets, but that's what we're expecting at this point in time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. 
Nicholas Joseph: It's Nick here with Eric. Angela, you mentioned kind of what's happening in L.A. and the overhang and kind of getting the units back, which obviously is a good thing, medium and longer term. Just curious if you've changed the underwriting in that market specifically to make sure you're rented to tenants that are going to be paying the rent? 
Angela Kleiman: Nick, Rylan will talk about how we're underwriting activities in our various markets, including L.A. 
Rylan Burns: Nick, I think there's a higher degree of caution as it relates to what we're seeing in L.A. Thankfully, a double edge or we have a lot of exposure to that market. So I think we have pretty good data. And as we've shown over the past year or 2, we know how we are turning these delinquent units back into rent paying units and how quickly that can occur. So I feel like we've got pretty nuanced underwriting as it relates to L.A. market, but it is something that we're certainly factoring in. 
Angela Kleiman: Yes, Nick. And as it relates to the actual tenant underwriting itself for leasing activities, we have not needed to make any material change. Obviously, from building to building, there are always nuances and the tenant background and credit. We set a very solid bar for our credit. What has happened with delinquency really is not related to our underwriting. It's really a legislation result because eviction moratorium went on for so long. And then all the courts are backed up in terms of processing these evictions which is why the whole time line to get out these nonpaying tenants became prolonged. And so in terms of -- if you're talking about, say, new tenants going delinquent, we're not seeing that as a material problem at all. 
Nicholas Joseph: Okay. Yes. That's exactly what I was asking about. So you're not seeing anything from new tenants? This is definitely more of a residual of what you've seen before because it seems like the bad debt has certainly been improving pretty rapidly recently. It feels like April was even better than the first quarter. 
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that's correct, Nick. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Angela, just going back a few questions back to the demand and jobs and tech jobs. What do you think is more the reason for this if tech is still sort of sluggish on the hiring front, would you say it's more about sort of markets returning to normalcy more about people, let's say, in Southern Cal enjoying that lifestyle? Or is this really just a function of housing shortage. And we can talk about all these other factors, but the reality is the lack of housing, the single-family slowdown, meaning since the credit crisis, the shortage, that's really the dominant driver. And therefore, all these other items that we talk about are sort of on the margin, but it's really the housing shortage that's driving the stronger-than-expected recovery in apartments. 
Angela Kleiman: Alex, that is an excellent point and, good job. You've been paying attention. What we are seeing is that the supply definitely is a significant benefit for our markets, and it's something that we've been stating for several years now, in that we don't need much demand for us to achieve our plan and to have a healthy performing market. And so these other incremental benefits are great signs in terms of whether it's moving a return to office.  
 We are seeing continued improvements in both domestic and international migration and in fact, we're showing a positive population growth for the first time in 3 years. So all these little anecdotal data on the margin is hopeful. But in terms of really driving acceleration, the other -- the high-paying job growth will need to kick in. But our markets are going to do just fine. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is just an update on the whole -- you have a third attempt on overturning Costa-Hawkins sort of, I guess, 6 months out. Is there a sense for -- what's the sense on the advocacy front, where both sides stand. And obviously, Gavin Newsom has been big into promoting new housing. But are there major political forces coming out in support of low returning Costa-Hawkins? Or the majority of the political might out of Sacramento is supporting -- keeping Costa-Hawkins against the ballot initiative? 
Angela Kleiman: Alex, that is an important question. What we are seeing is the vast majority of the legislature are not supporting overturning Costa-Hawkins. So they're on our side. And because they recognize, especially in our market, we have an acute shortage of housing. And so that is not -- that is an antigrowth initiative. We have maintained our coalition to support reasonable legislation and especially relating to housing. And of course, this proposal has been defeated overwhelmingly twice, and we just have not seen anything that shows that will be different this time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. 
James Feldman: If we ran our numbers right, it looks like your new lease rate growth was flat or even slightly declined month-over-month from March to April. So I guess first question, is that correct? And secondly, if it is correct, we're just wondering what drove the lower acceleration? And how do you expect that to trend into May? 
Barb Pak: Jamie, it's Barb. Yes, that's really driven by L.A. and Alameda between March and April. And once again, it's delinquency-related challenges which is ultimately a benefit to our revenues because we get those units back and can lease into a rent-paying tenant. And -- but if you pull out those 2, we did see a sequential increase. So I think it was primarily just driven by L.A. Alameda. 
James Feldman: Okay. And then Secondly, the acquisition in your JV in the quarter seemed like a great opportunity. You didn't have to reassess your tax basis, you already had majority ownership. Can you just talk about the opportunities to continue doing deals like that? And then also just more broadly, I thought your comments on the transaction market were pretty interesting. I think you said 4.5% core cap rates. Can you just talk more about what's going on in the transaction market in terms of buyer interest? I think a lot of your peers have said things have pretty much taken a pause. So curious what you're seeing on the ground and your thoughts on putting capital to work. 
Rylan Burns: Jamie, Rylan here. On the first point, we do have significant opportunities to continue to acquire from our joint venture partnerships. What we are going to do, however, is try to make the best capital allocation decision we can at any given point in time. So at the start of this year, this was a joint venture that was maturing, and we had the opportunity to purchase our partner's interest and it made sense. It was accretive for our shareholders, and that's why we decided to elect that route.
 So we have a pretty deep joint venture business that we can continue to look for opportunities, but we are not solely focused on one or the other. We're trying to find the highest and best returning investments that we can find.
 As it relates to the transaction market, I think what you've been hearing is generally correct. The volumes continue to be very low as they were all of last year approximately 1/5 of the transaction volumes we saw in '21 and '22. What we're seeing this year is there was an ample amount of capital looking to be put to work in particular, from our focus on the West Coast in multifamily. So there's a bit of a scarcity premium for well-located suburban product that's coming to market.
 And so you are seeing very competitive bidding pools for the few transactions that have made it to market. And our expectation is that, that is going to continue. So we're tracking a couple of deals right now. We have very deep bidder pools, both levered and unlevered buyers and I think some of our public investors would be surprised at where these transaction cap rates are going to come out. So more to come there. 
James Feldman: Great. Does that motivate you to sell more? 
Rylan Burns: It's certainly something we're considering. Again, we are trying to grow the portfolio, but we need to be cautious about where we where our highest and best use of capital can be. So we have both opportunities that we are evaluating. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. 
Joshua Dennerlein: I want to go back to your comments, Angela, about where you're sending out May and June renewals. It sounded like mid to low 4s. If I recall correctly on the last call, 4Q, I think renewals, your guidance was assuming like a slowing to like market rent growth, like the 1.25%. Is this kind of what was expected in guidance? Or is that ahead of schedule? And just like how should we think about like the cadence for the rest of the year? 
Angela Kleiman: Josh, we are slightly ahead of schedule. And what we haven't done is because we have not reforecasted, it's a little too early to talk about the actual cadence. And -- but I will say that we're ahead of schedule everywhere else except for L.A. and Alameda. So I do want to caveat that. But the things are doing fine right now. 
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And what's your -- could you remind us what your typical like negotiation spread is on those renewals, they come back to you, they're signed before you send them out? 
Angela Kleiman: Yes, it could range anywhere from 0 depending on market strength to, say, close to 100 basis points depending on what else is going on. It could be supply, it could be jobs environment, a whole host of things. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. 
Haendel St. Juste: A couple of quick ones for me. I guess, first of all, I'm curious, if there's any remaining benefit to your renewal rates from the burn off of concessions? Or is that a tailwind that's now behind us? 
Angela Kleiman: Haendel, there's a little bit in May and then no more in June and July. 
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And where is the overall loss and lease of the portfolio today? And maybe if you could break that down by region? 
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. So loss to lease for the Essex portfolio in April is about 20 basis points. So nothing exciting there once again. But keep in mind, we have a L.A-Alameda overhang. So if you exclude L.A. Alameda. Loss to lease will be a little over 1%. And just to compare to last year, around April, loss lease was 80 basis points. So absent of L.A. Alameda, things are looking slightly better. We're not talking about massive acceleration, but it is slightly better. So in terms of just the disbursement, Seattle has the best loss lease at about 80 basis points; Northern California, about 10 basis points; and Southern California about 10 basis points. So that gives you kind of the range where things stand. 
Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate the color. And then last one, just on the -- maybe talking about the health of the mezz book, I think you put 2 loans on watch list last quarter. So maybe talk about your -- the book or your perception of the credit risk there and maybe your overall interest in adding to the book today, especially with rates looking to stay higher for longer? 
Barb Pak: Haendel, yes. It's Barb. So on our last call, we had 5 that were either on nonaccrual status or on our watch list. And then we've obviously taken back one of those in the first quarter. So we're down to 4. And of those 4 assets, 3 of them have loans maturing in the next 2 to 3 quarters. So we'll have an outcome there sooner rather than later, I believe. On the other asset, there's one other asset that we're having productive conversations with the sponsor to contribute additional equity, which will put us in a safer position in the capital stack.
 On that one, we will likely have more information on our next call on that one. So net-net, it's trended a little bit more favorably in terms of the amount that it's on our watch list. Nothing new was added. The book continues to perform. None of them -- none of our sponsors are in default with the senior lender or with us. And so the sponsorship really does matter here and we have really good sponsors. So no new updates. 
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And then your thought process perhaps on adding? Or is that not being considered at the moment? 
Barb Pak: Yes, that includes adding anything new. We go through a comprehensive review of the portfolio every quarter. And we scrub it. And so yes, that does include that process. So there was no new added to the watch list this quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. 
John Kim: Barb, just following up on that. So what is the earnings impact of consolidating Sunnyvale. I realize there's no impact from the impairment, but you've already had that on nonaccrual. So I would imagine be accretive going forward? 
Barb Pak: Yes. So in our 2024 initial forecast, we didn't assume any accrual on the Sunnyvale asset. So it was a 0 in our forecast. Now given that we consolidated it, we did pay off the debt. We think it's about a $0.05 benefit this year. Keep in mind, it's a small asset and then growing from there as we see better rent growth. 
John Kim: Okay. And can you quantify how much of the first quarter blended spreads benefited from reduced concessions on a year-over-year basis? And just remind us how that trends for the remainder of the year. 
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. John, it's Angela here. So first quarter concessions pickup impacted renewals by about 60 basis points. And then we're -- what we're seeing in April -- Barb, do you have them in front of you? 
Barb Pak: Yes, it's about the same. 
Angela Kleiman: Okay. April is about the same is 60 basis points. And obviously, May, we don't know yet, but we know that we have concessions burning off in June, July, August will be flat and a slight pickup in September and into the fourth quarter, but not much. 
John Kim: So second and third quarter -- end of second and third quarter last year is when you started to really reduce concession? 
Angela Kleiman: Yes, yes, which is typical. And definitely second quarter and into -- a little bit into the third quarter, and then it picks up again in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. 
Adam Kramer: I wanted to ask about maybe a little bit about some of the demographics of your renters and thinking about the different jobs kind of your job growth commentary earlier on in the call in the opening comments. I think you kind of mentioned that the tech industry and some of the higher-paying jobs having really recovered. I think people typically think of your portfolio as more Class B, right, a little bit more suburban, a little bit more Class B. Maybe just walk us through whether it's your tech exposure, whether it's the type of renters that are renting with you guys and maybe a little bit more just about the specific jobs that are within your tenant base? And how has job growth fared among those different industries? 
Angela Kleiman: Yes. Sure thing, Adam. Our tech exposure hasn't changed too much. it's about somewhere around mid 5% of our total portfolio, of course, much higher in Seattle than Northern California and very little in Southern California. And so when you look at our portfolio as a whole, it's actually quite diversified. And what that means is a job is coming through all the different industries. And so recently, the growth -- in job growth has really been in government and health and education services. And so we see that the impact throughout our portfolio. 
Adam Kramer: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And the implication would be there's fewer renters within your tenant base from those government and other service teacher types of industries. Would that be the kind of implication? 
Angela Kleiman: Well, Adam, I think what I was trying to say is that our tenant pool is pretty well diverse and there's employers from all job sectors. It mirrors the U.S. pretty well with the exception of higher professional services, generally speaking. And so we're not going to be that different. And of course, with the Northern region having a higher concentration in tech, that's the one benefit. 
Adam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful, Angela. Maybe just switching gears. Look, I think the commentary around -- I think you kind of mentioned you didn't buy back any shares, but also an issue in your equity -- maybe just walk us through how you kind of view your equity cost of capital today and kind of the other potential cost of the other potential capital sources and cost of capital there, whether it's -- and again, financial a little bit, but just kind of capital allocation strategy from here? Is this more kind of an asset-light approach in asset late year, if you will? 
Barb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. No, it's a good question. I mean you have seen us in the past, buy back stock when we're trading at significant discounts to NAV. And and we can accretively sell an asset and ARP the difference between public and private market pricing. I think today, we don't love our stock. We haven't issued a stock or common stock in many years because of where we're trading relative to where we think the value is trading. 
 And to Ryland's point, where we're seeing private markets trade our cost of equity capital is not an attractive source for us, and we will look to other alternatives. We have free cash flow, the preferred redemptions and then look at where we can sell assets or JVs, if our stock price is still not where we like it, if there's an alternative acquisition opportunity or alternative source of use of those proceeds. So we've done this for -- since the founding of the company, we've always looked at all the sources of capital and will remain disciplined on that front. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. 
Brad Heffern: A couple on the press book. Can you give the yield that you ended up at on Sunnyvale and also say how much debt you paid off as a part of that process? 
Barb Pak: Yes. So our yield is 4.75%. It is a high-quality condo-style property. And Essex because we own the property next store, we can operate it much more efficiently than the prior owner. And then in terms of the debt payoff, it was about $32 million in debt that was paid off. 
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then, Barb, can you give the interest income that's associated with the assets that are not being accrued? Just what that would be if they paid? 
Barb Pak: If -- for the 4 assets that are nonaccrual, I don't have that in front of me. I would have to -- I have to follow up with you offline on that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. 
Richard Anderson: No, no. Wedbush. So I have a question on the dividend increase. I know you guys are a dividend aristocrat, which sounds great. but you also are counting on free cash flow as a source of capital in the absence of raising equity, you mentioned that upfront. I'm curious how married you are to this annual increase to the dividend, particularly now when cash is king and free cash flow is important to you more now so than ever, perhaps. So if you can comment on the dividend policy going forward and staying on this Aristocrat list. 
Barb Pak: Rich, it's Barb. It is very important for us to stay on the dividend aristocrat list and maintain the dividend and continue to increase it. We do like free cash flow, but we also have a lot of planning that goes on behind the scenes in terms of how we do raise our dividend. And we do target a certain percent of our FFO and our AFFO yield to go out as a percent of the dividend payment. So all that gets factored into how much we increase the dividend annually. And it won't be 6% every year. It just does depend on a variety of things behind the scenes that are going on. But maintaining the dividend and keeping our long history of increasing it every year is something that's very important to the company. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And my second question is understanding the makeup of job growth has not been your sweet spot yet to this point. But I'm wondering when you think of the jobs that are being created, do they have no shot to being a resident with you guys? Or could there be a situation where they would qualify in a doubling up scenario? I'm just curious to the extent there is some areas of the job growth market that don't immediately look great to Essex, but is there a path to them becoming residents nonetheless because of some sort of set up like that? 
Angela Kleiman: Rich, it's Angela here. That's a good question because when we look at the median income, it actually is pretty darn good, and it matches the profile of our property quite well. And so we're -- it's my way of saying we don't have an issue with the demographics in that they can't qualify for our properties because within a market, we have a diversified pool. So even though we're solely in the West Coast, within each submarket, we do have different levels of properties where tenants can qualify. And the quality of jobs I'm speaking to really more relates to our ability to accelerate rent growth. And that's the key when I'm talking about the high paying jobs. 
Operator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, this will conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Kleiman, you may begin.
Angela Kleiman: Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex fourth quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks; Rylan Burns and Jessica Anderson are here for Q&A. I will start with the key highlights of our 2023 performance then discuss our expectations for 2024, followed by comments on the transaction market and our investment strategy. Overall, 2023 was a solid year for Essex. We achieved a 4.4% same-property revenue growth for the full year, which is in line with our revised guidance and 40 basis points higher than the original midpoint. Furthermore, we made substantial progress in reducing delinquency as a percentage of rent from over 2% in the first quarter, down to 1.4% by year-end. These are the results of the well coordinated efforts of our hardworking operations and support teams across the company. Great job team, and thank you. Lastly, we continue to drive results to the bottom line, delivering a 3.6% year-over-year increase in core FFO per share, exceeding the high end of our original guidance range by $0.06. Turning to the fourth quarter, we deployed an occupancy focused strategy as market rents moderated generally consistent with typical seasonal pattern. In addition, we recovered a significant number of delinquent units starting in October. As expected, the subsequent backfilling of non-paying units during a seasonally slow period created a temporary headwind to net effective new lease rates, which averaged negative 1.7% for the quarter. On the renewal front, the positive trend continues with strong retention among our residents, generating an increase in renewal rates of 4.9% for the quarter, resulting in blended rates of positive 2.6%. As we start 2024, leasing activities in our markets is steady. In January, new lease net FX rates improved by 150 basis points and concession usage decreased by half since the fourth quarter, and our financial occupancy sits in a solid position of 96.2%. Moving on to our outlook for the West Coast in 2024 as outlined in our earnings package. We expect the US economy and job growth to normalize in 2024, consistent with economists' outlook of a soft landing. We forecast job growth on the West Coast to perform in line with the national average on the Essex markets to produce market rent growth of 1.25% on average. The consensus macroeconomic US assumptions and the quality of jobs are key considerations to our modest outlook. In 2023, the employment growth was largely concentrated in the service sectors, which did not yield meaningful rent growth. We expect this dynamic to continue, and we currently assume hiring of highly skilled workers to remain muted as companies continue to evaluate their labor needs and priorities. While our base case scenario for 2024 reflect tempered growth, there are several factors that could support a more positive outcome. First, inflation could continue to move in the right direction, increasing the likelihood that the Fed will pivot from tightening to easing. Accordingly, the economy could gain momentum and hiring of highly skilled workers reaccelerate as cost of capital becomes more attractive. Second, the large technology companies implemented significant business and labor retrenchments at the end of 2022 through the early part of last year. Therefore, these companies are better equipped today to lead advancements and stimulate growth. To this point, recent layoff announcements have been much smaller in scale with companies citing larger strategic plans to redirect talent and investments toward artificial intelligence projects, which we view as a long-term benefit for the West Coast. With low levels of housing supply in our markets, a modest increase in demand could accelerate rent growth. Despite uncertainties in the overall economy, we are confident in our market's ability to navigate near-term volatility and to outperform in the long term. Our conviction is based on two fundamental factors, low housing supply and favorable affordability. Over the next two years, we expect less than 1% of total supply growth per annum, which enables us to generate positive rent growth in most environments. Also, renting in the Essex markets is considerably more affordable than owning a home, and favorable rent-to-income ratios support a long runway for rent growth, especially in our Northern regions. As such, we expect the economic incentive to rent to persist and drive demand for multifamily housing. Lastly, on the investment market and our strategy. 2023 was a year of historically low transaction volume, primarily due to significant volatility in the capital markets. Although, we've seen interest rates decline throughout the fourth quarter, yield spread between buyers and sellers remain wide, ranging from approximately 25 to 50 basis points in our markets. And thus, we are not anticipating a significant increase in deal volume in the near term. Lenders have generally been accommodating to sponsors extending debt maturities when feasible, and there are very few four sellers in our markets currently. Given the thirst of data points, there is less certainty in the transaction market. It is during periods of uncertainty that Essex has historically created significant value for our shareholders through external growth. As such, our investment team is proactively looking for acquisition opportunities to generate the best risk-adjusted returns. We expect Essex's disciplined approach to capital allocation, strong balance sheet and deep market expertise will be key differentiators in creating long-term value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barbara.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss the key assumptions to our 2024 guidance and provide an update on the balance sheet. Beginning with our outlook for 2024, a key factor to our revenue forecast is our market rent growth assumption. As Angela mentioned, the economic backdrop is expected to be muted this year, which is leading to below average rent growth for our markets. As a result, same-property revenue growth is tempered at 1.7% at the midpoint on a cash basis. The key drivers of our revenue growth are outlined on Page S-17.1 of the supplemental. Our guidance assumes delinquency of 1.5% of schedule rents for the full year, which represents a 40 basis point improvement to year-over-year revenue growth. We expect delinquency will gradually improve as we move through the year. In terms of regional performance, we expect Southern California will produce our highest revenue growth at 3%, led by Orange County in San Diego. Northern California will be around 1%, and Seattle will be our weakest performing region, which is forecasted to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Moving to operating expenses. We are projecting 4.25% growth for the full year, which was largely driven by higher insurance costs. Although insurance costs account for a small portion of our total operating expenses, we are forecasting a 30% increase in our premiums, which adds 1.4% to our total same-property expense growth. The company remains focused on managing controllable expenses, which we are forecasting to increase 3% in 2024, primarily driven by higher wages. In total, we expect same-property NOI growth of 60 basis points and core FFO per share growth to be flat at the midpoint compared to 2023. Core FFO growth would be over 1% higher, if not for the impact from two items related to our preferred equity platform. First, in December, we received $40 million in redemption proceeds, and we are forecasting an additional $100 million in redemption proceeds for this year. We anticipate redeploying the funds into new acquisitions, which tempers our near-term FFO growth, but is the best long-term capital allocation decision for Essex. Second, while our sponsors remain current on all financial obligations with the senior lenders, we changed the accrual status on two investments in the fourth quarter based on current market conditions. Further, we've taken a prudent approach as to how we projected income for the remainder of the portfolio as part of our 2024 guidance. We will continue to evaluate the accrual status on each of our preferred equity investments every quarter as appropriate. Turning to the balance sheet. Essex is in a strong financial position with minimal financing needs over the next 12 months and ample sources of capital. Our leverage levels are solid with net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times, and we have over $1.6 billion of liquidity available to us. We manage our balance sheet and capital needs conservatively to be well positioned to create value throughout the cycle, and we remain optimistic, we will see opportunities to invest this year. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Just digging into guidance here. Can you share what your assumptions are for new and renewal lease rate growth are relative to the 1.25 market rent growth assumed and kind of how you're thinking about the cadence of that through the year? 
Barb Pak: Hi, Austin, it's Barb. Yes. So we're assuming 1.25 for new lease growth and renewals, we expect to be slightly above that at 1.75%. We do expect renewal growth will be in the first half of the year be above 2% in the low 2% range and then drift down to our market rent growth assumption of 1.25 in the back half of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: I guess just following quickly up on that, what's driving that really tight spread? Are there concessions burning off or anything that's impacting, I guess, the spread between new and renewal lease rates assumed in your guidance?
Barb Pak: Yes. So I think if you look at January, you'll see we printed 4.8% on new leases or renewals, but 50% of that is a burn-off of concessions, and so it's not really a new market rent growth. And I would say, our philosophy on renewals is not to push them above market. We do like to, we want to price them appropriately. And last year, in 2023, we didn't have a significant loss to lease. And so we don't have a big spread differential between our new and renewals from last year that would carry forward into this year. So we think it's priced appropriately.
Austin Wurschmidt : And if I can just sneak in one more. I recognize you guys report financial occupancy, but could you break out the impact from guidance around the occupancy change and then impact from concessions and maybe what market rent growth would look like on a net effective basis if you included the concession impact there? Thank you.
Barb Pak: Yes. So the concession piece on the occupancy and concessions, we expect concessions to be a 10 -- or 10 basis point headwind to our forecast this year, occupancy to be 20 basis points. So we're forecasting 96.2% for occupancy. So we don't expect concessions to have a material impact to the forecast this year on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. I guess, good morning out there. I noticed on the delinquency slide, I guess it's S-16, there was a big jump up in the delinquencies between the fourth quarter and January. And I know you talked about that overall trend getting better for the full year, I think, to the tune of 40 basis points. But just what color can you provide in January that showed that big pop?
Barb Pak: Hi, Steve, it's Barb. Yes, this January, we've seen for several years now. It's the post holiday. I think people are paying off their credit cards and whatnot. So it's not something that we're overly concerned about. We're monitoring it closely. But we have seen this last year, if you go back and you look at our supplemental, we saw 190 basis points increase from Q4 to January. This year, we're up 80%. So it is a lot lower than we were a year ago, but we're monitoring it.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. And then just, I guess, maybe on the DC or your -- I guess, your pref book. I mean just as you've kind of gone through and scrub sort of some of the things you talked about a couple of the underwriting changes. Like just what risk do you sort of see out there on the kind of roughly $500 million you've got outstanding? And I guess, how are you sort of handicapping that in terms of any future write-offs?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, Steve, this is Barb. We take a prudent approach when we look at this. And there's a variety of factors that we look at when we're looking at our preferred book, where are we -- where is our last dollar sit relative to the market today? What -- what's the maturity of our investments? And how much time do we have for the market to recover and really what is our sponsors doing? Are they continuing to put equity and can they continue to fund? So those are the factors that we're looking at. I think we have fully handicap the issue that we see today based on current market conditions within our guidance. It's a few assets we're monitoring. But for the most part, the book is performing as we expected.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Tricarico: Hey, it’s Daniel Tricarico on for Nick. Barb, with respect to the improvement in new lease rate growth in January, which markets were the largest drivers of that change? And I know you mentioned the 50 basis point improvement from concession burn-off, but is the general market improvement largely in line with typical seasonality?
Jessica Anderson: This is Jessica. I'll take that. With regards to the largest driver of the sequential improvement from Q4 to January, it was 150 basis points. We saw the greatest improvement in Northern California and the Bay Area. And a large part of that was concession burn-off. For the total portfolio, if you break down a 150 basis point improvement, 100 basis points of it is the improvement in concessions. So, we were averaging one week in Q4 and that's a half a week for January. And then the other part of it, 50 basis points is attributed to rent growth, which is typical with what we would expect this time of year historically.
Daniel Tricarico: Great. Thank you. Angela, follow-up. How are you thinking about recycling capital from your future pref equity redemptions into acquisitions or other use? You talked about optimism I believe in your opening remarks around a growing opportunity set. Are you seeing anything specific in the market today? And I guess, along the same lines, how are your JV partners thinking about deploying new capital into acquisitions today?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. As far as how we're reviewing investments. And let me just give you a quick background on our pref equity book. The investment thesis for this vehicle was it was intended to complement development pipeline during a period where yields and interest rates were low and construction costs were accelerating at a significant higher rate than rent growth. So, you saw us leaning into this business when the 10-year fell to historical low. And in that environment, a 12% yield was relatively more attractive. The general market environment and the interest rate conditions today are very different. And so we view that there's more upside to rent growth in our markets over the long run. So, the relative value is more compelling to focus on these simple acquisitions. So, it doesn't mean that we're shrinking the preferred equity book intentionally, but rather that this book will probably drift lower as we look to acquisitions as a way to grow the company. And the reason is because if you look at the fundamentals in our market, it all speaks to more upside relatively speaking, from rent growth. So, especially in our northern region, we have much lower supply. Affordability metrics is in the best position we've seen since we started tracking this metric historically. And there's -- the rent has yet to recover, so still in the recovery phase. And lastly, there is a demand optionality. I mean if you look at the composition of the companies in our markets, the seventh largest -- seven out of the 10 largest companies are located in our markets, and these are companies that have tremendous amount of wealth and looking -- and have committed to infrastructure and investment deployments. And so if you look at all the building blocks, it's there and it's right for acceleration once the economy shifts from a soft economy to a growth economy. And on the IRRs, Rylan, do you want to talk about the IRS?
Rylan Burns: Yeah. At a high level, I mean, we have several joint venture partners. We've been in this business for a long time and remain committed to us and our investment thesis along the West Coast. So there is demand there if we see the right opportunities. And we would expect we will see some opportunities in the next year or two.
Daniel Tricarico: All right. Thanks for the time guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I think you just mentioned that you saw the largest improvement in Northern California between 4Q and January and your peer, just mentioned something similar on their call a moment ago. So I was just curious why you think you'll see this muted rent growth environment throughout the year in Northern California, if you're already starting to see signs of a recovery during the seasonally weak period.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Eric, it's Angela here. On Northern California, it's really when we look at our market rent growth, it's a -- we do see potential upside. Having said that, that will require the tech companies to hire -- to resume their hiring in a more robust way. And so our forecast is really a function of the general market outlook, because we cannot disconnect from what's happening with the rest of the country. And in particularly, the North Cal region itself, it's really dampened by Oakland because of the amount of supply. And so if you look at the 1.25% market rent, composition. First of all, it's a narrow range, just given the overall economic environment. But our Southern California leads the portfolio and above that 1.25% and Seattle is a close second. But the drag is really Northern California, which is closer to 1%, so below that 1.25% average, and that's because Oakland is well-below that 1%. So that's the drag.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then as far as your renewals, when does the concession burn off, sort of, the comp get harder? And where are you sending renewals for the next couple of months if you exclude to that concession burn off?
Jessica Anderson: Eric, this is Jessica. As far as renewal burn off, Barb mentioned it earlier, right now, it's roughly 50/50, and it becomes less so with regards to concession burn-off as we progress through Q1. Our concession strategy last year, I think we averaged roughly half week free last year, and there were some lumpiness as we dealt with delinquent units. So we may see that show up periodically. But with regards to forward-looking renewals we've sent out February and March at roughly 3%, 3.5%, and it's a little bit less than 50/50. It's probably more like 60/40, and it will continue to progress that way like I said, unless we have pockets of heavy concession usage from last year.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon, actually good morning, it’s afternoon here. So two questions here. First, I do like the updated S-17, it's much simpler and I think brings the focus to just the data that you guys provide, so that's good. So two questions here. First, on the pref equity book, I'm assuming that you guys did not underwrite like low three cap deals at the peak or such. But can you just walk through where your investments sit in the capital stack. And as we hear articles or read stories about low 3 cap deals being revalued into the 5s, and what that does to people's equity and the associated debt. Can you just walk through your pref book and how you underwrote it and how we should think about it from a cap rate perspective?
Barb Pak: Yeah, Alex, this is Barb. There's a lot of moving parts to that question. And every asset is different. What we have is a comprehensive model where we value every asset every quarter. And what we're really focused on is where is, our last dollar sit? Where are transactions occurring? And where is -- what is the exit strategy and our response is going to continue to fund equity shortfalls. We're also looking at their debt maturities, their caps and swaps they have in place as well as their interest reserves with their lenders. So there's a variety of factors that go into it. I do think we've scrubbed the book. We stopped accrual on two others. They were in Northern California, and given where we were in the stack, and we're watching a few others closely. But for the most part, we're at very reasonable valuations on the rest of the book and are not concerned with it. And we've consistently got redemptions even in the fourth quarter we were redeemed out of one of our assets. And so we feel good about the rest of the book, and we've not had to take back an asset. We found solutions, and I think that goes to our disciplined underwriting of our guarantors.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And Barb, just to be clear on that, the two in Northern California, they're not paying so they're on non-accrual or you just were precautionary and then the other, I think, let that you're watching, do you expect those to go on non-accrual?
Barb Pak: So the two in the fourth quarter, we put them on non-accrual. They weren't required to pay current, but we put them on non-accrual just given where we are in the stack. They have near-term maturities as well and we're working with the sponsors on those debt refinancing's. And then the other ones that we're monitoring, we're assessing that -- we'll assess that quarter-by-quarter. We have reserved it in the guidance, but we're assessing it based on current market conditions.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Barb, just on the guidance front, hearing how you guys have described the market, Seattle is the week one. Oakland is weak, but your other Bay Area is fine. Southern Cal is obviously great. You're recapturing the COVID units the OpEx is what it is. You have very little supply in the rest of the portfolio, and it sounds like the jobs outlook from what Angela described is fine. So are there any addition-- like it doesn't sound like there are really many headwinds in your portfolio. You don't have the supply issues that are plaguing other markets or geographies. So, are there any other headwinds that we should be thinking about as far as your earnings? Or -- is this -- or what I've outlined is pretty much how you guys are looking at the landscape this year?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Alex, it's Angela here. I think you're on point as far as how we see our portfolio. We do see that we have a very stable portfolio and supply definitely is a benefit for us. The variability really relates to the timing on the delinquency. And that is, that is one aspect of our business that we don't have as much control as we would like, because we are subject to how long it takes for the court to process these delinquency units. The good news is that, that process timing has begun to decline. So for example, last year, when we're talking about L.A., it took about 10 to 12 months. And currently, we're down to 8 months. Everywhere else used to be nine to 10 months, now it's down to six months. So we're making good progress there, but that remains an open item for us as far as the risk is concerned.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to dig a little more into your comments on insurance. I think you said up 30%. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? Is that definitely the number? Is there any kind of variability to that? And -- does this last round of storms we've seen over the last few weeks impact that at all? Or is it more forward-looking?
Barb Pak: Hi, Jamie, it's Barb. So we did our property and earthquake insurance renewal in December. So that number is fairly baked for the year. We still have our general liability, but we don't that to move the needle too much. So 30%, I think, is the number. It is still a very challenging insurance market, and we do have a captive and we utilize the captive as appropriate to minimize our insurance premiums where appropriate and where we – based on the risk that we would take within the captive. So we used all angles to minimize that number, but I think it is still going to be a challenging market for the foreseeable future. In terms of the storms that won't impact the number this year, but what the carriers will do next year is still it's undetermined. I think what we need to see in the insurance market is the reinsurers that come back into the market in a big way for the premiums to start to come down. And in terms of storm damage, we haven't had anything material. We've had obviously some leaks and some minor things, but nothing material related to the storms.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. That's helpful. I know it's so hard to like quantify because there's a waterfall at every tranche of the coverage, but is there a way to give a number of like your captive exposure? Like what percentage of total liability does fall on the company versus third party? It seems like more and more REITs are growing their captives or using their captives more. I just wonder if there's a way to benchmark that seems so convoluted.
Angela Kleiman: Yes, Angela here. That's a tough one to quantify because even though there are more REITs looking at the captive and then I think it makes sense to do so. Everyone approach how they take first loss and that first layer differently. And so I don't know if you can really get apples-to-apples. We'll look into it and see if there's a better way to provide some additional context.
Barb Pak: And the other thing I would just add on that is we've had a captive for decades, and we have a marketable securities portfolio of over $100 million, which is the premium that we would have paid to third parties that are there to backstop any major insurance loss that we have. So we a substantial amount of money sitting there on our balance sheet because of that.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. That's very helpful. Have you grown the exposure in recent years or not necessarily?
Barb Pak: Not necessarily. We will ebb and flow earthquake depending on the earthquake premiums that are out there because sometimes the earthquake coverage can be extreme. So we will look at that in a different way, but we do have third-party earthquake on all high rises and five stories enough. But outside of that, we haven't taken on any real significant risk in the last few years.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Thank you. I'm sure we'll talk about this more.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Kramer: Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask you about kind of the new versus renewal spread. And I know it's been talked about a little bit already, but just wondering if you were to look over whether it's a long run average, or maybe go back to kind of prior recessions, even and use that as kind of the test case. Wondering what the kind of spread historically was between new and renewals?
Angela Kleiman : Hey, Adam, it's Angela here. That one -- the relationship between renewal and new lease rates is really driven by what the prior year's new lease rate is. So, for example, in 2022, our market rents or new lease rates were north of 11%. And so that, of course, means that you can have a much higher renewal rate to take it to market. And so that relationship really will be driven by whatever the market rent is going to be and the renewal then follows. It's really a lagging effect. So there isn't an exact number that you really can peg just because it's really one follows the other, not so much that there is a logical relationship that you could just use as a benchmark for trending purposes.
Adam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful. Thanks, Angela. And just on the kind of pref equity, you kind of may be getting kind of more and more money back from that than you have in the past. And I know in the past you roll asked about kind of, hey, would you look at other markets in the U.S., right, other markets outside of West Coast. And maybe with getting kind of more proceeds back from the pref equity, having a little bit more dry powder that could enable you to maybe take a harder look at some markets outside of the West Coast. So figure I’d asked that question.
Angela Kleiman : Hey, Adam. No, that's a good question. We actually have -- I know this is not a surprise, we get this question on a regular basis, and it's fair to ask. We have historically a disciplined approach when it comes to evaluating markets, not just within our own markets. And so we do look at all the major metros across the U.S., and it's part of our annual study to make sure that we have a good handle on what are driving the fundamentals of other markets as well. And so -- and this is not to say that we wouldn't venture into other markets or take whatever proceeds available. It's really a function of how we view the relative value. And what I mean by that is, as I mentioned earlier, when we look at the fundamentals of our markets with recovery ahead of us, with potential demand catalysts from these large companies and low supply and affordability metrics. That just speaks to the fact that our market has much more upside and lower risk from supply. And so it's more compelling in the near term to focus our investments in our markets. We will, of course, continue to watch the other markets and make sure that relative value holds.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein : I just want to go back to your comment that you're sending out renewals at 3%, 3.5% right now, what your guide assume is 1.75% for the full year. I think some of that might just have to do with the free rent burn off. But can you maybe walk us through the cadence of when we get past that for your rent burn-off and when things start to trend down to 1.7% because I assume the second half of the year is actually weaker than 1.75%?
Angela Kleiman: Hey Josh, it's Angela here. We are seeing that -- that the benefit of the concession burn-off to begin to abate as we head into the second quarter. And that's why -- as Barb mentioned, that you'll see that renewal rates to start to converge to that 1.25% market rent. So, that's -- hopefully, that's the cadence that answers your cadence question?
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Yes. No, that's good. And then maybe just one more. For the same-store revenue range, could you walk us through the assumptions that get us to the high and low end of the same-store revenue range of 70 basis points to 2.7%, mostly focused on like blends and occupancy assumptions underlying that?
Barb Pak: Yes, Josh, this is Barb. There's a lot of different assumptions that go into the high and the low end. I think the biggest factor will be delinquency and market rent growth that could drive us to either the high or the low end. And as we saw like in the third quarter when we -- or the fourth quarter when we got back a lot of delinquent units, it can have an impact, a temporary to our occupancy and to market rent, if we get those units back in a low demand period. So, there's a variety of assumptions related to that on the high and the low end.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, all right. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hey everyone. Can you give us the balance on the two non-accrual investments? And then can you also comment on what the $20 million noncore G&A charges this year?
Barb Pak: Yes. So, the two that we put on non-accrual, the balance is $25 million for both and in terms of the $20 million that we have in our guidance, that's mostly related to political contributions. As you know, we're fighting a couple of ballot measures. So, that's most of what that's for.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess, maybe bigger picture, supply is still relatively low at the portfolio level and rent growth is call it, low 1%. Is it just mainly the markets with heavy supply bringing that -- the blend down for you? You also mentioned something in the comments earlier about the job growth is being driven by service-related jobs. So, I'm just wondering if the job mix is also playing a big part of the forecast this year?
Barb Pak: Hey Wes, on the rents for our guidance, it's a couple of factors. So, first is what you mentioned the service sector jobs, which has been -- which has dominated the job growth last year. And we've all seen the announcements recently. The lots of companies are still retooling and reevaluating. And so typically, if you look at the long-term average of our job growth and the composition, normally, you would want about 30% of those jobs to come from higher wage jobs. And so in this environment, which with the consensus -- the macro consensus of a soft landing, we certainly wouldn't be forecasting -- we wouldn't be getting ahead of them forecasting robust high wage job growth. And so that's one key factor. As far as supply, you're right, for our portfolio, it's only 0.5% for California. Seattle is elevated and close to 1% and higher than last year. Fortunately, for us, it's mostly concentrated in the downtown area and our portfolio is mostly under Eastside. Having said that, there will be some properties that will have to -- that will be impacted by supply, and we'll see concessions elevated on a temporary basis for those assets.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thank you for that.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. Barb, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on your quarterly process of remarking the values in your preferred equity book and making sure your dollar basis is safe. Are you able to share a rough average loan to value in your prep book right now? On real values, not lagged kind of third-party appraised values?
Barb Pak: Yeah. I don't have that in front of me. And I think it varies by asset. So I don't have that in front of me. But it does matter about the rent growth that we've seen in each asset for each property and how we underwrote it initially that all plays into fact where we are in the capital stack. But like I said, we do a thorough scrub and we feel comfortable with the book.
John Pawlowski: Okay. One more for you, Barb. How much success, if any, have you had collecting past written off rent from tenants that have moved out? I'm just not – I don't have a good sense of how much teeth you guys have to go after credit scores and how much you're able to actually collect from the huge cumulative written off rent balance?
Barb Pak: Yeah. It's a small component of our monthly collections. We are collecting a little bit every month on that past due rent, because we have hit their credit and gone after them. and because of our conservative approach to how we account for bad debt, whereby, if you're delinquent after 30 days, we reserve against it in the financials, when we go and hit their credit and they need their credit, they will start to pay. So we've -- it is a recurring part of our income given how we account for it, but it's hard to quantify, and it is lumpy. It moves around month-to-month. And we do expect it will be a reoccurring part for the foreseeable future given we have over $130 million in uncollected rent. But it will be a small part, but it will be drips and drabs.
John Pawlowski: Okay. All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. I wanted to go back to your market rent forecast of 1.25% for the year, which is below what you had a year ago. Angela mentioned in the prepared remarks, layoff announcements have come down quite a bit year-over-year. So I was just wondering, are you actually seeing more move-outs due to job losses this year versus a year ago when it seemed like tech layoffs were a lot more prevalent?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, John, it's Angela here. We have not seen more move-outs to job loss, and we do track that. When we look at move-out reasons, it's relatively stable. And so our market outlook is really a function of where the economy is and how we believe we would perform relative to the overall economy.
John Kim: Okay. So just projecting unemployment rate moving up?
Barb Pak: Yeah. And I think, John, just to add to that. I think the mix of jobs has been -- we've seen a change in mix over the last year as the high-quality jobs have not been added in mostly service sector, as Angela mentioned earlier. And I think that, that is -- we just don't see that changing in this environment given the slow economy. So -- that could change. That would be upside to the forecast, but it's not our base case at this point. And that's what's driving the below average.
John Kim: Can I clarify on the impairment that you had in your preferred? Do you still have a position in this asset? Or was it -- was the loan fully written off due to the recapitalization or some other kind of event?
Barb Pak: We still have our investment in the asset. But because our -- the loan and our investment matures in October of this year, and because we don't feel we'll fully realize our valuation by the end of the term of our maturity of our loan, we impaired the asset, which is consistent with GAAP accounting rules. We do believe in the asset long term and the market long term, we're obviously in a very depressed market in Oakland. And but it's going to take time for that market to recover. We need to see supply abate, which we will start to happen in 2025 and really into 2026. And that should bring -- bring rents up. And so that will help our investment long term. The sponsor continues to fund equity shortfalls and is actively putting money into the project, and we are working actively with them on the refi that will be coming up here in the fall.
John Kim: What is the likelihood you put more capital into the project or take ownership of the asset?
Barbara Pak: I think that will be determined as we work through the refinance and based on the sponsor's response to the refinance. So it's a little too early and premature to talk about that. We'll know more as we work through that this summer.
John Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. How is demand trending in your markets? And if you can quantify that in any way, like the number of property tours that would be helpful. Again, a market like Seattle does increase supply in the urban core combined with return to office, draw residents away from the more suburban Essex properties?
Jessica Anderson: Hi, Michael, this is Jessica. I can provide you some basics, I guess, as far as how leasing fundamentals are going in our markets. And it's really trending as expected in all of our markets. Right now, when we're looking at things like lead volume is steadily increasing, which is what we would expect this time of year, and then also leasing activity overall is stable. As far as quantifying it goes, I mean, we really see that increase in demand that we would expect, of course, correlates to whatever sequential rent growth that we see. And we pointed that out earlier, we saw good growth in both NorCal and Seattle. And that's something that is in part due to concession burn off. Those are our most seasonal markets. So we do expect them to grow more substantially on a sequential basis. But overall, they're performing as expected, in line with what we would expect at the time of the year.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is, is on rent control. Have you seen any change in the rent control environment in your markets? And then given that it's an election year, does that -- does that create a little bit more noise than a traditional year? Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Michael, in an environment where we're looking at 1.25% market rent growth, we certainly don't expect an elevated concern when it comes to the rent control conversation. Now there is, I think many of you are aware that there is a proposition out there to repeal Costa-Hawkins again, sponsored by Michael Weinstein, the Head of the AIDS Foundation. And we, of course, participate in the housing coalition that supports responsible legislation and we do not view that this proposal to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Housing Act will have traction because it's -- this is the third time that this proposal has come up. And in the past two times, it was overwhelmingly defeated, only one out of 58 counties voted in favor of repealing Costa-Hawkins and they -- and that was by a narrow margin. And it lacks the governance and general political support, it is viewed as an antigrowth proposal that will deter housing production when we already have a housing shortage. And so that -- but that is one that we are watching carefully. But beyond that, that's a normal operating environment for us from a legislative perspective.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in 2024.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please proceed you’re your question.
Rich Anderson: Hey, good morning, everyone. So Barb, you said one of the swing factors for you is getting back delinquent units and perhaps into a downtime in the rental market and not knowing what that opportunity would present itself. But I imagine, it would be either zero or something more. And it's just a matter of when that something more hits. Is that it? Because obviously, the delinquent unit wasn't paying rent. I just want to make sure I understand that logically what you're saying there.
Barb Pak: Yes. So yes, and we can take the example of what happened in September, October. We got back hundreds of units or occupancy. So our delinquency dropped about 50 basis points, but our occupancy also dropped commensurately. And then when we backfilled, we gave back a little bit on the rent growth. And so there was a small impact to the bottom line, but it didn't all fall to the bottom line. Long-term, it's beneficial for us. But there is a temporary headwind, especially if you get the units back in a low demand period because then you have to give concessions to backfill -- to backfill those units. If we get the units back during peak leasing season, and we have a strong leasing season, there will be less impact to occupancy and rent growth.
Rich Anderson: Why would there be an impact negatively, if they weren't paying rent, who cares what the occupancy was if there were zero rent coming in any way? I'm just curious, I'm not sure I understand why there would be a negative number in that scenario. It would either zero or something more. Yes.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Rich. Yes. So I think from your question -- from your perspective, the absolute number is right now, we're going from zero to something. So you can't be below zero. But keep in mind, the way Barb has outlined the guidance, we are assuming an improvement in delinquency, which means we will need to get -- we do need to convert some of those zeros into a positive number, just to be at midpoint. Does that help?
Rich Anderson: Yes. Okay. Perfect. That's what I am looking for. Yep. Thank you. And then -- so where there are problems in the bank industry and as it touches multifamily, it's in the rent-regulated area, and we've seen that in New York Community and Signature portfolios and so on, rent regulated can -- is California can be described with that phrase, I assume. I'm curious to what degree you're seeing anything popping up? And if this was covered earlier, I apologize. But is there -- are you in a position to jump on opportunities? Is there a pipeline building of sort of these sort of distressed situations, maturities coming. Anything like that, that is interesting to you? Or is it not really sort of apparently happening at this point as an external growth opportunity for Essex? Thanks.
Rylan Burns: Hi, Rich. I'll echo what many of our peers have said is we're not currently seeing much distressed selling at all in our markets given the amount of debt coming due in the next couple of years, we anticipate there should be some opportunities, but as of yet, we have yet to really see any force selling. So we are keeping our eyes open and looking for opportunities, but nothing as of yet.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai : Hi. In terms of the $134 million in receivables, are there different ways to tip away at that, like get debt collectors involved? Or just anything operationally you can do to get your money back faster?
Barb Pak : Yes, Linda, we are -- this is Barb. We are pursuing every avenue to try to collect on that money, whether it be taken to small claims court, we've being their credit -- and like we are collecting a little bit here and there, but it depends on when they need their credit. And when they need their credit, then they tend to come back and pay, but if they don't need their credit for a long time, then it can sit out there. But every avenue we can pursue, we are pursuing to try to collect on that money.
Linda Tsai : Got it. And then just in terms of getting units back in a low demand period where it's more negative for you, like what are some of the determinants for the timing of when you do get those units back and how do you forecast that to the extent you can?
Angela Kleiman : Linda, that's the $64,000 question of the day. When do we get these darn units back? And for us, it would be great to get them back as soon as possible. The challenge here is that once a unit is in eviction. When we looked at the fourth quarter, the majority of those tenants just leave. So what that means is, for us, normally, in a normal environment, we have noticed that a tenant is going to vacate. We can pre-lease these units. We can plan for a turnover and of course, coordinated marketing efforts and our site personnel is ready for the move out, move-ins and all those logistics. In a situation where we have a certain number of evictions in play, and we don't know how many are going to come back or when, that's the part that creates that pressure when it comes to pricing and it's very difficult to predict.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Buck Horne: Thanks. Appreciate the time. was wondering if going to the delinquency issue, if you could maybe add a little color if you're seeing any systemic application fraud or upticks in just application fraud or identity fraud or other types of misrepresentations by tenants? Is this something that's kind of spreading on social media that's becoming more of a structural issue?
Angela Kleiman: Buck, it's Angela here. We have been -- our team has done a great job staying on top of these potential issues. And when we look at the fraud instances, it has not ticked up or become elevated. And in some instances, say, if it's a building specific issue, we immediately remedied those. And so that really hasn't been a driver for whether it's behavior or impact to our financials. It really is driven by the core processing time. So, I'll give you an example. When the tenant goes delinquent, pre-COVID, it only took us about, say, two months on average to evict this tenant. Because of the court delays, it's six months plus, right, or eight months if you're in LA. And so that's the time that's getting accumulated. And so we normally have a level of delinquency in our portfolio, but it's elevated now because it's just taking longer.
Buck Horne: Got you. Got you. Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate the color there. And just as it relates to your future investment opportunities? Or kind of how you think about capital allocation between urban core or suburban assets and opportunities in your core markets? You're saying there's a lot of upside still yet to be achieved in the West Coast markets and some significant recovery potential. Do you think that applies to the downtown urban cores of L.A., San Fran and Seattle? Is that where you would look to allocate additional dollars first? Or do you think the suburban submarkets would continue to outperform.
Rylan Burns: Buck, it's a good question. Obviously, investment returns driven by what you pay. So we are paying attention to everything that's coming to market, and we'll keep an open mind to any investment. A major consideration for us is also making sure that we are acquiring near our existing footprints, given our unique operating model. We think we can add a lot of value when it's purchased when we buy something near an existing asset collection. Now as you know, the majority of those assets happen to be in the suburban market, and that is where we're primarily focused. They also have fewer quality of life issues currently. So, a simple answer is we are very focused in our suburban footprint, but we will keep an open mind to anything that crosses our broader markets.
Buck Horne: Appreciate it. All right, thanks guys. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
Barb Pak: Goodbye.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-27 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman, you may begin.
Angela Kleiman: Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex’s third quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. My comments today will focus on how we performed to date. Our initial outlook for 2024 and a brief update on the investment markets. Overall, 2023 has unfolded generally in-line with our expectations. We increased our same-property revenue and NOI growth in middle of the year, despite a challenging operating environment, with almost 2% of rent delinquent for the first nine months of the year. For context, this delinquency level is approximately five times our historical average. The unprecedented eviction protections enacted during COVID exacerbated by subsequent court delays has resulted in protractive exposure to non-paying tenants and uncertainty on timing of when we could recapture these units. That said, we made considerable progress reducing delinquency as a percentage of rent, which is now at 1.3% in October, this improvement has naturally resulted in a temporary trade-off between rate growth and occupancy but has proven to be an optimal strategy to maximize revenues as we make progress towards normalization in our markets. Looking ahead to 2024, we plan to publish a more comprehensive outlook for the West Coast in conjunction with our full year guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. For now, we have provided our initial 2024 supply outlook for our market on S-17 of the supplemental which forecasts total supply growth of only 0.5% of total housing stock. Unlike many other US markets, total housing supply in our markets is expected to remain at low level. And we do not see a near-term catalyst for increasing housing supply growth in the Essex markets. This supply landscape also minimizes our risk to job growth relative to other markets, especially if we encounter a softer demand environment and will be a tailwind for Essex when the economy accelerates. While muted supply is part of our thesis, we also see conditions that could drive demand for housing. First, after a year of retrenchment, layoff in the tech industry appears to be slowing and return to office is gaining momentum, with percent of remote job hiring at the largest tech companies now in the low single-digits. Implying that once tech hiring resumes in a meaningful way, job growth will be highly concentrated near major employment centers. Second, it remains to be seen, how the artificial intelligence industry will grow. We know that success in this industry will require immense scale and capital resources, and these types of companies are largely concentrated in the Bay Area and Seattle. Third, affordability, particularly in Northern California. Today, the Bay Aera is as affordable as we've seen since we began tracking this data, and we expect this will provide a long runway for rent growth. In summary, the combination of this potential demand backdrop and a muted supply outlook gives us confidence that the West Coast is well positioned to outperform in the long-run. Lastly, an update on the apartment investment markets. Deal activity slowed further in the third quarter, as interest rates increased sharply in recent months, compressing perspective returns and resulting in many buyers remaining on the sidelines. We have seen several marketed deals not transact this year as sellers await a less volatile interest rate environment. There is little evidence to suggest transaction activity will pick-up in the near term as bid-ask spread remains wide. We have navigated through many economic cycles and our finance team has done an excellent job in fortifying the balance sheet, which positions Essex well for any environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.
Barb Pak: Thanks Angela. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, along with investments and the balance sheet. Starting with our third quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that core FFO per share for the quarter came in $0.03 ahead of our midpoint. The outperformance was driven by slightly higher revenues, other income and lower G&A expenses, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Most of the deals in the third quarter is timing related. As such, we are reiterating the midpoint of our full year core FFO per share and same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth. As it relates to operating expense [Technical Difficulty] which increased by only 1% due to the favorable outcome we received in Seattle. As we look to 2024, we expect operating expenses will remain elevated, primarily driven by non-controllable items such as insurance and utilities. In addition, the tax benefit we received in Washington share is not expected to repeat in 2024. However, it should be noted that we have done a good job over the past four years improving the operating efficiency of the platform, which has led to modest increase in our controllable expenses. Since 2019, our controllable expenses have increased around 2.75% annually despite elevated inflationary pressures and higher costs related to our delinquent units during this period. This favorable outcome is primarily driven by the rollout of Phase 1 of our property collections model. As always, we are continuously looking for ways to improve efficiencies within the platform in order to optimize our cost structure. Turning to investments. For the year, we expect preferred equity redemptions to be around $70 million as we anticipate being fully repaid on a $40 million investment in the fourth quarter. As we look to 2024, we expect redemptions within our preferred equity book to be around $100 million. While we are actively looking for new deals to replace these investments, there could be a timing mismatch in terms of when we get repaid and when we can reinvest. We are finding there are still significant capital sources eager to invest in this portion of the capital stack, while at the same time projects with reasonable return expectations are becoming harder to find. We will remain disciplined in this environment, leaning on our deep network on the West Coast to source deals at attractive risk adjusted returns. Turning to capital markets and the balance sheet. In July, we closed $298 million in ten-year secured loans at a fixed rate of 5.08%. The proceeds were used -- will be used to repay our 2024 consolidated maturities. We were proactive in refinancing our debt early in today's volatile rate environment, locking in favorable financing ahead of the recent acceleration in treasury yields. As such, the company is well positioned with minimal financing needs over the next 18 months. We are pleased that our net-debt to EBITDA ratio continues to trend lower and stands at 5.5 times today as compared to 5.8 times one year ago. With over $1.6 billion in liquidity, the balance sheet remains a source of strength. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Anderson.
Jessica Anderson: Thanks Barb. My comments today will cover our recent operating results and strategy, followed by an update on our delinquency progress and regional highlights. Operating results were solid for the quarter including same-property revenue growth of 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced a normal peak leasing season across all markets. Market rents peaked in August, at 6% growth year-to-date compared to December 2022 and has subsequently moderated by 10 basis points in September, which is consistent with typical seasonality. While we took advantage of opportunities to push rents during peak season, we shifted back to an occupancy focused strategy midway through the third quarter as we began to recapture a larger volume of units from non-paying tenants. This shift in strategy tempered our blended trade-out rates in Q3 which were similar to Q2 at 2.1%. Renewal growth rates were healthy at 3% in Q3 and 5.3% in October, boosting our blended trade-out rates while new lease growth was muted at 1.2% for Q3, reflecting new lease incentives to backfill recently vacated non-paying units. Eviction related move-outs increased in September, allowing for improvement in delinquency as a percentage of rents to 1.9% in September and even further improvement in October to 1.3%. Several of our markets such as Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Diego have returned to delinquency levels close to the long-term run rate. Los Angeles and Alameda County remained elevated, but significant progress is also being made in these areas after protections expired earlier in the year. As Angela mentioned, the improvement in delinquency will result in a temporary tradeoff with new lease growth and occupancy, which can be seen in our preliminary October numbers, but we view this progress, as a positive for the company. Consistent with our approach all year, we remain nimble and will shift our strategy as necessary to maximize revenue in any operating environment. Finally, I want to thank the Essex team for their diligent efforts this past quarter. They've been a major driver of the improvement we've achieved. Moving on to regional specific commentary. Beginning with Seattle, this market has performed as expected this year. Blended net effective rent growth averaged 0.5% for the quarter, improving 70 basis-points from Q2. Despite nominal trade-out growth, demand fundamentals were solid in Q3 and I'm pleased with the recovery of this market after a slow start to the year. Market rents in this region were the first to peak in July on par with a typical year and we anticipate a normal seasonal moderation although higher levels of supply deliveries in the fourth quarter may have an impact on pricing. Turning to Northern California, blended net effective rent growth averaged 1.4% for the quarter, consistent with Q2. Market rents peaked in late August later than normal, an indicator of solid fundamentals in this market. Santa Clara was our top-performing market for the quarter as outlined on page S-9 of the supplemental. The ongoing return to office along with corporate housing activity contributed to these positive quarterly results. San Francisco and Oakland CBD, which account for a small portion of our NOI, have lagged the regional average. Oakland continues to be impacted by supply, which is expected to continue into 2024. Lastly, Southern California continues to be our top-performing region led by San Diego. Market rents in Southern California were last to peak in mid-September and blended net effective rates remained resilient at 3.7%, despite the headwinds in Los Angeles, our market most impacted by delinquency. In October, delinquency in Los Angeles was at 4.6%, reflecting a 2.1% improvement since the start of the year. We anticipate making continued progress on delinquency in Los Angeles and as such we expect rents and occupancy in this area to be more volatile in the near-term. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing on the delinquency front and expect continued progress, heading into next year. As we conclude the balance of the year, we remain focused on preserving occupancy and positioning the portfolio favorably, heading into 2024. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thank you. Jessica, you highlighted that you've shifted your strategy from pushing new lease rate growth to growing occupancy, due in part to the elevated move outs of non-paying tenants. But from what I recall, the guidance assumes both an improvement in cash delinquency and re-acceleration in new lease rate growth towards that high 2% range in the back-half of the year. So, I guess I'm just curious if anything else changed from a demand perspective that also contributed to that shift in sort of operating strategy?
Jessica Anderson: Well, just to emphasize, we are on-track for the year. And as mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is essentially a trade-out. We did expect delinquency to stay elevated above the 1.3% that we reported for October. So that is lower than we had planned although we had experienced the trade-out with occupancy and our new lease -- new lease trade-out rate. So as far as demand goes, all of the markets are performing as expected as we move into the seasonal slow period and we're encouraged by recapturing the non-paying units because it will position us well as we head into 2024.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it, that's helpful. And then can you just remind me -- I know you guys report financial occupancy, but does that capture cash delinquency or is that figure more reflection of gross potential rent? Thank you.
Jessica Anderson: Financial occupancy does not include delinquency.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Wolfe: Hey thanks. Just curious what you think drove the decline in delinquencies in October sort of specifically versus, say, two months ago and -- even a couple of months ago. Some of your peers started seeing it. Do you think that the improvement is sustainable going-forward?
Jessica Anderson: Hi, Eric, this is Jessica. Well, we're definitely encouraged by the improvement that we've seen in October and there is several factors that are contributing to that. The first is, for all of our areas outside of Los Angeles and Alameda, protections expired in July last year and at the time we were reporting that evictions we're taking in the range of 10 to 12 months and some longer. And so now that we're a year, plus into those areas, we are seeing a lot of those units have made their way through the system. And in the move-up that we're experiencing. As far as Los Angeles and Alameda go, those protections expired earlier in the year and those tenants are realizing that there are no more protections. There is no more emergency rental assistance. So overall, the tenant sentiment has changed and there is a greater sense of urgency. So we are seeing increased move outs as tenants are realizing this. And as far as forward-looking, one month certainly doesn't make a trend and we've seen some choppiness in delinquency as we've worked through it, the last couple of years, but we're certainly encouraged by our recent results and we're going to be monitoring that closely, and we'll have more information on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Eric Wolfe: All right, that's helpful. I guess leads to my second question which is around the -- you dropping through new lease rates, the increased occupancy of non-paying tenants. I guess, how long would you sort of expect that process to take? And would you expect new lease rates to sort of go back up to that sort of 2.8% that you discussed on the last call or should renewals have to come down? Because, I think you also talked about renewals tending to follow new lease. So just trying to understand how long new lease rates will be depressed and if we should also expect renewals to come down to follow them?
Jessica Anderson: All right. Let me tackle that. I'll tackle new leases then renewals. So as far as what we can expect for new lease rates through the quarter. I expect those to remain muted. We have come into a period of easier comps, but since we've increased incentives to backfill these units, that's going to mask some of that progress. And overall, we view that as a positive. I think it's neutral over the short-term, with only a couple of months left in the year, but a positive as we look to 2024, because essentially we have people occupying units that are not paying rent. And so if that unit becomes vacant, it's not vacancy, but essentially that's neutral trade-out. And we're offering concessions to refill -- backfill these units as quickly as possible. And at that point, you have somebody occupying the unit that will be paying full market rent in the near term. So it sets us up favorably for 2024. And with regards to renewals. renewals is where you're seeing our comp show up. Renewals are insulated from some of the choppiness of the day-to-day pricing strategy as we've increased incentives to backfill these units. But what you're seeing in October is essentially 50-50 gross rent growth and then also concession burn-off in that 5.3%. And I expect for the quarter, renewals will be pretty consistent. We've sent them out around 5% and we'll monitor conditions closely. We may negotiate those a little bit, but expect those to be fairly consistent through Q4.
Eric Wolfe: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Tricarico: Hey. It's Daniel Tricarico with Nick. Thanks for taking the question. First question is on market rent growth thoughts for next year. With the 0.5% supply growth you gave in the sub, just curious what sort of demand environment would drive negative market rent growth next year, given that supply backdrop? Just looking to sensitize possible outcomes.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, that's a good question. It's Angela here. We -- one of the reasons why we held off on publishing our macro outlook is because we listen to our investors feedback to better understand the value of publishing that outlook because that ultimately impacts our view on market rent growth. And we have decided not to change -- I mean to change our approach to -- so we would provide the outlook early next year so it aligns better with the timing and the release of our guidance. And so -- I wanted to give you that backdrop, but ultimately the market fundamentals really are going to be impacted by a couple of factors. And we start with looking at the third-party macroeconomist forecast, which is still evolving and we've not seen anyone with a robust outlook, but it is too early to predict. What we will say is that Essex is in a better position relative to other markets due to low supply that you mentioned earlier, which of course reduces the risk to rent growth and of course having some potential upside when it comes to future demand. And so those are all the different moving pieces that we are evaluating at this time.
Daniel Tricarico: No, that's good. Thanks for that, Angela. And the next question would be on just your different regions. SoCal has been your strongest, but curious if you could see that gap to Northern California and Seattle remaining or maybe converging next year. Any thoughts on the puts and takes there? Thank you.
Angela Kleiman: Well. I think, Northern California is our steady Eddie market and it has a profile -- employment profile that's similar to that of the US, but with higher level of professional services. So the land remains constant. In Northern California, we do expect that recovery will come. Of course, the timing is the question, right and so ultimately it should outperform, if nothing for the sake of it's still in the recovery mode. And so that's how we're thinking about the two regions.
Daniel Tricarico: Great, thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Sakwa: Yeah, thanks. First, Jessica, could you provide a kind of a loss to lease [Technical Difficulty] and an earn-in figure for the portfolio?
Jessica Anderson: [Technical Difficulty] is consistent with periods pre-COVID, the three years average pre-COVID. And as far as earning goes, typically in the past we look at using roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more of that loss to lease number, which gets us to roughly 70 basis points or 100 basis points. And then we'll look at whatever our market rent forecast is for the year and take 50% of that and it's still early and we'll be evaluating that and providing more information on our fourth quarter. We do see some other building blocks as far as earning for next year with some other income initiatives as well that will contribute to revenue growth as well next year.
Steve Sakwa: Great, thanks. And then maybe just on the investment side, I guess, I think Barb might have talked about some repayment of some of the preferred investments. I guess just what are you seeing in the marketplace today from other developers or other investors who might be in trouble form a financing perspective?
Rylan Burns: Hi, Steve, Rylan here. We are still seeing a few opportunities. I would say just a little historical context. The majority of our deals up until last year were development based. This year it's been a mix, I would say about 50-50 between development and stabilized recaps and I anticipate next year we're going to see more opportunities for stabilized properties that are seeking recaps. We've seen several deals in the past couple of years with above 50% leverage and very low-interest rates capped or swap that will roll in the next few years at a very different interest-rate environment. So with limited NOI growth we've seen in several of our markets, we think there are going to be opportunities to put some capital to work.
Steve Sakwa: Great, thanks. That's it from me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah, hey guys. I appreciate that your markets have lower supply than a lot of other markets out there across the country. But just kind of curious on what you're seeing as far as demand goes in San Francisco and Seattle and then maybe what do we need to see to kind of see an acceleration of that demand in those markets?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, it's Angela here. I think on the demand side for Northern California, we do want to acknowledge that it remains soft, but I do think that we got two things happening. One is from a year-over-year comp perspective, September was still quite robust last year because that was before the tech sectors began their retrenchment. And at this point what we're seeing is that, that has stabilized and so that's a -- definitely a good indicator. As far as other indications, we look at, of course, unemployment claims that remain stable and WARN notices, it's back to pre-COVID levels. So that all points to that the market is functioning as it should. In terms of looking forward, we do think that the technology sector, the hiring needs to return in a more robust way. It’s -- this is -- what it looks like is that they're going through kind of the tail end of the retrenchment and so we do see light at the end of the tunnel from that perspective. And of course, having the remote job hiring, which is now in 8% versus it was 25% last year, and of course 100% during COVID, that need to continue to decline, and which we expect that to happen. And then, of course, the last piece is really the international migration, which has been quite muted as a result of COVID and of course, the various retrenchment. And so with those three elements, those are all potential upside for our markets.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, appreciate that color. And then maybe just one quick one and apologies if I missed this. But what does your guide assume for the rest of the year as far as new lease rate growth goes?
Barb Pak: [Technical Difficulty] specific number that we need to achieve to hit the fourth quarter [Technical Difficulty] we got back a lot of units from non-paying tenants. It has had an impact to our occupancy, but there's a trade-off there. So there's a variety of factors that will play into the fourth quarter guidance, and there's not a specific rent growth number that we need to achieve because there’s all the other factors play into it.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. Can you talk about for the occupancy first initiative in the first half. Do you think that sets you up for potential acceleration next year?
Jessica Anderson: Hi, Jamie, this is Jessica. Can you clarify your question, were you talking the first half of 2023? [indiscernible]
Jamie Feldman: Yeah. I'm just thinking about what the year-over-year comps could be into next year. Like, where did you push harder in the first half of '23 that you may get the benefit. It might be harder to have the comps for the first half of '24 both on occupancy by market and also by rents?
Jessica Anderson: Yes, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, year-to-date, occupancy, I believe we're sitting about 96.5% and right now we floated down to 95.9%, but again there is a trade out. So, it's revenue neutral over the short term, but potentially positive as we head into 2024. So where we're heading right now with occupancy, it's hard to peg exactly where we'll end the year. As I mentioned, we remain focused on occupancy and back selling units. It's a seasonally slow period, so it's uncertain how much progress we'll be able to make with occupancy over the short term. So with that said, as we head into the year, we certainly could be lower than last year. But stable is what my expectation is from an occupancy perspective. But there's other components that will add to a favorable revenue outcome as we see our delinquency come down. And as far as occupancy, by area, I mean, generally speaking, we're seeing our stronger occupancies in Orange County, San Diego, Ventura. Seattle is performing quite well now and having quite a stable seasonal slowdown, particularly when compared to last year, and it's sitting around 96%. Los Angeles is 95.4% and I would expect that market to be particularly impacted with a lower occupancy, but again an upside on the delinquency front. And the Bay Area is also sitting around 96%. Does that answer your question?
Jamie Feldman: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just switching gears, to the investment here to investment potential. I mean, you mentioned Oakland. I mean, some of these sub-markets, you saw better opportunities or better pricing?
Rylan Burns: Hey, Jamie. Rylan, here. I would say, we are open to any good investment opportunity subject to the conditions that are presented to us. At a high level, as we've talked about, we are relatively bullish on the prospects for Northern California on the next several years, and I think Angela has reiterated several of reasons for that case. Oakland will be challenged for the next year or two given the supply that went out there. So it would have to be a pretty compelling investment opportunity. But it's -- we are open and eagerly looking for opportunities in all of our core markets.
Jamie Feldman: Okay, all right. Thanks, Rylan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Heffern: Hey, everybody. Can you talk about some of the return to office mandates you've been watching like we saw with Meta in September. And has there been a noticeable impact in leasing activity on the ground from those?
Angela Kleiman: The return to office mandate that we've [Technical Difficulty] what I mean by that is, last year, when the tech employers announced they had to make some adjustments, they had said, three days, and then they moved back to two days, and they were still hiring remotely. This year, what we're seeing is that the rehiring -- the remote hiring has stopped and, in fact, it's become policy. And, of course, the return to office has been gaining momentum. It's difficult to point exactly to our financial lease rates because we're in the middle of working through the evictions and delinquency issue, and that's taking precedent. So there's a lot of noise in that. Certainly we expect that that's been a benefit, but to [Technical Difficulty] straightforward as possible at this point.
Brad Heffern: Okay, understood. And then concessions have come up a few times on the call. I'm just curious if you could walk through the individual markets and just give the average concession that you're offering right now?
Jessica Anderson: [Technical Difficulty] offering across the portfolio with an average of one week free and [Technical Difficulty] units as they come in and adjust as needed to manage our new lease velocity. As far as by-market, we have the largest volume of concessions concentrated in pockets. Southern California is still generally just a few days outside of Los Angeles, and we're seeing larger concessions in Los Angeles areas, the Bay Area. And then Seattle surprisingly is only a few days at this point. As, I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's been a very stable seasonal slowdown in that market.
Brad Heffern: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Kramer: Hey guys, thanks for the time. Just a couple of questions on kind of a couple different demand drivers you guys have touched on in the past. I think one would just be -- some of kind of be in-migration to your markets, right? And that could be overseas tech workers, visas, other kind of immigration factors. Just want to maybe kind of walk through that because I know there's a lot of focus on the outward migration. Maybe just kind of thinking about the in-migration to your markets. And then the other kind of demand driver question is just on kind of the end of the, writer strike, actor strike, if that -- what potential impact that could have on your business?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Adam. It's Angela here. Good question on the in-migration. Those -- the data on that front is not as readily available, but what we've been tracking is really the move-ins. And as I've mentioned last year, we saw a good uptick and I think part of that relates to really a recovery and since then it's been steady. And so the in-migration data into our markets from outside of California and Washington have generally remained steady. The piece that we're still missing actually is the international migration part of it. And I do think that, that will return and just not as immediate at this point. And as far as the hospitality industries, it's very telling that when we look at the drivers of job growth in the third quarter, it's mainly education and healthcare and other services. Hospitality and leisure was very muted. And we do think that that's partly attributed to the strike. And so we do think that, that could be a potential demand catalyst as well.
Adam Kramer: Great, thanks. I'll leave it there. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hi everyone. You mentioned getting -- I think, repaid on $100 million extra in the structured finance. Do you have a timing estimate on that? Do you -- is there any chance you extend that? And then when looking at the entire structured finance book, is there any geographic concentration?
Barb Pak: Hi Wes, it's Barb. I think for now you could assume mid-year on the $100 million is probably a safe assumption. I think we have some in the first half of the year and some in the back half of the year. So mid-year assumption is good there. And then in terms of geographic concentration, our portfolio is actually, it mirrors our actual portfolio in terms of our investments. So about 40% in Northern California, 40% in Southern California, and 20% in Seattle is how the portfolio aligns in terms of where it's located geographically.
Wes Golladay: Great. That's all from me.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. On the 5.3% renewal rate growth achieved in October, can you break that down between how much of that was rate growth versus concession burn-off from a year ago?
Jessica Anderson: Hi, John, it's Jessica. Yes, that -- it's roughly 50-50. So we're seeing about 2.5% to 2.8% or so in rate growth and then the rest is concession burn-off.
John Kim: So when you compare the concessions that you mentioned earlier that you're offering versus the year-ago, is that additive to rental rate growth going forward?
Jessica Anderson: Where we sit right now it is additive. So last year we were at roughly two weeks, pretty consistently across Q4. And right now, we're sitting at a week. Like I said earlier, we may increase the volume of concessions and the amount, but we'll monitor that. But as of right now, that's a positive.
John Kim: Okay. Has there been an update on the gross delinquency outlook for the second half of this year, it was last at 1.9%. I think you basically there, including October, has that changed at all?
Barb Pak: Hi, John, it's Barb. We didn't make any changes to our guidance for the full year. We believe we're on target for that. There may be puts and takes and if delinquency does come in favorable, there maybe a trade-off with occupancy. And so net-net, we're in line with our full year guidance.
John Kim: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Good morning, thanks for the time. Barb, I have a question about the potential deferred repair and maintenance and CapEx costs that might be in the portfolio today associated with delinquent tenants. Have you -- could you give us an order on that, a sense, like an order of magnitude of the total amount of dollars you think that needs to get spent over the coming years on these units? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether early innings is seeing the cost flow through from evictions or you've already worked through most of it?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, John, it's Angela here. So let me give you just a high-level answer to that, because, frankly, what we're seeing is the turnover as it relates to delinquent tenants is not -- the higher level of CapEx is not material relative to in the past when we have delinquent tenants and some actually have just decided to leave. And so the turnover just sort of natural turn, and there's going to be bad actors from time to time, but once again, it's at a comparable rate as pre-COVID. And so that's why there isn't a number that Barb can point to. Our CapEx at this point is really more driven by other activities like storm damage and as far as the eviction is concerned, it's a higher volume, but it's not greater damage because of evictions.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Maybe shifting over to the private market, and I joined the call a few minutes late, so apologies if I missed this, but Rylan, I'm curious where you think market clearing cap rates are right now in kind of the urban cores of San Fran and San Jose, I imagine they're pretty close to redline right now. So I'm just curious, what type of pricing do you think buyers and sellers might agree on pricing in the kind of urban high-rise environment in San Fran, San Jose?
Rylan Burns: Hey John, I appreciate the question. I hesitate to give you a specific number, because as you are well aware, when there is not any transactions, it's very difficult to pinpoint where buyers are. I also would take some pause with the idea of a redlining a whole city. We are still seeing -- or we've seen some transactions occur, year-to-date, and the buyer profile is different than what we've typically seen. I think you're seeing some family office buyers who are coming in and looking at the basis versus replacement costs that are still continuing to transact in some of these sub-markets that you mentioned. So obviously a challenged market fundamentally over the past year or two, but as those turn, I suspect you're going to see people, investors come back in and -- so I'll leave it at that, without giving you a specific number, but hopefully that color is helpful.
John Pawlowski: Yeah, no, it definitely is. Maybe one follow-up. Just curious, I know you've been talking more suburban over the last few years. What -- like what pricing becomes interesting to you to go back into these urban markets that have not really healed from COVID? What kind of range of cap rates would you be willing to be a buyer at?
Rylan Burns: Thanks, John. Another good question. As you know, we force rank our 30 plus sub-markets and forecast a rent growth for five years, forward looking based on our fundamental analysis. And so the cap rates have to accommodate for a higher IRR based on those rent growth estimates. So there is a price at which we would be willing to invest in these submarkets. I will say, given the performance we've seen over the past several years with the suburban strongly outperforming and where we're looking at supply for the next few years, I would think, on average, incremental dollars will go towards our portfolio investments that look similar to what our portfolio mix currently is demonstrating. But there is a price and we have our -- we're turning over every rock and looking for opportunities and I'm optimistic we're going to see more in the next few years.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Connor Mitchell: Hey, thanks for the time. Just wanted to follow up on some of the in-migration discussion. Would you be able to kind of give a waiting or the amount of impact that you're expecting from international migration maybe compared to historical figures, whether that's 10% of the growth compared to the current return to office we're looking for? How much of an impact do you think that could have versus the other demand factors looking forward?
Angela Kleiman: Hey Connor, It's Angela here. That's a good question. The one thing I can point you to is California historically has a negative net in-migration, so 17 out of the last 20 years, even during years when we have significant growth. And so -- but once you factor in international, net migration becomes positive. As far as the exact percentage, that's influenced by a lot of factors. It's influenced by, of course, supply and the demand and where the macroeconomy generally is. And of course it's influenced by the affordability ratio. So I don't think I could do you justice by making a straight line from migration number to a absolute percentage of increase.
Connor Mitchell: Yeah, of course. And then, just another question. You've talked about the secured financing a little bit. So after you issued the secured debt earlier this year recently, just wondering if you could give an update on how the unsecured market is looking now versus the secured market and whether there's been any narrowing of the spreads? The unsecured market has improved a little bit since then. Thanks.
Barb Pak: Yeah, this is Barb. So on the unsecured bond market for us today, we would probably be in the high 6% range to do a 10-year unsecured bond offering. And if we were to go do a secured loan, 10-year secured loan like we did, I think we're in around a mid-six. So there has been a little bit of a narrowing from when we originally did our secured loan back in July, but there hasn't been a lot of transactions on unsecured bond market as well. And so it's a little unknown at this time. But we feel good about where we executed and our capital needs for next year. We don't have a lot of capital needs next year.
Connor Mitchell: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys. Couple quick ones for me. First, Angela, I guess I'm curious, any perspective on -- there's an article in New York Times the other day, in it called -- California called -- slam San Francisco for egregious barriers to housing I think was the header. So I'm curious if you have any thoughts on this. Certainly the idea of low barrier to entry, low supply in California is the key theme, key part of the thesis there. So I'm curious if there's any perhaps updated perspective reviews on the barriers to building, if there's any changes that are being contemplated that could be real and how that could impact the marketplace? Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Haendel. It's Angela here. It's a good question, I think. We've all seen the acute housing shortage in California and despite Governor Newsom's efforts to enact multiple legislations to spur housing production, it just has not moved the needle in a meaningful way. And you may recall that he campaigned on building 3.5 million homes by 2025. And as part of that, there were numerous legislation passed and even recently a few more passed. But that barrier continues because there is a cost barrier, there is -- as part of legislations they enacted requiring prevailing wages, there's environmental protections and so it just is very challenging. And so I go back to that original goal of 3.5 million homes that to be built by 2025. Currently they're on track and have issued about 450,000 permits. So now units built and we're two years away. So that gives you the magnitude of how we view supply and why we do believe that it will remain favorable. And when we look at the permit data, it remains very low as well.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it, got it, thank you for that. And then one more, I believe, earlier you mentioned that concessions in San Francisco, broadly in your portfolio average, one week. I was hoping you could bifurcate that a bit further, maybe San Francisco proper versus down in Peninsula. Thank you.
Jessica Anderson: Hello, this is Jessica. I don't have that information in front of me. I mean, San Francisco is such a small market for us with just a 1,000 units and a couple of large buildings. But like I said, as far as what we're currently offering, I would say roughly one week free with a little bit more in pockets of the Bay Area like San Jose. Oakland is supply impacted, so we have higher concessions there. Seattle, very minimal concessions. All of Southern California outside of Los Angeles, minimal concessions.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Over the next 12 months across, which markets would you expect the highest rent growth and how much faster might growth be in these markets versus your portfolio average?
Angela Kleiman: Hi It's Angela here. We do expect our Northern region to outpace the southern region, and so particularly Northern California and Seattle, and for different reasons. Northern California much lower supply and of course will have a benefit ultimately from the tech hiring when they come. And Seattle, it's been our strongest job growth market, but Seattle also has a higher level of supply, about two times of that of California as a percentage. So about 1% of stock versus 0.5%. Having said that, both of these markets, particularly in Northern region are rebounding and of course, Northern California, as I've mentioned before, has a much better affordability metric. And so for those reasons, we do expect the Northern region to outperformed the Southern regions.
Linda Tsai: And then just one quick follow-up on expenses. Given the commentary about higher utility insurance costs in '24 , do you see more markets where this is more pronounced versus others?
Barb Pak: Yeah, this is Barb. No, on the insurance front, it's just a broad -- it's actually a national issue, not an Essex, Pacific or West Coast issue. We're just seeing a lot of pressure on insurance cost and we expect that to continue. It's been an issue in '23, we expect that issue in '24. And then on the utilities front, we're up about 6% year-to-date, and we do expect that utility pressures will continue to be above inflationary levels near term, despite all the ESG efforts we're putting into place. And so those two will cause expense growth to be elevated next year.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.
Angela Kleiman: Goodbye.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-28 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman, you may begin.
Angela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex's second quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. We delivered a solid second quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the high end of our guidance range. In addition, we are pleased to announce a meaningful increase to our 2023 guidance for same property revenues, NOI and core FFO per share growth. Barb will discuss this further in a moment. Our performance to date demonstrates the underlying strength of the West Coast economy along with continued refinement to our operating strategy. My remarks today will focus on our 2023 revised outlook for the West Coast and conclude with an update on the transaction market. Starting with expectations for the balance of the year, as shown on Page S17 of the supplemental. Our improved outlook reflects the year-to-date resilience of the economy and labor markets both surpassing our initial forecast. This dynamic, coupled with slowing apartment deliveries have contributed to a healthy demand for rental housing in our markets. As a result, we raised our average market rent growth expectations for the West Coast by 50 basis points to 2.5%, with notable increases to San Diego and San Jose.  Demand associated with job growth is a key driver to the revision. We now expect our markets to generate 1.7% job growth for the full year. This is mostly attributable to the growth achieved in the first half of the year, with our markets posting 2.6% job growth on a trailing 3-month average through June.  Additionally, the layoff announcements from the largest technology companies have proven less consequential than headlines suggested with only a fraction occurring within our markets, and the vast majority of those affected quickly finding new employment.  Turning to the supply outlook. Our research forecast a slight reduction in 2023 deliveries as a few delay projects get pushed into 2024. While we have been pleased with the steady job growth achieved on the West Coast to start the year, we remain cognizant of the potential for more interest rate increases given the Fed's focus on inflation reduction. Thus, our job outlook contemplates a moderating economy as we approach year-end. And accordingly, our base case expectation assumes modest market rent growth for the remainder of the year. Looking forward to the next several years, we see the West Coast as uniquely positioned to generate above-average rent growth based on 3 key factors present today. First and most importantly, the West Coast supply outlook is relatively muted, and a multiyear lead time is required to develop new housing in our markets. With permitting activities declining, we expect to benefit from moderate supply levels for years to come.  Second is rental affordability. Since 2020, average personal income in the Essex market has grown over 20% compared to cumulative rent growth of 10%, resulting in attractive rental affordability. Furthermore, high cost of homeownership continues to favor renting. It is now over 2x expensive to own compared to rent in the Essex market.  Third, solid demand drivers. Our Southern region continues to demonstrate stable growth supported by a diverse and vibrant economy. Likewise, the Northern region economies are steadily growing, a key driver is the investment in AI companies that are largely concentrated in Northern California. We've seen open positions of the top 10 tech companies improved gradually each month since the trough earlier this year.  Lastly, fully remote as a percent of total job postings have significantly declined at below 10% in June. For these reasons, we expect the West Coast to continue gaining momentum for the remainder of 2023 and outperform over the next several years. Lastly, turning to the investment markets. Transaction activities in the West Coast have remained muted. Similar to the first quarter, volume in the second quarter was about 55% lower than the same period prior year with cap rates in the mid-4% to low 5% range for institutional quality properties. We are starting to see more deals actively marketed at a similar valuation levels. Interest from a healthy group of buyers range from local syndicators to large institutional and foreign investors. As expected, leverage buyers remain largely in the sidelines, waiting for more clarity on interest rates. We continue to diligently underwrite deals as we are well positioned to be opportunistic.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with a brief overview of our second quarter results, discuss increases to our full year guidance and provide an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. Beginning with our second quarter performance. I'm pleased to report we achieved core FFO per share of $3.77. This result exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share, of which $0.06 is attributable to better revenue growth and lower property taxes in Washington. Our favorable year-to-date results have enabled us to increase the full year midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by approximately 40 basis points to 4.4%. The increase is due to higher occupancy and net effective rents achieved year-to-date, partially offset by higher delinquency in the second half of the year as compared to our original forecast. As it relates to same-property operating expenses, we have reduced our midpoint by 100 basis points to 4% as a result of a reduction in Washington property taxes.  Due to these revisions, our full year same-property NOI growth has increased to 4.5% at the midpoint, representing a 90 basis points improvement to our guidance -- to our initial guidance. As a result of our strong second quarter and revisions to our same-property outlook, we are raising the full year midpoint of core FFO by $0.22 to $15 per share, which represents 3.4% year-over-year growth. Turning to capital markets activities. We have historically been proactive in managing our capital needs and debt maturity profile, taking advantage of attractive opportunities in the market to refinance our debt early, minimizing our near-term capital needs and maximizing our financial flexibility. Subsequent to quarter-end, we closed a $298 million 10-year secured loan at a fixed rate of 5.08%. Proceeds will be used to repay unsecured bonds maturing in May 2024.  In the interim, the proceeds will be invested in short-term cash accounts, resulting in a positive impact to FFO of approximately $0.03 per share until the unsecured bonds are repaid next year. Our capital markets team did a terrific job monitoring the variety of debt capital sources available and locking in a favorable rate in today's volatile environment. With this refinancing, the company has addressed approximately 50% of the 2024 debt maturities at pro rata share. Finally, our balance sheet metrics remain strong. Leverage continues to decline, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend lower and stands at 5.6x today. We have minimum near-term financing needs over the next 18 months and over $1.6 billion in liquidity. As such, the company remains in a strong financial position. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Anderson.
Jessica Anderson: Thanks, Barb. I'll begin my comments today by providing color on our recent operating results and strategy, followed by regional commentary. I was pleased with our operating results from the second quarter, including a same-property revenue increase of 4% year-over-year. For the first several months of the year, we maintained an occupancy-focused leasing strategy to mitigate expected headwinds from eviction-related move-outs. This approach helped us exceed revenue expectations in the first half of the year and left us well positioned to push rate during peak leasing season, which continues today. Our new lease trade-out accelerated through the second quarter from 0.5% in May to 1.7% in June and finally to a preliminary 2.1% in July. Renewal trade-out is stable and averaged 3.4%, resulting in blended net effective rent growth of 2.2% for the second quarter. These results were achieved despite increased turnover driven by eviction-related move-outs. Given ongoing delinquency court backlog, we will continue to work through evictions for the rest of the year and anticipate some of this activity spilling over into 2024. Moving on to regional specific commentary. In Seattle, blended net effective rent growth averaged negative 0.2% for the second quarter, dragging down the portfolio average. This is attributed to 2 key factors. First is the year-over-year comp. In the second quarter of 2022, Seattle generated a portfolio-leading net effective rent growth of over 16%.  Second, Seattle remains our most seasonal market, thus is more sensitive to changes in the operating environment. You may recall during the back half of 2022, the Seattle market experienced increased supply during a period of softening demand, which heavily impacted rents as we headed into 2023. However, throughout the second quarter, we saw a steady strengthening of demand, particularly in Seattle CBD that coincided with Amazon's mandatory May 1 return-to-office of 3 days a week. Strong leasing activity drove a collective 680 basis point sequential increase in net effective rents from April to June and a solid 97% quarter-end occupancy. Moving on to Northern California. Blended net effective rent growth averaged 1.5% for the second quarter. Oakland continues to be impacted by supply posting a negative 0.4% for the quarter, diluting the healthy 2.7% achieved in San Jose, where the bulk of our Northern California portfolio is located. Despite the tech employment headlines, we still experienced corporate housing activity associated with the large tech companies albeit muted from last year, which helped support seasonal demand. Quarter-end occupancy was also solid at 96.7%.  Lastly, in Southern California, blended net effective rent growth averaged 4.1% for the quarter, driven by continued strength in San Diego, Ventura and Orange County. Los Angeles is pulling the average down with a 1.9% blended lease trade-out for the quarter. However, because of the eviction activity in this market, rent growth and occupancy are expected to run lower relative to the rest of Southern California for the remainder of the year. Quarter-end occupancy in Southern California was 96.3%.  In summary, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of the year and the current operating environment. As we begin the third quarter, we are well positioned with the current physical occupancy of 96.7%, coupled with strong leasing activity across all markets. As we look to the back half of the year, we will reassess our rent growth focused strategy as the summer leasing season wraps up in the next 30 days and maintain our flexible approach to maximize revenue in a variety of market conditions. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe: I think at NAREIT, you mentioned that you saw some earlier move-outs of nonpaying tenants, which probably was impacting your pricing and the use of concessions. But based on your comments and just looking at the July data, it seems like your delinquent percentage is staying about the same. So I'm just trying to reconcile that and try to understand when we might actually see the delinquent percentage come down.
Barbara Pak: Eric, it's Barb. I would say delinquency is generally tracking in mind. We were ahead in the first 6 months relative to our plan, primarily due to emergency rental assistance payments. July is generally on plan. And we do expect that number will continue to trend lower. And by the end of the year will be below 2%. We left our midpoint unchanged at 2% for the full year. But we are making progress, but it's slow, it's dependent upon the courts and just resident behavior. So it's a little bit out of our control.
Eric Wolfe: Understood. But I guess, just to be clear, I mean, if I look at the sort of May data around new leases, you're using concessions, that was what was depressing that number. I mean, guess what -- I guess what drove that then? And then what changed to allow you to feel more comfortable with the push rate?
Jessica Anderson: This is Jessica. Eric, I'll take that. With regards to our shift in strategy around mid-May, we changed from an occupancy-focused strategy to more focus on rent growth. And to your point, what got us more comfortable with that? Well, a couple of things. One would be really the macroeconomic outlook, the headlines that we're seeing earlier in the year and the layoffs, and the headlines overall were concerning. And so we took a proactive approach and the layoffs subsided, and we started seeing strengthening. And then in addition to that, with regards to the eviction, they've been coming back at a pretty steady pace, which is manageable.  And so based on the strength we were seeing in the markets and the manageable pace, at which we were getting the evictions, we felt comfortable shifting to a rate growth focus. And what you're seeing in April and May that we had shared as far as our trade-out numbers so reflects concession usage that was predominantly in April. We averaged about a week free at that point. We did go through a lot of evictions that we wanted to offset and reposition our occupancy at a higher rate right before peak season and some of that activity spilled over into May. But as of today, concession usage is minimal across all of our markets.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
Stephen Sakwa: Just to follow-up on Eric's question, just to be clear. So your delinquencies baked into guidance are basically 2% for Q3 and Q4? And then secondly, can you just provide some color on what your blended, I guess, rate expectations are for Q3 and Q4?
Barbara Pak: Steve, this is Barb. I'll take the first part of that question. And so in terms of delinquency, yes, it's roughly 2% for the full year. We're at 2.1% today, year-to-date. And so it's a little bit under that in the back half of the year. Like I said, we do expect it to continue to trend favorable, but it's an inherent lumpy number. And so it's difficult to predict month-to-month, but end of the year should be less than 2% for sure. And then on the blended, I'll let Jessica answer that.
Jessica Anderson: Steve, this is Jessica. As far as blended goes, I'm going to break that out into new lease and to renewals. And so year-to-date for our new leases, we've achieved 1.1%. But keep in mind, that reflects our focus on maintaining a high occupancy earlier in the year. And so we gave approximately it's over half a week in concessions to maintain that higher occupancy. And when we look at our outlook, we've revised it from 2% full year rent growth to 2.5%, which reflects the broader expectations of the market.  And so in order to make it apples-to-apples, we have to adjust our first half. And so essentially half a week is 1% of rent growth. And so if you add that to our 1.1%, you get to 2.1%, which leads us to 2.8% for new lease growth expected for the back half of the year. And based on the strength that we're seeing in the markets right now, and then the easier comps that we'll be facing in Q3, particularly Q4, that is an achievable number.  And then as far as renewals go, renewals are reaccelerating. We've sent renewals out in August and September at around 4%. You may have noticed in our results that renewals had come down, which essentially went to 2.8% preliminary for July. And renewals trail new leases by approximately 60 to 90 days. So wherever new lease -- new leases go renewals end up following, but we've been able to achieve some solid rent growth. And so therefore, the renewals reaccelerated and expect renewals to be around 4% for the back half of the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: So given the strength that you highlighted year-to-date, the benefit to same-store revenue growth in the first half of the year as well as some of the new lease rate growth momentum you achieved in June and July. I guess, why leave your back half same-store revenue growth guidance of 3% unchanged?
Barbara Pak: Yes. This is Barb. I would say, I think we know -- we've done the vast majority of our leases. We still have some to go. So we know where leases are going to trend this year and that top line number. If we get substantially more rent growth from here, it's really going to benefit 2024 at this point versus 2023 given the amount of time that's left in the year. And the number of leases that we have left to sign is lower in the third and the fourth quarter. And so I think that's the biggest factor. The biggest factor to our guidance at this point in terms of same-store is really delinquency. It can swing up or down. That's the biggest wildcard right now. I think with other -- the other components of the same-store revenue are pretty dialed in.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then, Jessica, I think you said 2.8% new lease rate growth in the back half of the year. Just trying to understand the cadence of that through the back half, obviously, starting in the low 2% range here. You've got easier comps coming given the deceleration you saw last year. So can you give us a sense of that cadence? And then from a back half perspective, what type of seasonality did you underwrite for the back half?
Jessica Anderson: So as far as where we see trade-out going would expect that is slightly different by market, but expect that to accelerate from here. It will be higher in Q4, and that's simply based on the comps, as you pointed out. And then as far as seasonality goes, we see this as being a typical year, and we may have a prolonged peak. We've been monitoring our rents. And typically, we peak in NorCal and Seattle around -- right around about now or mid-July and then SoCal is often a little bit later. But as of this week, we're still seeing rents accelerate in San Jose specifically in Southern California, and some of our other markets are leveling off at this point. So pretty normal, but we're seeing strong leasing on the ground and anticipate a typical seasonal slowdown.
Operator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.
James Feldman: Your comments and also EQR commented earlier, talked about maybe an improving return-to-office, especially in the Bay Area. Can you talk more about what you're seeing? And also, how do you think about the implications for suburban versus urban type of assets as more people are getting pulled in the cities? I think their comment was the urban -- more urban as the people want to be closer to their workplaces.
Angela Kleiman: Jamie, it's Andrea here. I think there are a couple of things that are different between how our portfolio is located versus EQR and where the key job nodes are in California versus the rest of the country. So I'll start there. So as it relates to the urban, suburban conversation, keep in mind that in California, most of the large tech companies are actually suburban based. And so that, of course, for us, it's always been a benefit even pre-COVID. And the underlying strength is a couple of factors, right? Lower supply in the suburban [indiscernible] the cities are tougher, quality of life, more homeless and some of these other issues.  And of course, the proximity to employers are much more favorable from that perspective. And so from that perspective, Essex, our view is that the suburban still is more compelling than the urban. And that is consistent to our prime [indiscernible] even for COVID. As far as the return to office, we saw that in Seattle with Amazon early May. And although I do want to say that, that was somewhat muted than normal just because of the layoff announcements. And so it was really people digesting and getting rehired. And so from the return-to-office activity, what we would expect to see is that it will be more pronounced in September with Meta and some of these other larger companies. Essex, for us, we're doing the same thing. We are mandating a 3-day working from office now until September after Labor Day as well. And so we do see that at that point, the activities will resume in a more robust way.
James Feldman: Okay. And then as we think about your expenses heading into kind of late into the fourth quarter or even into next year. Can you just talk a little bit about where you think you may see either the greatest moderation or maybe some acceleration in operating expense growth across the major line items?
Barbara Pak: Yes, this is Barb. I would say in the back half of this year, we have easier comps as it relates to eviction costs and turnover because we had those expenses last year in the fourth quarter. And so some of the expenses that we've seen in the first quarter and some of our high R&M, and admin expenses will moderate in the back half of the year just on a year-over-year growth basis. I would say, in terms of other lines this year, I don't see significant change in any other major line this year. I think we've got expenses pretty dialed in for this year, we do know taxes and insurance.  As we look to 2024, it's difficult to predict just yet where we're going to land. We'll be going through our budget process here this quarter, and I'll have more clarity on the next quarter call. The 1 line item that we've talked about in the past is insurance, it still is a very challenging market. We would expect that we would be up 20-plus percent next year on the insurance line. But keep in mind, that's a very small line for us. It's only like 4% of our total OpEx spend. So while the headline number is large, it's a small component of our OpEx. And outside of that and outside of the favorable taxes we have in California, where they only grow 2%, we need a little more time to dial in 2024.
James Feldman: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess just sticking with insurance, are you seeing any lightening up from the insurance company in terms of what they're willing to offer as they build up their capital reserves? Or no, you think it's going to be another tough year?
Barbara Pak: Right now, based on what we know, we believe it will be a tough year. We're going to go through our renewal in the fourth quarter of this year. Our renewal comes up in December. And so I'll have more clarity on the next call in terms of that market. But based on what we're hearing, we think it's still a very challenging market.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: So two questions. First, Angela, you made comments before that sort of outward migration from California is always a constant, but it's the HP-1 visas, the overseas tech workers, et cetera., entrepreneurs who immigrate to the country that offset and drive. So just sort of curious, what's the latest on tech hiring from overseas? Whether it's permanent or sort of the annual consultants who they bring in? Just curious what's going on there.
Angela Kleiman: Yes, Alex, that's a good question. We haven't seen an active hiring from an international basis yet. And what we have seen is on a net migration for California as a whole. So this is market as a whole. That net outflow remains negative, but it hasn't been -- it's gotten better. So during COVID, it was an extreme outflow. And now when we look at the net migration outflow number, it's pretty consistent to pre-COVID. And so we do think that once we have that international, it would definitely be a good tailwind. As far as when we look at our own portfolio, just on a more granular level, so this is move-ins. We saw a pop last year between the first and third quarter with California reopening, and that acceleration was definitely very encouraging to see. And since then, the move-out, obviously, it's not going to continue at that level in terms of acceleration. But the -- I'm sorry, I meant to say the move-ins, but it has remained positive, and it's been stable. And so that's another good sign.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is on capital markets. You guys did a secured loan that wasn't for a JV. Normally, I guess, in REIT land for the investment-grade companies, we expect secured loans either in times of distress or for a joint venture asset. Here, it seems like the unsecured debt markets are open. So just sort of curious the decision on that. And also, I imagine there were probably a bunch of people who are out there hungry to buy more of your unsecured. So maybe it's just maybe if something else planned later in the year that satisfies that. But just sort of curious about the decision to do secured and what seems to be a functioning unsecured debt market?
Barbara Pak: Alex, it's Barb. That's a great question. I will tell you, we do prefer unsecured debt, and that's been kind of our ammo for many, many years as that's the way we finance the balance sheet. In this environment, though, we saw a significant pricing differential between the secured and unsecured market. So while we locked in our -- the secured loans at 5.0%. If we were to go to do an unsecured bond, it would have been 65 to 75 basis points wide of that. And so that pricing differential was so great that we decided to move forward with the secured side of the equation. 95% of our NOI is unencumbered. And so we have lots of room within our covenants to secure a few assets. And there's no change in our overall balance sheet philosophy. It was just really a pricing differential that made us move the way we did.
Operator: Our next question is from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: Just wanted to ask about the R&M same-store expenses. It looks like it was impacted by storms and flooding damage in the first half of the year. One, is that all behind us now, so it will kind of normalize out in 3Q? And then what would that trend look like if you could strip out the storm impact?
Barbara Pak: This is Barb again. Yes, you're correct. It is impacted by some of the spillover from the storm and flood damage cleanup costs in the second quarter. We had a lot in the first quarter and some of it still is in the second quarter. And it also had higher turnover costs because keep in mind, we are getting back units. And so it's that and then just general inflation -- inflationary pressures within the R&M space.  And so it's three components. In terms of if we just pulled out the flood, I don't have that in front of me. I'll get back to you on what that would be. But it's really all 3 of those components that drove that increase. In the back half of the year, though, I do expect that number to come down. First of all, we don't expect the same level of storms or floods. It's not a rainy season here right now. And so that should abate and not be in our third or fourth quarter numbers. And then the eviction-related turnover costs, we have easier comps in the third and fourth quarter because we started incurring those last year in the third and fourth quarter. So that 14% that we had in the third quarter should moderate significantly in the third and fourth quarter.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that, Barb. And then can you just clarify when exactly you made that strategy shift from occupancy to rate growth. And then I guess my real question is, does that imply you have a bigger mark-to-market? I'm not sure if you actually set the mark-to-market at this time.
Jessica Anderson: Josh, this is Jessica. Yes, we switched really about mid-May. And as far as the mark-to-market, we're looking -- right now, our loss-to-lease is 1.7%. But as I mentioned earlier, still seeing our rents grow in some markets. And so expect that potentially to go up a little bit more.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Is that about average of the loss-to-lease at this time of the year, 1.7%? Or is it a little bit below normal because of that -- the initial strategy on the occupancy?
Jessica Anderson: Yes, it's definitely a little suppressed based on our approach earlier in the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yubico with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Daniel [indiscernible] on for Nick. I can ask the question. So July new lease rates accelerated nicely from 2Q. So just curious what markets drove that sequential improvement? And second, do you think it's possible to see continued acceleration given some of your larger markets have lagged year-to-date and are, I guess, still recovering in a sense in tandem with the pretty benign supply backdrop?
Jessica Anderson: This is Jessica. Yes, we did see Seattle was a large contributor to the sequential improvement, followed by Northern California. Southern California has been performing pretty steadily. And then as far as specific markets in Northern California, San Jose has been particularly strong, which reflects over 40% of our portfolio in the Bay Area. So we've seen strong occupancy, strong leasing demand. That one is encouraging, certainly watching it. We've seen with all of the prior return to office announcement. So Amazon and Seattle CBD and then last year with Google as well in the Bay Area, there's definitely demand associated to these return to office events.  And so anticipating that Meta, which is in September is going to have the same impact. I would imagine, we're experiencing some of that demand right now. And then also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the corporate housing activity. It is less than last year, but we still saw the activity this year, which is always an encouraging sign as far as the health of the big tech employers, they certainly wouldn't be investing in interns and contract work if they were planning on tightening their belts and we've certainly seen an uptick in hiring as well.  So San Jose has been doing quite well. And then Seattle had already touched on the Seattle CBD and the Amazon returned to office, so that was a factor. And we're still seeing strength in demand today. However, it is our most market. And so we certainly see the most pronounced reduction in rents in the back half of the year in that market. But I expect it to be in line with our typical seasonal curve and expectations there and then also supply. We do have good supply headwinds in Seattle. Some of it was pushed to the first half of 2024. So it's a little bit better than what we originally expected, but we still have some supply on our radar there.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then I'm not sure if you have an answer to this question, but San Diego, one of your stronger markets. Wondering if you have a sense of like which employment sectors are driving demand in that market for your assets?
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. The key drivers in actually all of our markets have been in the health services and education and, of course, the leisure and hospitality as well. And so with San Diego rebounding, it's been good to see those activities coming back in a more robust way.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: On the Washington property taxes coming in lower than expected, was that due to a favorable appeal that you had or lower mill rates or something else?
Barbara Pak: John, it's Barb. So property taxes in Washington declined 1% year-over-year. The assessed values went up 15%. So when we were budgeting, we knew assess side were up quite a bit, but millage rates came down. And so that's what drove the favorable year-over-year reduction in taxes. There was -- it wasn't based on a PL.
John Kim: Do you think that rate is a good run rate going forward? Or is it more of a onetime reduction?
Barbara Pak: It's really hard to know. So there's a lag effect in terms of when they do the bills. So our '24 bills will be based off of 1 January of '23 assess values, which we don't know what those will be at this point. Obviously, values have changed over the last year. But it also depends on the millage and what the city does with that. And so that's always a wildcard factor. Historically, we've not had a reduction in Seattle taxes 2 years in a row. But -- so we'll have to just monitor and see next year. I don't know if 1 -- a negative 1% is a good way. I wouldn't use that. I don't think that's how we would view it going forward, but we are pleasantly surprised this year.
John Kim: Okay. My second question is on your loss-to-lease. I think Jessica mentioned it was 1.7%. Last year, Angela mentioned that the September loss-to-lease is a good indicator for your future earnings. And I'm wondering how you think that trend just given the market rental rate assumption has gone up? I think you touched on this a little bit, but where do you see that September loss-to-lease go to?
Barbara Pak: Well, it's definitely a little bit too early to predict that, and we have -- while we've had a typical seasonal curve. It will be interesting to see how the back half of peak leasing season plays out. And yes, I did share it, we have the 1.7% loss-to-lease today. But based on several of our markets, still accelerating with rent growth week-over-week that may grow from here and also the Meta return to office that we're watching and the demand overall in the Bay Area could change how we typically experience in August or September. So in short, it's a little bit early. And yes, we will look at that in September as we typically do.
Angela Kleiman: Just a little context. I think last year, around this time, we were sitting around 7% loss-to-lease. And -- but we were looking at the seasonal curve that is occurring in a more -- that mirror pre-COVID level. What happened was the prior year, we didn't even peak until November. So it's been a little wonky coming out of COVID. And so it's September, generally, as a rule of thumb is a good data point. But just because of the uniqueness in the past couple of years, I just -- we didn't want anyone to just peg a June number as a good rule of thumb.
Operator: Our next question is from Handel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: So first question is on transactions. As we've heard we've seen still pretty stalled. But you mentioned that you're diligently underwriting deals. So I'm curious where you peg the bid-ask spread at today and where asset pricing would need to be for you to get more active?
Adam Berry: Haendel, this is Adam. So yes, we are underwriting every deal in the market. And even though in Q2, volume went down pretty considerably. Q3, I expect it to be increased just given the amount of activity in the market today. So we are underwriting a lot of deals right now. And there isn't much of a bit-ask spread. I think many of the deals -- most of the deals that are on the market today will make. So I think there will be capitulation on both sides and a meeting of the minds. And I think echoing what Angela said in her opening comments, I think those are going to be in the mid-4s to low 5s range depending on product, location and then specific circumstances, whether there's assumable debt or some tax abatements.  So as far as when we will be back in the market, I think that's really highly dependent on where our cost of capital is. So given where we're trading today, that it's hard to make accretive deals in the mid-4s to low 5s. And so we will continue to market or continue to monitor the market, and we will act when it makes sense.
Haendel St. Juste: Got you. That's helpful. A follow-up on the conversation around concessions. Can you guys provide a more detailed breakdown perhaps by region what the average concession that you're providing in your NorCal or SoCal and Seattle regions are and then also a loss-to-lease by region?
Jessica Anderson: Sure. This is Jessica. So concessions in Q2 by region. So if you look at Southern California, it's a little less than half a week. Northern California, 1 week and Seattle a little bit over half a week. So that gets us to 0.7 weeks overall. And keep in mind that a lot of that was concentrated in the April time frame. Some of it's build over into May. By the time we got to the end of the quarter, we pretty much have no concessions across the portfolio with the exception a very small portion of our portfolio that is exposed to lease that's like 10 to 15 properties or so. And then as far as loss-to-lease by market, Southern California, 2.5%; Northern California, 0.7%; and Seattle, 1.9% to make up the 1.7%.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. And then sorry, if I missed this, but what's the embedded assumption for bad debt impact the revenue in the back half of the year?
Barbara Pak: Haendel, it's Barb. It's roughly 2%, a little bit under 2%, consistent with the full year forecast.
Haendel St. Juste: That's the incremental tailwind? You're saying that the expectations by year-end? Is that the incremental benefit you expect in the back half of the year?
Barbara Pak: No, that's the assumption. So we assume 2% for the full year. We're at 2.1% through the first 6 months of the year, we assume effectively like 1.9% in the back half of the year to hit our 2.0% for the full year. So it is an incremental improvement in the back half as well.
Operator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Green Street.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a follow up on the question earlier. What's the total magnitude of acquisitions, you're hoping to achieve in the back half of this year?
Adam Berry: Robin, this is Adam. So at this point, our intention is to -- well, our guidance really is not to acquire anything in the back half of the year. We -- like I said, we've been underwriting everything. And if there are deals that makes sense strategically that fit in with our existing portfolio, whether through economies of scale or other methods, then we will focus more on those deals. But for the moment, given our cost of capital, we wouldn't expect much on the acquisitions front.
Unidentified Analyst: So with, I guess, in a scenario where there's minimal acquisition, then no development starts penciled. Do you expect to -- how do stock buybacks stack up in terms of midterm priorities for capital allocation?
Barbara Pak: Yes. I mean we did do stock buybacks in the first quarter, and we will assess our sources of capital to do that because we want to maintain our balance sheet strength and a leverage neutral approach to the stock buyback. So we would need a source of capital to continue to buy back the stock, and so that would imply that we would dispose of something.  So it will all depend on where we can find opportunities to add value to the bottom line. Because at the end of the day, that's our goal on the external front is how can we grow accretively. And to Adam's point, it's hard to do it via acquisitions today. But it doesn't mean that we're just going to go buy back the stock. We would need a source of capital to do that as well. So it all go into the mix.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate that response. And then finally for me, can you give us a rough direction on what percentage of the $100 million outstanding delinquencies that you think you'll ultimately be able to collect?
Barbara Pak: Yes, it's a great question. It's difficult to know. I mean, obviously, we'll get some of that. But -- and none of that is baked into our guidance for delinquency this year. We are making progress collecting. The problem is, until the courts get caught up delinquency keeps accruing because we have tenants that are in our properties a lot longer than they were historically. Pre-COVID, if somebody went delinquent, they were out within 2 to 3 months. And now they go delinquent, they're out in 9 to 12 months. And so that's part of the compounding problem on the delinquency side and the cumulative delinquency side. In terms of what we're going to collect, I can't give you a number. It's just too hard to predict.
Unidentified Analyst: Do you think it's closer to 10%, 20% or towards 50%? I understand it's very hard to predict.
Barbara Pak: Yes. I'm not going to throw out a number because it's just not something that we know with any sort of certainty at this point. We're working hard to collect every time that we can. We've used all measures possible to go after these tenants who are delinquent and have delinquent balances, but it's not a number I can throw out there.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
Michael Goldsmith: For the L.A. market, are you seeing any pressure from the writers and actor strikes? Or does your guidance contemplate any impact from this?
Jessica Anderson: This is Jessica. I'll speak to as far as the on-the-ground operations. We have not seen any impact from a strike at this point. We track our exposure to the major studios and it's less than 1% of our L.A. portfolio. And so I think it really comes down to how long the strike is going to go on and if there's potentially a ripple effect to other industries. But at this point, we do not see it have a material impact on our portfolio would have to go on for some time. There may be specific property impact, but not the larger portfolio as a whole.
Michael Goldsmith: That's helpful context. And for my follow-up question, when you look at the A versus B quality properties. Are you seeing any differences in trends between them? Is there any differences in demand or tenant health and how that's trending between A versus B quality properties?
Jessica Anderson: This is Jessica again. As far as A versus B, we do not see a material difference in performance. It's more really location. So back to the whole suburban versus urban concept. And the bulk of our portfolio is suburban, and we are seeing strength in our suburban market versus some of the urban properties. And really, I think that's attributed to supply as well. When we look at where we have concentrations of supply is in these urban locations. So Seattle CBD, Downtown L.A., West L.A., Downtown San Diego, and that's where we would see rent lag. So urban versus suburban is where we're seeing the difference.
Operator: Our next question is from Nathan [indiscernible] with Robert W. Baird.
Unidentified Analyst: Can you speak to what is driving the strength in San Diego? And which market or markets do you believe will be the next to see a rebound?
Jessica Anderson: This is Jessica. So yes, San Diego has been a phenomenal market for us. I think it benefited during the pandemic. It was a popular area to relocate to, rents were lower and overall great quality of life. And as Angela mentioned earlier, there is some underlying employment industries that have strength there. So San Diego has been very solid, and we expect it to continue to perform well. As far as other markets that I have my eye on that are showing signs of strength, go back up to the Bay Area with San Jose. Just to reiterate what I'm seeing there, that's been a strong market for us. And then when you couple that with the recovery as well that we still anticipate with continued return to office and where we're at relative to pre-COVID rent. There's definitely an upside there and then up in the Seattle area for similar reasons. But of course, we're going to be facing some supply headwinds there over the next year.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Ms. Kleinman, you may begin.
Angela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex's first quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter that exceeded our initial expectations, and that we are raising the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for the full year. Barb and Jessica will provide more details on the quarter, while my comments will focus on our economic outlook, the opportunities within our platform, and some perspectives on the apartment transaction market. Beginning with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we continue to anticipate modest economic growth in 2023 resulting from a more restrictive monetary policy tempering job growth nationally. Our assumptions are detailed on Page 17 of our supplemental package. As we all know, the West Coast is home to some of the largest companies to announce layoffs over the past six months. Even so, the West Coast economies have proven resilient, producing a solid job growth of 2.7% on a trailing three month basis through March. We believe there are two key factors contributing to the durability of the underlying West Coast fundamentals. First, many of the layoff workers have quickly found new jobs. And second, the vast majority of the layoff affected people who do not reside on the West Coast. For example, we continue to monitor WARN notices and, of the largest companies to announce layoffs, only 16% of their reductions have occurred in our markets. With the exception of a few specific submarkets, the overall labor market and demand for housing in the West Coast had a healthy start to the year. On the supply side, the outlook remains favorable with only about 60 basis points of total housing stock forecasted to deliver in 2023, the supply risk in our markets remain low. We expect that continued housing production challenges, such as diminished labor force and high construction costs, should lead to relatively [light] (ph) apartment deliveries for the next several years in our markets. Thus, we do not need meaningful job growth to generate modest rent growth in 2023. Since none of us have control over the Fed or the economy, our team will remain focused on what we can control, which is the continued enhancement of our operating platform. We have been thoughtfully transforming our operating model for several years, which has resulted in one of the most efficient operating platforms in the industry. Relative to our peers, Essex has the highest controllable operating margins and one of the lowest average controllable expense per unit. While the rollout of our property collections model has contributed to this efficiency, we are only midway through implementation. Our next phase of expanding this operating model to the maintenance function will maximize the workflow of our associates, including reducing tasks time and vendor costs. These advancements will enable incremental revenue growth to flow more efficiently to the bottom-line, ultimately generating additional FFO per share and dividend growth throughout all economic cycles. Lastly, turning to investment activities. We're still seeing institutional quality transactions occur from the mid to high 4% market cap rate with a deeper buyer pool towards the high end of this range. Keep in mind that the transaction market is still digesting higher interest rates, as evidenced by a significant reduction in volume of approximately 70% nationally and 60% in the West Coast in the first quarter compared to last year. In addition to the [indiscernible] volume, our cost of capital remains unattractive from an acquisition's perspective. But keep in mind that Essex has a long track record of creating value for our shareholders by arbitraging discrepancies between the stock price and the underlying asset value. Once again, we demonstrated this strategy in the first quarter, locking in significant FFO and NAV per share accretion for shareholders, which is the primary driver of raising our FFO guidance mentioned earlier. We continue to actively evaluate potential deals and are ready to act swiftly and thoughtfully when opportunities emerge. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with a few comments on our first quarter results and full year guidance, followed by an update on investment activity and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report our first quarter core FFO per share grew 8.3% on a year-over-year, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08. The better-than-expected results are largely attributable to two factors that drove an outperformance in same property revenue growth: first, occupancy trended higher than we expected for the quarter; and second, net delinquencies were better than forecasted as we received $1.3 million in emergency rental assistance. As you may recall, we did not assume any rental assistance funds in our 2023 forecast. Overall gross delinquency was 2.5% of scheduled rents for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Given the favorable first quarter results, we are currently running 30 basis points ahead of our full year midpoint for same property revenue growth. However, given the macroeconomic uncertainty and the timing of recapturing delinquent units, which remains uncertain, we are holding off on changing our same property guidance range until we get further into the peak leasing season. As for core FFO, we are raising our full year midpoint by $0.03 per share, primarily related to accretion from stock repurchases completed in the first quarter and higher other income. Turning to our stock repurchases and investments. During the quarter, we sold a 61-year-old student housing community located in a non-core market. The proceeds were used to buy back the stock on a leverage neutral basis in order to arbitrage a significant disconnect between public and private market pricing. This is another example of how Essex seeks to create value in all environments while at the same time improving our portfolio. As it relates to our preferred equity book, we had little activity to report this quarter. However, for the full year, we still expect about $100 million of early redemption. Our sponsors are able to take advantage of the available financing via Fannie Mae and HUD to redeem us thoroughly. We believe the additional source of financing is one of the many benefits to being in the multifamily sector, which has, over time, helped keep cap rates low. Overall, we remain comfortable with our preferred equity portfolio, especially given how diversified it is both geographically on the West Coast in terms of -- and in terms of the average deal size. Finally, onto the balance sheet. We plan to pay off our upcoming 2023 unsecured bonds that mature May 1 with the proceeds from the $300 million delayed draw term loan, which closed last year. As such, we have no funding needs over the next 12 months. With $1.5 billion in liquidity, limited variable rate debt exposure, and access to a variety of capital sources, our balance sheet remains in a strong position. I will now turn the call to Jessica Anderson.
Jessica Anderson: Thanks, Barb. I'll begin my comments today by providing color on our recent operating results and strategy, followed by regional commentary. I was pleased with our operating results from the first quarter, including a same property revenue increase of 7.6% year-over-year. As Barb mentioned, one core factor driving these results was the successful execution of our occupancy strategy that resulted in a solid 96.7% for the first quarter, up 70 basis points from the fourth quarter. This focus began in Q4 and was done proactively in anticipation of elevated turnover from eviction. During the first quarter, we made progress recapturing units from non-paying tenants and we experienced the highest volume of eviction related move-outs to-date. The number of long-term delinquent residents has declined by 65% from our peak over a year ago, excluding Los Angeles and Alameda County. Additionally, a notable milestone in the first quarter was the ending of the eviction moratoriums in the city and county of Los Angeles, where approximately half of our delinquency resides. Given backloged eviction courts, it will take many months to recapture these units, but steady progress throughout 2023 is expected. I am very proud of the team and appreciate the tremendous amount of work that has gone into recapturing, turning, and re-leasing units. Thank you, team, great job. Throughout the first quarter, we saw positive demand indicators for the portfolio, lead volume, which reflects the number of initial inquiries into leasing an apartment and as a leading indicator of demand, was consistent with and up in some cases over same quarter last year. Additionally, concession usage has declined from approximately two-weeks free in the fourth quarter to a half-a-week free in the first quarter. We are experiencing a relatively normal ramp up to the peak leasing season. Net effective blended rates accelerated through Q1, averaging 2.9% for the quarter and ended with March at 3.8%, although they moderated in April. This was due to a temporary increase in leasing incentives to offset a period of heavy eviction volume. While April averaged 96.4% occupied, we are at 96.9% today and well positioned to absorb additional turnover while still increasing rents as demand allows. Moving on to regional specific commentary. In the Pacific Northwest, our most seasonal market, blended net effective rents were up 30 basis points in the first quarter compared to one year ago. The elevated supply in the downtown submarket is weighing on our regional performance. The supply outlook for Seattle is comparable to 2022 and similarly a more challenging second half of the year is expected. In Northern California, blended net effective rents improved to 2.6% in the first quarter year-over-year. We're seeing strength in the San Jose submarket, offset by supply driven weakness in Oakland. The supply outlook for Northern California remains relatively muted, which will benefit our ability to push rents, presuming job growth continues to outpace the recently announced layoffs. Finally, in Southern California, blended net effective rents were up 5% in the first quarter as demand remained solid. All regions have fared well to start the year, including Los Angeles. As I mentioned earlier, we're expecting elevated turnover in this region driven by eviction. In general, supply outlook in Southern California is very manageable and outside of pockets of supply in submarkets such as West LA, this market is expected to fare well. In summary, 2023 has started off slightly better than expected. Demand for apartments has been solid. We continue to make progress with evictions and our occupancy-focused strategy positions us well. We are cautiously optimistic as we head into the peak leasing season, but also acknowledge the macroeconomic uncertainty that could influence apartment demand through the balance of this year. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Yulico: Great. Thanks. Appreciate some of the commentary on the markets and tech job exposure. I guess if you were to quantify some of the impact to markets whether it's parts of Oakland, Downtown Seattle, any other more difficult markets right now within the portfolio, how would you come up with that as a percentage of a total company?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Nick. It's Angela here. Good question. On the -- on our portfolio composition, big picture, we have about 20% of exposure in Seattle and 40% in Northern California and 40% in Southern California. And so when we look at the overall portfolio composition, we're actually pretty comfortable at where everything is sitting and our results have delivered, especially in Q1, the way we had anticipated. Now, there are pockets of softness. For example, I think you heard about Downtown Seattle and certain pockets in Downtown LA. And so, Downtown LA, for example, is about 2% of our portfolio. And so, in aggregate, it's not so meaningful that gives us pause. And as you can see by our Q1 results that it's -- we're generally trending well here.
Nick Yulico: Great. That's helpful. And then just a second question is I know you talked a little bit about the tracking ahead of same store revenue growth guidance right now. I guess in terms of what some of -- you could talk a little bit more about some of the offsets that could prevent the guidance raise in the second quarter. I don't know if it's the delinquent units coming back to market and how they get leased. And then, separately on the economic forecast, it sounds like the job losses are playing out better than expected year-to-date. In many cases, large tech has already come out with their announcements. So, maybe talk a little bit more about the decision to not change some of the economic forecasts as well. Thanks.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, it's Angela here again. Good question. And it's something we debated, because you -- as you know, in Q1, jobs did track better than what we expected. Having said that, I do think that visibility this year is just more limited than past years because it's -- because of Fed's position, right? And the next Fed meeting isn't until May 1. And so, we are anticipating a mild recession, and that is a factor, and that's nationwide, of course, it's not Essex. And you're right, with the tech layoffs, especially looking at the WARN notices, we have -- we saw that peaked in January and appears to be trending down, but it's just too early to really have clear visibility on where the economy is headed. And Barb will talk about guidance.
Barb Pak: Hi, Nick. Yeah, I would say on the guidance piece, delinquency, obviously, is something that's still a little bit uncertain to predict in terms of getting units back. As Jessica mentioned, LA, Alameda, just are coming out of their eviction moratoriums. And so, the timing on when we're going to get those units back is uncertain. And so that's a factor. And we also want to get a little further into the peak leasing season given the uncertainty that Angela just mentioned. And then, we'll do a full reforecast for the second quarter. But the first quarter was very strong for us, and we feel we feel pretty good going into second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks. I guess with respect to the stock repurchases, is there an internal limit sort of in the short term or long term, or just as long as you're able to sell assets and then buy back your stock at a reasonable discount, you'll just keep going?
Barb Pak: Hi. This is Barb. We're going to match fund, asset sales with stock repurchases, so we know what we're locking in in terms of value. We do have an internal NAV and we know where the value of our assets are. And so, we're going to be cognizant of it. We're going to be mindful of the balance sheet, liquidity, and maintain our strong balance sheet structure. And so, it's not we're just going to do it to do. We want to make sure that we're thoughtful about doing it. And what we did in the first quarter is we sold an asset that's non-core. It actually doesn't fit with our new operating model. We got a very attractive price for it. And then, we're able to take it and redeploy them buy back the stock and create a lot of value that way. So, we're going to be very thoughtful going forward.
Eric Wolfe: Right. And I guess, what I was trying to understand is just -- if you're able to sell $200 million, you're able to sell $300 million successfully, you'd be willing to repurchase $300 million? Or is there just sort of a certain point where from a G&A perspective and sticking other sort of considerations into account that it's just not as efficient for you to keep selling assets and buyback stock? And then, I guess to sort of add on to that question, for your internal NAV, are you using the cap rates that you see transact in your markets or sort of making adjustments about where it should be based on debt cost? Because I think the theory of that it's a pretty thin transaction market right now. So, the cap rates we're seeing may not be sort of reflective of where things would transact if they had to.
Barb Pak: Yeah. Our NAV is based off of -- Adam and I sit down and we talk about where transactions are happening and where we think we could sell our assets today, and based off of what is happening and negotiations that are going on behind the scenes. And so, we feel like we have a good pulse on the market. We have sold assets over the last several years and proven out the value for the portfolio. And so that is the process on the NAV side. And we're very comfortable transacting and selling and then buying back the stock.
Eric Wolfe: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Sakwa: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess maybe for Jessica, I was hoping you could speak a little bit to the blended rates that you talked about. I think in April you said maybe there were some impact from the eviction. So I'm just hoping to see if you could quantify that, because I think amongst all your peers, you might be the only one that showed a decline in April. So just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that and maybe what your expectations are for May and June.
Jessica Anderson: Hi, Steve. Yeah. The -- overall those numbers -- those blended numbers that we're looking at, those are net effective trade out numbers. And so, I think it's important to point out, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that through March, so they grew sequentially throughout the quarter. So April really reflected a point in time pricing strategy rather than underlying market fundamentals. And we've expected with the evictions, we're working through quite a few. And they do come to us in a steady stream, but we do anticipate that there might be some concentrations from time to time. And so that's what's really driven our occupancy-focused strategy. And you really saw that play out with our April occupancy number. We had floated down after seeing a concentration in March to 96.4%. But ultimately when we start -- when we think about as far as the market and how they're progressing through the seasonal ramp up and the strength there, we really look at our market rent, which is essentially the -- our gross recently achieved leases. And since the beginning of the year, we have seen our market rates grow sequentially through April in all of our markets. And so, those net effective trade outs and of course incorporate concessions and again really reflects a point in time. So, we saw really great activity in April and we were roughly one-week free as far as concessions go. And we've since pulled back to only a couple of days today on average. And breakdown by market, we're actually sitting at 97% in Seattle, 97% in Northern California and then 96.8% today. So, ultimately, we're pulling back on the concessions. There might be a little bit of a spillover into May, and we expect the trade out rates to reaccelerate from here and then also market rents to continue to grow.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. And then, I guess maybe as a follow-up, just to get a little more color on Seattle. I mean some of your peers had maybe a bit more weakness and spoke to the weakness specifically in Downtown Seattle. I know that you have probably more East side exposure. But just any thoughts around Seattle in particular? And does Amazon's kind of May 1st return to office policy have any influence or have you seen any influence from that? Or do you think people were sort of already back in the Seattle market? Or do you think there's a wave of people to come back to the market in the near term?
Jessica Anderson: I think, yes, overall for Seattle -- and we have a pretty conservative outlook for Seattle this year. And as I mentioned that I think it will be more challenging in the back half as we experience more supply. And we've been experiencing that really for the last six months. But interestingly, yes, in April, we did see quite a bit of movement from a leasing velocity perspective. So I do feel like that May 1st return to -- mandatory return to office three days a week for Amazon potentially had an impact for us. And as far as strength goes, I mean anytime you introduce leasing incentives or adjust your rates, how the market responds and the leasing velocity you're able to get is really telling. And so we weren't necessarily getting 97% in Seattle. So that really goes just to show that there is some underlying strength there. And so I think Amazon did play out. But again, we have a pretty conservative outlook and we're certainly seeing the impacts of demand with the diminishing of the hiring with Amazon and Microsoft. Last year having July, August 30,000 open positions that essentially disappeared in a matter of a month or two. And then, obviously, we have the supply factors. We have both things working [against us] (ph). But, we're encouraged and I think Seattle is on track with our expectations for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Sort of going back to the stock buyback conversation, I guess in sort of the sources and uses or match funding, any future repurchases, are you guys currently marketing any additional non-core assets today?
Adam Berry: Hey, Austin. This is Adam. Apologies. So at the moment, we are not actively marketing anything. We're always opportunistically looking at potential for disposing of assets that are either non-core or in non-core markets. And this is how [indiscernible] deal we sold last quarter, that's how that came about. But currently no, not marketing anything right now.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then just going back to guidance a little bit. I mean, you mentioned a couple components of driving the same store revenue outperformance in the first quarter. First, which is obviously a non-recurring item in the ERA payments. Have you received any additionally ERA payments in the second quarter? And then, second, with the dip in April, I guess how is April trending relative to plan? Is it offsetting some of the benefit you had in 1Q? Or is April occupancy and rents also trending ahead of plan? Thank you.
Barb Pak: Yeah. This is Barb. On the Emergency Rental Assistance payments, in April, we had a $100,000 in our same store portfolio, so nothing material. And that is disclosed in our supplemental. And then in terms of factors in the April guidance, the one thing I would say is that for delinquency, we did assume the first half of the year would be in the mid 2% range, 2.5%. And then the back half, we expect continues to trend down to close to 1.5% and 2% for the full year. So we're on plan with delinquency in April, and then occupancy at 96.4% is generally in line with plan as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I was hoping to shift gears to the expense side. Can you talk about just the key line items in expenses? There's been a lot of volatility for insurance for people and taxes. Just kind of what gives you conviction on your current outlook for the different expense lines? And where do you think maybe there might be some risk either the upside or downside of the growth rates?
Barb Pak: Yes, this is Barb again. So on the expense side, I think the biggest variability we're seeing is really maintenance and repairs, because we have more turnover, we had some more flood damage this quarter. So that's kind of one time we don't expect that to reoccur, but we do expect the turnover to be a reoccurring item given evictions. I would say, on the insurance, we've already done our insurance renewal for the year. So that line is pretty baked and we don't expect any surprises from here on out. It is up 20%, but that's going to be the number for the year. And then, on the tax side, we do have the benefit of Prop 13, and so -- which is 80% of our tax base. And so that is pretty well known. We'll know Seattle taxes here in the second quarter and then really have that drilled in. And so for us, the variability on expenses is mostly just tied to R&M. And then utilities, the one thing on utilities is it can be variable. We did -- we've put in place some gas hedges, which has helped us on the utility expense side. And so, it's kept at to a more moderate level, all else being equal.
Jamie Feldman: Okay, thanks, Barb. And then, Orange County seems to have come through this quarter pretty well across most portfolios, including yours. Can you just talk more about what's going in that submarket specifically?
Barb Pak: Yeah. As far as Orange County goes, it is -- it has performed well. For the last couple of years, we were seeing good trade out numbers, good leasing velocity. It's really stable as far as the supply outlook. There's nothing noteworthy there as well. So, overall, Orange County is pretty stable as a lot of our Southern California markets, San Diego is similar as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. Barb, can just elaborate a little bit more on the real estate taxes? You had the rare decline in taxes. And I think you mentioned last quarter you were budgeting 4.25% increase. And given real estate taxes are the largest components of OpEx and insurance came in pretty much where you expected, is there the likelihood of your expense guidance going down during the year?
Barb Pak: John. So, on the tax line, it really deals with the comp issue from the first quarter of last year. So, in Seattle, if you recall, we did have a favorable surprise last year where our real estate taxes went down 4%. We didn't know that until the second quarter. The first quarter of last year was our budget and what we assumed taxes would be. And so it was way too high. so we're comping off of a really easy comp, and that's why you see the negative 1.6 on the tax line. We -- like I said a few minutes ago, we'll know where Seattle taxes come in, in the second quarter when we pay the bills. And so, that's still TBD. We're still assuming 4.25% overall for the tax line for this year. It's really just a comp issue in the first quarter.
John Kim: Okay. I mean I saw last year's first quarter wasn't that high, that was like 3%. But anyway, my second question is on your mezz opportunities. It seems like with regional banks having issues that could be a part of the capital stack where you could see more opportunities at higher yields. And I'm wondering if that's the case and how you would stack that up versus buybacks.
Adam Berry: Hi, John. This is Adam. So over the last couple of months, we've seen, I would say, a slight uptick in possible opportunities come in the mezz and pref world. As you said, some of the lending sources out there have either tightened or disappeared entirely. It remains to be seen if this new wave that we're seeing will actually translate into deals. There are legacy development deals that have been out there a while. There are some new, actually existing deals that we're seeing as well. But again, this process takes a long time and several months. And so, we're assessing a number of new opportunities, but very too early to tell how many of them translate into actual deals. But we'll always -- we'll continue to look at potential options when we have liquidity, whether that's through dispositions or redemptions, what the best use of that capital is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Heffern: Yeah. Hi, everybody. Thanks. So the big tech layoffs have already been touched on, but I'm wondering what effect, if any, do you think the SVB failure and the associated impact on tech company funding they have on your residents. I know you typically talk about a relatively small exposure to big tech in the resident base, but I'm curious if you think that applies to start-ups as well.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Brad, it's Angela here. With the SVB failure that occurred recently, we did not see any impact to our portfolio. And so, looking forward, obviously, we don't know what can happen. But we do know that the parent has filed for bankruptcy. But its subsidiary, which SVB has -- the Fed stepped in and then it's been sold. And so we certainly don't expect further disruption from that. And just looking at some anecdotal information, looking at the 30-plus companies in our real estate technology ventures, there's no impact there either. So, as it relates to kind of a broad banking sector, it could -- it may play into more a broad economy conversation. And for those -- that's one of those reasons that we are forecasting a mild recession in our current expectations.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Barb, another one on the guide. The increase to the guide was smaller than the beat versus the first quarter midpoint guide. I know you mentioned that most things are outperforming, and then you had the repurchase as well, but it seems like there was some sort of offset for the rest of the year, second quarter to fourth quarter. So, can you talk about what that is?
Barb Pak: Yes. So, the vast majority of the beat in the first quarter was really tied to same-store revenue growth, and we didn't change our revenue outlook. And so that is not carried forward through in the guidance. So that was $0.07 of the $0.08 beat. The reason we changed our guidance was the stock repurchase, which will carry forward, that's $0.03. And then, we also have higher other income, mostly tied to better rates on our cash management platform and how we're managing our cash and our marketable securities. And then, it's partially offset by lower co-investment tied to preferred equity redemptions and the timing of those redemptions. So that's what was updated in the guidance. Same-store will be revisited here in the second quarter.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Kramer: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about -- look, I know we touched on kind of tech and SVB. Maybe asking the same question a little bit differently, which is just on kind of severance packages. I know some of the early layoffs last year, maybe some even -- later in the year, have longer severance packages, right, and so maybe you wouldn't kind of see that change in resident behavior right away. Wondering if maybe since some time has passed since then [indiscernible] many differences in resident behavior kind of given the severance packages that may be expiring now?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. It's Angela here. The severance packages can range up to three months. Having said that, given the bulk of the layoff announcements that occurred back in January and tenants behavior, they tend to make decisions, say, 45 days to 60 days in advance for major events. We -- what our expectation is that we've seen that play through our portfolio. We've digested it already. And once again, I kind of want to point to the job growth numbers as a good indicator. But the other good indicator is the initial unemployment claims in California and Washington. And today, they still remain below the 15-year average. So that's another good data point there.
Adam Kramer: That's great. That's all super helpful. Maybe a follow-up. I think you guys have done a really good job of kind of bringing us into your minds when it comes to kind of managing occupancy versus pushing rents I think both on this call and in prior calls. Maybe just kind of on a go-forward basis, walk us through kind of that trade-off, right? I know you mentioned concessions now lower than they were earlier in April. Walk us through maybe just kind of how you're thinking about that trade off now, given kind of the demand screen today, right, how you're thinking about kind of managing occupancy versus pushing rents?
Jessica Anderson: Hey, Adam, this is Jessica. Yes, so we're progressing through the peak leasing season. And of course, we're always going to be opportunistic with a focus on maximizing revenue. I think overall, with our outlook for the year, I think we'll probably spends the bulk of the year focused on occupancy based on -- we know we're going to continue to have to work through evictions. But also rent growth is moderating. And when you think about as far as rate growth, any time you're turning an apartment, you're experiencing the turn costs and the cost of vacancy. And so you really have to be getting some really strong trade out numbers to make it make sense to be focused on rate over occupancy. But certainly, we'll monitor the markets closely. And just like we pulled back concessions at the end of April and leaving us well positioned for the peak growth period that typically occurs in Q2, we certainly have opportunities again to maximize revenue overall.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning out there. So two questions. First, just going back to Silicon Valley. Let me ask the question this way. You guys mentioned that you anticipate the $100 million of debt and preferred equity being taken out this year and that the owners of properties have capital options in Fannie and Freddie. So, are you saying that what's going on in banking and where we see people, lenders pulling back from real estate loans, that's having no impact on your debt and preferred equity portfolio? Or is it just this $100 million that you're slated for being taken out is fine, but broader speaking, there are bank fallouts to the debt and preferred equity business?
Barb Pak: Hi, Alex, it's Barb. What I was speaking to is that there is still capital available in the multifamily space. I know in other sectors, it's just definitely pulled back, and I definitely think the banks have pulled back. But the government financing is still available. Life insurance companies are stepping in. And I think you're seeing other lenders step in. And in our preferred book, keep in mind the deals that we're getting taken out of, they were underwritten 2019, 2020, a long time ago when cap rates were in the mid 3.5%, and so we can get fully taken out. And so I think they're good situation for us. And we haven't seen any real issues within our own portfolio. It doesn't mean that it's not happening elsewhere. But in terms of distress in the whole market, we haven't seen that in a significant way on the West Coast.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is going back to supply. It sounded like the only market that was an issue is Seattle, and I'm assuming that's Seattle Downtown, not the suburbs. But in general, as you look at your portfolio into next year and the year after, do you see supply coming down everywhere, like Northern Cal is clearly that's been a pullback. But do you see any area where there's going to be a deluge of supply that's going to deliver next year? Or as you look across your portfolio, whatever this sort of is the peak and next year should be less supply across your markets?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Alex, it's Angela here. It's a good question. I'm trying to figure out looking ahead, what's happening here. In terms of our portfolio, just big picture starting this year compared to last year, overall supply is slightly down. But the vast majority, as you pointed out, is Northern California is down over 20%. And Southern California is up slightly about 14%, and the bulk of it is in the Downtown LA and then some of these other West LA, certain other markets. But overall, of course, that supply number is quite muted. As we look forward to 2022 -- 2024, what we're seeing preliminarily [indiscernible] landscape. And so not a huge drop-off, but similar level. But keep in mind, we're already operating at a pretty darn down low level, right? I mean total supply as a percent of total stock is only 60 basis points. And so, we do foresee that to continue especially given the environment of much more challenging labor force available and higher construction costs. And lastly, rents in the northern region haven't moved significantly past pre-COVID. So, Northern California is still slightly below pre-COVID level. And so, it didn't surprise us that Southern California supply picked up slightly this year. And I think you kind of see that throughout the country where you have significant rent growth that's where supply will occur. So that's the big picture of our overall this year and next year, similar levels and it's going [indiscernible] in our markets.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. So, just to clarify, Seattle, it is just Downtown Seattle, that's the issue, right?
Angela Kleiman: Seattle overall is slightly down, but Downtown is up.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay.
Angela Kleiman: So, yes.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Going back to the share buybacks, do you have a number of assets or a dollar number in terms of non-core that you would sell? And if you were to get offers on core assets at those 4% to high 4% cap rates, would you opportunistically sell those to buy back stock accretively?
Adam Berry: So, on the first -- hi, Anthony, this is Adam. The first part of your question, do we have a list of non-core assets, the answer is yes. And we're constantly having discussions and going through those to see where they could potentially sell and what we could do with the proceeds. As to the amount with which we can buy stock back, there are challenges always with dispositions. There's always the different ramifications of tax gains, Prop 13. So all of those are taken into account when we assess what we can do with those proceeds. There's also another tool in the shed is to use 1031 exchanges to exchange out of non-core assets into markets that we think will overall affect the portfolio in a positive way.
Anthony Powell: Okay, thanks. And maybe more broadly, it sounds like you're a bit more optimistic on kind of the West Coast markets recovering this year despite the layoff activity. Does this make you -- does it just reinforce your view on the West Coast has the best use of capital, the best place to invest? Or would you still consider maybe diversifying into the East Coast or Sunbelt as we've talked before about in prior calls?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, hi. It's Angela here. On the diversification question or expanding outside of West Coast, it is something that we have been disciplined about evaluating. And so that -- just that basic discipline has not changed. We're going to continue to monitor those markets and look for opportunities. But back to your original point, I think you hit the nail on the head, especially as it relates to Northern California, a couple of things going for our markets where we have the lowest supply deliveries and especially Northern California supply is down 22%. We're just starting to rebound in terms of job growth, getting jobs -- numbers getting back to pre-COVID levels and market rents still below with gradual improvements. We're in the best affordability position from a rent-to-income perspective in the northern region, below long-term average. And so that would point to all the best growth prospects. On the just broad picture on the migration front, and we all experienced meaningful net migration during COVID, while the migration landscape has been improving gradually as well. And so, you put together all those pieces [indiscernible] point to that where we want to deploy our dollar, where we see the most upside ahead of us, it's in the West Coast.
Anthony Powell: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I just want to get your view on maybe starting developments with the hopes of delivering into our better part of the cycle.
Adam Berry: Hi, Wes. This is Adam. It's -- the development landscape today is challenging for a number of reasons. Angela has pointed to a few of them. With a challenging labor market, construction costs have remained elevated. And so when solving for a, call it, 20% premium over where market cap rates are, it just -- it basically will lead to a lower land price than landowners are willing to go. So, sure, we would love to be delivering into a lesser supply market, but right now, it's just the development deals just don't cancel.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And can you remind us, don't you have a few covered land place? Or did you get rid of those?
Adam Berry: We do, yes. And those are still generating active revenue. And now with some, we're pursuing entitlements in the meantime, so parallel processing and others have just longer-term lease commitments.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then could you talk about maybe the demand from people that currently have H1B visa? Do you view it as maybe a potential positive with more people getting visa or with tech layoffs, maybe you might lose a few people?
Angela Kleiman: We actually see the international part to be a tailwind for us, because it's just starting. And so I think it's no surprise that historically, California has a net out-migration if you only look at domestic numbers. In fact, 17 out of the last 20 years, it's net out-migration domestically. And even during those periods, we had meaningful rent growth acceleration. So the international component is what drives migration to become positive for California. And that virtually disappeared. I mean it was zero during COVID. And so that is just starting to come back. And so we are hopeful that will be additive to the demographics piece.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is about migration. How is demand from customers -- how has demand been from customers currently living outside Essex's market? And how does that compare with normal? And then also the other side, have you seen increased or decreased move-outs to non-Essex markets?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. Compared to the migration from outside of Essex markets, we are generally -- just domestically speaking, of course, we're generally back to pre-COVID levels. And so that's a good thing. And with -- of course, with the international, we do see that's where the tailwind is. As far as the out-migration piece, when we look at the migration numbers, we look at it on a net basis. And so we're continuing to see gradual improvements.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. And my follow-up, we talked a lot about tech layoffs, but have you seen any specific changes in the reasons for move out?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. We really haven't. I mean, we've track, of course, the usual move-outs to purchase a home that's below the long-term average, move out for jobs, new jobs or transfers or loss on that one bucket. And in totality, it's generally in line with historical norms. And so what I think is happening is what we're seeing, which is that the job losses are being quickly absorbed and benefited by that gradual in-migration on a net basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Chandni Luthra, your line is live.
Chandni Luthra: Sorry, I was on mute, sorry about that. Could you give us any thoughts around the RealPage issue? Any changes you are making to your operating platform considering those dynamics? And then how are you thinking about the rolled-up class action suit?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Chandni, it's Angela here. We actually have been reducing our usage of RealPage as we develop our new revenue management system over the past several years. And so, we started as well before the RealPage lawsuit for the reasons that Jessica mentioned earlier. So, we believe that their claim is without any merit, and we're very confident about our defense prospects.
Chandni Luthra: Great. And as a follow-up, and sorry if I missed this, but what was gross delinquency in the first quarter? I believe net was 2.1%. And then as we sort of think about delinquencies improving faster than expected with eviction moratorium going away and the process becoming easier, could there be upside to that 2% growth delinquency numbers that you laid out earlier?
Barb Pak: Hi, Chandni, it's Barb. So in the first quarter, gross delinquencies were 2.5% versus the reported number of 2.1%, so 40 basis point improvement tied to Emergency Rental Assistance. And then for the outlook for the year, the 2%, we're still holding to it. I think LA and Alameda just come off. It's really going to depend on how quickly the court move on these evictions. It's taking six-plus months right now. And so that really is going to depend how quickly either people go through the whole eviction process or whether they just skip. And that's a little unknown at this point. I think in the next few months, we'll have a better visibility on that.
Chandni Luthra: Great. Thank you for the detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up question to that bad debt topic. Barb, just one question on the longer-term bad debt profile of your markets. Based off the current trajectory of gross delinquencies and just the payment behavior that you're seeing among tenants, do you think when the dust settles, bad debt actually settles out at a structurally higher level versus pre-pandemic behavior? And if not, when is your best guess on when bad debt does get back to pre-pandemic levels?
Barb Pak: Yes, John, it's a great question, something we talk about internally a lot. We historically have been at 35 basis points pre-COVID. We believe we will ultimately get back there because there won't be any loss to protect tenants like there was during COVID, which allow tenants to have this behavior. And so now that we're coming out of all of the moratoriums, I think the City of Oakland is the only one that really remains, we think we will get back there. But it's going to take until into 2024 to get there. And it won't be -- for the full year of 2024, it's going to take into that year because of the eviction process and how long it's taking. But structurally, we don't believe that there will be a fundamental shift in delinquency and our long-term trends will go up because of COVID.
John Pawlowski: Okay. In your unregulated submarkets within the portfolio, has bad debt reverted fully back to pre-COVID levels?
Barb Pak: I don't think we -- no, I don't think we've gone back fully to pre-COVID levels in our other markets. As Jessica said, in the call or in our prepared comments that we've gotten over 60% of our long-term delinquent residents out over the past or since the start of 2022. So, we're making good progress, but we're not fully back to where we should be at this point.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then last question for me is more of a regional question for Angela or Jessica. If you start the clock today, which region do you think would generate the highest and lowest revenue growth for the next two or three years, Seattle, Northern California or Southern California?
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. I'll start, and Jessica, welcome to add. In terms of the upside or the most revenue growth, we definitely see Northern California being in the top of that list followed by Seattle and then Southern California. And both for -- with Northern California because of, as I said earlier, the job growth is just getting back to pre-COVID levels, market rents are still below pre-COVID, but it has been gradually improving. It has the lowest level of supply deliveries relative to our other portfolio and the best affordability position. And so that -- for those reasons, it's ranked number one. And Seattle for similar reasons, but it does have a higher supply, and then it's more volatile or more seasonal. And so -- which means that -- so with Southern California coming in last, not because we don't like it, it's just because it's just done so well. I mean it's 15%, in some cases, 20%, 30% rent growth above pre-COVID. And we're starting to see some supply pressure, which -- it's still in check relative to the rest -- the U.S., but relative to our markets, it's starting to creep up. And so that's the order of the ranking. Jessica?
Jessica Anderson: No, nothing to add.
John Pawlowski: Agreed.
Angela Kleiman: Okay. Good. Glad you agree.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Barry Lou: Hey, it's Barry Lou on the line for Haendel St. Juste. I just want to have a quick follow-up on the regulatory question. So, I was wondering if you could provide any color on the $8.5 million in legal settlements added back to your core FFO. Wondering if that's from one big settlement? And if there's any piece of that, that will trickle into future quarters? Thank you.
Barb Pak: This is Barb. It was primarily related to a legal settlement for construction defect at one of our properties, and there's no carry-forward on that. That was just a one-time item that occurred in the first quarter. It was paid in cash. So that's done.
Barry Lou: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes, thanks for the time, everyone. I just wanted to touch base on the new revenue management software you rolled out at the start of the year. Just curious to kind of hear your experience as you're using that now, and how it's trending versus your expectations, and just -- maybe just the capabilities versus your old software?
Jessica Anderson: Hi. This is Jessica. Yes, things are going very well. We're very pleased with the platform thus far, and we have a long development pipeline for that revenue management system. So, all is going well. I mean a couple of benefits to point out that we're looking at is in alignment and allows us to price at a portfolio level with our property collections model versus the commercially available systems you're often pricing at the property level. And then second, we also see, as far as long-term development, the ability to optimize our amenities. So when you look at like our average rent, it's $2,600 and good $200 of that is actually fixed amenity values. And again, with your commercially available systems, that portion of the rent is not optimized. And so if you look at that on an annual basis, what that is for us is over $100 million that's not optimized. So that's one opportunity we also see moving forward with the system. So there's a few value-add opportunities to give you a couple of examples.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Thanks, Jessica. Maybe just one follow-up on that. What exactly do you mean by like price of the portfolio level? And like what's the benefit to having it done that way?
Jessica Anderson: Well, when you're looking at, we have a high geographic concentration. And so when you're pricing properties individually, sometimes you can be kind of cannibalizing yourself based on the occupancy position at a property. And so, when you're looking at an entire portfolio collectively one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, ultimately, you can maximize revenue through a more stable approach to rents and the balance with occupancy.
Joshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that. Thanks, Jessica.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the job market. To the extent that job growth has fully recovered to pre-COVID, WARN notices are below average, and that laid off people are finding jobs quickly again, do you have a sense of what industries people are getting hired to?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. In our markets, well, in the northern regions is, of course, more tech centric. But in the Southern California, it's more service driven, leisure and hospitality. It's much more diversified and mirrors that of the U.S. broad economy with more professional services and, of course, higher income levels.
Linda Tsai: Are the -- is the tech hiring from the ones that are also laying off, or is it more diversified?
Angela Kleiman: It's more diversified.
Linda Tsai: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-08 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time.A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will touch briefly on our full year results, expectations for 2023 and why we believe that our West Coast rental markets are positioned to outperform over the next several years. I will conclude with comments on the transaction market and the upcoming CEO transition. Overall, 2022 was a positive year for Essex as we generated full year core FFO per share growth of 16.2%, our highest year-over-year increase in a decade and 9.3% above pre-COVID levels. We attribute these strong results to relentless execution by the Essex team, improved efficiencies from the implementation of our property collections model and the strong recovery in our West Coast markets for the better part of the year. Our positive results were achieved despite the challenges associated with COVID-19 regulations in our markets. Our near-term results will remain impacted by elevated delinquency, which we estimate will represent a $0.60 per share drag on FFO in 2023 compared to our pre-COVID levels of delinquency. Notwithstanding the impact of delinquency in 2023, we believe we are entering the final phase of these challenges and that our COVID-related headwinds will be behind us in 2024. For 2023, we reaffirm our 2% market rent growth expectation across the Essex markets as shown on Page S-17 of the supplemental package, which is predicated on consensus assumptions for a slowdown in the U.S. economy driven by higher interest rates. Macroeconomic visibility is limited by a variety of factors, which translates into a wider-than-normal range of potential outcomes this year. Recent economic data highlights continued resiliency in the labor market with solid reports for job growth and unemployment claims even with elevated layoff announcements. In Essex markets, preliminary job growth for December was 3.8%, and the recent unemployment rate was only 3.2%, both outperforming national averages. Looking ahead, layoff announcements and lower job openings among large tech companies signal a softer employment outlook for 2023, which we incorporated into our forecast assumptions shown on Page S-17. Our primary challenge since early 2020 relates to the massive layoffs that occurred as a direct result of the government's response to the pandemic, which eliminated nearly 3 million jobs in California alone and force people out of densely populated areas in search of work. It has taken over two years to recover those jobs lost during the pandemic, and I'm pleased to say that the Essex markets have now fully recovered those losses. It is notable that each of the eight major metros in the Essex portfolio have now recovered from 98.8% to 100.9% of the jobs lost in the early part of the pandemic, leading us to believe that most of the slack in the housing supply-demand relationship from the pandemic no longer exists. We believe that this is a major milestone which should lead us back to our pre-pandemic growth profile once the economy stabilizes. As with past economic slowdowns, a frequent concern involves the tech companies that dominate Northern California and Seattle with nearly daily reminders of tech layoffs amplified in the newspapers. The tech sector is often volatile yet over longer periods, the industry has reliably generated top paying jobs and wealth creation that are at the foundation of a strong rental growth. A core strength of the tech industries is their ability to evolve in a cyclical process of reinvention, where the groundwork for new rounds of innovation are laid while the prior cycle is slowing. I am confident that this is what is occurring today. Going back to the 1980s, Big Tech was focused on IBM PCs and R&D efforts to improve semiconductor manufacturing, and that phase ended with the recession in the early 1990s. Growth of the Internet and e-commerce soon emerged and then later boomed and busted capping the dot-com era from which many believe tech would never recover. Instead, a wave of social and mobile products emerged 20 years ago, including Facebook, YouTube and the iPad and iPhone, setting up a much larger and more profitable era of growth. Then following the Great Recession, cloud computing and machine learning added to the next period of rapid growth, both for new start-ups and for sector leaders like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And now despite a very similar set of concerns, many of you will have followed the explosive recent adoption of new AI products such as ChatGPT and DALL·E.Consistent with the transformative technologies of the past, the innovators and investors in artificial intelligence are overwhelmingly concentrated in our markets including OpenAI in San Francisco and Google Brain in Mountain View. And despite a broad BC slowdown last year, funding for AI increased 70% and is now poised to grow vastly more in 2023. In a recent search of the leaving 100 start-ups in artificial intelligence, we found that more are headquartered in the Bay Area than in the entire rest of the United States. Thus, it is a combination of entrepreneurial spirit, financial capital and technical talent down on the West Coast as well as housing supply constraints that drives our expectation for the West Coast to generate superior rent growth over the long term. Turning to the apartment investment markets. We continue to see muted deal volume in our West Coast markets as buyers and sellers seek to compromise on their expectations for property values and yields. A relatively small number of apartment sales indicate that property values and cap rates have not changed materially since last quarter, and cap rates generally are in the mid- to high 4% range for high-quality suburban apartments. At this point, we've seen pockets of distress mostly focused on owners subject to variable rate debt and maturing short-term loans. It's possible that an extended period of elevated interest rates and slower rent growth could create new opportunities to generate FFO and NAV per share. We sold 1 property in the fourth quarter, and we are working on other potential sales. In conclusion, assuming my math is correct, this is my 115th consecutive conference call on behalf of Essex, which will be my last given my pending retirement as CEO at the end of March. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of the highly skilled, disciplined and focused leadership team for this great company. I'm taking a step back with full confidence in Angela's ability to lead the Company along with her determined and like-minded team. Thank you all. Finally, I have enjoyed working with so many of you in the investment community, and I thank you for your trust and support over many years. I remain confident that many great years for the Company are on the horizon. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, Mike. The evolution of Essex under your 37-year leadership has been remarkable. I and the senior team are grateful for your mentorship and we'll continue to diligently serve this company as we move forward. My comments today will start with brief operational highlights of our fourth quarter performance followed by our current operating strategy and updates on key operational initiatives. Essex had a productive 2022, which included optimizing the strong leasing momentum heading into our peak leasing season, addressing delinquency and recapturing units from non-paying tenants while transforming our operating business model. These accomplishments are the results of the exceptionally hardworking operations and support teams thoughtfully executing our business strategy amidst highly dynamic market conditions. Great job, team. Moving on to the fourth quarter. We shifted to an occupancy-focused strategy in late September in anticipation of softening demand and elevated move-outs related to eviction activity. The confluence of these factors created a challenging operating environment in the final months of 2022. Our switch to favoring occupancy helped us moderate the seasonal weakness and the elevated turnover caused by higher evictions. Excluding L.A. and Alameda Counties, I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress recapturing approximately 50% of delinquent units compared to one year ago. In addition, as we start the new year, demand fundamentals have improved in line with our expectations. Our net effective new lease rates troughed at the end of November, and we have been able to reduce concessions while gradually increasing new lease rates from December to January on a sequential basis. In the near term, we will maintain our occupancy-focused strategy as we continue to make progress on eviction-related turnover. Our portfolio sits at a healthy 96.4% financial occupancy today, and we are well positioned to increase rents if demand exceeds our expectations. Turning to key operations initiatives. We continue to make progress with our property collections operating model. Phase 1 is now complete, which centralized administrative and leasing functions, which combine nearby properties into onecentrally managed business unit. The efficiency benefit can be seen in our financial results with administrative expense growth of only 0.7% last year. And for 2023, we anticipate only a 3% increase despite inflationary pressures. Phase 2 expands the same operating principles to the maintenance function.We expect numerous benefits, including savings from reduction in third-party vendor contracts in unit churn efficiencies. The maintenance collections pilot is progressing well and is expected to conclude midyear. At that point, we will provide additional details on the rollout. Lastly, on the technology front, we continue to make excellent progress, most recently with the launch of our proprietary revenue management software. We have been developing this capability over the past two years and are excited for a platform with an integrated pricing and operating strategy tailored for the nuances in our markets. This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will focus on our 2023 guidance, followed by comments on investments and the balance sheet. Our 2023 guidance assumes same-property revenue growth of 4% at the midpoint on a cash basis. Overall, we expect healthy top line growth and stable occupancy to be partially offset by 70 basis points of higher delinquency. The reason we believe delinquency will be higher than 2022 is due to uncertainty around the timing of evictions in all of our markets. In addition, we do not expect to receive much in the way of Emergency Rental Assistance as compared to $34 million we received last year on a same-store basis. As it relates to operating expenses, we are forecasting a 5% increase at the midpoint, which is above our historical run rate. There are a couple of reasons for the higher-than-expected increase. First, controllable expenses are forecasted to increase 4%, which is driven by wage inflation and elevated eviction-related costs, partially offset by savings we achieved via the rollout of our property collections model last year. Second, we are experiencing elevated cost pressures within utilities and insurance. In total, we expect same-property NOI growth of [3.6%] at the midpoint. In terms of core FFO, our midpoint assumes 1.6% growth. The primary reasons for the modest increase include higher interest expense and delinquency and lower structured finance income, which are outlined on Page 6 of the earnings release.In total, these items equate to a $0.57 per share headwind, representing nearly a 4% reduction to growth on a year-over-year basis. Turning to investments. Given the challenging investment environment and our elevated cost of capital, we have not provided specific estimates for new acquisitions as it is difficult to generate accretion today given the significant disconnect between public and private market pricing. Given this disconnect, the best way to create value today is through asset sales and share buybacks or via preferred equity investments all of which we completed in 2022. It should be noted that we have a long track record of finding ways to create NAV and FFO per share in all environments, and we will maintain that discipline going forward, while at the same time, match funding our investments on a leverage-neutral basis. As it relates to the structured finance portfolio, during the quarter, we completed a comprehensive review of our investments performing a wide range of sensitivity analysis on a variety of key metrics. The analysis confirmed the portfolio is performing as expected with the exception of two investments, both located within the Oakland submarket. One of the investments was redeemed in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $2 million impairment. For the other investment, we took a conservative approach given the uncertainty around fundamentals in Oakland due to high apartment deliveries, which is leading to an elevated concessionary environment. As a result, we stopped accruing on this investment during the fourth quarter, resulting in a $0.06 reduction to our 2023 guidance. Overall, we have a long successful track record of investing in structured finance investments. Over the past 12 years, we have invested approximately $690 million in structured finance investments that have been fully redeemed, achieving a 13% average annual return for our shareholders. Lastly, on to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement in our credit metrics with net debt-to-EBITDA returning to pre-COVID levels at a healthy 5.6x, with no debt maturing on our consolidated balance sheet until 2024, limited development funding needs and ample liquidity, our balance sheet remains in a strong position. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: First of all, congratulations again, Mike and Angela. Mike, I appreciate the comments on kind of the tech cycle and future thoughts there. But what gives you the comfort that the benefit for any recovery or the eventual recovery, I guess, in tech will accrue mostly to the West Coast markets like we've seen in the past versus maybe some of the more newer tech markets or Sun Belt markets given population and job growth trends that we've seen there?
Michael Schall: Well, thank you for the congratulations. I appreciate it. I think tech is just growing in terms of its share of the overall employment base. So we expect tech to grow throughout the United States and certainly wouldn't exclude the Sun Belt. But I think that as with the past, most of the cutting-edge technology and the people that are really driving innovation will be located as they have been in the past here on the West Coast. So that gives us a great deal of comfort. And I went through that relatively long description of my career here and what tech has done really because of that because we've seen it reinvent itself so many times over and over again. And I would have a hard time believing that, that is anywhere close to being at an end. And -- and finally, I guess I would add that the prospects and the importance of AI to almost any -- every application from businesses to consumers, et cetera. is pretty extraordinary. So I think this is going to continue onward. And I think that we'll be right in the center of that innovation here on the West Coast.
Nick Joseph: Yes. AI innovation is pretty exciting. And then just on the structured finance program, I guess two questions. Just number one, for the asset in Oakland that you're not accruing income. Can you walk through how that potentially could play out going forward in terms of your role there? And then it sounds like you're in an analysis across everything and everything -- all the other are performing as expected. But are there any on the watch list or potentially maybe could become issues?
Barb Pak: Hi, Nick.It's Barb. Yes, we did a comprehensive review. And on the rest of the portfolio, we don't have any other assets that are on the watch list. Keep in mind, we leaned-in heavily in 2020 and prior when cap rates were higher, NOI has grown significantly since we started this portfolio. And so none of the other properties screened high on the capital stack. The one in Oakland is really a function of the high concessionary environment right now. Net effective rents are lower, NOI is lower than how we underwrote it. And so we're higher in the stack than what we'd like to be. So that's why we took a conservative approach to stop accruing. We have constant dialogue with the sponsor and they're very engaged in our participating rating checks as needed. And so we don't see any other fall out at this time from that asset.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: Thank you. And add my well wishes and congrats to you, Mike, as well. First question is I think last quarter and at NAREIT, you talked about a week of free rent, I think, in Seattle, in a couple of weeks in San Francisco. And just wondering where those numbers sit today? And whether or not you feel like you've seen the effect of all the layoffs that have really been announced since the fall?
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. On the concessions, we have seen it essentially taper off throughout the portfolio since December, which is basically I've mentioned earlier that our portfolio trough late November and it significantly improved as an overall average in the fourth quarter, particularly in December. We were running about two weeks concessions. And right now, it's a portfolio average, we're running less than a week. So that gives you an indication of directionally how things have improved pretty quickly.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one follow-up for Barb. You gave us the bad debt, like the per share drag and the 70 basis points on growth. But if I look at the fourth quarter, it was 1.1%, I think,is there a way to express it in those terms in terms of where your expectations are for 2023?
Barb Pak: Yes, Tony. For 2023, we're expecting bad debt as a percent of schedule rent to be 2%. Now keep in mind, we don't expect any Emergency Rental Assistance in 2023 as compared to the $34 million we received on a same-store basis in 2022. And so that's why the net number is going to increase. We were at 1.3% in 2022, and it's going to 2%. Now the underlying gross delinquency is improving because we are able to evict. It's just taking longer than we had initially expected, but we are making progress on that front, as Angela mentioned in her script.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird.
Wesley Golladay: Good morning, everyone, and congrats again, Mike. I'm curious how the supply pressure changed throughout the year? And at what point did you start to push rate?
Michael Schall: Wes, thank you for the congrats. I appreciate that. In terms of supply pressure, there are pots of supply in a few places. We noted Oakland earlier, I think there are multiple lease-ups in Oakland, which are really having the effect of pushing down price. Seattle has more supply deliveries this year and especially the fourth quarter because it's generally a seasonally weak period, and Seattle tends to be weaker than the California markets, primarily because demand goes to zero in the fourth quarter or close to zero, and Seattle has more supply of apartments. But going forward, the supply picture looks like it's declining. And this is a result of obviously lack of rent growth for the last few years. So the ability to produce housing at an accretive level is pretty challenged, and we see that in our preferred equity book as well. And so I think it's going to be -- we're going to be in a period where there's relatively not a lot of supply. And if we get any demand, we'll be in good shape.
Wesley Golladay: Got it. And then just curious, what happened to all these people that are evicted, if you have a new tenant coming in, say, in June, will you know if they were a nonpayer if they're a prior apartment? Or is just everyone going to swap non-paying tenants?
Angela Kleiman: Well, on the tenants renting front, we have a pretty robust process there. Having said that, we, of course, will do credit checks and that will let us know if they are not -- or they have any prior debt that needs to be paid. And so that's our best indicator on that front.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. So that would be a relatively timely event. I guess there's like the ties that are not paying -- it's already in the books for you as a delinquent tenant?
Angela Kleiman: Right, right. And in fact, even for us, for tenants who have left, we have -- we immediately have updated the credit report as well on our end. And there is, of course, ongoing report on ongoing debt. So there are various resources that we can use and we have used.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: I wanted to revisit the delinquency. I think last quarter, you referenced L.A. County was, I believe, 40% of the overall delinquency. What is that figure today? And then I'm curious on the $0.60 per share, what is the annualized run rate that you'll be running at or that you're assuming by the fourth quarter of 2023?
Angela Kleiman: I'll just touch on the delinquency population.It’s Angela here. In the past, L.A. is about 40%, and it's ticked up to about 50% L.A. delinquency, and that doesn't surprise us given the eviction moratorium has not been lifted. We had expected L.A. to continue to accrue under the delinquency basis. However, the good news is that the new tenants coming in, we're not seeing those tenants [indiscernible] prior tenants.
Barb Pak: And then Austin, this is Barb. On the $0.60 that Mike referred to, that is compared to our pre-COVID historical run rate for not only the revenue piece, but also the expense piece because we have elevated eviction and turnover costs associated with the delinquency. And so it's both pieces. What we are expecting in the back half of the year is our delinquency.Our gross delinquency will be around 1.5% for the second half of the year, 2% for the full year. So we do expect to make progress, but given the timing on these evictions is very difficult to predict at this point. We don't expect to be to our normalized run rate by the end of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's fair. Just trying to understand what sort of the earnings power going into 2024 is, but we'll haveto revisit that later this year. Second question, you referenced your shift to favouring occupancy late last year. And you highlighted some month-over-month improvement from December to January. I guess what would it take for you guys to pivot towards going back to pushing rate? And would that mean that the 5.5% renewal rate growth that you are at in January could stabilize or even reaccelerate from here or would the benefit accret more towards new lease rates?
Angela Kleiman: That's a good question. In terms of the occupancy strategy, and when we would shift, it's going to be a little bit different in each of the markets. So for example, we actually are seeing great strength in our Southern California portfolio. However, we are running a little bit higher occupancy in anticipation of the eviction and the opportunities to vacate non-paying units that's coming our way. So we're building that not because we're seeing a market softness issue, it's more of a strategic play to ensure that we are well positioned. And so for example, in places like Seattle, which is, as we noted, highly seasonal, when we see demand come back as it typically does during peak leasing season. We would expect that we should be able to switch back to favoring rent growth, especially now that we've been able to reduce our concessions in a meaningful way.
Austin Wurschmidt: And is it safe to assume that Northern California has a similar setup as Seattle in terms of some seasonality, maybe and the opportunity being to be able to push a little bit harder as we come out of the seasonal low, if you will?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that makes sense. And the one caveat is, of course, the supply conversation that we talked earlier, right? So for example, places like Oakland that will continue to probably take a little bit longer, because of the supply. But in areas where we are not trying to manage through pockets of supply, there are some good opportunities there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.
SteveSakwa: Mike, offer my congratulations as well to you and to Angela on the transition. I guess the question, when you think about the cadence and timing of revenue growth, can you maybe just talk about how you think that progresses throughout the year and maybe what the first half looks like versus the second half? I realize there are some shifts in the delinquency numbers that Barb just spoke about. But when you kind of look at that sort of midpoint, say, 4% on a CAC basis, how heavy is that in the first half? And I guess, how light is that in the second half?
Barb Pak: Yes, Steve, it's Barb. I would say the first half we expect to be higher than the second half. We're about 5% in the first half. The first quarter will probably be north of that, and then it will trend down throughout the year with 3% on average in the second half of the year. And that's really a function of the year-over-year comps because last year, while rents accelerated, it didn't fully hit our revenue growth line.And so, we expect to capture that this year. First half will be higher than the second half.
SteveSakwa: Okay. And you talked a lot about -- well, I guess, let me just say on occupancy for kind of the second question. But when you think about some of the potential soft points that Mike talked about in tech, I guess how are you thinking about maybe some of the potential occupancy loss in either Seattle or San Francisco or what have you baked in, I guess, specifically for the Bay Area and Seattle from an occupancy perspective?
Angela Kleiman: So from an occupancy perspective, we're not running at a whole lot different than prior periods. The one caveat is really more focused on Southern California particularly L.A. because we're anticipating some vacancies there from eviction. So for example, we saw the similar headwind in Northern California in the fourth quarter, and we anticipated that. So we employ the same strategy. So it's really more focused on some of these unique situation as we come out of COVID related legislation really to position us for better growth.
Barb Pak: And Mike, do you want to talk about employment?
Michael Schall: Yes. Let me just add one more quick thing. Steve, a big question here is what is going to happen to the pace of employment. As I noted in the prepared remarks, job growth has been really strong. However, maybe some of the layoffs or the warm notices haven't actually showed up in job growth yet. So our expectation for the year -- just to remind everyone, on S-17 was for minus 2% -- 0.2% job growth for the U.S. And so, we're going to be watching job growth over the next several months. But it seems like we are running stronger than we expected, certainly with respect to January's job growth number. And if that continues, then you get to a point where maybe our U.S. job growth estimate on S-17 is too conservative. So we'll watch that closely.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning out there and just joining in. Mike, congratulations on your tenure,on your last earnings call; and Angela, best on taking the helm next quarter. So two questions. First, maybe just sticking with that job rebound, Mike, you had mentioned early on in COVID when everything in California was shut down, a lot of the service industries, those jobs literally had a fleet because they were closed down. They could work whereas a lot of tech people could work from home. As you talked about that really strong job rebound in December in the benefit, California has recovered all of its jobs. How would you rate -- when we see these headlines of the layoffs versus it sounds like there is pretty good job growth. Is it more of the job growth coming from the service jobs and maybe that's what you're seeing more demand in your apartments? Or as you look at your resident mix profile, you're like, look, our resident mix profile today is really no different than it was back in 2019.
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex. I think things are normalizing from the pandemic period. And -- but I would say, yes, we are recovering leisure, hospitality and other service jobs at a very high rate, and that continues onward. And -- but it appears to be normalizing. But also the tech job growth during the pandemic was incredibly strong. And we think that some of the more recent tech announcements are just sort of giving back a small portion of the job gains that occurred during the pandemic. So we don't even considered tech to be all that weak at this point in time. I think it's just transitioning from what it was and taking the next step or the next chapter of things. So overall, we think jobs are on the right track. Again, our S-17 was based on the consensus estimates of all the big economists in the U.S. and it's possible, and it almost seems like whatever weakness we might have is be a pushback because we're stronger earlier, which would probably be a net benefit for this year if that continues. And so we'll be paying close attention to that. And I want to maybe go into the -- two more things actually. One is the warn notices, and we had our data analytics team do an analysis of the major, the largest layoffs announced and what portion of them are in California and Washington versus the total. So this is Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Cisco. They globally have 1.6 million employees and the layoff rate is about 4% or 64,000 announced layoffs. In the California, Washington market, the employees of those companies in these markets are about 335,000 people, and there's about 10,000 layoffs. So the percentage of layoff is lower actually in California and Washington as compared to the broader enterprise. So I think that is important. And finally, it's interesting, the unemployment rates are so low. San Francisco, 2.2%, in San Jose, 2.4% and everyone under the U.S. average, except for Los Angeles, which is at 4.5%, no doubt that's because people are drawing benefits and able to stay in our apartment subject to the eviction moratorium.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is just getting back to the delinquencies, I think you guys have highlighted obviously L.A. and Oakland. Is that the bulk of what's driving delinquencies this year? And then as a consequence, especially in L.A. with the good cause of eviction, should we assume that you guys will look to pair your exposure to L.A. County?
Michael Schall: Yes, let me talk about that and Angela or someone else may have a comment. But the two really difficult eviction moratoria are in Alameda County, which is Oakland and L.A., L.A. City expired. However, L.A. County extended to March 31. Actually, L.A. City was a really horrible ordinance. L.A. County is not nearly as restrictive. For example, it only applies to 80% median income tenants, for example. And so there's a little bit of relief in L.A. And in terms of exiting L.A., I think that, that is -- it depends. I mean, we will exit -- enter and exit markets as we deem necessary using a much broader set of criteria for supply-demand analysis, rent growth expectations, cap rates, et cetera. And so that will drive that discussion as well as jobs and some of these other issues.
Barb Pak: Yes, Alex, on the delinquent unit front, L.A. and Alameda are the bulk of our delinquent units over 60% our delinquent units long term greater than three months or in LA Alameda. And so that's a factor as well as the slowdown in the court, courts are really bogged down. It's taking longer to vice in our other markets, and that is a factor as well in the '23 guidance to recapture those units.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Heffern: Mike, last quarter, you said that the 2% rent growth forecast seemed pretty dire at the time, and it was more based on what the Fed was doing and projections from economists and what you're actually seeing on the ground. I know you reiterated the 2%, but your commentary around employment seems to suggest that you still think it's a somewhat pessimistic outlook. Am I interpreting that right?
Michael Schall: I think Angela and Barb will kick me if I do anything that I say anything that's inconsistent with our published position. I mean the reality is, I don't know. And in the comments I referred to a range of outcomes that's broader than historically we've been able to triangulate in the past for most of the past, the relationship of supply and demand much more -- much better than we can this year. So, there are more moving pieces and given that inherent uncertainty, I still think that is within the range of potential outcomes. But again, we'll be watching job growth and more notices and all those various items for better visibility. Notably, a warm notice out there may not have hit the layoff part of the reported job growth. So, there's a lag there. And so it's a little bit unfair to comment on that until we see how that plays out.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Fair enough. And then non-revenue-generating CapEx seemed elevated in the fourth quarter. And I think the 2022 total was up about 40% year-over-year. What's driving that? And can you give any expectation for where '23 will shake out?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. It's Angela here. The -- I think it may be helpful to just talk about how we look at CapEx because looking at a one-year number can be misleading. Our CapEx program is for each property on a 10-year plan. And so, on years where there is a large improvement that we made in replacement, for example, it's going to show up and it's going to look lumpy. So -- but having said that, in 2022, we also had to catch up from the -- when we paused the activities in 2020. So for example, pre-COVID, we're running closer to about $1,700 per door. And in 2020, we were down to like $1,300. So, over 20% increase. And so you play that forward a couple of years later, there is that lag effect. So that's what you're seeing as well. If you look at a, say, 10-year average, our CapEx per door is pretty similar to where our peers are. Now we do have a little older portfolio on average. So, it naturally we should run a slightly higher CapEx per door. So that's -- sorry for the long winter answer, but there's just a little bit more to it than just one number per year. And next year, we're evaluating the expectations you have also inflation. So, it's probably going to be similar to 2023, I mean 2022, but like I said, over a period of time, over a long period of time, it should revert to a long-term average.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Congrats to everyone. I wanted to ask about the pricing of Anavia, which seemed better than expected given the interest rate environment. Any commentary you could provide on this pricing if it's reflective of other asset sales that you're working on? And sort of on a related topic, the matching tax in L.A., what do you think that's going to have the impact that we'll have on both the transaction market near term and pricing?
Adam Berry: Sure. John, this is Adam. So, beginning with Anavia. Anavia was, I'd say, an opportunistic sale to -- there was a very specific buyer and which -- that's reflected in the pricing. Generally speaking, we're seeing cap rates kind of trading in the market in the mid- to high fours. So Anavia, I'd say, outperform that by a bit again just because this very specific situation. Regarding the mansion tax in L.A., so we've seen a slight elevated potential transaction volume in L.A. due to the mansion tax coming into effect April 1. For the most part, I think most of those deals probably won't trade just given they were all on very short runways and pricing expectations just doesn't seem like they are being met. Going forward, I think we've seen this in Washington when they their transfer tax up. It actually did not affect transaction volume generally at all. I think the one thing that may be an outcome of the L.A. management tax is, it could potentially hinder development within Los Angeles, any significant headwind to development returns, especially from merchant builders, that's just going to affect their back end and make it that much harder to build.
John Kim: Okay. My second question is just a follow-up on delinquencies. It looks like it's going to be $40 million on a gross basis this year. How does that compare to last year? We estimated at about $57 million just based on your disclosure. I just wanted to make sure that was accurate. And as part of that, can the ERA surprise to the upside, there's not much baked in guidance?
Barb Pak: John, I may have to follow up with you on those numbers. I want to get back to my office and have the model in front of me. So I don't know if I want to quote the numbers here on the call. In terms of ERA, that would be upside if we were to collect some, but we've exhausted most of that so that we don't expect much in the way of ERA. The one thing I would keep in mind though, is we do have $90 million uncollected bad debt cumulative since the start of COVID. We only have a $3.4 million accounts receivable balance. We think we'll collect more than $3.4 million. It's just a timing of when we're going to collect that. So that is upside to the numbers. It's just -- we don't have that baked into our forecast given the inherent nature of when we're going to collect that. But that's really the upside is on that front more so than even ERA, I would say.
John Kim: Okay. Just -- I'll follow up with you off-line, but that $57 million we calculated from the change in cumulative plus the ERA you received last year, but I'll follow up offline.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Dennerlein: Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys say we're sending out new and renewal notices today?
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. No, we haven't talked about that. Our new and renewals are sending out somewhere between say, 4% to 5% depending on the market. So this is for very March. But keep in mind that does get negotiated. So if we're sending a renewal, say, north of 5%, we assume maybe 100 basis points negotiation depending on when and in some of these markets, we're sending out well in advance. So for example, Seattle, it goes out six months in advance. So hopefully, that gives you a better sense of the range of outcomes.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Yes. No, that's helpful. And then Fiber, I wanted to touch base on -- you mentioned prediction costs and same-store expenses and I guess those from being elevated. I guess how are those showing up in same-store expenses? And then if you kind of normalize for those, what would your same-store expense look like?
Barb Pak: Yes. So, eviction costs show up in our administrative line. And obviously, we have elevated turnover as well, and that's in the R&M line. So it's in both lines. So, I would say in total relative to our historical average. Our controllables are forecasted to be 4% this year, but without the elevated eviction and turnover costs, we think we'd be closer to 3%. So it's about 100 basis points impact to the controllable line item for the year.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. That's awesome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Yulico: First question is just in terms of when you're looking at some of your data on move-outs, maybe you could talk about how that's trending in terms of reasons for move-outs, job losses versus rents being too high or even move out to other regions?
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. That's interesting because we keep expecting big shifts coming out of COVID under the move-out reasons. And moving out to buy home really still hasn't changed from long-term average. I think because the cost of housing here is just a lot less affordable job transfers or other reasons, pretty darn similar and to our historical averages. And so, we have not seen any material change on move-out.
Nick Yulico: Okay. And then just other question is on move-ins. Whether you're seeing any benefit from return to office, which has been a little bit of a slower process in some markets on the West Coast. I mean are you seeing any benefit from that in recent months, whether it's specific cities in the portfolio or even from your move-in data, if you are seeing any instances of people relocating back into your markets because we're now required to be in some sort of hybrid job in an office in your markets increasingly. And I'll just as well, congrats Angela and Mike as well.
Angela Kleiman: Congrats and once again, another good question on the in-migration. It's -- so I have mentioned that in the third quarter, we saw a pretty big uptick on the immigration to our market, 30% to 35% on average between Northern and Southern California. And of course, part of that is attributed to return to office. We have seen that trend continue in the fourth quarter. But keep in mind, fourth quarter is typically just a low demand period. So it's really difficult for us to be a particular trend. The only thing I can tell you is that compared to the first quarter, the in-migration is still better marginally, we're not talking huge numbers from that perspective, once again, fourth quarter is just a tough time to trying to get an indication of that. Mike, do you have anything you want to add?
Michael Schall: Yes. I just wanted to maybe add, we do some work, again, data analytics team that deals with micro com-patterns. And I guess I want to make a comment that it seems to be normalizing as well. Again, you had that mass exodus early on in the pandemic. And we been making progress and just back to the point where we've effectively placed all those jobs, but the places where people are coming from and going to, again, using LinkedIn data, not our own data appear to be pretty similar to what they were in the past. So generally speaking, the migration pattern here is we give people from the large Eastern and Midwestern metros. And actually, more recently, Dallas and Atlanta are on that list of incoming in the top and the place where people go, typically, people will retire, sell their house in California, their expensive house a new part of their retirement plan. And so, they go to a less expensive West Coast cities, notably Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas.
Nick Yulico: Appreciate that, Mike. Any plans to move or you stay in California?
Michael Schall: I'm staying and I'm looking forward to spending some time with the grandkids and that type of stuff. And I'm still going to be around, if Angela will have me, a role to be determined. So I love the Company and love what I do here. So not ready to completely check in this whole thing is really driven by Angela being ready, and that's what's important. And so do a great job. I'm very confident.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Kramer: And congrats again. Look, I just wanted to ask about, obviously, tech markets overall, right, where you guys are located, but maybe just kind of specifically, the tech exposure among your tenant base, if you have that number. Look, I get that they're kind of secondary, secondary tech jobs and secondary exposures to kind of tech jobs within your markets, but maybe just kind of explicitly tenants who are employed by tech employers if you kind of have that percentage for your residents.
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. What we do is we track the top six because everything else is just too fungible on that number. So currently, we're about 7% of our tenant base is linked -- directly linked to the top six tech companies. And of course, it's much more concentrated in Northern California and Seattle relatively speaking. But that's a very manageable base. And of course, in certain assets or properties are -- that has a much closer proximity to the headquarters, the percentage will be disproportionately higher.
Nick Yulico: And how does that 7% kind of compared to maybe pre-COVID or last year historical average types of numbers?
Barb Pak: Not a big change. We tend to kind of run between, say, 5% to 7%, and it kind of hovers around there?
Adam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe just switching gears, wondering kind of the new versus renewal trends new lease kind of modestly negative and then kind of still in the 5% range for renewals for January, look, I think conceptually, if I understand correctly, if that trend kind of continues maybe would form kind of a game lease. So wondering maybe your thoughts on that, if you could kind of see that happening or maybe kind of renewal and new converge over time and kind of that gain to lease is informed?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, A couple of things. I just want to give you a little background first on the new lease rates. That, of course, is heavily impacted by our concessionary strategy, which is related to our occupancy strategy. And so part of that is not as much a market issue versus a strategy issue, and of course, that is something that we shift quickly away from the concessionary environment in January. And so, I don't want you to think that this is something permanent here to stay. And so -- but ultimately, with the renewal rate in an environment where new leases are on our S-16 expected to be about 2%, there is going to be a convergence of new lease and renewal rates and it'll probably take this full year to have that play out.
Adam Kramer: Really appreciate it.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: My first question is when is FX current exposure to corporate housing? And then how do we reconcile the impact of job losses with a return to the office?
Angela Kleiman: I'm sorry. Can you repeat the first part on corporate housing?
Michael Goldsmith: What is your current exposure to corporate housing?
Angela Kleiman: Corporate exposure. Got it. Got it. So our current exposure is about 3%. And what's interesting about that number is during COVID, it actually went down to zero. And so we've been building that up. So last year, it was around -- got up to about 2.5%. Now keep in mind, in Seattle, it's going to move around because they -- it's a temporary nature, right? It comes in pretty heavy during the seasonal peak around July, and that can ramp the portfolio up to 7% and then goes back down around October as they leave. So, there's inherent -- there's an inherent cyclicality to that tenant basis.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. And my second question relates to the regulatory environment. Obviously, the markets that you operate and have gotten increasingly difficult -- increasingly difficult, whether it's rent controlled, Prop. 13, Seattle and Washington State potentially becoming an issue. So maybe can you walk through kind of your updated thoughts around this? And then whether you would look to diversify your portfolio over time, just given some -- given the more challenging operating environment?
Michael Schall: Yes. No, that's a great question, and I'll handle that one. Yes, we have been maybe a little bit surprised just how aggressive some of these actions are. We have a pretty strong advocacy effort that is driven by CAA in California and the local -- one of the local groups up in the Washington area. And so, we spend a lot of time working with those organizations and trying to advocate against those policies. Almost always those policies are sold on the basis of being good for the housing industry. And when, of course, we all know that, in fact, is exactly 100% wrong. It's the exact opposite. So, unfortunately, it's something that we have to deal with, and it is concerning to us and we spend a lot of time on it. The proposal in Washington is still very early on in the process. It's in the house, and it hasn't come out of committees. And as a result of that, I think there's still a long way to go. Again, we will be monitoring that. And -- but all of these different proposals tend to make California less appealing to a landlord and increase the risk of that occurring. So, to your point about other markets, I think I want to reiterate what I said before, which is we are tracking more markets now, 25 major metros across the country. We are looking for specific things. The things that essentially attracted us to California 30 years ago, let's say, and trying to rank those markets in terms of appeal and whether they can compete with the California markets. And we have some interest in some of them. I don't want to get into great detail at this point in time. But as I've said before, and I think actually, this last couple of quarters has played this out why this is important, it's about timing, and it's about making a shift at the appropriate time when our cost of capital is appealing, and we can enter at a point where we can feel like rent growth is going to continue in any of the markets across the country, including our market, San Diego, notably, Orange County, et cetera, if you get 30% to 40% rent increases, you're going to have a lot of supply that we'll hit. And you just can't keep growing. There has to be some change. The markets become unaffordable. The average person can't afford the rent in that location that causes people to move further out to find more affordable housing. The markets, in a certain sense, have a self-correcting mechanism in them. And this has always been the case. It's true here, it's true everywhere. And so we're going to thoughtfully make that decision at the appropriate time. Does that help?
Michael Goldsmith: No, that was really helpful. Congratulations, everyone.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Adam, I wanted to follow up on your transaction market comments. Just curious, how you see the depth of the bid at the cap rates you throw out there. It'd be brought a substantial number of assets to the market, do you think they would trade in those then to high four cap rates you suggest?
Adam Berry: We're still seeing a gap between the bid and the ask. But we are we are seeing, I'd say, a muted volume of deals going down in that mid- to high 4s. So yes, if we got back to, I'd say, kind of normal volume, I think that's where we shake out today.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Just so, I understand those cap rates, are those kind of initial buyer cap rates? Or are those your disposition yields?
Adam Berry: Well, so for Anavia specifically, what we quoted in the statement was disposition yield. What I'm saying the mid to high 4s, that's more of a buyer cap rate.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Last question for me. Just Angela, curious for your thoughts on just the topic of just COVID impacts fully reversing. So as COVID in the rearview mirror, would you expect market rents in any of your Southern California markets that have seen huge cumulative rent growth to actually see absolute declines in market rents over the next few years?
Angela Kleiman: Keep in mind that market rent growth is a function of demand and supply. And so at this point, even looking out the next couple of years, supply is still relatively muted in Southern California and pre-COVID environment Southern California have performed really well. And so Southern California has similar employer base as the broad U.S. market. That's why we like it. It's less volatile, but it has a higher level of professional services, so better earning power. And for that reason, Southern California continues to be stable. And so, we wouldn't expect that because of COVID, absent the fact it's going to just suddenly fall apart.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell: Just a question on the impact of return to work on the outlook in the -- on the West Coast. A lot of the technology firms have announced the office space rationalization, office space sales, could that be a headwind for rent growth in the next couple of years even if you have higher job growth, fewer people are in the cities because they're doing more hybrid work as these firms kind of reduce their footprint?
Michael Schall: Yes. Anthony, it's Mike here. Most of our portfolio actually is suburban in nature. So we have relatively little in cities -- and but we're thinking that return to office is something that will slowly evolve -- and there will be -- maybe we go from an average of two days a week in the office to three days a week in the office. And that will all -- anything that is more office-centric will pull people closer to our apartment community. So that would be a positive impact in our view. And so at this point in time, because people have moved further from the offices and that has cause us to readjust sort of our template for looking for potential acquisitions and other things. But over time, I think that all of us, including, I'd say, here at Essex, we have some of the same issues that we're better off. We're more productive. We make better decisions when we're together as a management group -- senior leadership group and super important to the overall results of the Company. So we think that return to office will be ultimately a tailwind.
Anthony Powell: Maybe one more in terms of just been on buybacks, you made some good promise there last year. Do you think if fire-sell starts to agree that you can maybe increase the buyback amount year-over-year as you sell more assets?
Barb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. We'll assess that based on deal volume and whether we can create NAV and FFO per share. It's hard for me to tell you right now that we can do that in this environment. But it is something that we're cognizant of we have shown that we can run the machine and reverse many times over many different cycles. And so we'll be willing to do that if the right opportunities present themselves.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste: And my congratulations on a fantastic career and all the best of your next chapter and best of luck Angela. So I just had a couple of follow-up questions left here on our list. I guess, first, I want to go back to expenses. Barb, I think you mentioned controllable expenses, you're expecting to be at 4% this year as part of the 5% guide, which I think is higher than a lot of us expected. So maybe can you go through a bit more of the building blocks of that 5% expense growth and maybe if there is any contrast versus say, Seattle, which doesn't have the Prop 13 benefit that California does? And if there is any benefit from the rollout of the property collections platform you mentioned earlier? Thanks.
Barb Pak: Yes, Haendel, on the expense growth, the 5%, really the biggest driver of that is non-controllables. That's up 5.5% to 6%. And really, the key factors are in utilities, were up 10% this year. We do expect high single-digit increases next year. Insurance is expected to be up 20% next year, is a very difficult insurance market. And then on real estate taxes, we've budgeted a 4.25% increase and that's really being driven by Seattle reverting more to our historical norms. So, those are the key building blocks on the non-controllable piece. On the controllable piece, 4% at the midpoint, and we do expect admin to be up only 3%. Once again, we do have elevated eviction costs in that line, which is masking some of the benefits from the rollout of the central services or the property collections model that we rolled out last year that centralized some of those functions. So, it's masking it a little bit this year. But overall, that should give you the major building blocks for why we have a little bit elevated expense growth.
Haendel St. Juste: No, that's helpful. I appreciate that. But just so we're clear, how much impact in a more normalized environment would that property collections platform have?
Barb Pak: Well, so I said the eviction costs are about a 1% impact to controllable. So that's the factor you can use is it would be 1% lower.
Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate it. What's the assumption built into the guide for turnover this year and year-end occupancy?
Barb Pak: Occupancy, we've assumed is stable year-over-year, so flat, no change there. And then in terms of turnover, we did see elevated turnover in the fourth quarter. And given the eviction headwinds that we expect to face in getting the delinquent units back, we do expect turnover to be a little bit more elevated than historical norms. But it's good because then we get tenants in that are paying rent. So, we think that's actually a good thing.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. That's all for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Feldman: I just want to go back to a comment you made earlier in the call about distressed acquisitions, distressed acquisition opportunities coming up with some owners with floating rate debt. Can you talk more about what you're seeing, the magnitude? And do you think that's going to be something that pros as an opportunity set?
Adam Berry: Jamie, this is Adam. So we haven't seen much of that to date. We are -- it's more on the structured finance platform where we're seeing more opportunities on existing deals with maturing debt or with expiring rate caps. We do think this will accelerate into the year and provide potentially more opportunities like I said, probably more focused on the truck and finance platform versus acquisitions, but looking at it from everyday.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then I guess, sticking with structured finance, the impairments you took, how should we think about that, the risk profile of those investments versus the rest of the book or even deals going forward? Like was that just kind of at the higher end of your risk profile? Or the market conditions really just change that quickly that led to the impairments?
Barb Pak: Yes, I would say it's the latter. We didn't change our underwriting on that investment. We didn't go out wider on the risk spectrum or the curve. It really is a function of the Oakland market highly concessionary the developer wanted to sell, and we ultimately agreed to the sale. Now keep in mind, we actually made money on our investment for shareholders. We invested $11.5 million in this project, and we got redeemed $14 million. So, we made 7% annually for our shareholders, the coupon was 10%. So, we didn't quite earn what we thought we were going to earn, but we thought it was in the best interest of shareholders to take their money back and redeploy elsewhere. And so, we didn't lose money. And I think it is a unique function of that market. Right now, given I think there's 16 lease-ups in the market right now.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then finally, just thinking about the -- just in terms of the moratoriums, like how much of that is actually baked into your guidance, the upside, potential upside from LA and Alameda County?
Barb Pak: Well, what we have in our guidance is we do assume that gross delinquency will continue to trend down throughout the year as we are able to recapture our delinquent units. So right now, we have about 3% of our units are delinquent. That's down from 5% at the start of the year of 2022. And we expect that to continue to trend down. By the back half of the year, we expect to be in the 1.5 or lower range for the second half of the year. So, it is a function of the guidance. We do -- we have baked that in, that we'll get more of our units back this year.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. But in terms of the revenue upside, you also have that in really -- I'm just thinking if maybe they get extended past March 31. Is that a downside risk to the guidance or no?
Barb Pak: I don't -- we don't see that as being a downside risk because keep in mind what Mike said earlier about L.A. County, which is the new eviction moratorium is actually more strict than L.A. City was. And so, we don't see that being a hindrance to us. In addition, we are making progress. It's just -- it's taking a little longer than we expected. So, we don't see that as a significant downside at this point.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Hope to see many of you at the Citi conference, and we definitely appreciate all the well-wishing for Angela and me. I want to note that it's been an absolute honor to work with so many of you. And so have a great day. Thank you for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at the time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will begin by congratulating Angela for her appointment to the Essex Board and for chosen as the next CEO of the Company following my planned retirement in March 2023. I’ve known Angela for almost two decades and we have worked closely together since she joined the Company 13 years ago. Angela embraces and exemplifies Essex’s strategy and core values and is a dedicated thoughtful leader as well as an excellent negotiator. Our recent leadership announcement was a combination of the multiyear succession plan administered by the Essex Board, and I appreciate each participant’s commitment to the plan that resulted in its success. It has been an honor to lead this awesome company made possible by my great leadership team and the coordinated effort of every Essex associate. My thanks to all of you. Today, I will touch on our third quarter results, introduce our initial market level rent forecast for 2023 and provide an update on the apartment investment markets. Our third quarter results represent our fifth consecutive quarter of improving core FFO per share. On a year-over-year basis, we reported core FFO per share and NOI growth of 18.3% and 15.4%, respectively, with core FFO exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share. The positive results are reflective of the team’s execution and the continued recovery throughout our markets, largely driven by the ongoing rebound in Northern California and Seattle with Southern California remaining a consistent and strong performer. Year-to-date, the economy on the West Coast has shown resiliency with job growth as of September 2022 of 4.3% in Southern California and significantly higher in the tech markets of Northern California and Seattle. The positive job growth is partly attributable to the recovery of workers lost amid the significant shutdowns early in the pandemic, especially leisure, hospitality and service jobs that were added throughout the summer. As a result, it is not surprising that the unemployment rate in each Essex market with the exception of Los Angeles is under 4%, including San Francisco and San Jose in the mid 2% range. The unemployment rate in Los Angeles is higher at 4.5%, likely related to the ongoing eviction moratorium in the city of Los Angeles, which is expected to run -- to end in February 2023. Job openings at the large tech companies have declined from record levels during the pandemic, although they remain significant with approximately 20,000 jobs available, roughly consistent with the number of job openings they reported between 2016 and early 2020. Thus, while we recognize that tech job growth is slowing, the large tech companies are well-capitalized and continue to expand and hire in our markets. As in previous years, we’ve included our initial forecast for 2023 market level rent growth on page, S-17 in the supplemental. Our forecast begins with the consensus estimates of third-party economists for the national economy with respect to GDP and job growth, indicated at the top left of page S-17. Based on these estimates, our data analytics team estimates job growth in each Essex metro. On the supply side, we use our ground up fundamental research to estimate apartment deliveries, which is proven to be highly accurate over many years. Everyone’s visibility into next year is limited by uncertainty related to past and future Fed actions and their impact on the overall U.S. economy, and therefore the forecasted rent growth may vary if the key assumptions prove inaccurate. In summary, housing supply across the Essex markets is expected to grow at 0.6% of existing housing stock with the greatest increase occurring in Seattle with a 1.1% increase. Job growth is expected to be new next year, growing at 0.4% overall in the Essex market, with the best job growth expected to be in San Francisco at just over 1%. As a result of these demand and supply assumptions, we expect net effective new lease rents to increase 2% in 2023 with our California markets expected to marginally outperform Seattle. On a year-over-year basis, we expect apartment supply to decline about 10% in 2023 with Northern California having the largest expected reduction down 45%. We also expect 2023 single family deliveries to be similar to 2022, even with permits growing modestly given much higher mortgage rates. With respect to for-sale housing, declining housing production and reduced affordability are tailwinds for apartments in the Essex markets, representing a small positive factor, contributing to our rent outlook next year. Given economists’ expectations for a modest recession in 2023, I’d like to summarize our historical experience about operating our portfolio in previous economic downturns. Generally, in each significant past recession, our weakest market has been Seattle, which is due to the confluence of negative job growth and higher levels of housing supply deliveries. Northern California follows a similar pattern to Seattle with respect to job losses during recessions, although with significantly less supply that results in outperformance relative to Seattle. Finally, Southern California is our best performer during recessions, given its diverse economy and minimal supply. That being said, each recession is unique and there are several factors that could lead to a different outcome. First, most of the previous recessions followed a long economic expansion where rents grew substantially. And it’s those higher rents that pressures affordability that fosters higher level of apartment supply. On the West Coast, rents plummeted in the early part of the pandemic and our recovery was much delayed compared to the rest of the country with Southern California’s recovery beginning in mid-2021, and Northern California and Seattle in early 2022. As a result, the West Coast is still in the early stages of its from the 2020 recession and housing supply has not had sufficient time to fully recover. In addition, with many offices closed during the pandemic, it was common to hire remotely with the expectation that workers would need to relocate closer to offices upon re-openings, which is now occurring. The relocation of employees back to the West Coast pursuant to return to office programs, represents demand for apartments that is generally not included in job growth. Finally, we expect less outward migration in the next few years, primarily because those that typically leave California, such as the newly retired, probably left early in the pandemic when businesses were shut down. In a moment, Angela will comment further on migration. Turning to the apartment transaction market. We have recently seen a few deals close at valuations that were negotiated before the most recent increase in interest rates, and conditions have changed enough since then to significantly impact transactions. As expected, the immediate impact of higher interest rates will result in diverging buyer and seller expectations for property values, resulting in a larger bid-ask spread. Generally, it takes more than higher interest rates to create financial distress, especially with recent strong rent growth given inflationary pressures. However, pockets of distress may develop from credit or liquidity events or excessive Fed tightening, although no major issues are apparent at this point. Broker price talks with respect to apartment transactions indicates that cap rates for high-quality and well-located apartments are in the mid-4% range in the Essex markets. Finally, I wanted to note that, our balance sheet is in great condition, thanks to the unwavering urgency of Barb and the finance team over the past several years. When the markets turn positive, we expect excellent opportunities to invest creatively, and we will be in a position to be opportunistic. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, Mike. I will begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to Mike for his mentorship and guidance over the past 13 years. I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this organization and to build upon the Company’s long history of thoughtful capital allocation and operational excellence. My comments today will focus on our third quarter performance, followed by some regional highlights, then wrap up with the key operational initiatives that we are excited about. Starting with the third quarter, during much of this period, we capitalized on the strength of the underlying fundamentals in our markets by pushing rents and achieved 10.3% year-over-year growth in new lease rates in the third quarter. Although this is a deceleration compared to the 20% growth in the second quarter, keep in mind that new lease rates in the first half of last year declined by about 6%, but in the second half new lease rates surged to positive 17%. The tough year-over-year comps is the key driver of the deceleration. And the third quarter results are in line with our expectations. In general, we have seen a normal seasonal rent pattern. Accordingly, as we approached the end of the third quarter, we shifted to an occupancy focus strategy. Turning to the delinquency. In recent months, we have begun to recapture more units from nonpaying tenants. With the ending of eviction moratorium, it is no surprise that the number of move-outs related to nonpaying tenants have increased. Looking forward, we plan for a higher volume of move-outs, which may create a temporary headwind in occupancy for the rest of the year and into 2023. For this reason, even though we have shifted to favor occupancy, we anticipate our occupancy to be slightly lower than historical levels. The good news is that regulations are being pulled back, which is allowing us to finally make progress on delinquency. Moving on to regional highlights, starting with Pacific Northwest. After a strong start to the year, rents in this region have peaked in late July. The seasonality through the third quarter, which includes the typical decline in market rents subsequent to the peak is consistent with what we have experienced between 2016 and 2019. However, since mid-September, we’ve been facing softer demand along with higher level of supply deliveries in the second half of the year. So, we are monitoring this market closely.  As for Northern California, this region has led our growth in net effective new lease rates since the start of the year. Strong job growth and return to office are two key contributing factors. Bay Area net in-migration has continued to accelerate this year. In the third quarter, over 35% of move-ins were primarily from outside of our markets, which is an increase from 15% in the first quarter. Notably, we are seeing positive migration trends from markets as diverse as Dallas and Boston. Consistent with our previous commentary on commitment of tech giants to continue to expand in Northern California, we are excited to see Google break ground last week on its massive mixed use development in San Jose. This development is expected to bring 25,000 high-paying jobs and effectively doubling the amount of office space in Downtown San Jose. This will be a long-term benefit for Essex as we own almost 6,000 units in this region. On to Southern California, healthy job growth is continuing to drive incremental demand for rental housing. As such, this region continues to perform well. We’re also seeing positive in-migration to Southern California, with 30% of our third quarter movies coming from outside the region compared to 17% in the first quarter. Turning to key operations initiatives, we have completed the rollout of first phase of our property collections operating model, which focused on leasing, administration and customer service. By way of background, this model optimizes our geographic density and transforms our business from operating each property individually to a collection of around 9 to 12 properties. The shift in business strategy enables us to leverage our team and technology to improve the customer experience and achieve significant efficiencies. I’m pleased to announce that Phase 1 is fully rolled out across the entire portfolio, ahead of plan and the progress is beginning to show up in our financial results. Year-to-date administrative expenses were up only by 1.4%. Despite a significantly higher wage increases, along with other inflationary pressures on expenses. The next step is to apply the collections operating model to the maintenance function. As we have demonstrated previously, this model has created more career advancement opportunities for employees through specialization, while improving efficiency and customer service. The maintenance collections highlight is currently underway and rollout is planned to start by mid next year. Lastly, on the technology front, the implementation of Funnel software suite is progressing well. As you may recall, Funnel is RET Ventures company with whom we have chosen to co-develop applications to enhance our platform. The Funnel product will handle the end to end customer experience from initial prospect inquiries through the full resident lifecycle, which will result in better experience for our customers. From an employee perspective, this technology will streamline or automate the manual tasks associated with roughly 60,000 transactions each year. Our initial pilot showed a promising 35% reduction in task time associated with these activities. Continued refinements are underway, and we are excited to work toward a full deployment by the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today I’ll discuss our third quarter results followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I’m pleased to report third quarter core FFO per share a $3.69, a $0.04 beat to the midpoint of our guidance range. Half of the outperformance was due to lower operating expenses, which is timing related and the other half was from higher co-investment income due to better NOI growth at the joint venture properties and higher preferred equity income. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.02 per share to $14.47, representing approximately 16% growth compared to last year. As it relates to delinquency, we are seeing continued improvement in our gross delinquency, which is helping to offset less emergency rental assistance funds. The same-property portfolio gross delinquency improved sequentially from 4.5% in the second quarter to approximately 3.5% in the third quarter. October improved further to around 2%. We suspect the gross delinquency trends will continue to improve as we work to recapture delinquent units. However, the improvement is unlikely to be linear. One additional positive development that recently occurred is the City of LA approved removing eviction protection starting on February 1st of next year. This will allow us to recapture delinquent units in an area that accounts for approximately 40% of our outstanding bad debt and will allow us to finally get back to our historical level of delinquency. However, it will take time to achieve this goal, and we would expect delinquency will remain elevated through the first half of 2023, with the expectation that we will get closer to our historical average of 35 basis points of scheduled rent by the end of next year. Turning to our stock repurchase and investments. Consistent with last quarter, investing in our own portfolio and select preferred equity investments offers the best risk-adjusted returns in today’s market. In the third quarter, we repurchased $97 million of common stock at a significant discount to our internal NAV, which we plan to match fund on a leverage-neutral basis with proceeds from a disposition expected to close in the fourth quarter. As it relates to other transactions, we closed $65 million of new preferred equity and subordinated loan investments during the quarter and committed to one additional investment in October. These new commitments are expected to be match funded with redemptions of two structured finance investments that are slated to close in the fourth quarter. Finally, I want to provide some additional color on the strength of the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains healthy at 5.8 times and we expect this to further improve as EBITDA continues to grow. It should be noted that we operated around these same leverage levels before the pandemic and our balance sheet metrics are strong. In addition, we are well positioned from a capital needs perspective. In October, we closed a delayed draw term loan that will be fully drawn in April of 2023 with proceeds intended to repay $300 million in bonds that mature next year. We have swapped this debt to an all-in fixed rate of 4.2%. As a result of this transaction, we have all our known funding needs addressed until May of 2024. The company has no significant unfunded development needs and can fund the dividend, operations and capital expenditure needs from free cash flow. Additionally, our variable rate exposure excluding our line of credit is minimal at less than 4% of our consolidated debt. With over $1.1 billion in liquidity, no funding needs for the next 18 months and access to a variety of capital sources, the balance sheet remains well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. And congratulations, both Mike and Angela. Maybe just starting on the building blocks for next year. Obviously, you provided the market rent growth of 2%. What’s the earn-in expected from 2022 lease in? And then where is the loss per lease today, and where would you expect it to be at the end of the year?
Angela Kleiman: Hey Nick, it’s Angela here. So, on the earn-in for 2023, I think -- if it’s okay with you, I wanted to step back and make sure we’re using a consistent definition. For us, the way we look at earn-in is we look to the September loss-to-lease, it’s not too hot and not too cold, and take 50% of that. So, in this case, September loss-to-lease was close to 7%, taking half of it would be about 3.5%, and that will be our earning, and we assume no market rent growth. Now, what we’ve heard is there’s a question about 2023 revenue growth and how does the earn-in applied to that. And so what we’ve done in the past is explain that by saying, you take your earn-in and then we look at our 2023 S17 market rent growth and take 50% of that. So, that would be -- the market rent growth is 2%, so half of that would be 1%. You add that to the 3.5% earn-in, that gives you a proxy of about 4.5% for revenue growth for 2023. And so, as far as the loss-to-lease, where we are is we’re about 2.5% loss-to-lease in October for the portfolio. And of course, it varies by region, but that’s coming from a loss-to-lease in September of 6.7%, so definitely a deceleration. But it is expected and loss-to-lease at this level for October is actually better than our historical patterns. Typically, around this time of the year, we’re at about 1% loss-to-lease and heading towards zero by year-end. So at 2.8, we’re feeling pretty darn good about the portfolio.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That was very helpful. And then maybe just on the transaction market, given kind of the expected rent growth and where debt costs are today, does the 4.5% cap rate make sense for most buyers, or how are they thinking about getting to their unlevered IRRs, given maybe the negative leverage situation initially right now?
Adam Berry: Yes. Hey Nick, this is Adam. As Mike mentioned in his opening comments, the transaction volume is definitely down from where it was a quarter ago. But there are still deals being priced. There are still deals going non-contingent. And in talking to buyers who are still active in the market, they’re willing to take a certain level of negative leverage for 18 to 24 months is the number that I’m hearing now. And so, with various assumptions about rent growth, repositioning and those types of strategies, that’s what we’re seeing in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Look, I guess the biggest thing that everyone’s focused on is the 2%. And Angela, you walked through the math, and I know this is not trying to get this into a debate about ‘23, but the math that you just walked through would, I think, basically imply your revenue growth is several hundred basis points below several of your peers. And I guess I’m just trying to understand, is that really a function of market mix; is that a function of the conservatism, the 2%? I don’t know what the history of that number is. And if you start low and kind of work that number high over time, but it just strikes me as your implicit growth for next year is kind of well below the peers.
Michael Schall: Hey Steve, let me try to handle that one. So S-17, beginning a few years ago, decided to start with the consensus of third-party economists as to the U.S. and then drilled down from there into what that means for our markets. And we obviously have -- Chairman Powell there talking about breaking things and pain to come at a mild recession, which is what this is based on. And so rather than using our own how we feel, we think it’s important that we create a scenario that’s based on the consensus of the people that are really studying these things and certainly not ignoring what they’re saying. And so, that’s where this macro scenario comes from. Do we feel like that’s a little bit dire? Yes, we do. But again, several years ago, we made the decision to start basing S-17 on the macroeconomists view of the world, which, in fact, is pretty dire. And it seems to us that we shouldn’t ignore the Fed’s comments about pain to be had, et cetera. So, that’s where that scenario comes from. Do we feel like things are a little bit better than that? Well, yes, we do. And if we were basing this on how we feel, we would come up with something that is more optimistic than this. But again, we shouldn’t ignore the Fed, and that seems like it’s what’s happening out there. And we think that’s fundamentally misguided, I guess. Does that make sense?
Steve Sakwa: Yes. No, look, I agree that they’re storm clouds. It would seem like you would need to see negative job growth occurring in order to really diminish the pricing power that’s out there. And so, when I look at your job growth forecast or the market’s job growth forecast of 40 basis points, again, supply growth of 60 basis points, those are largely in lockstep with each other. There’s not big dislocations on the supply front in your market. So, it would feel like occupancy is going to be relatively stable. And so, I would have thought that rent growth wouldn’t be off to the races, but that it might be better than 2%. If you told me job growth was very negative, I would agree with you.
Michael Schall: Well, that -- and that’s exactly what the third-party economists are saying. So, up there in the upper left-hand corner is the consensus of the -- again, third-party macroeconomists that say, job is going to be minus 0.2% next year. And so that forms the basis of what we think. So, we outperform in terms of job growth the U.S. economy. And in fact, that minus 2% for the U.S. is translating into 0.4% job growth for us. So not a lot. But again, it’s a pretty dire scenario. And so, that’s where that comes from. Again, we don’t feel like it’s this bad. I mean based on what we see in front of us today, we’re having some seasonality here in October. We expect that. Loss-to-lease typically goes negative by the end of the year, and it probably will this year. Keep in mind, the demand side of the equation is driven by jobs. And obviously, we pay attention to the seasonally adjusted jobs. But the reality is, if you look at total nonfarm employment, it gets pretty soft in the fourth quarter. And so, these things can happen. So basically, we don’t feel -- we feel like this is a pretty draconian scenario, but we’re trying to maintain some consistency with respect to what we are trying to put out there with respect to S-17. And just following through on the historical pattern, and looking at what the economists out there are saying, we think this is that scenario. Could it be different? Absolutely it could be different, and we hope it’s different. But again, I don’t want to ignore the elephant in the room. It seems pretty important to actually consider what the macro economists are saying and what it means for us. And I would add to that, everyone across the nation is going to feel the same pain if this occurs. It’s not just a West Coast thing. It’s a national thing. It starts with the U.S. job growth. And then, we look at historical relationships to try to determine what it means for the West Coast. And that’s where these numbers are coming from.
Steve Sakwa: I appreciate that. Thanks. And then, I guess, maybe just in terms of return hurdle hurdles and how you’re thinking about underwriting. Can you just give us a sense for how you guys have altered either acquisition hurdles, development hurdles in light of given where stock prices have gone, where bond yields have gone? I mean, how much have you raised your cap rates, IRRs in today’s environment?
Adam Berry: Hey Steve, this is Adam again. So, consistent with what we just talked about the 4.5% range is kind of where we see the market. We’re probably not buyers at that range, we have a better use for our capital and development yields will need to move off of that base, if not maybe slightly higher. So, when we look at development deals, depending on where they are in the entitlement process, we’re looking at a 20% to 25% spread over to adjust for the risk related to development.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: Hey. I just wanted to maybe dive a little bit deeper into some of the markets. Looking kind of at the October new lease growth, kind of the 2.8% figure. Wondering if you can maybe just give some color just on performance across kind of the different markets. I think that would be helpful.
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. So, on the new lease rates for October at 2.8%, it’s actually a pretty wide range. With starting -- I’ll just go from North to South. Pacific Northwest, it’s negative, about 90 basis points, and that’s consistent with my earlier commentary about the softness in that market. And then, Northern California, the strongest at about 4.5% and Southern California close to 2%. So, Southern continues to be the steady Eddie. And Northern California is rebounding as we have anticipated.
Adam Kramer: Got it. That’s really helpful. And just looking at the occupancy figure, it looks consistent kind of October versus third quarter. Maybe just comment a little bit about kind of -- are concessions being used, and I’d imagine maybe in kind of the weaker Northwest market, maybe they are being used. But I would love to just kind of hear are concessions being used, is that kind of used as a tool to kind of maintain occupancy here?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. We -- concession usage is -- for us, we focus on where there’s a competitive supply. So, of course, during our -- if we’re doing our own lease-up, we use concessions, we line that as part of our pricing tool. But absent of that, it’s a function of how many lease-up do you have near property, and how do we remain competitive and meet the market? So, in terms of the concessions usage, just the change between October and the third quarter, it has ticked up, and it’s primarily driven by Seattle. So Seattle -- in the third quarter. And as mentioned that we had a very normal third quarter, was less than a week. And it is now about two weeks, and that’s the biggest change. With all the other markets, it’s incremental a couple of days more, which is consistent with what we expected. And so, portfolio overall, our concessions has gone up from say half a week to about a week portfolio-wise, and with the key driver being Seattle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Angela, congrats. And I guess now you get the joy of answering directly to George after each earnings season. So, I’m sure you’ll enjoy that part. So, question -- two questions for you. And going back, Steve -- to Steve’s question. Traditionally, you guys are a conservative team, I don’t want to say -- yes, I won’t characterize it any more than that. But traditionally, you guys are an under promise over deliver. Mike, I hear you on the economic forecast in S-17 that this is independent consensus, this isn’t your world. But when we think about just bottom line earnings growth because obviously the stats get worked with the COVID rebound, it sounds like you guys are saying that revenue was 4.5% while your lost lease right now is 7%. But you’re only saying, hey, next year, maybe 4% -- 4.5% for revenue. Prop 13 helps on the taxes next year. So, your OpEx should be probably a little bit better than the national average because you don’t have the OpEx, the property tax pressure. But as we think about bottom line FFO growth, should 2023, assuming that it’s not a blood bath recession, should be sort of more of a normal type earnings growth? Or I’m just trying to figure out how much the year-over-year stats are impacting our clouding the FFO growth that is implied by what you guys have presented?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. Hey Alex, there’s obviously lots of moving pieces here, and you’re asking good questions, kind of what does that mean for the bottom line? Let me just clarify a few things and then I’ll flip it back to Mike to talk about S-17 and maybe follow-up on the FFO. The 7% that you’re referring to is September loss-to-lease. And what we normally do is take half of that with earn-in. So, that’s how we got to the 3.5%. And so, that’s pretty consistent math for proxy purposes. And as far as the expense comment, I do want to address that for a minute. I do think that we should perform a little better than inflation on average. And especially on the administrative side of it, that should be quite a bit below inflation. And with -- since we have not yet rolled out maintenance collections that will be higher than the admin growth. And so, we expect controllables to come in comparable to this year at about 4% for next year. So that’s uncontrollable. And so, that’s some of the building blocks from the P&L perspective. And then Mike?
Michael Schall: Yes. Alex, I just wanted to add a couple of things perhaps. So first thing is that Angela, she thinks for next year the kind of proxy formula is that 3.5 plus half the growth of next year, which is the 2%, which is the pretty dire scenario. So, I’d say there’s some potential upside if that dire scenario doesn’t take place. So that would be one thing. And then I just want to mention that we feel pretty good about where the Company is positioned right now. Core FFO right now is at the high end of the bicoastal peers when you go back and compare it to Q4 2019. So, we feel good about that. And we’ve accomplished that with really Southern California at sort of full recovery -- in full recovery mode, not Northern California and Seattle. And we attribute that to the fact that both of them fell further and have a longer period of time that’s required for recovery. In Northern California, for example, rent levels right now are roughly equivalent to where they were at pre-COVID. So, there’s been no rent -- in Northern California. And historically, the tech markets are the driver of growth, and I suspect that they will be the driver of growth going forward. We’re just not there yet. So, we feel good about this. When we think about some of the other things, incomes, median incomes – household incomes in San Francisco, San Jose are now over $145,000 a year. That’s the median, which is pretty amazing and screens very affordable as it relates to rental value. And that’s what draws people to the West Coast. Everyone talks about, well, the costs are higher on the West Coast, but the reality is they’re drawn by the incomes that are much higher as well. And so, we think that there’s going to continue to be a recovery as we recovered jobs lost in the recession in Northern California and Seattle. We think that they will once again become the drivers of the Company going forward, and very little of that is priced into the stock, which makes us think that there’s very good upside here.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is on your debt and preferred equity programs, obviously, one of your peers had a default and they’re taking the property back here in New York, the office company, converted two DPE [ph] positions. You guys have a number of investments. Do you see the risk profile of DPE [ph] or your view is that as you monitor the deals, they’re all financially performing the way you expect them, meaning nothing -- you haven’t seen anything outside of what you’ve been monitoring along the way, both in performance as well as in the developer’s ability to get to secure financing?
Adam Berry: Yes. Hey Alex. So at this point, we’re not seeing any potential for material defaults. We constantly assess our preferred equity book. So, the short answer is no, we’re not seeing anything at this point. A little more background behind it. Over 75% of our pref and mezz book was underwritten in 2020 or before. So, we really -- we didn’t go down to the depths of the mid-3 caps, chasing deals. We did very few deals during that time. And so, with this recent expansion in cap rates, it really doesn’t impact where we are in the stack. And then, you couple that with pretty significant NOI growth, and we feel like we’re in a pretty good position.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: I’m wondering for one of the comments I think Angela said in her opening remarks on the higher move-outs is, I think, what you’re expecting going forward. Are those higher move-outs from non-payers who I guess you’ll be able to address with LA restriction going away? Just trying to get a sense of like, will that lower occupancy kind of impact same-store revenue.
Angela Kleiman: Sure, sure. We -- there’s two things happening on the move-outs. The higher turnover is driven by two factors. One is, of course, the Seattle softness that I’ve talked about earlier. And it’s attributed mostly to an elevated level of supply in Seattle in the second half. And of course, when there’s more supply, there’s more concessions, and that draws people out of stabilized properties. That’s not usual during a period where corporate hirings are slowing, once again. That’s what’s happening in Seattle. As far as California, the higher move-out is attributed to the nonpaying tenants moving out, which we see is a good thing. And so, with the LA moratorium expiring next year, we do see another opportunity there. So, we’re able to make good progress on the delinquency front there. So, that’s -- hopefully, that’s what you’re looking for.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. No, that’s helpful. And then you -- I think another comment you mentioned was just shifting more to focus on occupancy. Is -- I guess, what’s driving that? Is it just like you want to hang on to occupancy assuming like -- it sounds like you guys are taking the big picture macro view that there might be like a recession…
Angela Kleiman: I see what you’re saying. Yes. So, the -- normally, when we see market strength, which is usually during a period of strong demand, we push rents. And as we head toward the end of the third quarter and into our seasonal low in the fourth quarter, we historically switch that strategy to push occupancy. And so, what we’re doing here is consistent with what we’ve always done in the past. And what we’re seeing is this is -- what I’m trying to convey there is that this is a normalized market that’s stable, and we’re essentially shifting this strategy to maximize revenue during this period of time. And the reason -- so normally, what you will see is in the fourth quarter, our occupancy may run, say, in the mid to high 96%. But because of this eviction headwind, it may run a little bit lower. So maybe in the low 96%. But I wanted to signal to the community that that’s not because there’s any problem here, this is actually a good thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Angela, I wanted to ask your methodology on the earn-in. I realize this is somewhat of a new figure, at least to us on the outside. And your use of taking the September loss-to-lease and approximating it by using half of loss-to-lease. [Ph] I would have thought the earn-in was basically the rent contribution this year versus next year on rent that you’ve signed to date. So, I was just wondering how this earn-in compares maybe to prior years and then also how accurate you think the September loss-to-lease divided by two -- how good is that to the actual contribution?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. So, if I look at the September loss-to-lease and use 50% as a proxy. And then look at that number relative to prior periods, pre-COVID, this -- the September number is actually about twice as high as the normalized period. Normally, around September, the loss-to-lease is around 3%. And so, this is one of the reasons why we feel good about where our portfolio sits and as we head into next year. Absent, of course, a recession, we certainly should do quite well.
John Kim: So historically, your earn-in is about 1.5% per year?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that sounds about right. Now the one thing I do want to clarify is that everybody calculates it a little bit differently. And so for us, we are not including concessions. So, if we include concessions, that earn-in number, obviously, will be much higher. But we’re trying to just keep it apples-to-apples, so to minimize confusion. So, it’s the same baseline.
John Kim: Okay. And I know this has been asked a few different times. But on your 2% rent forecast, I’m just trying to get a sense of what kind of range that you see is at and how difficult it was to forecast job growth for next year versus prior years when you come out with this initial forecast?
Michael Schall: Hi John, it’s Mike. So again, we’re trying to start with third-party economists as to the macro scenario. And then what happens in the -- across the country will be a function of that. And again, typically, we outperform the national economy with respect to job growth. And so, the consensus of the big economists is for U.S. job growth to be at minus 2% next year. And we think we’ll do better than that. We’re plus 0.4%, but 9,500 new jobs under the 0.4 scenario, it is about 4,800 households against 50,000-plus new supply in the marketplace. So again, do we think that will happen? I mean, as of now and given what Angela just said, it seems like that’s pretty dire. But again, we should not ignore what the economists are saying and we should not ignore the Fed talking about wrecking things and pain points. So, we don’t know. Our visibility into next year is no better than yours. And whereas we feel pretty good today, as I said earlier, we can’t ignore these numbers. So again, I’d rather have this discussion so you guys know where we’re coming from than to just create a scenario out of thin air because that doesn’t sound relevant. When we do our budgeting process, we start with economic rent growth. I don’t know how you do a budget without that because you can’t leave it to the property teams to try to decide what rents are going to do. You have to have some macro view of the world. And based on that, you populate your budgets based on supply and demand at the local level. I don’t know how else to do it. And I’m not saying our budgets are based on this scenario because that -- because again, it does seem somewhat dire. However, we are mindful of the macro economy. We’re mindful of what the Fed is saying, and we’re going to adjust accordingly. Does that make sense?
John Kim: It does. I know it’s difficult time, too. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. First question is just in terms of your portfolio, I was wondering if you’re seeing any differences right now in the operating trends and recognizing you have a broad portfolio that’s different price points, suburban, urban. As we think about return to office being most challenged on the West Coast, in San Francisco proper, in Seattle proper, in downtown LA, may be downtown San Diego, too. How -- are you seeing a different performance of your apartment assets in those urban cores than the rest of the portfolio?
Michael Schall: Yes. It’s Mike. I’ll start and then flip it to Angela here in a minute. The answer is yes, of course. We see all kinds of differences out there. And I’m going to give you the broader perspective of what our portfolio is and why it is the way it is, which is we hope to have properties throughout the fastest growing metros. And again, we look at supply demand to try to get to those numbers. That’s how we deploy capital. We generally want to be in the B or renter by necessity category. Because when new supply hits, or when you have a supply-demand imbalance, which could happen next year, the properties that are hit the hardest are those that are near the new supply, because the new -- when someone down the street has eight weeks free, and you’re a brand new apartment competing with that -- competing directly with that, you may be impacted to a much greater extent. So, our portfolio is mostly suburban in nature. Again, we’re not trying to be in San Francisco and San Jose, we’re trying to be in the whole Northern California, metroplex, within let’s say one hour commute distance from the major job nodes. That is our portfolio composition. And we think there are -- there’s inherent safety in the Bs, because you can’t produce the quality property. And in a world where the -- as are more concentrated in the downtown, and the newer product is more susceptible to the impact of concessions if they increase substantially, we think those are the areas going to get hit the hardest. And the B quality property will do quite well. So Angela, I’ll flip it to you?
Angela Kleiman: Well, I think maybe I’ll just give you a quick example of what Mike is talking about. Concessions in downtown LA is about 1.5 weeks, and concessions throughout the rest of the LA area averages about a week. And so that gives you the magnitude impact of the downtown versus the market.
Nick Yulico: My other question is just in terms of move-out activity that you’re seeing on like a real time basis in the portfolio. I mean, how much of that would you attribute to people who have tech jobs? And are you seeing any signs yet of tech freezing, layoffs, hitting your portfolio?
Michael Schall: Nick, I’m going to start with that too. I mean, our portfolio is not positioned to be near the tech companies per se or to cater to the tech employees. We are trying to cater to the broad range of employment within our market. So, we do have a couple buildings that are predominantly tech related employees, but it’s the exception, and actually not even close to the average. So, we are a reflection of the broader economy. And therefore, the tech component in Northern California and Seattle will be more, but there is a lot of -- there’s a pretty diverse job base there in general. And so again, that goes into the philosophy of the company. So I don’t think that, we are particularly exposed to tech. We are more exposed to supply-demand imbalances and which we hope won’t happen. But again, the dire financial scenario on the S-17 sort of contemplates that scenario.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Chandni Luthra: Mike, first of all, congrats on the retirement and Angela, congratulations on the new role. Team, what are you guys seeing on the preferred book? You obviously raised your commitments for the year. How do you see appetite for your investments next year, obviously with higher interest rates and how have returns changed? I know this came up briefly on the call, but do you see any distress related opportunities generally in the broader market as you think ahead?
Michael Schall: So, a couple of questions in there. I’ll try to go backward. As far as distressed opportunities, we’re not seeing them as of yet. There is talk of the potential for rate caps expiring and a need for that kind of rescue capital. We are not seeing it yet. And I haven’t really heard from anyone else who has seen it. There is definitely talk but haven’t seen any of those opportunities come to fruition yet. As far as -- let’s see, I think your other question was just what we are seeing right now on our pref side. We have increased returns. So, for deals that we are currently pursuing, we have increased returns between 100 and 150 basis points. I would say where the market is today, there are opportunities given the difficulty of debt today. But underwriting is a little more opaque. So I think for the fourth quarter, there is probably -- we have one or two deals in our pipeline right now. I don’t probably see more than that coming into the fourth quarter. I think things will slow down a little and people may take a pause. And then going into next year, I think, it will start back up and we will see more opportunities.
Chandni Luthra: Okay. And this one is going to be very quick follow-up. So, I completely understand and appreciate the use of third-party economists and kind of the view of the world that is out there right now. But if we don’t go into a full blown recession next year, is it fair to say that there is more potential for rent growth in 2023, given the market never fully recovered for some of your key markets or is that a fair assessment?
Michael Schall: Of course, it is. Yes. I mean, I would say when I look at supply, at around 0.6% of stock, that looks like it’s probably the lowest anywhere in the U.S. that’s what I’m guessing, are on the low-end, let’s say. And supply is the enemy in our view. And trying to avoid supply is a key part of why we are in these markets. So, if we get a little bit of demand growth, I think we will do just fine, and/or if the recession is just a short recession, and we’re in and then back out of it, that scenario would be better than what is on page S-17. So, we -- it appears as S-17 is probably close to the worst case scenario, but of course, none of us really know.
Operator: Our next question comes from the of line of Robyn Luu with Green Street.
Robyn Luu: Congratulations, Mike and Angela, and thanks for taking my question. So, I want to start off with the preferred investments, and subordinated loan business. So, are you seeing any capital providers that you’d normally see in bidding terms drop off, as you I guess pursue the preferred deals going forward?
Adam Berry: Great question. The answer is, yes. Predominantly the debt funds, they have disappeared. We would go into some of these deals, and especially to debt funds, they would provide what we call stretch seniors. So, it would be zero to, call it, 75%. They’re no longer in competition. So, we’re seeing more opportunities coming to us because of that.
Robyn Luu: Do you mind expanding whether those debt funds are purely domestic players, as opposed to also foreign players?
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. I think most of them were domestic players. I mean, I’m not sure that we know exactly where they’re coming from. But, we know that we were refinanced out of several deals with high yield funds. And I didn’t -- don’t know exactly who they were, but it seemed like they were domestic funds, high -- domestic high yield funds. So, and there were a lot of them out there. So, we were -- these redemptions have come to an end, consistent with what Adam said, and it looks like the market is much less competitive now and going forward, which we think is a good thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: Yes, Mike, I’ll echo everyone’s sentiment. Congrats, enjoy not having to prepare for earnings. And Angela, looking forward to continuing to work with you. I guess, just along those lines. I think that California struggles aren’t lost on people and you’re still kind of working through that and there’s still a lot of uncertainty. And I guess, Angela, do you think that the Angela climbing era will see Essex venture out from California, maybe like a Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake, maybe even a Texas, where a lot of the businesses and populations are going? I understand that it’s easier to build supply. But, some of the markets are supposed to have -- I mean, have been outperforming you guys for like the last three years and luckily, they’re going to again in ‘23 and they have a lot of supply. So, just that you can maybe comment on how the Angela climb-in era could look regarding portfolio composition?
Angela Kleiman: This is kind of a broader strategy question. And so, let me start with why we are here. And that’s to -- you even said it, the Sunbelt has outperformed for three years. Well, to us, three years isn’t exactly long-term. And what drove these three years is a pandemic. And so, the way we look at the world is we don’t expect to have regular pandemics that will completely change behavior and legislation. But, in terms of this general discussion about other markets, this won’t -- looking at other markets is not a Angela Kleiman era, specific pointing to that. It’s a discipline that we’ve always had. Mike’s been doing this for a very long time and I will continue that work and make sure that we are in the right place and where we can generate the highest long-term CAGR for our shareholders. And supply is definitely something that we cannot ignore, because that is a key reason of our outperformance combined with being in a center of innovation that drives demand and income growth and job growth and they’re all interrelated. And so, we’ll continue that discipline. And if we do end up venturing outside of California, we will also do it in a very thoughtful way. And they all consider our cost of capital, consider future growth and of course, the basic supply demand dynamics.
Neil Malkin: And then, I guess, the other one is on -- I don’t know, if we talked a lot about the delinquency in California. The February 23, is that for sure going to burn out? Because I know that throughout the pandemic, there have been a lot of fits and starts and lines in the sand that have been quickly erased? Is that like a firm date? It just seems like, obviously, every company is different. But people have had pretty varied opinions on how long it will take to sort of get back to pre-COVID bad debt. So I don’t know. Do you guys? Is that like a certainty? I mean, how do you think about that? And potentially did that go into any of your market rent forecasts by chance?
Barb Pak: The February 1, ‘23 date is set with LA, the city council has approved that, so that is not changing at this point. So, if a tenant is not -- has not paid current as of February 1st, we can start eviction proceedings. We do think delinquency could remain elevated in the first half of next year as we work through LA and the rest of our portfolio and getting tenants out. We are making progress, but it’s going to take time. We think the second half of the year, things trend closer to our long term average as we get the non-paying tenants out and replace them with paying tenants. And as Angela said, there could be some temporary impacts to occupancy, but we don’t expect it to have a huge impact to the market and to our results. We think the delinquency trend is favorable. The one offset to 2023 that you have to keep in mind is we don’t expect to receive emergency rental assistance next year, which we received quite a bit this year. So, that’s why we think delinquency won’t be a significant positive or a significant negative in 2023. That should be pretty much a push we think at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Heffern: Hey, everyone. Just going back to an earlier question, are you seeing any sort of elevated levels of move-outs to lost jobs, not necessarily tech specifically, but just in general?
Angela Kleiman: No, we really haven’t. What we are seeing the move out is really attributed to just normal market activities and then layer on to that, the other dynamics that I mentioned earlier.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then I heard concession stats for the Pacific Northwest and for Southern California. Can you give where things stand in Northern California?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. Northern California is sitting about a week, and that is a slight, like two days uptick from last quarter. So, it’s just not a meaningful change.
Operator: Our next question -- oh, go ahead. I’m sorry.
Angela Kleiman: That’s okay. I was just going to add that keep in mind, our Northern California portfolio is mostly suburban and San Francisco consists only about 2.5% of our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Mike or Angela, I know you guys are talking about that 2% market rent growth feeling a bit dire, but I guess how do we get comfortable with the fact that the loss-to-lease was 7% in September of this year versus a historical level of 3%. Yet you still expect the loss-to-lease to go negative in December, which would imply kind of a disproportionate slowdown here. So, how do we get comfortable with that? And then, why do we expect it to get better as we enter into early next year?
Michael Schall: Yes, I’ll start and maybe Angela will have a comment. It’s a seasonal pattern every year, and it’s not the same every year. There are variations. It’s really defined by the drop-off in demand i.e. jobs from October to December and supply continues on being delivered during that period of time. And so, that causes the seasonal slowdown. And so, it’s -- it’s lumpy and all that other stuff. And so, we are just commenting on the historical patterns. So, by the end of the year, probably loss-to-lease is zero or negative gain-to-lease. And then January hits and we start getting all the new budgets, all the new hiring, et cetera, that occurs in that first quarter, and that makes the markets recover. So, that’s how it works. It’s been like that for many years. Is there anything, Angela, specific to this year that looks different?
Angela Kleiman: No, other than that, it’s so far better than historical patterns. I don’t see anything different.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. And then just secondly, certainly congrats to you both, and I’m just curious Angela, with you moving into the CEO role, what are sort of the plans, or are you planning to elevate somebody internally to take your place to oversee operations? And how should we think about sort of the timing of that announcement?
Angela Kleiman: Well, the transition is about six months. And so, Mike is still the CEO until March 31st, and I’m going to -- I plan to enjoy every single day of that until that. As far as the team is concerned, I am not -- we are not going to make any changes to the operating team. We have a terrific team and great bench. And if you look at our company history for my first nine years as CEO, we did not have a COO. So, this is not -- we’re not doing anything unprecedented.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with SMBC.
Richard Anderson: Congratulations to both of you, Mike and Angela. Angela may be the first order of business. Can you simplify the page numbering, S-18.2? There’s an infinite number of numbers just so you know, you can make it a little simpler, all of us. But that’s just a little side note. When I think about this 2% number that we’re all talking about, if you were to go back and say in a normal time and you were to look at S-17, and you look at the supply number that you’re referencing of 0.6, and the job forecast at 0.4, and it’s a normal time, what would what would be the number. So, what’s backing into that? What would be the Fed impact that’s come to the 2% number? But, if it were more of a normal type of world, would that be 4, would that be 5, would that be 8? Could you comment on that?
Michael Schall: Hey, Rich, I just want to make sure I understand the question. So, we have this 0.4 and 0.6, and that results in a 2% rent growth, primarily because we’re mostly in the B area. Well, most of the stock on the West Coast is a B, by definition. And there’s just a huge housing shortage. It’s the backdrop behind all of this. And so, we think that we can get some rent growth. Obviously, moving into for-sale housing is people are locked into the rental renter pool in the B space. And as a result of that, we think we can get a little bit. So I think that’s -- so no matter what we think we can get about somewhere around 2%. And then we’d never, except in recessions, we always have job growth and household growth, using sort of a 2 to 1 ratio, we’ve -- it’s almost always well above the supply. So, it’s only in a in a recession scenario that that occurs. If there isn’t a recession next year, then we would expect and we’d expect the job to be much better. And that pretty quickly covers supply. And again, in other markets, you’re going to have a lot more supply, and they’re going to have the same demand issue. So on a run basis, we still think we do better. Does that answer?
Richard Anderson: Yes. Not really. The 2% is impacted by Fed action, as you described. I’m just asking, you know, what’s the factor in that 2% and what would it be if in the absence of this environment, based on the building blocks? But, if you don’t have an answer to that...
Michael Schall: Well, I’ll go back to what Angela said, then, you start with the earn-in, which is somewhere around 3.5 using the methodology that she gets to, and then you would take roughly half of the economic rent forecasts that would be based on the better scenario. So, if the supply-demand is better next year and that 2% becomes 4%, we would expect the building blocks to be 3.5 plus to -- or 5.5.
Richard Anderson: Second question is, we did some work on where all the REITs stack up relative to the entirety of their markets, not just competitive to your existing portfolio, but the entirety of the market. And you guys registered the best in my opinion, running from a rent perspective, just below the market average. I think that’s a good place to be if people trade down to a cheaper alternative. If you’re operating at the very top of the market, you could lose some people not have others coming in the front door. I assume you agree with that. And second, do you see any of that happening where people are coming from a more expensive unit, and coming to you or more Class B varietal? And that creates an extra leg of demand for you guys, as we go into this rough patch?
Michael Schall: Yes. I think Rich, you have to throw -- that is great question, by the way. I think you have to throw affordability into the mix. So incomes are, especially in the tech markets, they’re extraordinarily high. And the screening on rent to income is very low as a result of that. I mean, during the pandemic, as I said earlier, rents in Northern California about where they were pre-COVID, but the median household income has moved materially. And so, it screens very affordable. That’s not the case in Southern California. And so, I would expect to see and I don’t have any direct indication or reporting on this, but I would expect to see some doubling up and/or move moving to more affordable units, given the very large rent growth, 35%, from pre-COVID roughly, at that level. Even with some income growth, there still property is affordability pressure in Southern California, and I would definitely start to see some of those other things that happen, people move farther away, they double up, they trade down, et cetera. So, I think that’s what you’re getting at, and I totally agree with the premise. 
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to hand it back to management for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: This is Mike. Once again, I want to thank you for joining our call. We -- Angela and I both really appreciate all the congratulatory sentiment out there. Much appreciated. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in a few weeks, and have a good day. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-27 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will start with a summary of our second quarter results and then highlight the strong underlying momentum in the Essex portfolio, especially in the markets benefiting from the return-to-office programs of large tech companies and finish with a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive quarter of improving results with core FFO up 21.1% from the same quarter last year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and achieving the second best quarterly growth since the Company's IPO in 1994. Given our strong year-to-date results, we increased our guidance ranges for same-property revenues, NOI and core FFO for a third time in 2022, which Barb will discuss further in her commentary. Beginning with operating fundamentals, net effective rents for new leases are now 16% above pre-COVID levels and 20.6% higher year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2021. Job growth remains robust at 5.6% for June year-over-year, substantially outperforming the U.S. and reflecting the ongoing recovery from the massive COVID-related job losses in 2020. Page S17.1 of our earnings supplement demonstrates the surge in rents in the tech markets of Northern California and Seattle, the largest and last markets in our portfolio to fully recover from the pandemic. Net effective rents have increased between 18% and 20% year-to-date, reflecting momentum from return-to-office programs and very strong job growth. Fundamental research from our data analytics team indicates job openings at the largest technology companies have moderated recently off the very high levels throughout the pandemic, with job openings now about 15% above pre-COVID levels compared to about 77% last quarter. Unlike other industries within our markets, the tech sector was better positioned to pivot to hybrid work in response to the pandemic and accelerated hiring. As a result, labor demand for the most highly skilled workers at the large technology companies remained solid, implying job formation in excess of the number of recently announced layoffs in our markets which we highlight on page S17.2 of our earnings supplement. Given the focus on tech layoffs recently, it's relevant to note the definition of what constitutes a tech company has broadened to include businesses that have digitized a variety of analog processes and thereby represent a much broader umbrella of organizations not necessarily located in the Bay Area, including Peloton fitness offerings, Carvana's auto sales process and mortgage companies like Better.com. Likewise, the venture capital slowdown is now impacting companies across many industries and geographies, consistent with this broader scope. Conversely, it's the largest tech companies that drive employment in our North Cal and Seattle markets, and they are more insulated from capital market fluctuations, given their growth opportunities and extraordinary financial strength. Rounding out the overall employment picture in Northern California, we continue to see a recovery of jobs that were eliminated during the pandemic. COVID-related regulations were so stringent that much of the local surface economy workforce had to be fundamentally rebuilt. For example, the Essex markets added 420,000 relatively low paying jobs on a trailing three-month basis, including a 20% to 25% increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, which supports returning tech workers and their demand for services. Our commentary usually focuses on high-paying jobs but the service jobs are also important because most of their employees need to report to a physical location each day, and they support the ecosystem that creates livable and desirable communities. The strong demand for housing is supported by apartment affordability in our Northern California markets, which has improved sharply relative to long-term averages, reflecting a higher growth rate for median incomes relative to median rents. From a historical perspective, these markets screen affordable for the first time in the last decade, and rental housing is significantly more affordable versus home ownership. The value of the median-priced home in California is up about 13% year-over-year and with higher mortgage interest rates, apartments are clearly the more affordable option. We estimate that it is now over 2 times more expensive to buy than rent in the Essex markets. Affordability trends will be impacted by the apartment supply picture of moderated deliveries in the second half of 2022 and a further decline expected in 2023. Sharply lower rents in Northern California during the pandemic resulted in fewer apartment starts in 2020 and 2021 and therefore, a significant drop in new Bay Area apartment deliveries into 2023. Production levels of for-sale housing is also muted on the West Coast with only about 0.4% of existing stock being built annually and production is difficult to increase given zoning restrictions and land availability. Looking ahead, we recognize that the Federal Reserve is working to fight inflation, which often leads to a recession. Our experience indicates that no two recessions are alike, and clearly, the current situation is unique given West Coast remains in a recovery mode from the pandemic. Given this backdrop, we believe that the following factors will help moderate the impact to the West Coast rental markets in the event that economic conditions deteriorate later this year. First, large technology companies significantly accelerated hiring during the pandemic, largely because there were beneficiaries of the pandemic-driven preference for touchless interaction. Many newly hired employees were asked to work remotely until offices reopened, which is now occurring and is a key component of our recent market rent growth in Seattle and the Bay Area. Second, we have extremely tight labor markets and strong job growth on the West Coast, a significant portion of which relates to the recovery of jobs lost in the early part of the pandemic. Recovery of jobs, especially in leisure, hospitality and service sectors has been resilient and should continue for the foreseeable future. Third, the normal migration pattern from the West Coast includes workers' approaching retirement who plan to lower their cost of living and use the equity in their homes as part of their retirement plan. We believe that most of these workers left during the pandemic given California's extraordinary lockdowns, and therefore, it's likely that retirement-related migration will be muted for at least a few more years. Finally, foreign immigration was significantly slowed throughout the pandemic. In recent months, new visas for foreign workers are increasing with the large tech companies being a primary beneficiary, restoring an important source of apartment demand. Before I turn the call over to Angela, let me quickly touch on apartment investment activity. The extraordinary uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets and higher interest rates have disrupted the apartment transaction markets, resulting in fewer closings given diverging buyer and seller expectations. We are in a period of price discovery for apartment transactions and the absence of financial distress means that buyers and sellers are not forced to transact. Therefore, we expect fewer apartment transactions for the foreseeable future. It's difficult to pinpoint cap rates in this environment, although limited recent activity indicates cap rates in the high 3% range to low 4% range. We have seen an increase in apartment development activity that was decimated in the pandemic, driven by the strong rent recovery in suburban areas, which should lead to more preferred equity investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams for delivering some of our highest level of quarterly same-store revenue growth. All this while we continue to roll out our property collections operating model throughout the portfolio, great job team, and thank you. Today, I'll start with key operational highlights in our major regions, discuss rent growth expectations for the remainder of 2022 and conclude with an update on the rollout of our transformational initiatives for the operating business. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance. With strong demand fundamentals and modest supply described by Mike earlier, we maximize revenues by favoring rent growth rather than occupancy. This resulted in same-property revenue growth of 12.7% on a year-over-year basis and a 4.8% on a sequential basis, which are some of the highest growth rates achieved in the Company's history. As we head into August, so far, we are experiencing a normal leasing season with June and July loss to lease for the same-store portfolio at 9.7% and 10.3%, respectively. Turning to regional highlights, starting with our Washington portfolio. This region generated a 20.7% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter, which was led by Eastside Seattle, where the majority of our portfolio is located. Seattle continues to benefit from strong job growth, which is driving leasing momentum. Our Seattle portfolio is well positioned and 9.7% loss to lease as of July. On to Northern California. This region generated 17.5% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter, which was led by Santa Clara County at 24%, primarily driven by the robust demand from large tech employers in Silicon Valley. Northern California has demonstrated some of the strongest job growth this year. And despite the negative headlines on tech startups, we are not experiencing any softness in rent growth in July or in our third quarter renewals. We expect positive momentum to continue for Northern California with demand from return to office, which may be further accelerated by incremental job growth throughout the second half of the year. Loss to lease in this region continues to pick up and is 8.7% in July. Moving on to Southern California, which has been a strong performer with 22.4% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter. Healthy job growth has continued to drive incremental demand in Southern California, which is built upon the significant rent growth achieved last year and resulted in our highest level of loss to lease at 12.1% in July. Turning to our expectations for the remainder of 2022. As you may recall, we had anticipated a deceleration in market rent growth in the second half of the year because of tougher year-over-year comps. As expected, we are seeing this deceleration show up on our new lease spreads on page S16. However, as demonstrated by our current performance and the increase to same-property growth expectations for the year, our fundamentals remain strong. It is with this backdrop that we continue to advance our company-wide implementation of our property collections operating model. By way of background, we have been transitioning from a dedicated team for each property to teams that cover a collection of around 9 to 12 properties thereby transforming our business from a property centric to a customer-centric operating model. As we have rolled out, this model to our other regions, we've been able to replicate the improvements in cross-selling from 15% to 23% achieved at the first asset collection that was rolled out last year in San Diego. This demonstrates our sales team's ability to sell effectively across multiple properties, reducing customer acquisition costs and improving overall sales efficiency. Lastly, we have been making good progress codeveloping proprietary applications with partners from the RET Ventures such as Funnel, to enhance our technology platform. We execute approximately 60,000 transactions a year, including move-in, move-out and renewals, and we are focused on automating all manual tasks. Following full deployment of the Funnel suite in late 2023, we anticipate this investment will be an important factor in the 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement we expect to achieve over the next few years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a brief overview of our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. We are pleased to report we achieved core FFO per share of $3.68 in the second quarter. The results exceeded the high end of our updated guidance range published in June. Of the $0.10 beat to the midpoint, $0.03 relates to better-than-expected revenues in June and $0.06 relates to lower property taxes, primarily from a combination of lower assessed values and millage rates at our Washington properties. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.29 to $14.45. The revised midpoint equates to 15.7% year-over-year growth. The increase to our midpoint is primarily driven by better-than-expected operating fundamentals and an improved outlook on delinquency. As such, we are raising the midpoint of same-property revenue growth by 70 basis points to 10.3% and NOI growth by 140 basis points to 13.5%. In addition, our full year guidance assumes a reduction in expense growth from 4% to 3.3% at the midpoint. Turning to delinquency. We are encouraged by the continued improvements we are seeing in our delinquency. For the quarter, net delinquency was 60 basis points of scheduled rents, a significant reduction from the first quarter. This was a result of many efforts by our operations team, which led to a 20% reduction in gross delinquency as compared to the first quarter. In addition, we received a higher level of government reimbursement in the second quarter. Also worth noting, in late June, there were a couple of key events that are positive for the future. First, the State of California allocated an additional $1.9 billion in emergency rental assistance for existing applications after exhausting its initial $5 billion allocation. This gives us more visibility on the remaining funds to be allocated, especially as it relates to our $34 million in outstanding applications. Second, on July 1st, a California state law expired, which provides landlords additional rates to recapture delinquent units. Thus, outside of L.A. and Alameda counties where eviction protections remain in place, we would expect to see a gradual improvement in gross delinquencies over the coming quarters. Moving to our stock buyback and investment goals. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $61 million of common stock at a significant discount to our internal NAV, using free cash flow and excess proceeds from year-to-date transactions. As for our investment goals this year, we have a strong pipeline of accretive preferred equity deals and remain on track to achieve our goal of $50 million to $150 million of new commitments. However, given the rapidly changing interest rate environment and the sharp increase in our cost of capital relative to cap rates in our markets, we are reducing our acquisition goals, which are outlined in the earnings release to focus on share repurchases instead. This is consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, whereby we will shift capital to what the best use is, given changing market dynamics. Lastly, I want to conclude my prepared remarks by highlighting the strength of the balance sheet. Over the past year, we have seen a continued reduction in leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improving from 6.6 times at the depths of the pandemic to 5.8 times today. We are rapidly approaching our historical low for this ratio and believe we will see continued improvements in this metric over the next few quarters through growth in EBITDA. As it relates to upcoming capital needs, we are in an advantageous position. Our existing cash flow from operations covers our current dividend, all capital expenditures and development funding needs. As such, our only known funding needs relate to debt maturities, which are minimal, given we proactively took advantage of the low interest rate environment over the last few years to further strengthen the balance sheet. As a result, we have only $300 million in debt maturing in mid-2023 and $400 million maturing in mid-2024. This equates to less than 6% of our debt maturing annually for the next 2.5 years. And while interest rates have increased on new debt, capital markets remain open, and we have access to a variety of secured and unsecured debt sources. This affords us strong financial flexibility, which will enable us to be opportunistic as it relates to these upcoming maturities. With over $1.3 billion in liquidity, we are well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America.
Jeffrey Spector: My first question is focused on hybrid working. Mike, you said early on that return to work, but more hybrid working would benefit the company, and clearly, it is. I guess, what are some of the latest comments you're hearing or what are you hearing from the tech firms in your market on hybrid-verse at this point thinking about going remote fully? Obviously, there's article out today about one company going remote. Like, what are you hearing in your markets?
Michael Schall: Hey Jeff, that's a great question. Thank you. I think what we're hearing is everyone is now pretty much committed to hybrid working model, and they're trying to figure out what that means and some of the issues are being confronted that I think are embedded in that. So, I think that everyone's having trouble and I would include us in that in this case. People like hybrid, the hybrid model, and they want to stick with a hybrid model. And so, now, it's up to the companies to try to figure out what they need to do to modify their offices to accommodate that model. And notably, Amazon paused some of the work they're doing in Bellevue to take another look at the office format. And so, I think you're going to see more of that activity going forward.
Jeffrey Spector: Okay. And then I appreciate the charts on -- the more detailed charts in the sup on tech openings, open positions, I should say, in your markets. How do you track this data?
Michael Schall: We have a data analytics team that's run by Paul Morgan. And so, they scrape that data off the various websites and then categorize it by what's in our markets versus other parts of the U.S. And we've been doing this for, I would say, the better part of 10 years now. And so, it definitely tells the story. So, our data analytics team basically is responsible for that data.
Jeffrey Spector: Okay. Thanks. Can I just ask, can you say which markets you're seeing the most openings versus, I guess, ones towards the bottom?
Michael Schall: We are seeing -- the tech markets are continuing to lead in terms of those openings, so. And that is not surprising. I think, some of the details in those top 10 techs. I think it's interesting that both Google or Alphabet and Apple have hit a new high in job openings, believe it or not, even though made the broader comment that of the top 10 tech companies, they're off a little bit from their high. But still, the number of jobs they have open is pretty extraordinary, given the backdrop of what we've seen over the last several years. So, we're seeing a lot of strength there ongoing and almost as if all this economic turbulence wasn't such a big deal.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: Maybe just on capital allocation. You talked about the share repurchases. So curious, just given the transaction market and how historically you've sold assets to fund share repurchases, kind of the appetite today and how you think about funding additional buybacks?
Barb Pak: Hi Nick, it's Barb. Yes, that has been our strategy historically. In the second quarter, we did have excess cash flow, so we used that to buy back the stock. Going forward though, we would look to sell assets to buy back the stock. So, we could do that. We would like -- if we have an asset in contract, we might buy it back a little earlier than the sale. But for the most part, we're going to maintain our disciplined approach to match funding any future buyback going forward.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then, maybe just on operations in terms of the blended rent growth that decelerated a bit in July from the second quarter. I'm wondering how you kind of marry that with the strength in the chart on Northern California and Seattle and the acceleration of the rent growth that you're seeing there, just the interplay between the two.
Angela Kleiman: Yes. Hi. It’s Angela here. That's a good question. What we are expecting is the normal seasonality to play out. Having said that, we do have headwinds from tougher year-over-year comps that I described earlier. And just to give you a little more color, last year, in the first half, our blended lease rates was negative, was negative 4%, but in the second half, it surged to about 13.25%. [Ph] So, that's the tough year-over-year comp. And what we're seeing is with the strength in Northern California is that it's a key reason for the shift of expecting So Cal to outperform in the first half. And now in the second half, we're expecting Seattle and North Cal to lead our growth going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.
Chandni Luthra: Could you talk about your tenant composition a little bit, please? What portion of your tenants, what mix is employed by big tech versus, say, other industries? And how has that composition changed during the pandemic or more recently?
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike, and that's another great question. Thank you. We have a variety of price points in our portfolio. So, we cover, I'd say, from the B minus to the A plus category. And therefore, our tenant base is a reflection of the broader economy. And so, unless we have a few buildings that are adjacent, very close to the tech companies where we could have 90-plus percent of the tenants working in the tech industry, for the most part, we're much broader than that. And again, we reflect the broader economy, which includes policemen, firemen, teachers, all the hospitality and restaurant workers, et cetera. And it has not changed a lot. Yes.
Chandni Luthra: And then, as we think about 2023, some of your peers today talked about embedded rent growth. Could you perhaps give us more color in terms of -- given the rent roll that's already priced in right now, how should we think about the earn-in going into 2023?
Angela Kleiman: Hi. It’s Angela here. Another good question. And the embedded earnings for 2023 is really going to be a function of the seasonality curve. And at this point, we are -- we have one of the strongest loss to lease in the Company's history at 10.3%, and it continues to grow because we have not yet peaked. And you add to that the tailwind from the job growth and modest supply, we feel good about our position. But to try to speculate at this point is probably not going to be all that helpful because third quarter is when we tend to have the most transactions, and so it's the most active quarter. And so, once we see how that plays out, we'll be able to provide better visibility to the actual shape of that seasonal curve. And so, it's -- so we plan to have a more in-depth discussion on that topic on our October call.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski: Just one question for me. Adam, I'm curious to get your thoughts on the level of distress you're seeing in the broader preferred equity and mezzanine lending markets on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most dislocated, where are we on that barometer today?
Adam Berry: Hey John. I would put us at a 1. We're seeing very little distress on the pref side. We are seeing some opportunities where bridge lenders were able to loan on deals that are in lease-up. We've seen a definite pullback in that. So, we're seeing opportunities for us to come in, in those types of cases, but no, very -- I'd say no distress at this point.
John Pawlowski: And to be clear, I'm not talking about your specific book, but just in terms of the broader market, deals that are coming your way. So, other people being in distress, not Essex.
Adam Berry: Understood. Yes. No, it’s same answer. We're not seeing any...
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for your time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.
Steve Sakwa: I was wondering if you could talk about the renewals that you're sending out, I guess, at this point for August or what you sent out for August, September and perhaps October. And can you talk about what's embedded in the full year guidance for the second half in terms of overall blended spreads? Thank you.
Angela Kleiman: Sure. Happy to. It’s Angela here. I'll talk about renewals, and I'll turn it over to Barb to talk about guidance. In terms of our third quarter renewals, we're coming in at close to 10%. And it's a pretty tight band within all our key markets, Seattle leading the pack around 11; Northern California in the 10 range; and of course, Southern California close to 9.
Barb Pak: And then, Steve, as it relates to guidance, as what Angela said earlier, the first half of the year, we had much easier comps, but given the surge in rents we saw last year, we have much more difficult comps in the second half of the year, which on new leases, we're assuming in the second half of the year 7% new lease growth, it was 15% in the first half of the year, so a significant reduction just because of the comp issue.
Steve Sakwa: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just in terms of the bad debt, I know this is bouncing around quite a bit based on what you're getting back from the government. And it sounds like you might get a little bit more in the second half, but how would you sort of think the second half shapes up in terms of the bad debt figure?
Barb Pak: Yes. So, our revised guidance assumes 1.5% for the full year as a percent of our schedule rent. That's how we've been talking about it since the start of the pandemic. And that -- we assume the first half and the second half are about the same now. Previously, we had assumed a worse second half, but now we've pulled that up now. And that's really a function of the $1.9 billion in new emergency rental assistance that the states allocated. It does give us more visibility on continued emergency rental assistance in the back half of the year that we were uncertain about going into this quarter. And then, the other thing is we do have -- we have seen improvements in our gross delinquency. They have started to come down. In June, they fell; July, they fell. And so, we do expect a continued moderation in the gross delinquency line, which gets us to the improved outlook on delinquency in the back half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One.
Neil Malkin: First question, I guess, capital allocation or external growth kind of thought here. But you don't really have a land bank development pipeline anymore. I think your last one finished leasing up this quarter. Just curious as your plans, what you see maybe through the end of the year for potential growth given that -- I mean, really, you've been mainly an acquirer. So, what are your priorities? I know you talked about share repurchases, but JVs an option? Are you looking at -- again, just dispositions to fund all those things? And how do you plan on sourcing growth just outside of the organic picture over the next several quarters?
Adam Berry: Hi Neil, this is Adam. So, there was a lot to that question, but just kind of starting at the beginning. Historically, we haven't really been a land banking shop. We tend to -- when we develop, we tend to go after shovel-ready deals. We do have a couple of pre-entitlement deals that are in the pipeline and potentially would build further out. Other than that, though, we've seen the most opportunity in our prep book and especially more recently, we've seen quite a bit of opportunity. As for as acquisitions, we're always in the market, but highly dependent on where our cost of capital is and matching funds. We will -- we have seen some opportunities on the development side where we can joint venture and usually couple that with a preferred equity piece as well. And so, we're highly focused on turning those over as well. So, lots of potential, but on the development side, on the direct development side today, we're seeing cap rates probably in the mid-4s. And to us, that's just not -- that's not enough spread to adjust for the risk associated with costs and the other challenges associated with development.
Neil Malkin: Yes. Okay. Thanks for that. And then for Angela, you guys have more recently started talking about the -- at least externally, the sort of operating enhancements, operating model expense types of enhancements, about podding and being more efficient, increasing the resident experience. I just wonder if you could maybe kind of put that in perspective. Talk about that a little bit more. And then specifically, on wage pressure you're seeing, just given the high cost of living there. And then, you talked about like again, improving resident experience by potentially having units that have no people on site. And I guess, how does that improve experience if there's no one there to help, particularly with sort of like potential issues, lacks DAs, et cetera, things like that. So, if you can just walk through all those, that would be great.
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. So, you brought up a couple of points. I'll try to hit all of them. So, if I miss anything, please chime in. So, in terms of wage pressure, I mean, we're experiencing that just like everybody else. However, I think you can see from our controllable expenses, especially in the admin line item, we've been able to find offsets and so have been able to manage through that. And it's primarily because of how we have transformed our operating business model to this, I think you call -- collection because that's improved inefficiency. So ultimately, what remains is allowing our people to take less time to get the test that they used to do. From a customer perspective, though, first of all, we've been contactless since COVID. So, it's effectively no change for them in how they interact with us. But as far as availability is concerned, we have -- although the office is not open, we do have by appointments available and of customers that access [Technical Difficulty] however, if they want, they can reach us via different, whether it's online or 800 number, they can make an appointment [Technical Difficulty] and every asset collection has a hub [Technical Difficulty]. So, sometimes it's an immediate thing, they will get into a car and drive to a hub nearby. And so, once again, that has not been an issue either. And when we look at our customer satisfaction, so they actually have been feeling better than pre-COVID.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Yes. So basically, it sounds like just given the proximity of the pods, a maintenance issue, power, I don't know, leak issue, payment, whatever, amenity issue could be a few-minute drive away is essentially what you're saying?
Angela Kleiman: Well, let me just clarify something. The maintenance team is on site. And so, they are responding timely to any customer service request.
Neil Malkin: Okay. I'm sorry. Yes, I guess, I was just confused, because a lot of other peers have mentioned like peopleless buildings in terms of like servicing. But I guess, that doesn't apply to maintenance is what you're saying?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. So, what we're talking about is administration, bookkeeping, those type of activities, but the maintenance is separate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter. So, I'm going to go back to Angela on the earning question. I understand you want to keep that maybe tight to the vest. But if you're providing guidance, you're implying you have some guidance about the third quarter in terms of leasing activity. So that would suggest, while you don't know what's going to happen, then you would have an assumption of what's going to happen again. And based on that assumption, do you -- would you admit that you have in an earn-in number in mind, but you just don't want to -- you think it's just premature to share? Is that a fair statement?
Angela Kleiman: Well, it's a little bit more to it than that. I mean, it's speculative, right? Because right now, what we're saying is with 10.3% loss lease, that's higher than our typical loss lease in the past. Now normal seasonality means that that loss lease will start to decline over time. What I don't know and that's an honest statement, I don't know the rate of that decline or the steepness of that curve. All I can point to is from what we're seeing right now, the curve looks good. Having said that, there is the broad economy out there, and we will need to see how that plays out to have a better sense.
Michael Schall: Hey Rich, I’ll have my blue mood ring now. I just want to point that out. But one additional comment is I think what Angela is saying is seasonality implies that rents peak in July. We don't know if rents are going to peak in July. And so that inflection point, once we see that inflection point, we have better visibility going forward about what's going to happen for the rest of the year. So again, it's really a key time in terms of trying to determine where this is going to go, potentially, rents could keep going up or it could follow the normal seasonality, and we reach a peak in July and we start going downhill for the rest of the year. You're right. Barb has built in an assumption into the guidance. Barb, do you want to just comment on that, just to reiterate it?
Barb Pak: Like I said earlier, we do assume rent growth year-over-year moderates in the second half of the year because of the more difficult comps. And as Angela mentioned, we've assumed a normal seasonal curve. So, we will peak at the end of July, like Mike said. So, that is what's built into the guidance. But we do feel good about the tailwinds that are in front of us or behind us from where we are today.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. And then the second question is looking at, let's say, S-16, I believe, or maybe not S-17, rent growth forecast. Last quarter, Northern California was the leader. All markets, regions have grown, but Northern California by a lesser amount than the others. Now, in the second quarter, actually the laggard, once the leader, even though 10.5% is nothing to sneeze at. So, I'm just curious, you talked about tech layoffs that everyone's talking about. Is that intermingled in this forecast where Southern California and Seattle have leaped Northern California, again, all growing? So, I'm not really -- I don't mean to throw cold water on it, but Northern California is no longer the leader.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks for acknowledging that these are pretty darn strong numbers across the board. But just to give you a little more background, these -- the revised forecast is really a reflection of how we performed in the first half. And because the first half was so strong in Southern California and in Seattle, that's the driver to the change in order. So, when we look at the second half, so the second half of, say, about 7% for the portfolio, we are seeing that Seattle and Northern California will be the path in the second.
Rich Anderson: Southern California, right? Seattle and Southern California?
Angela Kleiman: No, no, Seattle and Northern California in the second half.
Rich Anderson: Oh, I see. I see what you're saying. Okay.
Angela Kleiman: Yes. So, that 11.1% [ph] is 15% in the first half, which is big, and that's driven by So Cal and Seattle and 7% approximately in the second half, and that 7% average will be driven by Northern California and Seattle higher than 7%. And of course, Southern California lower than 7%. It's average.
Michael Schall: And maybe one other final piece, Rich, and that is that Oakland is obviously lagging in the Northern California recovery as well. Oakland has -- Downtown Oakland has been slow to recover, and it's got quite a bit of development deliveries that are coming there and that's the part that's holding them back.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler.
Connor Mitchell: Just a couple on back rents. So first, how much of the back rents do you guys anticipate receiving from the government or California programs and then, how much do you think you'll have to go directly to the tenants to collect? I know you guys discussed a little bit about the additional government funds to be allocated. So, I was wondering about how much more to go to the tenants to collect?
Barb Pak: Hi. This is Barb. We have $34 million in open applications right now and then of our $78 million in cumulative delinquency. So, that's how you would compare those two, of which -- so the $34 million, we've assumed some of that will occur this year. We don't know how quickly they're going to disperse those funds. We've assumed about 50% of that we get this year in our guidance. It's not all same-store though, either. So keep that in mind. That's total for the whole portfolio. And then, the other piece that we have to go after the tenants, we will -- we already started that process. We have various means we can do to -- their credit, or doing their credit, go after them in small claims court in order to try to recoup our back rent, and we're actively doing what we can and abiding by the laws, obviously. And LA Alameda is where we're probably the most restricted, but outside of that, we have a lot of -- a lot more ability to go after the tenants.
Connor Mitchell: And then just a follow-up on that. What percent of the residents that owe the back rents are no longer within the Essex properties versus tenants that are paying current, but still owe past rents?
Barb Pak: Yes. No, that's a good question. I think it's roughly 50-50 at this point. The $34 million in open applications does relate -- bulk of that relates to our current residents. Very little of that is for past due -- or past residents.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: I'm not sure if you track this or not, but do you track move-outs because of job loss? And has there been any sort of change in that statistic, if you do?
Michael Schall: We do track new jobs or job transfers but not job losses exactly per se. And that number, new job or job transfer is roughly 15.7% in our portfolio versus, let's say -- which is down a little bit from the last couple of months. We don’t actually track how many job losses -- how many of these people actually lost their job, we just track jobs in general.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. It was worth a shot. And then, I guess, on the other side, on the move-in data, has there been data that suggests that tech workers coming back or indeed what's driving a lot of this demand?
Michael Schall: Not just tech workers, certainly, tech workers and the return-to-office people. But more broadly, we've mentioned in the script that there are awful lot of hospitality, leisure jobs and all the service jobs that are coming back as we fundamentally rebuilt when California shut everything down and many of them left the state. So, it's really both components. And again, our portfolio is not comprised mostly of tech workers. It is a -- it's intended to be a broad overview of the broader economy. So, we don't target tech workers per se.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Angela, you highlighted the strength in the loss to lease being above that 10% mark and that market rents are still growing at this point. But the portfolio has seen new lease rates decelerate much more quickly than some of your peers. And I certainly understand the difficult comps piece and some of the cross currents in the economy that are kind of blurring the next couple of months, perhaps. But, I'm really trying to understand with that backdrop of strong job growth, growing market rents still through July and the healthy loss to lease in place, why do we get to 7% new lease rate growth versus the 14%, I think you achieved in July for the back half of the year. Can you just put some additional detail in there, please?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, happy to. I think -- we try to provide a baseline. And so we don't tend to say, forecasting recession or excessive growth, for example. Now, I do want to point you to the backdrop of the second half of last year. We grew -- our blended lease rates was 13.25%. And so, the new lease rates were much higher. And so, it truly is a function of a tougher year-over-year comp. And to your point, is it possible that we perform better because of the fundamentals? Certainly, that's on the table.
Austin Wurschmidt: And what percent of the rent roll has been addressed, or what percent do you have strong visibility into at this point for the year?
Michael Schall: Certainly, the renewal side. We have good visibility on. It's going to be somewhere in the high-single-digit range. It's the new lease rate that we don't know, obviously, given all the turmoil in the financial markets, et cetera. So, again, as I think Angela mentioned earlier, so far, we're following a normal seasonal pattern. But typically, that changes -- the weaker portion of the year begins in July and through the end of the year. We just don't know what that inflection point is going to look like or when we're going to attain it. And so, it's a little bit difficult for us to predict the rest of the year given that we don't know where that peak in rents this year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Sure. No, I get -- I was more interested in if 75% of the leases have been addressed either signed or committed to at this point or 85%, whatever that number is. Anyway, maybe Mike, on capital allocation, admittedly, the headlines haven't helped you guys given your footprint. But you guys have certainly executed three guidance increases through the year. And you stepped in and bought back stock as you historically have when you trade at a wide enough discount to NAV. But I guess if the market isn't willing to ascribe the value that you see in the portfolio versus the private market aside from just selling assets and buying back a higher volume of shares, are there any other steps that you and the Board are discussing or looking to further close that value gap?
Michael Schall: Well, I don't think so. I mean broader strategic issues are not things that you would implement quickly, there thoughtful processes and just try to work through things. I think this is more tactical. We don't know what's going to happen in the broader economy going forward, and that point was very well made by the investors at NAREIT certainly recently. So, given that backdrop, we're going to continue to lean toward a relatively conservative approach to capital allocation, and that's the one that Barb was outlining before and Adam too. And maybe what I would add to what Adam said that trying to focus on the preferred equity book will be something that we're focused on the remainder of the year. But, in terms of broader choices when you look at where the stock price is trading and we do our own fundamental research on the value of the company on a per share basis. And when you look at those numbers, it's not a time that we would be aggressively growing the Company, let's say, just because the pieces are not as compelling as they have been certainly at different points of time. So, I think it's the time to just execute, you take what the market gives us and make thoughtful decisions, and that's what we've done. That's what we're going to continue to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: I think just a quick 1 for me. I think you gave some kind of good color on kind of where you see cap rates kind of high 3% or low 4% range. Wondering, I guess, kind of how much wider is that -- or how much has that kind of changed from maybe the all-time tights that you saw, be it 3, 6 months ago? And then, you also kind of mentioned about price discovery, right? And so, kind of wondering what is that gap now, I guess, that bid-ask spread, right, or that gap kind of between that's kind of causing kind of price discovery rate, causing limited transactions at this point?
Adam Berry: Yes. Hi Adam, this is Adam. To go -- cover the back half of the question first. So, transaction volume has actually been fairly consistent. Over the recent probably month to six weeks is where we've seen things slow down a little bit. So, we've seen some deals drop out of the market, and we have seen that bid-ask spread. Depending on the market, depending on vintage, I'd say for our core, core plus within our kind of core markets, there's probably a 25 to 50 basis-point bid-ask spread between what sellers are looking and buyers are willing. But again, that's not to be said that deals aren't happening because there are still transactions occurring in the market. Can you restate the first part of the question?
Adam Kramer: Yes. Just kind of how much wider that high-3% to low-4% range for cap rates -- how much wider is that kind of maybe the all-time tights of 3 to 6 months ago.
Adam Berry: Yes. So yes, we don't know where cap rates are going. But based on today -- what we're seeing today, we're seeing them in that kind of high-3s to low-4s. I might be...
Michael Schall: That's roughly 50 basis points higher than what we talked about...
Adam Berry: Yes. They were in -- okay, yes. So, they're in the mid-3s, what we talked about a few quarters ago. So yes, I would say 50 basis points is probably on average.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Yes. Thank you, operator. We would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We feel good about our results, and we feel like we may have a little bit of wind to our back. So, that's obviously great to see. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the near future. Thank you, and good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-27 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall : Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.  Today, I will comment on our first quarter results recent housing demand and supply trends and a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive quarter of improving core FFO per share and same-store revenue growth with this quarter's core FFO exceeding our guidance midpoint by $0.07 per share. As mentioned in our earnings release, our results and rent growth trajectory support an increase in core FFO and same-property revenue guidance for the year, which Barb will review shortly. Overall, rents have continued to improve. And as of April 2022, net effective rents in the Essex markets are now 11.4% above pre-COVID rent levels and up 22% compared to one year ago. All of our markets have positive sequential rent growth with Northern California leading the portfolio, improving sequentially by approximately 3% in each month of the first quarter. We expect further improvement in Northern California as progress is made on return to office programs for the large technology companies following several COVID-related delays. The top tech companies also continue to hire rapidly in the Essex markets with over 50,000 job openings posted for California and Washington, a 79% increase compared to March of 2020. Other indicators, including job growth, venture capital deployment and office investment continue to support our thesis that Northern California will remain the epicenter of the technology industries. A significant recent example came from Google, which announced a plan to invest more than $3.5 billion on additional office and data centers in Mountain View, Downtown San Jose and elsewhere across the Bay Area. The easing of COVID-related regulation has been pivotal for return to office in our markets. mask mandates have been significantly relaxed versus prior quarters making it easier to bring employees back to the office. Business travel, in-person meetings, property tours and conferences have resumed, and we look forward to in-person investor meetings once again. As COVID-related regulations continue to subside on the West Coast, the deadline to apply for rental relief in California has now passed as of April 1. The Government-sponsored rental relief has been a double-edged sword for California apartment owners as tenants were often encouraged to see government rental relief programs rather than paying rent. Delays in government reimbursements led to the highest delinquency since the onset of the pandemic, with the rental relief program now closed to new applications in California, we are now cautiously optimistic that underlying delinquency trends will improve. California's rental assistance program remains far behind with respect to payments providing potential upside as we continue pursuing the approximately $76 million of rent owed to the company. Given the extraordinary government restrictions during the pandemic, it became clear that our portfolio would need to achieve 2 inflection points before we could be confident that a full recovery was underway. The first was the reopening of our markets, which occurred in July of 2021 and the second was a return to office for the largest technology companies. Over the past 2 months, we've seen Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple all begin to reopen and restaff their offices. Our leasing specialists are reporting more applicants returning from out-of-state as hybrid and similar arrangements require regular office attendance for employees. Return to office mandates are generating economic activities, which is apparent in the job growth reports with San Francisco leading our portfolio with 8.9% trailing 3-month job growth. On average, the Essex markets reported job growth of 6.7% on a trailing 3-month basis versus the broader U.S. average of 4.7% and marking the second consecutive quarter that Essex markets have outpaced the nation in job growth. We expect this outperformance will continue as Essex has still only recovered 83% of the jobs compared to pre-covid levels versus the U.S. recovery of 95%.  We expect service and hospitality-related jobs to continue a strong growth trajectory supported by increased travel generally and demand for services from the well-paid workforce on the West Coast. The confluence of increasing job growth, a lower unemployment rate of 3.6% in the Essex markets and expensive for sale housing all contribute to favorable rental housing tailwinds. Turning to housing supply. The ability to ramp up housing production is more challenging along the West Coast as a result of long entitlement processes, burdensome regulations labor shortages and inflating construction cost. As a result, housing permits in Essex markets remain at levels roughly consistent with our long-term averages. Our bottoms-up supply analysis indicates that new deliveries will moderate for the rest of 2022, and we are also expecting a 15% decline in apartment supply in 2023 and which includes a 54% reduction in new supply expected in Northern California. All of our markets remain on the lower end of the supply growth spectrum versus other U.S. metros. Turning to the apartment investment markets. Geopolitical events, turbulent financial market conditions and high levels of inflation create uncertainty, which may become a headwind for transactions. However, cap rates generally don't move quickly and are mostly a function of investor demand for property. As to the West Coast specifically, strong evidence of recovering apartment market conditions, higher inflationary growth expectations and significant capital pursuing apartments appear to have mostly offset the impact of higher interest cost keeping cap rates unchanged at this point. Our review of cap rates for recent apartment transactions across the Essex markets indicate most institutional quality assets trading in the mid-3% range for stabilized properties with little deviation across markets, building class and location. We will continue to be selective with our capital allocation strategy, focusing on deals that have the best growth potential and generate accretion to our financial benchmarks. In closing, I'd like to briefly highlight the importance of ESG and its impact on the company. As a leading provider of housing along the West Coast, we know that our company has a responsibility to operate in an environmentally conscious way Consistent with that thesis, we recently released our TCFD report, which is the first step toward alignment with proposed SEC reporting requirements. Last week, we announced that Essex will co-anchor an ESG housing Impact Fund managed by RET Ventures. Finally, we are also pleased to announce the upcoming publication of our fourth CSR report which should be available in early May.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman : Thanks, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams. As we have implemented new systems and structures to optimize our operations, our team has taken on these challenges in stride and continues to demonstrate exceptional work ethic and dedication to our company's success. In today's comments, I'll begin with key operational highlights on our major regions, including our outlook for 2022 rent growth and conclude with an update on the rollout of our property collections operating model. We are pleased with our first quarter operating results, especially in delivering a 6.5% same-property revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. This is primarily driven by increases in scheduled rents and improvements in concessions detailed on Page 2 of our press release. The first quarter performance exceeded our expectations and included some of our strongest leasing spreads reported in the company's history, with net effective new leases up 20% and renewals up 11.7% compared to the same period last year. Average concessions for the portfolio continues to remain minimal with April loss to lease for the same-store portfolio at 9.5%. We are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. Here are the key operational highlights from north to south. Beginning with our Washington portfolio. Rents in the Pacific Northwest had a strong start to the year, improving sequentially each month since December.  In addition, we successfully decreased concession in downtown Seattle throughout the quarter. Our supply forecast reflects a modest rate in deliveries throughout 2022, and the Seattle job market remained strong with March average trailing 3-month growth rate of 6.1%. Moving forward, we anticipate steady performance from our Seattle region with a loss to lease in April of 7.7%. On to Northern California. As Mike mentioned earlier, rents in this region are being lifted by the return to office of large tech companies and a solid rebound in job growth. After a typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, construction usage in San Francisco and San Jose declined throughout the first quarter, leading to a steady improvement in net effective rents. Looking ahead, we expect the supply picture to remain steady for the rest of the year and on the demand side, job growth is accelerating with March average trailing 3 months growth rate of 6.7%. As Northern California is in its early stages of recovery, we are seeing a steady increase to loss to lease, which stands at 5.1% in April, and we continue to expect this region to lead our market rent growth in 2022. Turning to Southern California, which has been our best-performing market throughout the pandemic, we continue to be confident about Southern California as rents did not experience the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter and have continued to improve each month in the first quarter. Concessions have been below one week for almost a year. Turnover in Southern California remains at the lowest level relative to the rest of our markets, demonstrating continued strength and stability of this region. For 2022, we have forecasted a modest increase in supply delivery and anticipate concessions may temporarily elevate in areas near those development lease-ups. On the demand side, Southern California was our top-performing region with March average trailing 3-month job growth of 7.9%.  Furthermore, our April loss to lease of 14% will provide a tailwind to revenues into 2023. It is with the strong fundamental backdrop that Essex continues to make progress in advancing our property collections operating model. We discussed on previous earnings calls on how we successfully improved efficiency last year in San Diego and Orange County by operating closely located properties as a single unified business. The benefits of this operating model includes enhancing our customer service through virtual on-demand experience, creating more career advanced opportunities for associates through specialization and ultimately generating a 10% to 15% reduction in administrative staffing needs through natural attrition, which is also mitigating the inflationary pressures we are experiencing today. Historically, Essex has operated with an employee to unit ratio of 40:1. Today, we are at 43:1, and our target by the end of 2022 is 45:1. At this point, we have completed the Wola of Southern California and expect company-wide implementation by year-end. In addition, we have ongoing digital platform improvements rolling out over the next few years. As such, we have yet to fully optimize our business, and we anticipate further benefits in 2023 and thereafter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on co-investment activity and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded our expectations. The favorable outcome was due to strong operating results and higher co-investment income. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.25 per share to $13.95. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, we are raising the midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 85 basis points to 8.6% on a cash basis. This is driven by our solid first quarter operating results and an improvement in our net delinquency expectations for the year. Our revised guidance now assumes net delinquency of 1.9% of scheduled rent as compared to our original guidance of 2.4% at the midpoint. As Mike mentioned, the deadline for applying for federal tenant relief passed on April 1. We believe this has led to an improvement in our residents paying current, while at the same time, we have also seen an increase in emergency rental assistance over the past 2 months. As such, our April net delinquencies were 20 basis points of scheduled rent which is below our historical average of 35 basis points. While this is encouraging, underlying gross delinquencies were about 5% in April and thus, we still need to make progress before we can confidently put COVID-related delinquencies behind us.  A second factor in our improved core FFO guidance range relates to preferred equity investment as we are now expecting approximately $250 million of redemptions compared to our initial midpoint of $350 million. The reduction in redemptions relates to 3 investments that we now anticipate being paid off in 2023. Turning to our co-investment platform. We recently monetized the promote income within 2 ventures unlocking embedded value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we amended our WESCO joint venture, realizing $17 million of promote income, which was paid in cash. The venture generated a 16% IRR for Essex shareholders. Subsequent to quarter end, we amended our WESCO 4 joint venture earning $37 million of promote income, which was elected to reinvest back into the venture and increase our ownership to 65%. This venture achieved a 22% IRR. These 2 transactions are expected to create over $2 million in additional core FFO on an annual basis. Overall, our private equity platform continues to create value for our investors and remains an important alternative source of capital.  Finally, turning to the balance sheet. In the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 6.1x compared to 6.6x at the depth of the pandemic. we expect this ratio will continue to improve throughout 2022, driven by stronger operating results. with over $1 billion of liquidity, limited near-term funding needs and multiple sources of capital available to us, we remain in a strong financial position. That concludes my prepared remarks.  And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: Hopefully, it's a relatively straightforward one. But given the really impressive new and renewal growth that you're putting up right now. I'm hoping you can disclose for us what the earn-in for 2023 is right now?
Angela Kleiman: Rich, it's Angela. I would love to be able to give you the earning for 2023, but it's one barbelkilme. And two, it's just too early. I think you can see that our fundamentals are solid, and we're doing quite well.
Rich Hill: Okay. I'd figure that try. So maybe just one follow-up question I don't know, some of your peers talk about it. So I know it's not the ESS way, but I figured I'd give it a go. So we did noticed that your occupancy dipped a little bit in April, I'm wondering if you can just walk us through if that was intentional pushing rates into the peak leasing season and how you think that might trend given turnover that feels pretty low?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. That's a good question, Rich. And you've seen us do this, which is when we see market strength, we would change our strategy from favoring occupancy to pushing rents, especially when we see -- when we are anticipating more market strength coming ahead of us. So it is very much intentional. And you'll see that when we are past the leasing season, usually during third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter, we would change that strategy back to pushing occupancy instead.
Rich Hill: Okay. That's great. Mike, if I had another question, which I don't, I'd ask you about solar payables, but maybe we can table that for NAREIT.
Michael Schall: About what I missed that.
Rich Hill: Just about solar panels.
Michael Schall: Solar panels. Okay. I mean They hold the CSR effort
Rich Hill: Yes.
Michael Schall: I'll just make a couple of quick comments, and then we'll move on from there. We have actually, for over 10 years now been had our own, what we call resource management group. So we've got pretty long history of pursuing things that we thought were good for our properties, good for values and create more efficient ways of doing things. So our CSR efforts have been -- they're nothing new, and they've been part of our past. And -- but I would say, as we think about California especially, there's a mandate here to remove gas cars by 2035. There are other mandates, as you all know, and they keep us focused on that. I think that there is a strong intersection between opportunity to add value to the portfolio many of these ESG efforts, and you mentioned one of them, which is solar panels, but it goes well beyond that. electronic vehicle charging stations, et cetera, part of the mandate as well. So we're excited about it. We were excited to announce our co anchoring of that new fund that sponsored by RET ventures. And I think it's consistent with our path and the way we think about ESG.
Operator: Our next has come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: You talked about the strong rent growth and demand in Northern California. As you survey those incoming residents where are they moving from? Are they within the MSA? Are they coming from kind of other areas of California coming from other areas of country, what migration trends are you seeing maybe specific to Northern California?
Michael Schall: Nick, it's Mike, and maybe Angela will want to make a comment. And by the way, FeraBar runs higher I make that comment. But really, it's I think, opening up a number of different things. The normal migration pattern typically has retirees with expensive California homes leading as you enter into a recessionary period, we certainly saw that. And then normally, that's -- those retiring workers moving out of California are replaced by younger workers that are coming into California to take higher-paying jobs and some of the opportunities for the tech company. So the younger workers were largely told to stay put until the tech company has opened up. And so now we are starting to see them return. In addition to that, there are some foreign migration that has picked up also, and we're starting to see more demand for corporate housing units as these big tech companies in terms of their training and onboarding activities. There's definitely a pickup in demand from corporate house for corporate housing. So it's really across the board. We're seeing more normalization of our activities, and they're coming from a number of different areas.
Nick Joseph: And then maybe just on the transaction environment and I recognize every environment is different. But just based on your past experience, how are you thinking of asset pricing trending from here? Obviously, there's high rent growth, but negative leverage with higher interest rates. So in the past, as you've seen some of those inputs, what has that done to the transaction market on a lag basis?
Adam Berry: Nick, this is Adam. So going forward, we don't see -- we don't see transaction values changing a whole lot. I think Mike you mentioned in his opening comments. You are seeing some interest rate pressures, obviously, but with the growth that we're seeing throughout our markets and with the amount of capital in the market chasing deals. We're really not seeing a dramatic move in pricing for deals that are kind of on the market right now. We're seeing a somewhat less froth than what we've seen over the last, call it, 6 to 9 months. but that that's that extra 5% the groups have moved after the second best and final round that we're not seeing today. So it really -- like I said, we're not seeing a dramatic shift in pricing moving forward.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.
Steve Sakwa: Barb, I just wanted to try and clarify some things I'm a little confused. I know there are a lot of numbers on delinquencies and bad debt. So F-16, you showed -- you had 2.2 in the first quarter. It dropped 0.2% in April. But then I think I heard you say that delinquencies -- gross delinquencies were 5% in April. And that your guidance now incorporates 1.9%. So I'm just sort of trying to put the gross and the net together and really figure out how conservative, how aggressive you are on the delinquency front, and what sort of upside maybe there is if the rental assistance program, which have kind of burned off, lead to better collections, what kind of upside can we see?
Barb Pak: Steve, yes, that's a great question. So what I was alluding to in our guidance, we've assumed 1.9% scheduled rent, and that's on a net delinquency basis. So that would be after emergency rental assistance. That's for the full year, which implies 2% in the back half of the year. And that would compare to the in the first quarter in terms of net delinquencies on a cash basis. And then the other number I provided was the 5% on gross because we do still have high underlying gross delinquencies. We're working through those. And we have seen a positive change over the last couple of months. For example, in January, February, we're at 6.5%, and we've come down to 5%. And we believe that part of that is a function of the change in the law that occurred in April. That said, we still have a lot of work to do there, and we've only seen 1 month of data. So our guidance doesn't assume that, that materially changes from here, especially with Alameda and LA County where Avicion protections remain in place. So the combination of emergency rental assistance and gross delinquencies kind of gets us to our net 1.9% for the full year.
Steve Sakwa: And if you were to just put the 5% gross in perspective, say, pre-pandemic in 2018 or 2019 before all these issues, what are the gross delinquencies sort of look like just to help frame the 5% number?
Barb Pak: It would be less than 1%. Because remember, our net delinquencies were 35 basis points historically. So our gross delinquencies were less than 1%. And on average. So the 5% is definitely very high.
Michael Schall: Steve, let me throw out one other set of numbers. And that is we're owed $76 million. I think that was in my script, of which we booked, I believe, $4 billion of that as revenue or accounts receivable. So we have a long way to go, a lot of collections, potential collections out there. We just don't know when or how much, given the -- most of it comes from the state rental relief program, and it is impossible for us to predict when that's going to come in.
Steve Sakwa: Right. No, I understand it’s hard to kind of figure out when you’ll get it. But okay so there’s a fair amount of conservatism there that could lead to further upside. I guess, Mike, I know you’re not big on the development side, but just how are you thinking about new development opportunities, if at all? And are you seeing any changes in land prices or more opportunities coming your way? And how do return sort of pencil given the big inflation we’ve seen, but also the starting to improve rent growth picture?
Michael Schall: Yes, Steve. I mean, I’m going to turn that over to Adam here in a second, but I will say that in the recent past, we press released a couple of development deals, one in Seattle and one in Northern California. And that doesn’t speak to our pipeline. So with that, I’ll turn it over to Adam to talk about development.
A –Adam Berry: Steve, we’re seeing we’re not seeing a huge increase in deals coming out on the development side. Those that we’ve seen to trade in the Bay Area the per ore price has definitely gone up. They are generally solving to a low 4 cap, which that does not provide the spread that we need in order to justify risk associated with development deals. We probably have seen more tertiary markets, increase their potential for new development deals. And that really hasn’t been as much our focus either. So generally, we have – as Mike mentioned, we press released a deal last year in the Bay Area. We have a couple in the pipeline that we’re working through. But we are staying selective and disciplined as to what kind of spread necessary for these deals.
A –Michael Schall: One additional note, what Adam talks about a 4 cap, he’s saying today, that’s untrended for cap. So we compare an acquisition yield today against a development yield today. So it’s not trended just a flat.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.
Jeff Spector: My first question, Mike, is on your supply comments. I believe you said that for '23, supply will be down. I think you said maybe 11%. And I was -- and I'm sorry, if I'm saying the wrong percent, please correct me. I'm just curious how confident you are at this point on 23. And has that changed in the last couple of months? Has it always been -- has the expectation been lower in '23 similarly, let's say, a few months ago? Or has something changed?
Michael Schall: Jeff, actually, these numbers didn't change a lot from last quarter. And that overall reduction in 2023 was minus 15%, made up of minus 54% and in the Bay Area. So a pretty flat in Southern California and up a little bit in Seattle. So I think what's happened here is that in the early phases of COVID, people pulled back on development. And so we're starting to see the impact of that. Now couple of years later. And so I think that there will be a low period for development starts and then we'll see what happens in the further along in the cycle. But in my prepared remarks, I noted that the deliveries, we've actually had the peak deliveries in Q1, Q2 '22. So they moderate little bit toward the end of -- for the rest of the year, the last -- the next 6 months and then next year, again, down 15%. So the trajectory. And we do our own fundamental analysis on this. So we actually have people look at deals and see where they stand. And so we're accurate than some of the other data that you see out there, not that some of these can't change their construction delays, et cetera, that happen. But I think our numbers are spot on with respect to what's coming at us.
Jeff Spector: Great. And then just a follow-up, Mike, on some of the comments about San Francisco and the return to work. It's interesting. It seems to be one of the only markets where really the return to work has been a catalyst for apartment demand. A lot of other cities or most have seen that strong demand without companies, let's say, forcing people back to work? And I guess I'm more of a worry. I guess to me that it feels a bit negative, like why is that? Is that a problem longer term? I guess, how would you counter that? Like at the end of the , why is that a positive? I know it's a positive because you're seeing people come in on the return to work. But I guess what are your thoughts on that?
Michael Schall: Well, my initial thought goes back to the first chapter of COVID, which the city is basically shut down. They shut down all the restaurants, they shut down hotels, all the leisure, all the service jobs are pretty much eliminated. And so if you're one of those people who generally is not a high wage earner, what are you going to do? You just lost your job and you don't have any certainty about getting another one because basically everything is shut down in the city. So those people all left. And so now what you're starting to see is the demand for those services really didn't change all that much, but you got to bring all those workers back in order to reengage in those businesses. And so I think that's what's happening. So this was not a voluntary choice, people had to stay in the cities and pursue their livelihood, they were effectively forced out. So as the cities recover and again, we have some concerns about the is given defund the police movements, et cetera, homelessness. And -- but as the cities recover, we think that there's good upside. And it's entirely due to real demand for travel, for services, for restaurants, for hotels, et cetera. So we don't view it as artificial at all. We view it as a policy choice largely that caused the deep hole, and now, we're just recovering to a natural place.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: So 2 questions. Mike, in Northern California with the city reopening and jobs coming back, are you seeing more of the renters flood back to San Francisco, the city? Or are you seeing more come back to the burbs because they want the extra space? Or what's sort of the dynamic? Just trying to see where you're seeing more of the demand as people come back to the market to the region?
Michael Schall: Well, maybe Angela will add to that because I don't have anything that tells me on a more granular basis exactly what's happening. I do think that Suburbia has done better in virtually all cases. And the cities, the concern in the cities is both, I think I mentioned before, hoses, et cetera, but also there's more supply in the cities like, for example, almost all the supply in Los Angeles, sort of the greatest percentage supply increase in Los Angeles is in the CBD, same with San Diego and kind of same throughout. So it's really the confluence of both more supplies in the cities and the demand is maybe a little bit delayed from the suburban markets. and the suburban markets generally don't have nearly the extent of the problems that there are in the cities. So they are recovering faster and doing very well.
Angela Kleiman: Alex, if it helps, just a few data points on what Mike just said. It's Angela here. When we're looking at the sequential met new leases, net effective new leases. The best performing are San Mateo and Santa Clara. Those are the 2 top ones. So that is evidence of the strength of the suburban Northern California.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is on the delinquencies. And Barb, I appreciate your color to one of the previous analyst questions. But how soon can you guys get aggressive and start turning tenants residents over to the credit agency starts stocking their credit reports. Just how soon can you guys take a quicker hand or quicker tougher hand? And then two, if the state is paying all these people's rents, where is the -- I mean that sounds like a big moral hazard that the people know next time they don't have to pay rent. So it's like it seems to just set up for another repeat of this. Is there any sort of guard against that? Or are we just setting ourselves up for that? I guess it's a 2-parter. One, when can you report to the credit agencies? And two, it seems to be setting up for another if the state is going to pay all this background?
Angela Kleiman: Alex, it's Angela here. Maybe I'll start with the tenant's behavior first and like me, I want to talk about more hazard. It's a favorite topic. In terms of how aggressively we can push on that front, there are a couple of factors. One is that we still have eviction protection in place for LA and Alameda county. And so that will need to work itself out, and that's -- that goes to the legislative issues, right?  As far as our ability to collect going forward, keep in mind that the protection -- delinquency protection remain for any delinquency that occurred during the period before September 2021. So we're really talking about April delinquency. So on the new April delinquency, we can take action outside of L.A., of course, in Alameda. And so it's a whole process that involves going through evaluation of putting people and payment plans, win with our tenants on how to manage through this period of time. And so -- we do, at this point, have the ability to report to the credit agency everywhere, it's really how we want to go about it that will make the most sense to be able to maximize our collections effort.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Mike, did you want to add?
Michael Schall: Maybe again back to where is the delinquency. It's in LA County and Alameda County. And then the other part, which is state law statewide, which effectively says if you have a rental relief application outstanding, the courts will not hear an eviction case through June 30. And so there are still reasons why we can't do the things we would ordinarily do at this point in time. But the good news is, I think, that all of these programs appear to be getting close to their end, and then we'll pretty soon have a good idea of where we stand.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Barb, if I heard you correctly, the same-store revenue guidance increase was really 2 parts, neither of which seemed to include any change to your projections for market rents or occupancy through the balance of the year. So I was curious where market rent -- where is market rent growth year-to-date across the portfolio relative to the -- I think it was 7.7% projection you assumed for this year?
Barb Pak: I'll take the first part, and then I'll let Mike and Angela take the second part. So in terms of the same-store guidance raise, so 50 basis points of the raise was due to delinquency, another 30 basis points was due to lower concessions and higher net effective rents and then the balance was due to higher rubs. And then in terms of where we are in terms of market rent.
Angela Kleiman: Yes, I'm happy to cover that. It's Angela here. On the market brands, we are tracking pretty much in line in Northern California and Seattle. And keep in mind, we had anticipated that Northern California recovery would be quite strong. And so that is consistent with our expectation. Southern California is outperforming and it is tracking ahead. The -- and so we are in the middle of -- in the midst of relooking at our modeling assumptions, and we'll provide a midyear update. Having said that, keep in mind that when we're looking at leasing spreads, year-over-year leasing spreads, we will have the -- it will be the strongest in the first half because last year around this time, we still had negative leasing spreads. In fact, that negative leasing spreads weren’t continued through the second quarter, we didn't turn until July. And so for those reasons, with the year-over-year comparable, we need to evaluate the magnitude of what that means.
Michael Schall: And maybe 1 final piece, and that is we'll be looking at F '17 and our rent forecast, our economic forecast on -- and the net-net is we're ahead. And we generally don't do that every quarter, we do it biannually, so we'll be looking at that for next quarter.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. All very helpful. And just to clarify, Barb, on the 35 basis points, you mentioned a couple of items there, but I thought I heard you say in the prepared remarks that was mainly driven by first quarter performance. And so not necessarily that you've assumed that the -- even though it's decelerating in the back half of the year, but that growth will be higher than what was assumed in your original projection. Is that correct?
Barb Pak: I said it was driven by, yes, strong first quarter results and then better net delinquency collection. So we -- like I said, we factored in 30 basis points improvement in concessions and higher net effective rents for our full year guidance and then 50 basis points on delinquency. Those are the bulk of the same-store guidance rates.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mike, you've provided a lot of data points on the demand to supply ratio and set up for the recovery on the West Coast and how these markets have historically outperformed in an upturn. But obviously, we're amidst sort of some crosscurrents today and concerns about a recession on the horizon. So just curious how that impacts your view about the trajectory of the recovery on the West Coast.
Michael Schall: Well, I will -- I'll start by citing the fearful of Barb comment that we already noted, but we feel good about conditions and where we stand. So we are just recovering the things that were shut down during the pandemic now that, again, all of the mass mandates most of them have been removed, and it feels like we're in a better state. I think that that's most of it. And it feels like we have a lot of catching up to do. And we're at the front end of that process, we’re obviously late to the dance and -- but we feel good about where we stand and expect to continue to perform well.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Just wanted to ask for an update on where you're sitting at renewals for May and June? And what's your ability to achieve renewal rates that may approach the new lease growth rate of 22%?
Barb Pak: So on the -- you're asking about the renewals that we're setting out for the second quarter, right? I just want to clarify.
John Kim: Correct.
Barb Pak: Okay. I assume, yes. Okay. So on the renewals, company-wide, we're setting at about -- slightly above 11%. And the distribution is actually not a huge variance. SoCal at about 10.5%, and Northern California, close to 12% and Seattle close to 13%. So those are the averages. In terms of our confidence level, given where we're seeing the activities and the demand, we are quite confident that these are achievable rates.
John Kim: So if that continues in the second quarter, what's implied in your guidance of 8.6% same-store revenue for the second half of the year? I know, Angela, you mentioned that there are tougher comps that you're approaching. But at the same time, the loss lease went up to 9.5%. You have the market rent forecast of 7.7%. What do you -- what do you expect to happen in the third and fourth quarter?
Barb Pak: Right. No, that's a good question. So first quarter, our same-store was 6.5%. We do expect that to gradually increase from a revenue perspective because that is -- essentially there's a lag effect, right, between revenues and economic grants. So as market rents taper off, the revenues is falling, but it's continued to increase. So there's that catch-up effect.
John Kim: And so what's implied in your guidance currently for the back half of the year?
Barb Pak: In terms of rent growth or I'm trying to understand what you're asking for. I don't have that in front of -- effective lease growth, I don't have that in front of me. I have to follow up with you after. It's consistent though we haven't changed our full year outlook on F '17 in terms of market rent growth. So there hasn't been a change to that assumption as of right now. We're revisiting that.
Michael Schall: And John maybe -- John, as it relates to F '17, keep in mind that if we get it sooner, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to get what we got sooner. And in addition, we're going to get what we thought we're going to get. So there could be just -- it happened faster than we thought. And so keep that in mind. That's why we want to make sure that we wait for kind of a full review of F-17 before we start kicking it apart, if that makes sense.
John Kim: It does.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Nick Yulico: I just wanted to go back to the delinquency number. The $76 million, which is the cumulative number. And I know previously, I didn't see an update on this, but in terms of the reimbursement that you've already applied for and haven't received that number back in March was, I think, $59 million. Is that still the number? Did that change?
Barb Pak: Nick, it's Barb. So that number is $64 million as of last week of which half relates to our current residents and half relates to landlord initiated applications on behalf of past residents. And that the latter group is the one that the resident -- the former resident has to engage, which is obviously more uncertain of how we'll be able to collect that.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Helpful. And then in terms of the guidance then, how should we think about that $64 million. Is any of that factored into full year guidance collecting that money?
Barb Pak: Yes. What's implied is effectively the first group, the resident, the current resident applications. We have high confidence we'll get the vast majority of that. Given the programs now ended in terms of applying for new applications, we think that, that will come in this year.
Nick Yulico: Okay. So about half of it…
Barb Pak: Yes. It won't all be same store, though because that's for our total portfolio, including joint venture properties. And so a portion of that will be same-store.
Nick Yulico: Okay. But about half of it we should think about. And then because I know the number is like over $1 of FFO per share. So we should think about half of that is in the full year guidance this year and maybe half could flow in still or maybe next year depending on that pace?
Barb Pak: Right. The other half is uncertain, and we're seeking alternative ways to recoup that money, but the timing is very uncertain on that.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
BradHeffern: Yes. So in the prepared comments, you mentioned the 3 co-investments that are expected to be paid off in '23 now versus 2022 previously. Is that a headwind that's just moving to 2023? Or does the overall macro environment lead to fewer redemptions and better reinvestment opportunities overall and that some of the headwinds that we've seen lately are abating?
Barb Pak: Brad, this is Barb. So the 3 investments that were pushed, it's really a function of the interest rate environment today and where these properties are going to be in lease up. Keep in mind, in 2021 given the low interest rate environment, developers were able to get takeout financing before they were fully leased up. And given the higher interest rate environment and debt service coverage ratios, we don't see that happening anymore. And so that's really a function of what caused those to be pushed. Nothing -- the properties aren't behind on schedule or anything like that. It's just a change in the environment that's occurred from an interest rate perspective.
Brad Heffern: Okay. And are you seeing any additional reinvestment opportunities, just given I imagine the financing side of things is more difficult now than it was a few months ago?
Michael Schall: Brad, we -- I think that we will see more. Again, we have this lag after COVID when construction starts turned downward, and I suspect that we will see a lot of those deals come back and that will create more demand for the food equity program. So I think that will right -- that's in the process of rightsizing itself as well.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.
RichAnderson: Mike, I don't know if you remember, a long time ago, I talked to you about a mood ring. Do you remember that conversation?
Michael Schall: I do, as a matter of fact.
Rich Anderson: I want to ask about your near-term mood ring for San Francisco in a little -- or Bay Area in a little bit different format. Given S-17, I know you're going to update it, but right now, it's the leader. Northern California is the leader in terms of market rent growth. We've gone through that ad nauseam to this point. But you also reported quarter, same-store revenue in Northern California was the laggard of the 3 regions. Should we sort of extrapolate what you're thinking rent -- market rent growth wise, into your portfolio, shouldn't this just flip in the coming quarters in terms of the composition of store revenue growth in 2022 where Northern California should really become the leader in the back half relative to the other regions? Or am I thinking about that wrong?
Michael Schall: Well, Angela will maybe have some comments. But to your mood ring thing. So I actually -- because of you know what a mood ring is and I have different colors that I have in my mind because of you, Rich. So I never forget. Red would have to be the right color for us. I mean, I think that we feel good, energized, et cetera. And --
Rich Anderson: No Red is the wrong color. You would think blue, black --
Michael Schall: Parting to my mood ring thing, energize is red and excited and adventurous are red. So all that you feel -- I have the wrong mood ring app, I guess. So -- but no, we -- I think we're feeling good about things. And Northern California long term is our #1 market. I think it's the #1 market in America. In terms of long-term CAGRs rent growth, it's fallen well behind the curve in this case. And in this world because rents are always tethered at some level to income levels, it's really important that they move together. And we -- on the income side, we're still seeing some recovery happening there.  So I don't think you could just grow forever unless incomes are growing very rapidly. And 1 number that I was told by the group here is that our income and our -- our move-ins are up something like 15%, which is pretty darn good. It makes us feel better about the rents that we're charging, especially in Southern California. So things look good. I expect Northern California to really pick it up here, and it will become -- once again, as it has for the long term, our #1 market is what I would guess.
Angela Kleiman: And Rich, it's Angela here. Thanks for making my point for me, which is that in the second half, we do see that flip. We do see Northern California rent growth will then outperform Southern California rent growth.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then second question for me is -- we talk a lot about services coming back in restaurants and hotels and all that, but also reemployment or the reuse of office buildings with tech. Is it not true that hybrid office would be a better model for you rather than 5 days a week only because where you guys are located, primarily outside of San Francisco. So maybe a 2- or 3-day a week type of model would be good for your portfolio relatively speaking because people might be able to put up with a longer commute for a variety of reasons in that area, but just because they don't have to go into the office every single day. Is that the right way to think of it? Or is there any kind of return to office work for you and you're not going to really kind of dig into too much more of the detail beyond that?
Michael Schall: Yes. No, I think you're thinking about it the right way. I think that because of the hybrid workforce. And I think everyone, including the tech workers and actually Essex as a company, most of them are pursuing a hybrid model of some kind that requires some tethering to an office. And we're actually no different from that, obviously.  And so I think what the effect of that is, is that it makes the downtowns, which have all the office buildings, a little less desirable. And it probably adds -- and we've talked about this before, another ring, let's say, another 10 miles out from where we would have drawn our line because our portfolio is planned around the key job nodes and a commute pattern to those job nodes. So now we will expand that a bit. And a good example is we've been buying in San Diego County, some of the areas that are farther from the major job nodes. And -- but that will be true of Northern California and Seattle as well. So I think it does push out the commutable space and therefore, it expands our geography accordingly.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski: And just one question, and I'll let somebody else jump on. The revenue-enhancing CapEx spend this year, $100 million is a big number. Can you just remind us what are the drivers? What are you actually spending money on? And then how do you kind of expected returns, IRRs compare versus alternatives, either buying real estate or buy back stock?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. I'll talk about the CapEx program first and -- as far as the redevelopment spend and also just the forward CapEx spend. On the redevelopment side, we are targeting 8% to 10% cash on cash yield, and this is consistent with pre-COVID levels. And it's primarily because we're seeing the demand in our market and the rent growth to support this program. Now the elevated level that you may be referring to when it comes to the CapEx per door, I think that's what you're referring to itself, it's really driven by 2 factors. One is, of course, the material cost increase, but the other 1 is a catch-up. And so during the COVID period, we, of course, were very careful and ran much leaner from a CapEx perspective, both in terms of just trying to minimize contact and also being sensitive to what we can achieve on the top line. And because of that, our normal CapEx per door of somewhere around 1,750 dropped down to almost below $1,400. And so that -- there's a catch-up that just needs to happen normally.
Barb Pak: And then, John, this is Bob. In terms of where to put capital, obviously, redevelopment of the 8% to 10% returns are obviously our best use of cash proceeds today relative to buying an asset in the mid-3s or even buying back the stock. So it's just hard to put a lot of money to work. Remember, you're you've got an occupied building and you can only put so many dollars to work. So there's a capital constraint on how much we can put to work there, but we think that is the best alternative source of capital outside of preferred equity, which we've already discussed in the past.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: Now it's gone a little over narrow, so I'll be quick. First one, on the the RET fund, the one the climate change funds. Just curious about how you guys when you're talking about that with you either board or internally in investment committees, I guess what are you guys trying to achieve given that China and India are by far the biggest polluters and emitters of carbon in the world?
Michael Schall: It's a good comment, and I'm not going to make any comments about China or India. But I would say that, again, we saw -- as I mentioned earlier, we see good opportunities to invest in our own portfolio and make it better. And by better, I mean, produce a return on investment that makes sense. And we see the cost of electricity, trash removal, water issues et cetera, as being longer-term issues for all of us. And if we can solve some of those issues and get a payback by lowering our bills, et cetera, thdn so be it, we think it makes good sense. And initially, we had -- I know RET Ventures was thinking about that as part of their existing fund and, in fact, had made a number of investments out of their main fund in ESG. And a couple of them are super important One of them is we have SEC requirements. So a company called measurable was one of the RET investments before this new fund. And it helps us organize our data and getting ready for the SEC requirements that are coming down the road. So there are a lot of important reasons when we should be doing this, and we see a lot of opportunity out there. And it's not just investing money, it's actually getting a return on your investment.
Neil Malkin: Appreciate that, Mike. Last 1 real quick, maybe Adam, for you or anyone really, but your stock price is pretty much right around all-time high. I know that this typical model is stock price up, issue equity and buy stuff, stock price down, sell assets, JV stuff. Maybe just talk about the -- I think maybe some I touched on it before, the acquisition pipeline around in your market, potentially maybe some suburban locations, et cetera. Has that picked up recently, just kind of the things you're looking at? And or potentially maybe in the West Coast. Any commentary on how you think the rest of the year is going to shake out on the acquisition side, obviously, in the face of higher debt costs?
Adam Berry: Sure. Neil, this is Adam. As to what's going to come later in the year, it's hard to say. Over the end of Q4 and early Q1, the volume generally on the market was pretty low. There's a pretty significant decline in overall transaction volume quarter-over-quarter. There is quite a bit on the market today. As I noted before, over the last 6 to 9 months, we really didn't partake in the frenzy that was happening in those best and best final rounds. We're always constantly assessing what's on the market and where we see more growth going forward. And so we're looking at those deals. We're not going to be in the low 3s. And so if there's any sort of adjustment or if we see an opportunity that comes up, and we did see a few of those that we closed on in early Q4 and early this quarter, then we will jump into those windows.
Neil Malkin: Okay. So it just seems like it's going to be a little bit harder to kind of do the types of things you did maybe in years past when your stock price was up, and you're heavily acquisitive. It seems like that's maybe have a little tougher hurdle now just given cap rates and overall cost of capital. Is that fair?
Michael Schall: Yes, that's fair. I mean if you take the cap rates that Adam was talking about and you compare it to the company, you've climbed to the company, you will find that issuing stock is something we really shouldn't do. And so we have not done that and try to use our co-investment platform to fund most of the deals. And obviously, having positive leverage, i.e., cap rates over debt cost was a -- it helps a lot when it comes to deal making. And so we're no longer in that world. And so there's a bit of an impediment on the deal side caused by negative leverage once again.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra Newton with Goldman Sachs.
Chandni Luthra: If you could perhaps give some more insight into the connections operating model, I know you have it lined up to be rolled out fully across the portfolio by the end of 2022. And then I think you have the digital platform improvement next year. So is there a way to quantify in margin or cost benefits? And then how do you think of all that sort of culminating together from a timing standpoint?
Angela Kleiman: It's Angela here. I think you're asking about how we look at or how we evaluate the success of our property collections operating model.
Chandni Luthra: Exactly. From a number standpoint, I know you've given that ratio of 45 to 1from 40, which is very helpful. But how does that data translate into the P&L down the line? What sort of could you benefit as you think about running our models?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, sure. So we think about the benefit in 3 key ways. First is our customer interactions. And we can look at that by the retention rate. And the second one is operating efficiency, and that is the 40:1 ratio that I talked about that we now improved to 43:1 in terms of units to employ. And ultimately, what that means for the financial impact, and that's the third key metric.  And so when I refer to the 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement, when we implemented San Diego and Orange County, that translated to about $15 million of benefit to NOI, and we have realized that savings when we were only about 1/3 way through our implementation back then. So the expectation is that going forward, once we complete the rollout -- now keep in mind, we also have a digital platform rollout that's embedded in all of the cost savings. But upon completion, and this is several years out, we would expect an additional 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. The trick here is -- or the challenge is trying to figure out, it's not a dollar for dollar because when we -- when I talked about the $15 million things, we were not under such extreme inflationary pressure today. And so there will be offsets, which will go towards helping us to manage our controllable expenses.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just wanted to follow back on the delinquencies. You -- I just want to understand something. The rent payments that the state is making for the $76 million, is the state making all of that or the half of that? I think it's half of that, that you mentioned by former residents that you said those residents have to initiate, is that -- it sounds like the whole $76 million may not get paid back. It sounds like only the existing residents get paid by the state. Otherwise, the former residents have to do it on their own. Is that the correct understanding? Or did I misunderstand?
Barb Pak: Alex, it's Barb. So the total that we've applied for is $64 million as of today, the cumulative delinquency that Mike alluded to is $76 million. So there is a delta there. And then of the $64 million in applications, it's made up of 2 components: our existing residents, which is half and then past residents. Now we've applied on behalf of those past residents. Those past residents have to engage in the process for us to get our money. If they don't engage then the application doesn't move forward. And that's why I'm saying it's a little bit uncertain in terms of whether the past resident will engage and whether we'll collect that portion of the emergency rental assistance.
Alexander Goldfarb: And what's the incentive for them to engage?
Michael Schall: They get their rent paid. Keep in mind, Alex, we can't -- the landlord -- this is not a landlord program, it's a tenant program. And they have to have a COVID-related hardship. So they have to certify as to the hardship basically. And so we can't do it by ourselves. So -- but it's really their reimbursement paying us off and their incentive ends, they're going to owe some money if they don't process the application.
Angela Kleiman: Yes. Alex, it's Angela here. And that includes the impact to their credit report we can, and we actually have reported on our past residents. But also, there are other means for us to try to connect with them, which is we can go through small claims court. There are other means. And so it is actually to their benefit to engage with us and get this assistance from the state.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
Michael Schall: Okay. Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We are looking forward to NAREIT, and hopefully, we will see many of you there. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Good day and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will provide an overview of fourth quarter and full year results, our expectations for 2022 and an overview of the apartment investment market. Essex experienced a strong recovery in 2021, following the unprecedented and extraordinary challenges of 2020. The fourth quarter was our second consecutive quarter of positive same-store results and core FFO exceeded our original guidance midpoint by $0.05 per share. Overall, net effective rents remain above pre-COVID levels, despite a modest seasonal slowdown that occurs every fourth quarter. In California, the pandemic and related regulation has led to an unprecedented divergence in apartment performance across our portfolio. The suburban areas that underperformed for most of the past 30 years are now our top performers and our historical top performers are now our ladders. To demonstrate, net effective rents in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties are up at least 25% from pre-COVID levels, pushing rent-to-income ratios in these counties to all-time highs. Conversely, rents in the tech markets remain well below pre-COVID levels, especially San Francisco and San Mateo counties, which remained down at least 15% and now screen affordable relative to their much higher median household incomes. There is a similar divergence in performance in the large metros that contain both urban and suburban areas. For example, in Los Angeles County, Downtown LA net effective rents are flat from pre-COVID levels, while suburban areas, such as Long Beach and Santa Clarita are up 15% to 20%. We attribute the underperformance of the urban core to the damaging lockdowns in 2020, which resulted in severe job losses in restaurants and the service sectors. More broadly, recoveries in the urban core and major tech companies have been slowed by ongoing government restrictions, worker shortages and delayed return to office plans. While the large tech companies generally did not experience job losses, their hiring slowed during the pandemic and many employees relocated in the initial phase of the pandemic due to citywide shutdowns. As of December 2021, the U.S. has recovered about 96% of jobs lost in the pandemic compared to only 78% for the Essex markets. Obviously, we are disappointed that many tech employers pushed back their office re-openings during the surge of the Omicron variant over the holidays. However, the data indicates that most large tech employers will adopt a hybrid office environment and therefore, the return to office should be a significant catalyst for housing demand in our poorest performing markets. With job growth now exceeding the U.S. average, we believe that our recovery is well underway and several observations support our positive outlook. As highlighted on previous earnings calls, there has been many large investments in office space by the large tech companies this past year, contributing to positive net office absorption in 7 of our 8 major markets, representing 4.8 million square feet of space. Available office sublease space has begun to decline in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and Seattle, which supports our belief that many companies are moving forward with their return to office plans. As expected, there is a resurgence in service and hospitality-related hiring as our cities recover, with year-over-year increases in leisure hospitality employment ranging from about 29% in Ventura to about 56% in San Francisco. Recent immigration policy changes from the White House announced last week should also support the positive momentum that we are seeing in job growth at the higher income levels. For many years, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties disproportionately benefited from foreign immigration. However, during the COVID pandemic, stricter immigration policies during the previous administration drove net foreign immigration to a 30-year low. We suspect that the recently announced immigration policy changes will contribute to job growth, particularly in the Bay Area. Venture capital investment in the Essex markets continues unabated. In the fourth quarter, approximately $37.5 billion of capital was invested in West Coast-based companies or approximately 40% of the total venture capital deployed in the United States and representing 124% year-over-year increase. The West Coast remains a leader in venture capital, which is a driver of global innovation and in turn local economies and job growth. The top 10 tech employers in our markets continue to seek talent and with open positions listed in California or Washington reaching 47,000 in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the pre-COVID peak by 62%. Turning to our expectations for 2022, Page S-17 of our supplemental package summarizes our key operating expectations and assumptions. We continue to expect full year rent growth of 7.7% for Essex’s West Coast markets. Our rent estimates are derived from a top-down and bottoms-up approach that we continue to refine with each passing year. We are expecting 4.1% job growth in our markets next year, suggesting moderation from the 5.5% trailing 3-month average Essex markets achieved as of December. Even at 4.1%, West Coast job growth should significantly outpace the nation. Our research team conducts its own fundamental analysis of apartment supply and they expect around 37,000 apartment deliveries in 2022. This is slightly higher compared to 2021 and should lead to a limited disruption at stabilized communities. Similar to 2020, there are pockets of apartment supply deliveries in some urban submarkets, notably CBD LA. Similar to 2021 for-sale housing deliveries will remain very muted at about 0.6% of total stock of for-sale homes. Continued improvement in apartment trends in 2022 maybe bolstered by inflationary pressures in the United States currently at the highest level since the early 1980s. While inflation and its countermeasures have the potential to slow the economy, it’s worth noting that apartments are resilient with short lease durations and high operating margins. In addition, it is incredibly difficult to ramp up rental and for-sale housing production on the West Coast given long entitlement processes, government restrictions and construction labor shortages. Finally, we have a conservative debt structure characterized by minimal levels of variable rate debt, staggered debt maturities, and low leverage. Estimating future supply a few years from now is another important part of Essex’s capital allocation process and Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights recent increases in housing permit activity in various prominent residential REIT markets. While supply – while future supply in the Essex markets is expected to drop in 2023 and remain at manageable levels thereafter, supply appears to be increasing in several other markets. It is also important to note that we have limited exposure to the institutional single-family rental market compared to other metros. We continue to believe that housing supply and demand is the fundamental driver of our business and our capital allocation priorities. I have a few brief comments on the apartment investment markets where the deal volume in our markets has now surpassed pre-COVID levels as institutional capital targets West Coast apartments. Cap rates are consistently in the low to mid 3% range and we have seen yields converge across markets, construction types, location and age. We sold 4 properties last year valued at $330 million, using the proceeds to fund stock repurchases early on and then acquisitions as the year progressed and our cost of capital improved. For the year, we acquired $432 million, with the majority of acquisitions completed in a co-investment format to conserve capital. Generally, we see greater deal volumes during uncertain conditions, so we are optimistic about more opportunities to create value in the transaction market in 2022 and Barb will detail our ‘22 guidance assumptions in a moment. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks Mike. First, I’d like to express my gratitude for the exceptional operations and support teams we have here at Essex. As the challenge to our business continue to evolve, our team has also continued to step up, which speaks to the dedication, work ethic and the can-do attitude across the organization. On to today’s comments, I’ll begin with key operational highlights of our major regions, then focus on our outlook for the year, followed by an update on the progress we are making by leveraging technology, data analytics and transforming our operating platform. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results of 4% year-over-year and 1.6% sequential growth in same-property revenues. We have detailed on S-16 of our supplement, which shows the fourth quarter year-over-year new and renewal rent spreads up by 17.1% and 10.7% respectively. The significant recovery in rents over the last year was bolstered by the occupancy and concession strategies we implemented throughout the pandemic. To review our markets by region, I will begin in Southern California, which represents almost 45% of our NOI and was our best performing region in 2021. Through many economic cycles, we have consistently relied on Southern California for steady performance. And during the pandemic, it had exceeded our expectations. The one caveat is the Los Angeles submarket. While it is also showing strong rent growth, this market faces offsetting challenges from the ongoing eviction moratorium and disproportionate bad debt. Notwithstanding these challenges, we remain optimistic with the broader Los Angeles submarket because of the continued strategic commercial investments by companies like Warner Bros, which is planning to develop a 1.3 million square feet of studio and office space in Burbank. This will be the largest studio development in the country and is expected to bring about 1,400 new jobs to the market. Film LA recently reported the production activity hit an all-time high in the fourth quarter and Apple recently proposed a 0.5 million square foot office development in Culver City, which should create approximately 2,500 new jobs. The continued job growth and high cost of homeownership amidst a slight increase in supply deliveries in Orange County and San Diego are factors considered in our expectation for demand for rental housing and the basis for our 2022 outlook for Southern California market rent growth of 7.1%. Moving north to the Bay Area and Northern California, it is no secret that Northern California’s rents have lacked the nation and the Essex portfolio average. We view the region is in early stages of its recovery. Unlike most markets across the country, which are effectively back to normal economic levels, the Bay Area has yet to fully recover due to ongoing COVID regulations such as mask mandates and delayed return to office tempering the momentum of normal economic activities. We have seen communications by Bay Area companies informing employees of plans to return to office after Omicron case subsides and we remain encouraged by the large tech companies’ expansion plans and commercial investments in our markets, as highlighted by Mike. Furthermore, our supply delivery forecast a decline in 2022. Thus, we anticipate rapid recovery in rent growth without requiring a comparable level of increased housing demand. Keep in mind, that our Northern California portfolio is mostly suburban and should benefit from those employees having fewer commuting days in a hybrid environment. These factors contribute to our expectation for Northern California to be one of our strongest rental markets in 2022, with market rent forecasted to increase by 8.7%. Turning to our Seattle portfolio, which continues to perform well, we anticipate a similar level of supply deliveries this year as last year with the majority concentrated in downtown Seattle. Because our portfolio skews to the east side in Bellevue and surrounding suburbs, the demand for our communities remain strong from the continued investments by several companies, most notably Amazon, which has committed to developing a second tower in Bellevue, with construction to start this year and is expected to create an additional 3,500 jobs. Therefore, we forecast Seattle’s market rent growth at 7.2% for 2022. Moving on to the advancements in our operating model, by way of background, our disciplined focus of investing in high-quality submarkets has resulted in 70% of our properties being located within 5 miles of each other. With this competitive advantage in geographic concentration and innovation in technology and data analytics, we have re-envisioned Essex operating model with property collections. Essentially, we are transitioning from a dedicated team at an individual property to teams that will cover a collection of properties along with each associate to specialize in specific function and improving our ability to cross-sell among nearby properties. By organizing properties into collections and centralizing certain administrative duties, we expect to generate more efficiencies across the portfolio. We have already implemented this collections model in Orange County and San Diego and have achieved a reduction in personnel by approximately 10% to 15% through natural attrition. In addition, our data analytics has determined that our ability to cross-sell neighboring communities has increased by over 800 basis points following the adoption of the collections model. We plan to complete the rollout of the collections operating model to the remaining regions by the end of this year. While Essex has been efficient historically with each associate covering 40 units prior to 2019, with recent enhancements, we currently have each associate covering 43 units across the entire portfolio. Further benefits are expected in 2022 and thereafter as we complete our technology and other implementation plans. We are currently co-developing proprietary applications with partners from RET Ventures Fund and other software developers that will enhance the associate and customer experience. One example of advancements in our operating model over the past months has enabled 100% contactless tours, which currently consist of 92% self-guided tours and 8% virtual tours. As part of our technology initiative, we are starting the rollout of Alloy Access, a smart rent common area access solution, which will elevate the resident experience, while also further the productivity of our operations team by enhancing security, usability and monitoring, along with improving the effectiveness of the self-guided tours for prospective customers. In addition, we are working with Funnel to co-develop a tailored solution to further automate our platform, which we plan to rollout later this year. We believe this will directly benefit both the associates and customers through streamlined systems, on-demand features and link communications across properties, which will meaningfully accelerate the timetable to turn prospects into renters. We integrate these advancements with our data analytics platform to provide new operational insights. For example, leveraging newly available data on our leasing patterns from Funnel has improved the quality and effectiveness of our customer interactions. We have also applied advanced analytics with data from site plan to streamline our maintenance workflow, which reduced our unit churn times by 10% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis despite COVID-related labor challenges. We expect that these initiatives will continue to provide us with additional levers and insights to improve our revenue growth and operating margins in the coming years. With that, I will turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss the key assumptions supporting our 2022 guidance and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. We ended 2021 with strong momentum in the fourth quarter as demonstrated by 4.7% same-property NOI growth and 7.6% core FFO growth. We believe the economic recovery has only just begun on the West Coast and thus, this positive momentum will continue throughout 2022. As such, we are forecasting core FFO per share growth of 9.7% at the midpoint, which is the highest growth in 6 years. We are pleased that our 2022 core FFO per share guidance is expected to exceed our pre-pandemic FFO achieved in 2019 despite the challenging operating environment. This is a testament to our disciplined operating strategy and capital allocation process, which is driving results to the bottom line. Our 2022 FFO growth is primarily driven by a 7.8% increase in our same-property revenues on a cash basis and 8.3% on a GAAP basis. For the year, we expect fewer concessions as compared to last year, but delinquency remains a challenge and we are expecting delinquency of 2.4% of scheduled rent in 2022, which is 30 basis points higher than 2021. We have two counties representing 50% of our total delinquency, where tenant protections remain in place. In addition, response times on tenant applications seeking emergency rental assistance remains slow and outside of our control, leading to large monthly swings in the delinquency line item. As a reminder, our historical annual delinquency has been around 35 basis points of scheduled rent. And given our long history of high collections, we believe we can ultimately return to this level once the various restrictions are lifted. We continue to assist residents in applying for federal tenant release funds and have received $29 million to-date, of which $12 million was in the fourth quarter. As for operating expenses, we are forecasting a 4% increase, which is above our historical average of 2% to 3%. This is the result of wage pressures in the market along with general inflation in the economy for materials. In total, same-property NOI is expected to grow 9.4% on a cash basis. Continuing with our investment expectations for 2022, as we have discussed throughout the past year, we have seen an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments due to high demand for West Coast apartments and low interest rates. In 2021, we had approximately $210 million of redemptions and our 2022 guidance contemplates another $350 million of redemptions. Some of this was pushed from the fourth quarter into this year. Over the past year, it has become more challenging to find new investments given the influx of capital to this segment. However, we were able to secure $117 million of new commitments, with an average yield of 11%, maintaining our disciplined approach to underwriting these projects. Our 2022 guidance contemplates an additional $100 million of new commitments at the midpoint, of which we assume $50 million will be funded during the second half of the year. The remainder of the preferred equity redemption proceeds will be used to fund new acquisitions. Finally, the balance sheet remains in a strong position. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit metrics and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 6.3x as EBITDA grew. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2022. Over the past 2 years, we have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment and refinanced nearly 40% of our debt, locking in low rates and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 70 basis points. As such, we have only 6% of our debt maturing over the next 2 years. In addition, we have minimal exposure to short-term rates, with only 4% of our consolidated debt subject to floating rates. As such, we have minimal risk to the rising interest rate environment. Given limited near-term maturities, no material development funding needs and ample liquidity, the company remains in a strong financial position. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.
Rich Hill: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to maybe just start off with a question about new leases relative to same-store revenue. I typically view new leases as leading indicator of particular revenue and you put up just a huge number for new leases in January, I think, of around 17%. So how are we supposed to think about that and maybe if I could push you a little bit, why is the same-store revenue higher?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, Rich. It’s Angela here. So let me just give you a little context on the S-16 that shows our new lease it is terrific with 17%. But keep in mind, that’s a year-over-year number to start. And we had communicated that between fourth quarter of 2020 to first quarter of 2021, so that comparable period, that’s when market rent troughed. And so from a year-over-year perspective, we are really hitting kind of the greatest delta, if you will, from a differential perspective. So if we’re talking about really the same-store guidance, what we probably – I think a better indicator is to look to the S-17 that Mike talked about earlier and you take that market rent of 7.7%, that market rent growth. And then you factor in the loss to lease at year-end. And I know we normally do – look to the September loss lease, but you might recall that we were – we had a typical seasonality and the seasonal peak was pushed. So we had caution against using the September loss lease. So if we look at the December loss lease, it’s around 6%. And after and then some of these other factors such as legislation and delinquency, that’s what ultimately drives our midpoint guidance of 7.8%.
Rich Hill: Got it. And look, that makes sense to me. We spend a lot of time on your macro forecast. So I guess your revenue guide was consistent with that, which is sort of what we expected. The newly spread, which is really high, and that’s helpful color. Just one more question for me. When we’re unpacking what you reported and guided to relative to our numbers, one of the things that stood out to us was rising interest expenses and then rising non-same-store expenses. Can you just maybe talk through what you’re expecting for the interest expense side of the equation? And if you’re intentionally being conservative given the interest rate environment that we’re in right now?
Barb Pak: Hi, Rich, it’s Barb. In terms of the interest expense line, the biggest factor there is the reduction in cap interest as our development pipeline has substantially rolled off. And so that’s a pretty substantial increase in the interest expense. We do have a couple of rate increases forecasted in the guidance, and we will – it’s really why we have a range, but have a lot of variable rate debt. We only have 4% of our consolidated debt is variable rate. So that’s a small impact to the numbers. It really is the cap interest side of the equation. I think that’s a $4 million reduction.
Rich Hill: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you, guys. I will jump back in, but thank you for that.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hi, good morning. So just a few questions for me. As far as Southern California goes, the strength that, that market is experiencing in general, do you think that will continue? So when San Francisco reopens and those tech jobs once again have to be in the office, are you expecting a migration back of people who migrated down to Southern Cal going back to Northern Cal? Or your view is that everyone who has populated Southern Cal love the lifestyle and is not looking to relocate back.
Michael Schall: Hi, Alex, it’s Mike. I’ll start with this and then flip it to Angela maybe for some more comments. We think that there is a reversion underway, and it will draw people back to where the jobs were kind of pre pandemic. And so the pandemic caused a lot of disruption with respect to where people went and many people went to Southern California and elsewhere. And so we think as the pandemic winds down, people will go back to where they once were, again, hybrid model being the typical format for a lot of the big companies out here. So we think that some of the people will move from Southern California back to Northern California. But keep in mind, there were people from Southern California that moved to Phoenix and other places as well. So it’s not just a one direction movement, and we think that the overall impact will be beneficial for California in total. So even though some people move from Southern California back to Northern California, that will be offset by potentially other people moving back for job reasons and/or lifestyle decisions. So with that, I’ll turn it over to Angela. Anything to add, Angela?
Angela Kleiman: Maybe just a little historical context, Alex, with the Southern California portfolio and in particular, San Diego, Ventura and Orange County, these are markets that were at – that perform at a 97% occupancy even pre-COVID. So it’s already a highly desirable place to be. And we combine that with this region having the most – the strongest loss to lease and it actually has, as far as we can see, pretty long legs. So in the interim, during the reversion that Mike is referring to, it may be more of a net neutral, but long-term, this market will still – we will see this market continue to perform well with a good tailwind from loss to lease.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, as part of guidance, and Mike, you’ve spoken about the exodus of the high-tech worker and then the service worker who left when their businesses were shut down. But as far as guidance goes, how much of guidance is predicated on the return of tech workers, return of the baristas? Just trying to get a sense – or if return to office occurs and if service job, those people who left came back, that’s incremental above and beyond what you’re already assuming in your numbers?
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex, I would say that it’s already happening. So it’s not a future event necessarily. I think we’re in the middle of the reversion. And I think to point to a statistic just look at job growth, and job growth is – trailing 3-month job growth is highest in Seattle, 6.2%, followed by Northern California at – I’m sorry, Southern California by 5.8% and Northern California by 5%. So jobs are coming back. People are starting to move. The Bay Area, obviously, is a step behind, but we think it will catch up given the strength and the uniqueness of the tech employers that are there. And so we think it’s all underway, and it’s just going to take some time to play out. I guess the question is, can it accelerate? I mean we actually expect it to accelerate, especially in the tech markets, which were, of course, those that were most impacted. By the end of the year, we expect that California will – or our markets will have about 93% of their jobs that they lost during the pandemic recovered. We’re currently at about 78% now. So we expect, again, these trends to continue and pretty favorable for our markets given what the impact on jobs is.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on that, it seems like another topic at least for San Francisco and maybe Seattle as well as just been quality of life overall. And obviously, a return to the office will help improve things, but do you think there is other steps that need to be taken or will the return to the office really help with quality of life as well?
Michael Schall: I think quality of life considerations really come into play in the CBDs. The homelessness, concerns about defunding the police, etcetera, I think that is where quality of life issues are more manifest and obvious. And as I say, they are not creating any more beaches around here. So that’s obviously a benefit. And so I think that the quality of life in suburbia is actually very high. And we’re – as we said before, we’re going to push out a little bit further strategically into some other – some different markets. And Adam’s here can talk about this, which we’ve never bought invested before, but it represents one of those markets in suburbia. Good community, good decent schools in a very nice Northern San Diego submarket. And we’re looking for that, and we think that we can find great quality of life in some of those markets, and there is great opportunity out there.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then as you think about the co-investment and the preferred and the Med book, obviously, you’ve gotten good returns from it, and it’s led to some opportunities. But as you think about kind of earnings and some of the volatility that we’re seeing this year associated with it, how do you think about the size going forward from a strategic perspective?
Michael Schall: Yes. Nick, I think it’s about right, actually. So we have about $700 billion combined between preferred equity and the debt. And again, we don’t want that business to get to be too large. We, I think, took advantage of an opportunity in 2020 to grow the business a bit given that there was very little else that was working. And I think that’s helped, but it will be somewhat lumpy and that’s the primary reason why the Board and all of us think that we should control its size and not let it get too large. So that’s first and foremost on our mind. If in our – from our perspective, it is probably the best risk/reward of what we do in terms of how we generate income, and plus there are some other advantages. One of our investments this quarter was a joint venture that came out of the preferred business. So I thought that was having other types of business tied to that is important. Plus, we get we get a look at many development deals that are going on in the marketplace and that allows us to be more discerning with respect to our development pipeline.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.
Rich Hightower: Hi, good morning, guys. I want to go back to a couple of the prepared comments in terms of delinquencies, and I guess the longer term assumption that that delinquency rate will revert more to historical norms. Every time we talk to your coastal peers, regulatory risk is obviously very prominent in the decision to diversify outside of certain markets. I assume this is part of that. So I guess what over the longer term gives you the confidence that the regulatory environment in that regard will indeed get back to where we were pre-COVID?
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s a good question. And it’s definitely something that’s on our mind. And we will say that it’s frustrating from time to time, but I guess we would ask that everyone take a balanced view of these regulatory risks and look at the other side. And then the other side is that limited housing supply really comes from all the regulations that make it difficult to build housing in these markets. And so we try to balance that equation as best we can and knowing that we are a beneficiary of the supply issues that California has because there is always another regulation that is making it more difficult for us to build housing right around the corner, which is what keep supply under control in California. So keep that in mind. And we know that we need to be a strong advocate with respect to sensible housing policies, and we’re going to be active in that area going forward. But again, we would hate to trade away the unique benefits that we have given the supply restrictions in California.
Rich Hightower: Okay. I appreciate. There is two sides to the comment there, Mike. Maybe one quick follow-up, I mean just are you able to delineate for us on this call, the bad debt percentages in terms of leases that were signed in the pre-COVID advantage, true sort of COVID hardship at the time versus any leases that were signed in the world started to get better again. I mean – and people that were gaining the system after COVID was already a factor early to do that?
Michael Schall: I’ll start and then flip it to Barb. A lot of this – there was nothing in the pre-COVID period that indicated that there were any issues with delinquency. So I’ll make that comment number one. Most of the issues that we have are really related to the government – the governmental agency, which is – there is a website called Housing Is Key. And they have very recently about 7 billion in applications and they paid out about 1.9 billion, so they are way behind. And so there is this delay in getting reimbursed for all these claims, and Barb has some information about what’s in process, etcetera. But I guess the key here is that the state agencies are way behind, and there is a lot of money that has been submitted, and we don’t know – we don’t have control over what’s going to happen with those funds. And so we’re just going to have to wait, which led to what we hope to be is obviously conservative guidance. We weren’t intending to be conservative, but we realize that some of these factors are out of our control and so that we are maybe to the conservative perspective, but we just don’t know. Barb, with that said, I think you have some additional numbers.
Barb Pak: Yes, Rich. So in terms of our cumulative delinquency, we’re at about $67 million. We have applied for reimbursement for 80% of that, so about $53 million. And of that amount, $33 million relates to our existing residents. However, the tenant – the timing and amount of being able to collect that is unknown because the program prioritizes based on the resident area meeting income, which is something that we’re not fully privy to at the time they apply. The remainder is applications we apply for on behalf of past residents. Now our ability to collect on that is if the resident will engage, and that’s unknown at this time, but we have applied for everything that we can. And as Mike said, the state of California has been slow to disburse funds, which is causing a lot of the noise in our numbers at this point.
Rich Hightower: Okay, thanks for the color, guys.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Brad Heffern: Hi, Barb, thanks. I was wondering about rent to income. You talked in the prepared comments about the big divergence between urban and suburban. Can you give any figures about where rent to income have trended in those two splits? And if they have moved, has that largely been because rent has moved or has income moved as well? Thanks.
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike, and maybe Angela may have a comment too here. But generally speaking, the good news is that incomes are moving and that affects us in terms of our guidance, but it also helps us charge more rent or allows us to have higher rent levels and helps us much more than what it cost us on the operating expense side. So we’re pleased with higher income levels, and we’re seeing that throughout our portfolio. And in terms of numbers, so Southern California, for example, has a rent to median income. This is the median – this is not our data, this is a general data that comes from our data vendors, but using median rents and median incomes, we’re currently at 26.9% rent to income in Southern California versus the long-term average of 22.3%, so well in excess of that average. And then conversely, in Northern California, we’re currently at 22.1% rent to income versus a long-term average of 23.1%, so well below in that regard. Seattle is a little bit different. It’s at 21.1% versus 18.7%, respectively. So it suggests that it’s higher in the rent to income versus the long-term average, although that market has changed pretty dramatically in terms of it going from being a lower cost to a higher cost or higher rent market over the last 10 years or so. So I’d say, it’s fundamentally changed its nature. Does that help answer your question?
Brad Heffern: It does. I mean one of the things I was trying to get at is, specifically for Northern California, when you have the backfill after the initial sort of COVID pain, I’m curious, did you see significantly lower incomes from those people? And that’s part of what caused the pricing pressure? And is there any reversion of that or is the pricing pressure truly just due to other factors?
Michael Schall: Yes, if that’s the question, yes. No, we see – so take the leisure and hospitality segment, which lost a tremendous number of jobs because the state shutdown the restaurants and the hotel shut and travel were shutdown basically. So all those people that are generally pretty low wage earners left the Bay Area and went somewhere else. They migrated far and wide or went home with parents, etcetera. And so we’re starting to see them come back. They are skewing the data in terms of their impact on rent income. It looks like we’re bringing in a lot of lower-income workers, but it’s just replacing what we lost a while ago. So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the Bay Area or any of our markets with respect to income levels. I think they are still in very good shape. The tech companies continue to – they didn’t lose a lot of employees, and they continue to hire at robust levels, at high income levels. And then those high income levels are what really drive the demand for the services, all the jobs that we lost early on in the pandemic. And the high incomes – people here make enough money that they can pay a little bit more for their dinner and some of these other services. And so we just don’t see that as a key issue. The key issue is, how do you draw back people that left in the early parts of the pandemic, how do you draw them back now. And I think that’s an ongoing process. Is that helps?
Brad Heffern: Thank you. Yes, that’s perfect.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
John Kim: Hello. I was wondering if you talked about sourcing new preferred Med has been challenging in this environment. Would you consider doing deals outside of your core markets, not necessarily to own the equity, but just provide a wider pool of more opportunities?
Michael Schall: This is Mike. Actually, I’m going to give it to Adam in a minute, but we – the answer is, we are, to some extent. In other words, we’re not going to completely different markets that we’re pushing into other markets. Adam, we want to give them a couple of examples of deals that we’ve done?
Adam Berry: Yes. John, so we have been tracking in other markets since really the platform was put into place, and we’ve actually – we’ve done – echo on my set. So we look slightly outside of our markets to where we think the fundamentals are still there. They – and so a couple of that we have done, we did one in Redland [ph], which is Inland Empire. That one is going well currently funded. And then we have one round trip in Sacramento. That market has obviously done very well. So we continue to track markets within our overall footprint, but a little outside, and we will consider a little further beyond that.
John Kim: Okay. So nothing outside of the West Coast really?
Michael Schall: Yes.
John Kim: My second question is on your revenue-generating CapEx guidance of $100 million, which is more than double what you invested in last year. How much does this add to same-store revenue growth this year versus 2023? Is it fair to assume that most of this CapEx will be outside of Northern California?
Barb Pak: We actually are looking at these opportunities throughout the portfolio. So it’s not skewed toward one region because we are seeing strong market rent growth in all of our portfolios in all of our regions. And as far as when they will be realized, less likely in 2022, just because, as you know, it takes time to renovate and then get them leased up until that time. By the time that occurs, you certainly wouldn’t have a full year of revenue. So it’s more likely going to impact 2023.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, thank you. Mike, in your prepared remarks, you referenced that buyers in the markets are not really discerning, I guess, between location and maybe vintage of product. And so is that simply just a function of the amount of capital that’s coming into your markets and chasing deals? And separately, is there really any opportunity for you to pull forward any portfolio management objectives as a result of kind of everything seemingly converging in pricing?
Adam Berry: Hi, Austin, this is Adam. I can start with that and then if Mike has any follow-ups. So we’re seeing a different buyer pool for different vintages and different locations, but ultimately, what you said in your question is right. There is so much capital chasing these deals, whether it’s coming from value-add funds or larger core funds or whomever that the compression between product age type, construction type and location has been significant and continues to remain today. As it relates – Mike, do you want to cover that?
Michael Schall: Yes. The – could you repeat the question about the portfolio?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. Just portfolio management objectives trading around some markets, increasing product quality, whatever sort of is in your...?
Michael Schall: Yes, the broader management objectives, yes. We continue to believe that we can add value in a variety of ways. And it isn’t that we are necessarily going to dramatically increase our portfolio allocation to any one market or decrease it. I think that we are overall pretty happy. We want our to see how the pandemic recovery plays out. Like everyone else, there is a number of unknowns about portfolio transitions, and we would like to get into a more normal world. As I mentioned in the – in my prepared remarks, the laggards of the last 30 years from now are top-performing markets. Is that possible that, that continues, or does it revert back. And I suspect that there will be some fairly significant amount of reversion. As we think of the world, we think that probably the urban core – again, given issues with homelessness, crime, etcetera, are probably a mile – negative mile to significant negative. Hopefully, the cities get control over some of these issues. I think they can definitely do that with respect to crime. I am not so sure that there is a plan when it comes to homelessness. But again, that’s pretty focused on the urban core, much less so in – throughout the suburban parts of our portfolio, which is where the vast majority of our property is located. We have commented actually before the pandemic on deemphasizing the city centers, partially due to what I just said. And so that remains something that we will take a look at and potentially transact around going forward. But overall, North South balance, Seattle, I think was doing really incredibly well, great job growth and couple of key drivers up there in Microsoft and Amazon are really pushing that market. So , we would like to increase our portfolio up there actually, but it’s difficult to find the product at the price that adds value, so more to say, we have been there before.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. Got it. And then just maybe given where the stock is trading, certainly preferred, I think have the preferred equity investments have been one of the most attractive you have referenced. But beyond that, given where your stock is trading, is the joint venture still one of the best uses? Do you take a look at issuing from time-to-time where you are trading today? What’s sort of the thinking around your cost of capital and potential uses?
Michael Schall: Yes. When we look at deals, our deal generation is sort of independent of how we capitalize or how we take the deal down. And where we believe that we are adding value to the company and that could be core FFO or cash flow and/or NAV per share to the company, we will take it down on the balance sheet. And at times like now where we don’t think we can add value, we will do it in our – one of our co-investments where we are still a substantial owner. We still own about 50% of these transactions, and we manage it and therefore, we earn some – a small amount of fee income. But it’s really driven by the capital side of the equation. And again, at this point, we probably wouldn’t issue stock. We would prefer to transact in a co-investment format.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Just one follow-up question to that, the North and South – Southern California balance in the portfolio either for Mike or Adam, I guess I am listening, Mike, to your opening remarks and the unset investment takeaways by Northern California by the laggard or maybe sell or prune the winners just in terms of the dispersion of relative rents we have seen in the last 24 months. So, kind of pounding the table on the mean reversion trade, why don’t you have as much conviction to go out and tilt the portfolio on the margin towards Northern California more heavily?
Michael Schall: John, it’s a great question, and Adam, will you bring me 100 buildings in Northern California, please, at a 3.8% cap rate. That’s the answer. It’s not there. And if we could do it, we would. We did buy one property in Fremont, again, a co-investment. We would buy more if we could, John. But again, the markets are going to evolve and perhaps, we will continue to see more products hit the market. And we wouldn’t – for high-quality property in the right areas of the Bay Area, we are not black lining the Bay Area by any means.
Adam Berry: Just to tack on a little there. We see every deal that’s marketed and every deal that’s not marketed, and so it’s always a relative game. And so we are underwriting consistently up and down the portfolio and jumping in where we see opportunity for that value add. Otherwise, we have seen deals in Bay Area closed at 3.1%, 3.2% cap, and that’s not where we are going to compete.
John Pawlowski: Okay. So, going in economic yields are still meaningfully lower in Northern California than LA, Orange County, San Diego?
Michael Schall: I keep telling Adam. I say, Adam, well, interest rates are going up. So, what’s going on with cap rates. And Adam keeps telling me, they are pushing down, right. I mean that’s effectively what we have seen.
Adam Berry: That’s effectively right. And so John, it’s not even going in. So that 3.1%, 3 2% cap that I quoted is economics. So, taking all units to market as of today. So, there is – it doesn’t include any future growth, but that’s still absorbing loss of lease, so, yes, very competitive.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi. I guess it’s still morning out there. Good morning. I wanted to – I have a question on your blended rate. I guess I am trying to better understand the cadence in the back half of the year versus the first half and some of the key drivers or underlying assumptions. You started off the year on a strong foot. You seem to be fairly optimistic about an improvement in back half of the year. But looking at the guide, there is a massive drop-off to get to your same revenue guide. So, maybe you can help me understand or square that a bit more. Thanks.
Barb Pak: Sure, Haendel. It’s really more of a function of the year-over-year comparable. And so we expect the first half to be much stronger because first half of 2021, it was still quite soft. And of course, we started recovering in the second half of 2021. And so from a year-over-year perspective, this year, the second half will be harder comparable, and that’s really what’s driving the trends.
Haendel St. Juste: No, I understand that. So, I guess maybe helping us understand maybe the delta perhaps between some of the regions in the back half of the year. Obviously, there is some tailwinds helping North Cal, but perhaps, North Cal has more headwinds given how well it’s reformed. So, maybe a bit more color perhaps on maybe the spread that you are thinking of there?
Barb Pak: Well, in terms of the spread, what we see is, in Seattle, would be the highest from a year-over-year on the second half because it has higher loss to lease and lower delinquency and better concession benefit. And Northern California and Southern California are pretty much very comparable. Southern California, because of the challenge by delinquency, while Northern California has that concessionary benefit and so they end up more similar, but in terms of spread, we are not talking – we are talking, say, 40 basis points versus not hundreds of basis points. So, they are all pretty not close.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. That’s helpful.
Barb Pak: And Haendel, just one question, are you asking about market rent growth or same-store growth? I am just trying to understand?
Haendel St. Juste: Yes. No, I guess the first question was more on the blended rate growth within the same-store, but the market commentary is helpful.
Barb Pak: Okay.
Haendel St. Juste: Where are you guys – I mean I don’t know if I missed it, but you guys mentioned where you are sending out renewals today for February and March?
Barb Pak: We didn’t – let me take a quick look. So, on the renewals, we are sending out – hold on, 2022. Where is that, here. So, we are sending renewals out, portfolio average in the low teens, so around, say, 13%-ish. And with Seattle, the highest, followed by North Cal and in South Cal, around 10%-ish.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. And that’s helpful. Mike, I guess a question for you. I heard your comments earlier about VC investment. And I understand there is a lot of profitable and very viable, established companies, tech companies today, but I guess I am curious, how concerned you might be regarding the ongoing Facebook or Meta troubles and the number of not yet profitable start-ups. I guess I am curious what – any level of concern you might have at all as to what might happen to your job growth assumptions that these companies have to cut G&A?
Michael Schall: Yes. Haendel, it’s definitely a concern. But I don’t think in terms of the STEM graduates and the workers that are in these fields, I don’t think there is any shortage of positions that might be available to them. There is plenty of jobs out there. I was coming out of college, I worked for venture capital company. And so I was there for quite some time, and it’s amazing how different the world is. And these companies are venture financed for a much longer period of time now, and the rounds are much larger. In fact, I think most of the money that was deployed that I discussed in the script was mega rounds, rounds exceeding $100 billion. So, we have some concern about it. Obviously, those companies are more vulnerable. And therefore, I think that’s warranted. I have been through that in my career in the late ‘90s, where all these companies went public and without a product, and they didn’t work out well. So, I think the current model of venture capital funding is much better and much more resilient. And a lot of these companies, the best ones will see it through. And the ones that don’t succeed, I think the employees have plenty of opportunity out there at some of the other companies. That’s what makes the Bay Area such a unique place from a technology employment standpoint.
Haendel St. Juste: That’s helpful. And if I could squeeze one more. I don’t know if I missed that number, too, but did you guys tell us what’s embedded in the guide for rental assisted payments for this year?
Barb Pak: Haendel, this is Barb. Like I mentioned earlier, we have applied for $52 million of our cumulative delinquency, $32 million of that is our existing tenants, and we feel good about that number. However, the timing is very uncertain. And what we do is, we forecast on a net basis. So, we have assumed that delinquency does increase this year because of the uncertainty related to the timing of payments on the – these applications as well as the California program, which the applications have exceeded the amount that’s already been allocated to the State. So, there is a variety of things that led us to that assumption.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. So, if I understand it, should you be successful in getting – I guess I am trying to understand, how – what level of payments are kind of embedded? And where the upside – where that line lies, I guess I am having trouble understanding what exactly is the net number, the absolute number that’s included in the guide this year?|
Barb Pak: So, in our guidance is a 2.4% delinquency as a percent of scheduled rent. That’s what will drive our numbers. And one thing that we are seeing is our delinquency has gotten worse overall – our net delinquency has gotten more over the last couple of months as more of our tenants are applying for aid as the program has changed recently to allow tenant supply for three additional months. Therefore, applications are going up. So, there is a lot of moving parts on that front, but the net number is, we do expect delinquency to get slightly worse this year before it gets better.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thanks. I will follow-up offline. But thank you all. I appreciate the time. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your questions.
Rich Anderson: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. So, is there any logic to the concept that regulatory environment could actually be a good thing in terms of being a magnet for residents. I know some of your peers are running because of regulation, but on the other side of that table is perhaps a resident – I don’t know. I would like to know that I have tenant-friendly regulation behind me if I am living in California. Is there any relevance to that line of thinking in your mind, Mike?
Michael Schall: Yes, Rich, it’s a good concept. People generally don’t think they are landlord very much. We don’t hear a great deal of appreciation. But having said that, I mean I think that tenants do appreciate it. Candidly, from my perspective, I worry that it’s taking advantage of the system as opposed to we will offer a safety net, we are all for helping people out that it can go too far in trying to find that comfortable middle ground, I think is what they are trying to do. And I am very glad I am not managing that program, by the way. So, I think it’s a good point. I think people do appreciate that part of California, and – but they are going to do what’s best for them, which ultimately will come down to their job and their quality of life and those factors that we spend most of our time thinking about.
Rich Anderson: Right. I mean Costa-Hawkins reversal is defeated. CPI plus 5% state-wide rent cap. I mean these weren’t terrible events in the life cycle of multifamily California, but anyway. Second question is, you mentioned that cap rates are still going down with, I guess what we would call the threat of rising interest rates, still tenures at historical lows. But I look back, 2018 tenure was over 3%. And I had looked at what you said in your call at the time, you said cap rates are running around 4.25%. So, are you kind of quietly hoping for perhaps an increase in interest rates to something more like that and also inflation because of the pass-through qualities of multifamily and that you could really start to see some opportunities come. I know it’s 3.1% now on the cap rate, but maybe that changes if we get some real change to the interest rate environment, and that perhaps opens up opportunities for you and you are more substantial cost or capital raising opportunities versus your peers?
Michael Schall: Yes. No, it’s a great question, great observation. And I think that the company is positioned sort of for the worst-case scenario, whatever might be in terms of the balance sheet and the overall structure. A world in which incomes are inflating and rents are inflating is a good world for us, I think. I mean I think that there will be opportunity. And even though our – probably, our interest costs would go up in that scenario, the vast majority of our debt is pretty well locked down in terms of maturities and rates. So, that would be a good world for us, and I think there is a reasonable chance that’s where we are on.
Rich Anderson: So, is a four -handle type cap rate, is there anything systemic about your world right now that, that can’t happen even if a scenario of 3% plus 10-year were to happen because that – I would assume that, that’s a very realistic?
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s – I mean the comment I would make is that cap rates tend to be pretty sticky over time. So, they don’t just change overnight just because interest rates move up or down. And I would say, back in those – the 2018 period you were referring to, we were maybe a little frustrated that cap rates weren’t moving down somewhat given how much the tenure had rallied. But until the COVID period, they remain pretty sticky even though you had pretty significant reductions in interest rates over that period of time. I think that probably you are not going to see cap rates adjust upward quickly. There is too much money looking for a yield and yield investment and 3% versus some of the options is still 3% and is still in the scheme of things interesting to some investors. So, I wouldn’t expect that to change it. Really is all about the flow of money and the number of investors that need yield and what the other yield alternatives are.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra. Please proceed with your questions.
Chandni Luthra: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you talk about the drivers behind sequential same-store revenue declines in some of your markets in fourth quarter? I am talking about markets like San Diego 3%, San Fran down – about 2%. Similarly, Contra Costa, I mean how much of this was perhaps a disappointment on return to offices? We were just crossing that Labor Day mark versus faced some seasonal factors that had a role to play here.
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. It’s Angela here. The sequential revenue decline really was not a concern for us this time because it’s really attributed to the timing of the lumpy delinquency recovery. And so what I mean by that is, in the third quarter, we have very favorable delinquency recovery. So, if you take San Diego, for example, if I back out delinquency, the sequential revenue growth would have been 1.6%. And so a similar relationship plays out for both Contra Costa and in San Francisco as well.
Chandni Luthra: Very helpful. Makes sense. And my follow-up question is around your collections operating model. Now you talked about rollout by the end of 2022. And you also said that you implemented this in Orange County and San Diego. So taking that sort of as an example, and let’s say, thinking about 10% to 15% reduction in personnel to natural attrition across the portfolio. Is there a way to contextualize that in some cost savings, either in terms of dollars or in terms of margins? That would be very helpful.
Angela Kleiman: Yes. I think the one example that we provided with the rollout and some of our other enhancements has already realized a saving of about 150 basis points in margin improvement and that represents about $15 million to the bottom line to NOI. And so my point in providing that context is that from a – if you look at the rollout, we are only a third way through and that was – that represents a rollout of really just two of our major regions. And so – which is why I provided indication of an additional 200 basis points to 300 basis points expectation of margin improvement just from the cost savings. And of course, with revenue, there is more to come on there, but that’s several years down the road.
Chandni Luthra: Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hi. Just maybe wanted to explore your comments around being pushing further out in the suburbs. I guess how do you think about kind of identifying these new targets further out from the urban core? And does this also imply you will have more capital recycling for those assets closer in?
Adam Berry: Hi Joshua. This is Adam. I can start off. As Mike noted previously, we have been somewhat rotating outside of the urban centers now here for a few years since – before the pandemic, and so we use our research team to assess. We look at all the top line metrics to see what areas within kind of our core footprint makes sense. And that’s how to say, Sacramento, for instance, that deal was done pre-pandemic. And even at that point, the – between job growth and income and affordability, lack of affordability for single-family homes, it made sense on all of our metrics, which – that’s what drives our investment decisions. So, we have a research team that reviews all those metrics amongst a number of both our more core markets as well as more secondary markets.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I appreciate your participation on the call, and we hope to see many of you in the not distant future at the Citi Conference. Thank you. Good day.
Operator: This does conclude today’s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-27 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Good day, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 2022, apartment market conditions, and then conclude with the regulatory environment. Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting substantial improvement in West Coast economic conditions and housing demand. Net effective market rents are now 6.4% above pre-COVID levels and it's notable that we've exceeded pre-COVID market rents despite having recovered only about 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic. As a result of improving market conditions, we reported quarterly core FFO of $3.12 per share, $0.08 per share above both our sequential results and guidance provided last quarter.  This is the first of likely many quarterly sequential improvements in core FFO. Southern California continues to deliver the strongest growth with net effective rents up 17.2% compared to pre-COVID while Northern California is still down 5.2%. Return to office delays at many tech companies and slower job growth compared to other West Coast areas were factors in the pace of recovery for Northern California. Overall, September job growth in the Essex markets was 5.2%, substantially above the U.S. average of 4%. Turning to our outlook for 2022, we published our initial market rent estimates on page S-17 of our supplemental package. We are expecting 7.7% net effective rent growth on average in 2022 with Northern California, the notable laggard in 2021, forecasted to lead the portfolio average in market rent growth next year.  A key assumption driving our outlook for 2022 is the return to a predominantly hybrid office environment occurring over the first half of the year, supporting our 2022 job growth outlook and our expectation that the West Coast markets will resume their long-term outperformance versus U.S. averages. Our confidence in the Bay Area recovery next year is partially driven by rental affordability following a year of solid income growth, lower effective rents, and exceptional growth in single-family home prices. Median for-sale home prices are up 17% in California and almost 16% in Seattle, making for-sale housing more costly relative to rental housing and often impeding the transition from renter to homeowner.  Finally, despite large increases in for-sale housing prices, our expectation for the production of for-sale housing in 2022 remains very muted at only 0.4% of the single-family housing stock. We previously noted that many large tech companies in our markets have delayed their office re-openings as a result of the Delta variant this fall, which we believe is the primary factor in the slow recovery of Northern California compared to other Essex markets. Nevertheless, recent tech Company announcements regarding office expansion, open positions in the Essex markets,  and new commitments to office space all support our belief that the leading employers remain fully committed to a hybrid office-centric environment on the West Coast. Page S-17.1 of our supplemental highlights recent investment by large tech companies which have continued throughout the pandemic and include Apple's 550,000 square foot recent expansion in Culver City, their new 490,000 square foot tech campus that will soon begin construction in North San Jose, and a recent acquisition of five office buildings with a total of 458,000 square feet in Cupertino. Google last quarter received needed approvals for its planned 80-acre campus near Downtown San Jose, and YouTube's 2.5 million square foot campus in San Bruno was just approved by the city last week.  We continue to track the large tech companies hiring in terms of open positions and job locations, giving us confidence that we continue to grow alongside the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy. Our most recent survey of open positions indicates 38,000 job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest tech companies, up 9000 jobs or 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Strong economic growth on the West Coast is further supported by venture capital investments which achieved new highs in Q3 '21 of $72 billion, of which 44% was directed to organizations in the Essex markets. Turning to our supply outlook for 2022, we are expecting 0.6% housing supply growth for the full year, including 0.9% growth for the multifamily stock which is manageable relative to our expectations for job growth of 4.1% in 2022.  Overall, our West Coast markets will remain well below the national rate of new housing supply growth and especially compared to the rapid accelerating pace of housing deliveries across many low-barrier markets next year. Longer term, residential building permits in Essex markets saw a modest 3.5% increase on a trailing 12-month basis, which is favorable compared to the U.S. where permits have increased 13.6% compared to one year ago. While our markets often temporarily underperform the national averages during recessions, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, including the cadence of housing supply deliveries with permitting data supporting our West Coast thesis.  Turning to the apartment transaction market, we continue to see strong demand from institutional capital to invest in the multi-family sector along the West Coast as evidenced by increasing transaction volume and cap rates in the mid-3% range. Apartment values across our markets are up approximately 15% on average compared to pre-COVID valuations. The Company has recently seen more development opportunities, and we were able to purchase two commercial properties in the third quarter. One located in South San Francisco that we expect to become a near-term apartment development opportunity, and another in Seattle that we will begin to entitle for apartments while earning an attractive 6% going in yield with a high-quality tenant. We also recently closed two apartment acquisitions as noted in the press release, and our acquisition pipeline is strong.  Barb, will discuss a new co-investment program in a moment, which is strategically important given our preference not to issue common stock at the current market price. Finally, the California statewide eviction moratorium ended September 30th. However, a few meaningful local jurisdictions have extended their separate eviction prohibitions. The net result is that a significant portion of our portfolio remains subject to eviction moratoria and other regulations that will slow the pace of scheduled rent growth in 2022. Fortunately, the federal tenant relief program has come to the aid of many of our residents, although the reimbursement process continues to be slow and require a significant coordination and support from the Essex team. I am grateful for this extensive team effort. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. First, I'll start by expressing my appreciation for our operations team as we are in the midst of a strong recovery, our team has been busier and working harder than ever. I also want to thank the support departments, especially our delinquency collections team for their diligence to help our customers navigate the complex rent reimbursement legislations. On to today's comments, I'll provide an overview of our portfolio strategy relative to current market conditions, followed by some regional commentary and expectations for our markets. Our third quarter results reflect a combination of the operating strategy implemented early in the pandemic and a healthy recovery in net effective rents that began in the second quarter as California and Washington finally reopened from the pandemic shutdowns.  As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic-mandated shutdowns halted our economy, Essex quickly pivoted to a strategy that focused on maintaining high occupancy and coupon rents with the use of significant concessions. Now, over a year later, as our markets recover, we're starting to see the benefits of this strategy flow through our financial results. In the third quarter, same-property revenues grew by 2.7%, which is primarily attributable to a reduction in concessions compared to the previous period. By primarily utilizing concessions last year, we were able to limit the in-place rent decline to only 1.1% in the third quarter.  The benefit of this strategy is also coming through our sequential revenue growth, which increased 3.2% this quarter from the second quarter. With the market volatility we experienced over the past year, this is an extraordinary result and positions the Company well going forward. From a portfolio-wide perspective, market conditions remained strong compared to a year ago as demonstrated by the 12.6% blended net effective rent growth in the quarter. In addition, rents relative to pre-COVID levels have continued to improve, further enhanced by a delay to the typical seasonal slowdown in all our markets. Turning to some market-specific commentary from north to south, rents and jobs in the Seattle region have had a strong recovery with net effective rents up 8.3% compared to pre-COVID levels and year-over-year job growth of 5.5% in September.  New supply continues to be largely concentrated in the CBD, which is less impactful to Essex because 85% of our Seattle portfolio is located outside of CBD. Looking forward to 2022, as outlined in our S-17 of the supplemental, total housing supply deliveries for the region is expected to decline compared to 2021, and we anticipate job recovery to continue, led by Amazon, which recently announced plans to hire over 12,000 corporate and tech employees in Seattle. As such, we are forecasting market rent growth of 7.2% in 2022. Moving down to Northern California, which is our only region where net effective rents remain below pre-COVID levels.  Greater job loss and apartment supply deliveries caused net effective rents to fall further in Northern California since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the job recovery in Northern California has been at a slower pace than our other regions, with only 4.4% year-over-year improvement compared to a 5.2% for the entire Essex portfolio as of September. We believe this is partly driven by the more onerous mandates delaying normal business activities. Apartment supply, particularly in San Mateo and Oakland CBD, are also presenting challenges for nearby properties, leading to financial concessions for stabilized properties of over a week in these markets in September.  On the other hand, we anticipate that Northern California will be our best performing region in 2022, with market rent growth forecast of 8.7% on our S-17. As Mike discussed, we expect hybrid office re-openings to continue, which will drive additional job growth and healthy demand for apartment units. With similar level of supply delivery expected in 2022 as this year, we are optimistic that Northern California is in its early stages of its recovery. Lastly, on Southern California, rent growth has continued to improve in the third quarter and net effective rents in September are 17.2% above pre-COVID levels. As we have mentioned in the past, Southern California is a tale of two markets, the urban areas in the Downtown L.A. versus the more suburban communities, which have generally outperformed.  In June, L.A. rents were still below pre-COVID levels, but as of September, they are now 6.8% above. While Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura have achieved rents between 17% to 30% above pre-COVID levels. Job growth in Southern California continues to progress well, up 5.9% in September as the region's economy continues to reopen and recover. With the exception of the Downtown L.A. area where concessions averaged one week in September, the rest of our Southern California markets has demonstrated solid fundamentals with no concessions recognized in September.  We expect Southern California strong rent growth to continue in 2022, led by Los Angeles, which has just begun to recover the jobs lost during the COVID recession. Apartment supply into region is forecasted to increase next year compared to this year and could present pockets of interim softness counterbalanced by a continued favorable job to supply ratio across the region. As you can see on our S-17 market rent growth for Southern California of 7.1%, we anticipate this region to perform at a comparable level as Seattle. With this backdrop of stable occupancy amidst a favorable supply demand relationship, our portfolio is well-positioned for the continued growth. I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share. The favorable outcome was due to stronger operating results at both our consolidated and co-investment properties, higher commercial income and lower G&A expense. During the quarter, we saw an improvement in our delinquency rate, which declined to 1.4% of scheduled rent on a cash basis compared to 2.6% in the second quarter.  The decline is attributable to an increase in income from the federal tenant relief programs that were established to repay landlords for past due rents. Year-to-date through September, we have received $11.6 million from the various tenant relief programs, of which $9.5 million was received in the third quarter. Given the increased pace of reimbursements, we began to reduce our net accounts receivable balance in order to maintain our conservative approach to delinquencies and collections.  As a result of the strong third quarter results, we are raising the full year midpoint for same-property revenues by 20 basis points to minus 1.2%. It should be noted, this was the prior high end of our range. There are two factors I want to highlight as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance. First, as Angela discussed, we are seeing strong rent growth in our market. While there will be a small benefit to the fourth quarter, the vast majority of the benefit from higher rent growth won't be felt until 2022 when we have the opportunity to turn more leases. Second, our fourth quarter guidance assumes we continue to receive additional government reimbursements for past due rents and contemplates a continued reduction in our net accounts receivable balance.  Thus, we expect our reported delinquencies as a percent of scheduled rents to be above our cash delinquencies, which is consistent with the third quarter reported results. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.11 per share to $12.44. This reflects the better-than-expected third quarter results and changes to our full year outlook. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.28 or 2.3% at the midpoint. Turning to the investment markets, during the quarter, we raised a new institutional joint venture to fund acquisitions, as we believe this is the most attractive source of capital today to maximize shareholder value. The new venture will have approximately $660 million of buying power, a portion of which is expected to be invested by year-end.  As I discussed on our last call, we are seeing an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity investments due to strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing, which is leading to sales and recapitalizations. For the year, we expect redemptions to be around $290 million. Roughly 40% of these redemptions are expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the current environment, we could see continued elevated levels of early redemptions in 2022. In terms of new preferred equity and structured finance commitments, we are on track to achieve our 2021 objectives as outlined at the start of the year. Year-to-date, we have closed on approximately $110 million of new commitments. As a reminder, it typically takes 3-6 months post-closing to fund our commitments given they tend to be tied to development projects.  Moving to the balance sheet. As we expected, we are starting to see an improvement in our financial metrics, driven by a recovery in our operating results. In the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 6.6 times last quarter to 6.4 times. We believe this ratio will continue to decline through growth in EBITDA over the next several quarters. With limited near-term debt maturities and ample liquidity, we remain in a strong financial position. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nic Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
Nic Joseph: Thanks. As we look to 2022, how do you think about Essex's ability to capture that MSA market rent growth of 7.7% that you discussed? I know either from a regulatory standpoint or the lease roll perspective, just trying to tie the initial same-store expectations to the market rate data that you provided.
Michael Schall: Hey, Nic. It's Mike, and Angela might follow me with comments. I think we're feeling very good about conditions around us. Again, we have high occupancy throughout and a very strong loss to lease, and that's been noted before. Everything looks like our markets are recovering. We expect to outperform the U.S. with respect to job growth, certainly going forward, and we view the catalyst of the return to office in Northern California as being the last piece that's probably the relative underperformance that we've had thus far relative to the peer group. We see that as still being a very strong part of our portfolio.  Historically, Northern California produces the highest CAGR of rent growth over long periods of time, and we expect that dominance to show itself and a lot of the reasons why we're embedded in the various comments that you heard from all of us, so hopefully, that all made sense. The number of open positions for tech companies, the big investments that the tech companies continue to make within the Northern California markets, etc., I think it bodes well, so we really feel great throughout our footprint. But the key piece going forward, I think, is Northern California, we feel very good about that, too.
Nic Joseph: Thanks. Maybe following up on that, the return on the office or hybrid. How do you think that impacts seasonality over the next few months as employees maybe move back into Northern California specifically?
Michael Schall: I think that given that we carry high occupancy into this period of time, any incremental growth in jobs should have a very positive impact on market rents. So, again, our expectation is, I would say, Northern California was probably shut down to a greater level than most other markets, maybe L.A. would be number two, but it has had the most muted recovery, yet, it has, I would say, the strongest and most dynamic job base. So again, we're looking forward to that. We're hoping it would happen earlier.  But again, I think the Delta variant has postponed that. But again, we feel strong. We think all the things, all the conditions that we would expect to see from number of open positions for these companies, major commitments to campuses and lease commitments for office space, etc., all seem to be focused on a return-to-office program, probably in a hybrid sense for these companies. So I think that's before us in the not distant future.
Nic Joseph: Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. So first question, I guess, is on the topic [Indiscernible] inflation and all the ways that it's impacting the business. How are you thinking about that impact in regards to payroll, R&M, utilities? What levers can you pull to offset some of those costs into next year? Then maybe some broader comments on your technology platform, where you are in terms of the rollout of that and how that could be a help here as well? Thanks.
Michael Schall: Okay. Haendel, thanks for the question. It's a good one. I'll let Angela handle the technology piece of it. Help me. What was your first part of your question? I'm sorry.
Angela Kleiman: Inflation.
Michael Schall: Inflation, yes. Yes. So I mean, we've studied the inflation thing, the historical precedent going back a long time actually into the early 80s and no doubt, we are feeling quite a bit of pressure on the cost side. Certainly finding positions, especially on-site positions is challenging and compensation is going up, for sure. The one piece that's good in California, obviously, is property taxes because Prop. 13 limits that increase. I go back to rents. Rents are obviously the big thing. We're a high gross margin type of Company, and therefore, the rent growth really matters in this equation.  I think in an inflationary world, rents do very well. So I would expect that our rent growth would more than compensate for whatever cost increases that we have. I'm not saying, I want this to happen, but I think if we were in a more stronger inflationary period, I think it would be a net positive in terms of the financial performance of the Company. Obviously, if inflation goes up, all asset values decline in value. So maybe that would be one sticking point as well because probably cap rates change and some other things happen as well. Angela, do you want to comment on?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. But I think Barb wants.
Barbara Pak: Yes, I just want to follow up on that one point. Haendel, the other thing that we've done over the last several years is take advantage of the low interest rate environment and lock in our interest rates for long periods of time. We have very little debt maturing next year and the following year, so we're not susceptible to rising rates from that perspective. We've locked in our interest expense effectively, and we have very limited variable rate exposure as well. So we feel good about where the balance sheets stands from an inflationary perspective.
Angela Kleiman: Great. On the technology front, Haendel, what we have been doing is to really focus on ramping up the contactless interactions which also allows for efficiency and then allows more flexibility for our site team. So we are going to continue that path and further refine and enhance those technology, and what that means is that it will allow our staff to probably specialize more and hopefully continue to be more efficient, and that will help. I don't think it will be, say, an immediate relief as far as the payroll expenses that you're looking for, but over time, it should benefit the business platform.
Haendel St. Juste: So without putting words in your mouth, it sounds like the near-term outlook for inflation, does it necessarily spook you? Perhaps there's a little bit of pressure building in the business, but maybe not to the degree to perhaps put a mid-single-digit type of expense growth outlook for next year.
Michael Schall: Well, we're not guiding yet for next year.
Barbara Pak: Still working through the budget.
Michael Schall: Barb drilled that into a prior to the call. Please don't give out any guidance for next year. So we're still working on this. Yes, I guess the point I would make is in high gross margin businesses, even if you get some expense pressure, the top line is so much more important. So I think in my view, we always look at rents. What's the relationship between rents and incomes? So in an inflationary environment, if incomes are going up, we're probably able to pass through most of that in the form of rent. If that happens, we will do very well on that scenario.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Fair enough. The second question, if I could ask about the two office acquisitions here in the quarter. Maybe some comments around the math, the thought process. Should we think of these as opportunistic in more one-offs or perhaps more reflective of the low cap rates in your markets which could be making more conventional acquisitions more difficult? If that's the case, thoughts on calling some of the portfolio a bit or maybe taking advantage of some of the pricing? Thanks.
Adam Berry: Hi, Haendel. This is Adam. So I'll touch on both of the two office acquisitions that Mike touched on in the opening remarks. They're both separate, which is why I'll cover them separately. The first one which is in South San Francisco, we've had that tied up for over 3 years, and so during that time, we work with the city to determine what zoning we could get. During that time, we're basically able to increase the density by over a 100 units. So when you take that, coupled with the cap rate compression that we've seen in the market, the deal made more sense than really, any development deal that we've penciled in the last couple of years.  So there is in-place income on the existing use, it's in the, call it, high three cap rate range, which is fine. That will get us through to entitlements which we would expect in nine months to a year or so. The other one, somewhat of an outlier. It's a single-tenant office deal in Seattle, really good location. There's still another nine years on the lease, and we have a partial guarantee for that for that term. So it's north of a six cap on current income. It does pencil on today's multifamily underwriting, and it is actually zoned for multifamily, but we'll revisit that in 5, 6, 7 years from now to see what makes the most sense. But for now, that's a very solid covered land play from our perspectives.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Adam Berry: Sure.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Haendel.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
John Kim: Hi, this [Indiscernible] for John Kim. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering a little bit about the regulatory risks in your market. I know you've touched on that here and there, but are these increased risks being priced into valuation? Some of your other peers were citing that as a recent reduced exposure in California, and I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about that?
Michael Schall: Well, I'll start and I'll let Adam chime in here. Well, we've obviously dealt with regulatory issues over many, many years really, for the 35-years I've been here. Historically, the bigger the loss to lease gets because of rent roll, let's say, the more buyers and sellers will start pricing in a portion of it or want to higher cap rate given the delayed impact of rents. But generally speaking, all apartments are valued based on market rents today.  Then again, the loss to lease is a determination based on facts and circumstances. So with California rent control law, the statewide law, at CPI plus 5% max of 10% annual increase, I don't think that, that in and of itself will cause a significant valuation differential, and I think that's the key part that if you're moving your rents by CPI plus 5%, let's call that 8% or something like that, most buyers will think that that is plenty of compensation for the transaction. I don't think cap rates move all that much because of that. Adam, do you want to comment on that?
Adam Berry: Just one additional comment. The most onerous rent controls within California, San Francisco, or Santa Monica, or Berkeley, there's just very little that trades there. So that's where you see that the larger loss to lease, the bigger gap between in-place and economic, and that's where pricing would fluctuate more. But as far as AB 1482 goes, the California statewide one, it doesn't really factor in to really anyone's models from what I can tell.
John Kim: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the color. Going back to the inflation piece too, how is that affecting your planned developments? I know you briefly talked about the other commercial acquisitions and how relative to multifamily, those are still good trades. But moving forward in the development pipeline, is that something that you are really thinking about?
Adam Berry: It's something we consider in all of our strategic decisions. We're not focused on the office market. I want to be very clear that the two opportunities that we had are like fairly one-offs. But we look at all of those factors in determining where and what to invest in.
Michael Schall: I think we estimated about 9% between today and when we would start construction, for example, on the South San Francisco deal that Adam talked about earlier. Could that be high? We don't know. But we build in an estimated cost escalation. But what really drives all these deals, if cap rates go from 4.25-ish down to 3.5 or so. The built-in value of those transactions, other development transaction until, of course, land sellers adjust their price. It makes a ton of sense and gives a lot more value created in that process. Adam, do you?
Adam Berry: Yeah. So just one final follow-up there. We're always looking at the spread between where stabilized acquisitions or stabilized assets are trading versus our development yield. Whether deal is entitled or unentitled, we're going to look for a different spread between what in-place cap rates are, and so that escalation that Mike referred to, we assume on everything whether it's 3 months out, 6 months out, or 2 years out. Then that factors into the denominator. So with this cap rate compression, we've seen, especially on these two deals, and there are a couple of others potentially in the pipeline where that spread has increased, and those are the deals that we are pursuing aggressively.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.
Rich Hill : Hey, guys, just a quick question. Could you maybe provide us some details on your loss to lease across the various different markets so that we can compare them to the rental rates you disclosed for your macro forecasts?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. At September, the portfolio loss to lease was 9.8%, and it's a widespread, it's from Northern California into force to Southern California in the low single digits, around 13%. We understand that typically, analysts look to this loss of lease to model next year. So I want to just make sure that I provide a little more context on that because we want to consider a couple of factors.  First, this year was an unprecedented year because we started out the year with a huge negative rent growth and has turned positive. It's a very steep curve. This trajectory is not likely to repeat next year. Because of that, and the delay in the seasonal peak, it has created a small drag on revenue for next year. Secondly, some markets, those over 10%, which, broadly speaking, will be our Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura counties. They're above the 10% rent control cap. So that will be a factor as well.
Rich Hill : Got it. Angela, that was actually exactly what I was looking for. Just maybe one other question. When we think about the leasing spreads versus list rates, is there a lead lag there? Some of the data we look at is that listing rates seem to be a lot higher than the sign leasing spread. So I'm just wondering if the listing rate is the leading indicator on how you think about that?
Angela Kleiman: I'm not sure if I am following your question.
Rich Hill : Yes. So what I am suggesting.
Angela Kleiman: Are you talking about asking versus achieved? Is that what you mean?
Rich Hill : Yes. I'm suggesting, are you're asking in October, November, December higher than where you've been signed?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, I see what you mean. Normally, let's put it this way for now. It has been higher, but that's pretty typical. What we try to do is forecast what the rent level is going to be one or two months out, whenever we sent a renewal. So what that means is sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower. So if we think that we're sending out renewals now for, say, December, January, it's not likely to be a whole lot higher. But back in, if we're sending renewals out in March for renewals in May or June, it tends to be higher. So it really depends on the timing and the market conditions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. Thanks, everybody. I was curious, just going back to the market rent growth forecast, if you could just give some additional detail of how you thought about baseline scenario that maybe doesn't include some type of hybrid back to office and how you went about determining what that additional growth would be layered on top with that back-to-office scenario playing out? We know you guys tend to take a conservative approach, so just trying to understand the baseline versus what would the upside look like.
Michael Schall: Yes. It's a great question. Yeah, I'm not sure we approach it that way. I mean, our research group, Paul Morgan, they use a variety of data sets and they're not looking at any one thing, not creating some base case scenario. The simple part of it is looking at what we expect job growth to do and how many units of demand are represented by the job growth, and then how much supply do we have? So fortunately, again, we're 96% occupied in all these markets. So it is like we have a hole to fill before the demand over supply situation takes hold.  We're already there. But included in some of the things he looks at, which is, I think some pretty interesting data. For example, Seattle has recovered 79% of the jobs that they lost in the pandemic and he is expecting them to be at a 110% by the end of the fourth quarter. So they will actually be above their pre-COVID employment level. Whereas almost all the other markets are still below pre-COVID level by the end of 2022. So it's not that simple. He considers affordability, which affordability is a key part of what we do, and we look at things now because there's been such incredible growth in rents in Southern California, they screen, and the way we do affordability is on a market basis, not a property-by-property basis, because we're trying to look at the overall dynamic in the marketplace.  Southern California, because it has such great rent growth, is screening a little bit expensive, and Northern California, which has the highest incomes and rents that are pretty moderate given what's happened here. That's what leads to the better growth rate for Northern California next year. Just by way of background, I'll give you a quick comparison. So rents in Seattle and Los Angeles, the median rent, the market rent, not Essex portfolio is about $1,816 in both cases.  But in Seattle, the median household income is $102,000 and in LA, it's about $88,000. Paul would look at that relationship and say, that's a positive for Seattle. It has about the same rents, has a lot more room to run with respect to income, and that would factor into the equation in terms of what we expect market rents to do. That makes sense?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. No, that's very helpful color. So in that scenario, if demand were to exceed just from a job growth perspective, you talked about kind of the jobs versus supply piece. So if back to office does drive incremental demand above and beyond that. Is it conceivable to think that you could benefit from a pricing cars perspective, but also see some upside to occupancy as well?
Michael Schall: Well, occupancy is a little bit different element, and that really has to do with how aggressively we're pushing rents, and so occupancy, some have noted has actually declined a little bit, but that's really because we're pushing rents. When you push rents, you hold out a little bit longer and you are willing to accept a little bit lower occupancy level. But going back to our basic thesis, if we have 530,000 jobs created next year and the typical relationship between a household and a job is 2:1.  So we have somewhere around 265,000 units of demand for apartments, and we produce a total supply of 64,000 homes. We should do pretty darn well on that scenario. Again, affordability becomes the key issue, and affordability is different by market. We screen, relatively inexpensive in Northern California and relatively expensive than Southern California. But just looking at basic supply demand, we should be in great shape next year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. We think 7.7% is a big number, but we'll wait and see.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.
Rich Hightower: Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question here. I guess outside of restrictions within the confines of AB 1482 in California, are you guys self-limiting any markets or submarkets with respect to renewal rents, just kind of in that corporate spirit and being a good guy vis-a-vis your tenants that you guys have employed in the past, thereby sort of exacerbating that growth in the loss to lease as things go forward?
Angela Kleiman: That's a good question, and this goes toward the social responsibilities part of our corporate governance, right? We have a self-imposed cap of 10% for many, many years, and really, the approach behind that is to avoid being viewed as anti-gouging, and that strategy has worked well for us for many, many years, and it really has not materially negatively impacted the returns of our shareholders.
Rich Hightower: Okay, and Angela, which markets are you employing that strategy at this moment, if you don't mind?
Angela Kleiman: Well, it's broadly across the portfolio, and so it's wherever we have that hitting the loss of lease of up 10%, and so it happens to coincide with 1482. So it's Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura, because they're all above 10% loss of lease.
Rich Hightower: Then Seattle, perhaps?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, Seattle as well.
Rich Hightower: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Not 1482, but yeah.
Rich Hightower: Right. I mean, separate from 1482. That's what I meant. Yes. That's correct. yes. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Brad Heffern: Hey everyone. I was just curious in the Bay Area if you've seen any change on the move-in stats, if maybe more people are coming in from outside the metro versus what you've seen more recently?
Michael Schall: It's a good question, and the granularity of that data is difficult to follow, and so it's hard to say exactly what's happening recently. We do have job growth, and the job growth is exceeding the national average. So from that statistic alone, we feel like there were some positive movement back to the Bay Area and clearly occupancy, etc., has confirmed that. But we don't think that the major shift has happened. We expect it to pick up here in the next couple of months as we approach year-end and hopefully accelerate into 2022, and that's the premise. But again, I'd say we need more job growth than what we have currently to achieve the 2022 forecast that is on S-17. But we'll do fine either way.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it, and then on delinquency, can you walk through what the underlying trend has been? I know there's noise obviously related to the rental relief payments, but has the underlying level come down? How do you see that sort of playing out?
Barbara Pak: Hi, Brad. This is Barb. So you can see we report our delinquencies. For the quarter, we were at 1.4% on a cash basis, and keep in mind, we did report in July last quarter and that was at 2.2%. So that implies August, September had come down. That was around 1% on a cash basis, and then October is about 1%, and that's really being driven by the reimbursements. As I mentioned during the call, we got 9.5 million in the third quarter. Most of that hit in August and September, and in October, we've seen a commensurate amount, so that's where we've been at. We've been stable, I would think, the last three month. It's been pretty stable in terms of our net delinquencies.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Neil Malkin: Hey, thank you. Still morning out there for you. Just on that last question, when you say the delinquencies is 1%, that is net of the amount that you collected from the delinquency reimbursements from California and other jurisdictions. Is that correct?
Barbara Pak: Correct. Correct.
Neil Malkin: So without that, it would still be in that like two plus range? Is that around where it would be?
Barbara Pak: Yes. Exactly. It would be higher without those reimbursements. The reimbursements is what is driving that number lower, correct.
Neil Malkin: Yes, sure. Yeah. I was trying to understand what's baked in, and if anything has changed and how you recognize bad debt and how that looks, I get you. Okay. Thank you for that. Okay, and just in terms of the people moving into San Francisco, I guess, we'll focus on that one. You mentioned that, in general, your portfolio is seeing people come back, and I wonder, just given the in San Francisco that rents are still down from pre-COVID levels, are the demographics changing a little bit from the people who are moving in? Are they the same in terms of income, jobs, or are more people who are coming in, moving in from the outskirts, looking for a deal of some kind that would potentially impact your ability to retain those once market rents come back?
Angela Kleiman: This is Angela here. That's a good question. We have not seen any meaningful change in the demographic profile, and I think this question was also posed early on when rents declined or when we were giving out significant concessions. I think at the end of the day, it's all about jobs, and so while it's slightly more affordable, we just don't see people randomly moving into the city and then not being able to stay. Does that makes sense?
Neil Malkin: Yeah, yeah. I appreciate that. Just the other one follow-up, maybe just talk about development and sort of mezz outlook. You kind of touched on this earlier, but given everyone understands there's a lot of inflation with input costs, supply chain disruptions, hard to get labor, etc. But you made the comment that you're seeing increase in developments and a commensurate increase then in mezz opportunities. Can you maybe elucidate that a little bit? You think that it would be a tougher environment, but can you talk about what's driving that, and then what kind of opportunities you're evaluating right now and potentially the size?
Michael Schall: Actually, maybe, I think there are several parts to that, and I think we may need to clarify the question a bit here. But overall, we think 2022 will have roughly 4% more supply than 2021, and part of that is because there was the delivery delays caused by COVID, and eventually, they will catch up into 2022, but not enough to be really meaningful in the scheme of things, especially, again, when you go through the job numbers that we have and the implied demand from 530,000 new jobs across our footprint. Notably, on the supply side, Seattle is the one market that's down pretty substantially about 12%. So that's another gold star, let's say, for the Seattle market there. Barb, do you want to [Indiscernible] Yes.
Adam Berry: Neil, as far as on the street opportunities that we're seeing to kind of echo your point with costs having risen. Now that being said, costs are well down from where we were at the lumber peak in mid-summer. But taking all that into account, we're seeing a steady flow of deals, but fewer deals, it seems that are penciling and that's both on the mezz and pref side as well as on the direct development side. The one point I made earlier with cap rates compressing on existing products, they're also diminishing some on the development yields. There are competing factors as to how deals are being made today, but like I started with, there is a flow of deals happening. But again, those that are actually penciling are, I would say, fewer and further between.
Angela Kleiman: Then Neil, I just want to make sure that in my prepared comments, I did say that we had $290 million of preferred redemption this year, and given the current environment, if it is to continue low interest rates and high valuations for West Coast assets, we could expect early redemptions of a comparable amount in 2022, I would imagine. We could still face headwinds there, just given this environment. We're seeing a lot of developers able to take us out early for a variety of reasons. I wanted to make sure that you heard that as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions.
John Pawlowski : Thanks. Maybe a question for Adam. I think in the prepared remarks, Mike referred to apartment values being up 15% versus pre-COVID levels. Curious in the hardest hit markets to the Bay Area where you think current values are relative to pre-COVID levels.
Adam Berry: Yes. Thanks, John. As Mike pointed out in the opening remarks, that's an average. As it relates specifically to the Bay Area, there's been very little to trade, very little of substance. I think that number in the Bay Area is going to be anywhere between 5% and maybe upwards of 20%. But again, there's been really just two Class A deals that have traded and then some B and C deals that have traded. So we're talking about very limited data set.
John Pawlowski : Sorry. To clarify, 5% to 20% down or up?
Adam Berry: Up.
John Pawlowski : Up. Okay.
Michael Schall: [Indiscernible]
Adam Berry: Yeah, John. I'm just kidding.
John Pawlowski : [Indiscernible] Yes. Okay. One final question from me and then I'll jump out. I'd like to just drill down on San Mateo. Obviously, job growth improving, migrations up. But sequentially, each and every quarter, revenues keep declining in San Mateo. Can you just tell me what's going on in terms of the rental behavior, the durability of demand gains over the last few quarters, and when does it turn the corner?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, that's an interesting question in that the data set itself, I want to just give a little context because I think that matters. Our San Mateo market only actually has four properties in the same store, and so because of that, you are going to see a lot more volatility, and in addition, there has been good job growth and it's a good market for us. There has been lease up competition in the area. We're talking about an interim period where you have competition from lease up, well their job growth is still at a slower pace relative to our other markets, and then you add that with a small data set. It's going to just be a lot more volatile. It's not that there's anything fundamentally that we're concerned about with this market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Apologies if I missed this, but on your co-investment platform, has the interest from institutional capital to partner with you changed the economics of those deals at all? Or is the increase attractiveness that you talked about really been driven by lower debt cost in the market today and the higher LTVs that you can use in those agreements?
Barbara Pak: Hi, Amanda. Thank you for it. We've used the co-investment platform for many, many years, and we like it because it is an alternative source of capital win. We don't like our equity, our stock price, and so we've used it from time-to-time. We do think it's a good source of capital for us, and in terms of economics, we were able to reduce the hurdle rates and improve the economics for Essex. Cap rates have come down over the past year, 75 to a 100 basis points, and we're able to change terms accordingly. So the economics of the joint venture didn't change materially from what we've done in the past, but we will continue to use this source of capital going forward depending on market conditions.
Amanda Sweitzer: That's helpful. That's it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Chandni Luthra : I think it's officially noon on the West Coast, so I will say, good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with your redevelopment program. If you could perhaps give some color. I believe you started that last quarter where you're at and how are you thinking about it in 2022.
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. We started ramping up and I mentioned that last quarter, and we're going to continue to do so, especially in light of the recovery and the strength of the recovery, and of course, our expectations for market rent growth next year, and our goal at this point is really to double the number of renovations for next year compared to this year, and then ultimately, get back to pre-COVID levels because it does take a little more time to ramp up these activities, and as market conditions improve, we also make sure that we underwrite the improvements, and ensure we don't have capital destruction, and make sure that we're meeting the market, and optimizing our returns, and so it's not a turn the switch on, we just want to be diligent about it.
Chandni Luthra : Then Angela as you follow-up to that, how's ROI looking at on those redevelopments? Is that consistent with pre-COVID levels? Is there a big range to think about there? Just trying to understand that if you could throw some color on that as well, please.
Angela Kleiman: Sure. I'm happy to. We target our ROI at pre-COVID levels. But keep in mind it's driven by market rents, and so what that means is that ROI, the way we approach it is that we wouldn't proceed with a reinvestment opportunity if we're not achieving our target ROI. Therefore, if you're concerned that there has been any compression or deterioration there, there has not been.
Chandni Luthra : Got you, and then my sort of second question would be, one of your peers talked about earlier today about some impact on leasing velocity from Amazon's policy shift on return to office. Just wanted to check with you what are you guys seeing from your standpoint? Thank you.
Angela Kleiman: Let me make sure I understand your question. Are you asking about our leasing velocity whether it has changed because of Amazon?
Chandni Luthra : I mean, Amazon's policy shifts on return to office, the announcement a couple of age ago.
Angela Kleiman: Oh, the policy. Yes. I see what you mean. So we have not seen the impact from the Amazon shift. Because keep in mind, while, yes, they have the corporate mandate, but they also have a lot of workers throughout the region. Of course, all the businesses that support Amazon. But practically speaking, we have not seen an impact on our turnover, we have not seen an impact in our occupancy and certainly not an impact on our ability to raise rents.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.
Daniel Santos: Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. So my first one is on your stock price. You didn't issue equity in the third quarter yet on our estimate, and based on the Street's estimate of NAV, you're trading at a premium. Instead of issuing equities, are going to disposition and JV route. So I just was wondering if you could give more commentary on your views on your stock price and maybe using more equity going forward.
Barbara Pak: Yes, that's a good question. We always remain very disciplined as it relates to what source of capital we use. So we look at a variety of different sources; one being the equity, one joint venture equity, and one disposition, and keep in mind, with values up 15% from pre-COVID levels that puts our NAV where we think the value of the Company is, is up quite a bit from where we were at the start of the pandemic, and so that's a factor that we look at when whether we want to issue equity today or not.  The other factor to keep in mind is we have a lot of money coming back from preferred equity redemptions. We're using that to fund the new investments we're making along with using the joint venture platform. We really do you think it creates a lot more value for our shareholders given the fees and the potential to promote hurdle and given where our stock price is trading. We don't believe we're at a material premium to NAV at this point.
Daniel Santos: Okay. That's helpful, and then lastly, how much more are you expecting benefit from SmartRent? What's your timing on that?
Barbara Pak: Yes, and that's a great question. The value of our SmartRent investment is about $75 million today, and our third quarter financials, there's a lag effect there because the shares are still held within RTV until we come out of lock out, and their financials are one quarter in arrears for us, and so we would expect a fairly substantial gain in the fourth quarter. It could be up to $40 million, and then we would also have to recognize an unrealized deferred tax provision as well. That could be up to $12 million. Both of those numbers are not reflected in our full year guidance for total FFO. Just given the uncertainty, there's a lot of other moving parts within RTV that we don't try to predict that gain or loss. But those are the numbers related to SmartRent in and of itself.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions.
Alex Kalmus: All right. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to touch on SB 9 and 10, and what you expect the long-term impact to be on California housing supply there / what you're seeing on the ground if anything yet?
Michael Schall: Yeah. This is Mike, and good question. We are still waiting and guessing as to what might happen with SB 9 and 10, and of the two, the one that's more impactful is SB 9 because that would effectively have the state override local zoning laws as it relates to the development of ADU units, and so potentially allowing more ADU units to be built in the suburbs. So I want to note that there previously was a ADU law that was passed earlier this year, and this whole situation has been quite politically active with respect to the YIMBYs, the "Yes, In My Back Yard", versus the NIMBYs, the "No, In My Back Yard" groups, and that's going to be an ongoing battle.  So I think personally, given that there was an ADU law that was out there before and it had relatively little impact, that's going to continue to be the case. There was a L.A. Times article that was recently written and it estimate, I don't know where this estimate came from, but I'll just mention it for the sake of transparency. It mentioned that estimated 1.5% of single-family homes are likely to use SB 9. I suspect that will be high. But the backdrop of this is that Governor Newsom and various other sources have indicated that the state is short millions of homes, and the likelihood that SB 9 and SB 10 will change that, I think, is very unlikely.
Alex Kalmus: Right. Thank you very much there, and I just wanted to touch on the trajectory of potential renewals going forward given the CPI regulation. Would you consider pushing on that lever in future rent negotiations to make sure that over the span of a few years, you're able to get some market quicker? Or do you see that being just playing out similarly how it has in the past in terms of the difference between renewals and new move-ins spreads?
Angela Kleiman: Well, the CPI plus 5%, it's that, but it's cap to 10%. So it's not a metric that we have flexibility to push at our discretion, and we've been operating in this market even before AB 1482. We have assets that had rent control. Over a long period of time, it had comparable growth rates and we've operated well under these circumstances. So we don't think this is going to fundamentally change our ability to achieve our return targets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I was just kind of curious how you're thinking about pushing rate in the fall winter. It looks like some of your markets you saw a little bit of an occupancy dip, and maybe it's a different strategy across markets, would be great to discuss that as well.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, happy to. So this is an unusual year in that normally, we peak around July, and so starting, end of July, we start to have a deceleration for six months. This is an unusual year in that we had this huge ramp-up. We went from a big negative, I think, like negative 10% of market rent growth in Q1, and we peaked around, it depends on which markets, but Seattle and Northern California peaked around August, and Southern California is just peaking now, as we speak. So it's very different from that perspective, having said that, that natural seasonality does play itself out, and so the question is really a magnitude issue.  What we're going to continue to do is focus on at this point, wherever we can push rents, but more likely as we head into November, December, now focusing on occupancy, and I think some people noted that in the third quarter, we allow occupancy to fall a bit, but I want to emphasize that was because of the strength of the market, and now we're going to preserve those rents and focus on occupancy if we see that deceleration continue to continue.
Joshua Dennerlein: That's great, and maybe just a follow-up on that comment that SoCal is just peaking now. Is that late October peak? Has it been a leveling off or starting to see a little bit of pullback? Just curious where it is.
Angela Kleiman: It's between mid-October and now. So, say, in the past week.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay, great. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you, Operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to seeing many of you, virtually speaking, at the upcoming NAREIT. Until then, stay well, and again, thank you for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this point. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barbara Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. On today’s call, I will start with our second quarter results which were driven by a strengthening economy and positive [indiscernible] underly a robust recovery on the West Coast. I will also discuss the status of reopening the West Coast economies and related factors, concluding with an overview of the West Coast Department Transaction Markets and Investments. Our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected. With a strong economy and high vaccination rates, we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic related impacts are behind us. As noted on previous calls, our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and scheduled rent, both necessary for rapid recovery. To that end, net effective rents surged during the second quarter, along with year-over-year improvement in occupancy, other income and delinquency. The recovery in net effective rents continued unabated in July and we are now pleased to announce the July net effective rents for the Essex portfolio have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with our suburban markets leading the way while the downtowns are improving, but still generally below pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turned and Angela will provide additional details in a moment. Having passed the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward, we made a second set of positive revisions to our West Coast market forecast which can be found on Page S 17 of the supplemental. Driving the changes is an increase in 2021 GDP and job growth estimates to 7% and 5%, up from 4.3% and 3.2% respectively from our initial forecast. As a result, we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent growth to improve to minus 0.9% from minus 1.9% from the beginning of the year. To put this into perspective, consider that our net effective rents were down about 9% year-over-year in Q1 2021, given our current expectation of minus 0.9% rent growth for the year, year-over-year net effective market rents are now forecasted to increase about 6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2.6% of scheduled rent for the quarter and well above our 30-year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points. The American rescue plan of 2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance, which was allocated to the states for distribution to renters for pandemic related delinquencies. Through the second quarter collections of delinquent rents from the American rescue plan were negligible, as the pace of processing reimbursements has been slow since the program launched in March. We expect that to improve in the coming months. We expect delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time, as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections lapse on September 30 in both California and Washington. At this point, only about 7 million of the 55 million in delinquent rent shown on Page S 16 of the supplemental has been recorded as revenue. Given uncertainty about the timing of collections, no additional revenues are contemplated in our financial guidance. Even with the approved job and economic outlook, the reopening process was gradual through the second quarter, with full reopening declared in mid and late June for California and Washington respectively. The unemployment rate was still 6.5% in the Essex markets as of May 2021. underperforming the nation. Through Q2, we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic. Employment in the Essex markets dropped over 15% in April 2020 and while job growth in our markets outpaced the nation in the second quarter, we're still 7.9% below pre-pandemic employment compared to 4.4% for the U.S. overall. We see the gap is an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming months as we benefit from the full reopening of the West Coast economies. We believe that many workers that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic related shutdowns and work from home programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the pandemic. As we proceed through the summer months, we edge closer to the targeted office reopening date set by most large tech employers in early September. As recent reports about Apple and Google suggest the COVID-19 Delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process, our survey of job openings in the Essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong as we report 33,000 job openings as of July, a 99% increase over last year's [indiscernible]. New venture capital investment has set a record pace this year with Essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested providing growth capital that supports future jobs. Generally, economic sectors that fell the furthest during the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery in the reopening process led by restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues travel and so many. Returned to office plans which remain focused on hybrid approaches will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices. Given that many workers won't be required to be in the office on a full time basis, we expect average commute distances to increase. As we highlight on Page S 17.1 of our supplemental, this transition has already started in recent months, as our hardest hit markets in the Bay Area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond the NorCal region. In particular, since the end of Q1, the sub markets surrounding San Francisco Bay have seen positive net migration that represents 18% of total move outs over the trailing three months compared to minus 8% a year ago. These inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as Sacramento and the Monterey Peninsula, as well as renewed flow of recent graduates arriving from college towns across the country, a notable positive turnaround from last year. In Seattle CBD, we've seen similar or even stronger recent inflows and were likewise experiencing a strong market rent recovery. On the supply outlet, we provided our semi-annual update to our 2021 forecasts on S 17 of the supplemental, with slight increases to 2021 supply as COVID related construction delays shifted incremental units from late 2020 into 2021. We expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second half of 2021, with more significant declines in Los Angeles and Oakland. While it is still too early to quantify recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years, multifamily permitting activity in Essex markets also continues to trend favorably declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis as of May 2021, compared to the national average, which grew 230 basis points. Median single family home prices in Essex markets continued upward in California and Seattle grew 18% and 21% respectively on a trailing three-month basis. The escalating cost of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent. We suspect these trends will continue given muted single-family supply and limited permitting activity and believe these factors will be a key differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many U.S. markets with greater housing supply. Turning to apartment transactions. activity has steadily accelerated since the start of the year, with the majority of apartment trades occurring in the low to mid 3% cap rate range based on current rents. Generally, investors anticipate a robust rent recovery, especially in markets where current rents are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. With the recent improvement in our cost of capital, we have turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect to FFO accretion targets. With respect to our preferred equity program, we continue to see new deals although the market is becoming more competitive. Lower cap rates from pre-pandemic levels have produced higher than anticipated market valuations which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early redemption. That concludes my comments. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics. With the reopening of the West Coast economy the recovery has generated improvements in demand and thus pricing power. Our operating strategy during COVID to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions to maintain schedule rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand, resulting in same-store net effective rent growth of 8.3% since January 1, and most of this growth occurred in the second quarter. A key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our operations team and responding quickly to this dynamic market environment. While market conditions have improved rapidly during our second quarter -- driving our second quarter results to exceed expectations. I would like to provide some context for why sequential same property revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. The two major factors that drove this decline were 50 basis points in delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions. Delinquency in the first quarter was temporarily lifted by the one-time unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds, as expected in the second quarter, delinquency reverted back to 2.6% of schedule rents versus the 2.1% in the first quarter. On concessions, the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year. To be clear concessions in our markets have declined substantially and are virtually non-existent except for select CBD markets. Our average concession for the stabilized portfolio is under one week in the second quarter compared to over a week in the first quarter and over two weeks in the fourth quarter. Although concessions have generally improved in the second quarter, they remain elevated ranging from two and a half to three weeks in certain CBD, such as CBD LA, San Jose and Oakland. Given the extraordinary pandemic related volatility in rents and concessions over the past year and a half, I thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rent compared to pre-COVID levels. As of this June, our same-store average net effective rent compared to March of last year was down by 3.1%. Since then, we have seen continued strength and based on preliminary July results, our average net effects are now 1.5% above pre-COVID levels. It is notable that this 1.5% portfolio average diverged regionally, with both Seattle and Southern California up 5.8%, 9.3%, respectively, while Northern California has yet to fully recover, with net effective rents currently at 8% below pre-COVID levels. On a sequential basis, net effective rents or new leases has improved rapidly throughout the second quarter and preliminary July rent increased 4.7% compared to the month of June, led by CBD San Francisco and CBD Seattle both up about 11%. Not surprisingly, these two markets were hit hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rapid growth. Moving on to office development activities, which we view as an indicator of future job growth and according the housing demand. In general, the areas along the West Coast was the greatest amount of office developments have been San Jose and Seattle. Currently San Jose has 8.1% of total office dock under construction and similarly Seattle has 7% of office stock under construction. Notable activities include Apple leasing an additional 700,000 square feet and LinkedIn announced recent plans to upgrade their existing office in Sunnyvale. In the Seattle region, Facebook expanded their Bellevue footprint by 330,000 square feet, and Amazon announced 1400 new web service jobs in Redlands. We expect in the long-term areas with higher office deliveries, such as San Jose and Seattle will have capacity for greater apartment supply without impacting rental rates. While these normal relationships were disrupted during the pandemic, we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters. Lastly, as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum, we have restarted both our apartment renovation programs and technology initiatives including actively enhancing the functionality of our mobile leasing platform and smart rent home automation. Thank you and I will now turn the call over the Barbara Pak.
Barbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range we provided during the NAREIT conference by $0.08 per share. The favorable results are primarily attributable to stronger same property revenues, higher commercial income and lower operating expenses. Of the $0.08, $0.03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and G&A spend, which is now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year. As Angela discussed, we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few months ago. As such, we are raising the full year midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 50 basis points to minus 1.4%. It should be noted this was the high-end of the revised range route provided in June. In addition, we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint due to lower taxes in the Seattle portfolio. All of this results in an improvement in same property NOI growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3%. Year-to-date, we have revived the same property revenue growth at the midpoint up 110 basis points and NOI by 160 basis points. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.09 per share to $12.33. This reflects the stronger operating results partially offset by the impact of the early redemptions of preferred equity investments, which I will discuss in a minute. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.17 or 1.4%. Turning to the investment market, as we discussed on previous calls, strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalization of several properties underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments, resulting in several early redemptions. During the quarter, we received 36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan, which included 4.7 million in prepayment fees, which have been excluded from core FFO. Year-to-date, we have been redeemed on approximately 150 million of investment and expect that number could grow to approximately 250 million by year end. This is significantly above the high end of the range provided at the start of the year. However, this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding today, which is good for Essex and the net asset value of the company. As for new preferred equity investments, we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals, and we are still on track to achieve our original guidance of 100 million to 150 million in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our original guidance assume new investments would match redemptions during the year. However, the timing mismatch between the higher level of early reductions, coupled with funding of new investments expected later this year has led to an approximate $0.10 per share drag on our FFO for the year. Moving to the balance sheet, we remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1/3 of our debt over the past year and a half taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3.1% and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional two years. We currently have only 7% of our debt maturing through the end of 2023. Given our [indiscernible] maturity schedule, limited near term funding needs and ample liquidity, we are in a strong position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nic Joseph with Citi.
Nic Joseph: Maybe you started Barbara on the comments you just made on the preferred equity in the mez loan. In terms of the pipeline today, are you seeing any compression on yields or expected returns, already changes to the competition there?
Adam Berry: Hey, Nic. This is Adam. To answer your question, yes. We're seeing compression on cap rates. We're seeing -- it's a much more competitive market now with proceeds going well above where we're typically comfortable and rates going significantly below where we've been in the market. So to sum, yes, we are seeing the absolute compression on valuations.
Nic Joseph: Thanks. So then in terms of the early redemption that you've seen? I mean, is there a risk of further early redemptions that could at least create an air pocket on the earning side?
Barbara Pak: Hi, Nic. This is Barbara. At this point, I think we factored that all in and based on what we know today. And already -- almost in August. So I think we factor that into the current guidance. So I'm not expecting any more redemptions at this point for the rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: I wanted to just come back to sort of trends that you're seeing in your markets. And I appreciate all the color and commentary you gave us. But I'm hoping you can compare and contrast what you're seeing in your market specifically, versus maybe what someone typically thinks about in San Francisco, Los Angeles, the broader West Coast urban markets. So specifically, are you seeing people still continue to migrate in? Are you seeing people migrate out? One of those trends in your markets that give you confidence relative to maybe some of the urban markets are at trends?
Michael Schall: Hi, Rich. It’s Michael. I think I'll handle that one. And others may want to comment as well. But I think we feel really very good about what's happening here. Noted in my comments that we’re fully recovered with respect to market rents, versus pre-pandemic levels, while only recovered about half the job so far, so that I think -- that's a powerful place to start. And if we look around the West Coast, we feel great about what's happening. And we expect good times to continue that, consumer is super optimistic. They've saved money via COVID versus COVID, by not traveling and a variety of other things. So millennials are forming households. And there's a lot of hiring here on the West Coast. So that's why we talk about the top 10 tech companies and how many open positions they have, they've come a long way in the past year, after what we perceived as them pulling back amid COVID, on their expansion plans, I think that they're now turning that corner, or have turned that corner hiring more people pursuing things that they put on hold a year ago. And so everything feels like it's in good order at this point in time. As you go to the cities, the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of all the industries that have been so dramatically affected a year ago, including the leisure, hospitality, restaurants, filming in Southern California, et cetera. And as we look at the world, we're looking at, whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth and we think absolutely they are we think that, we're in a fluid areas, a fluid areas demand services, you're starting to see those services come back in terms of restaurants and a variety of other areas. And so we see this turning around nicely. And again, I wouldn't have expected to be fully back with respective rents at a time when we've only recovered about half the jobs that we lost. Make sense?
Rich Hill: Yes. It makes perfect sense. I was just waiting to see if anyone else was going to follow up. That's perfect, Mike. As we look forward, and at the risk of asking you to guide, which I'm not, we have this obviously a pretty significant trough that that came late last year and early this year. Is it sort of reasonable to think that 2022 will be the mirror image of that? And then maybe we can -- if we maybe even continue to push rents above a normal trend over the medium term?
Michael Schall: It's a good question. And Barbara -- look at me very strangely, if we start talking about 22 at this point in time. So and how we are, we tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance. And so we don't want to go too far out there. But I would say that, I would expect, certainly the return to office to be a good thing for the downtown locations, because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach, which means that people are going to have to be closer to the offices to show up let's say plus or minus three times per week. As a result of that, the people that move to the Hinterlands, the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably are going to need to come back. And I think about Ventura don't want to pick on Ventura, because it's done great. But, it's a long way on a commute pattern from Ventura into the where the jobs are in LA. And I don't think people are even going to want to do that three times a week. So I think that kind of frames the dynamics, those that had a year, given the pandemic to make a different choice about where to live, I think will likely make a different choice going forward, now that there's more clarity about what the company is going to do with respect to their work from home or return to office programs.
Barbara Pak: The only other thing I would add is, Lisa's resigning today, we'll have half an impact to the rent this year to our rent roll, and that will carry forward into next year, too. I mean, look at Angela mentioned, we had a strong July, and so that is going to only affect part of this year's numbers.
Rich Hill: I got it. Thank you, guys. I'm not sure that's entirely what I wanted. But I appreciate the response. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys, hope you're all doing well. I'm just kind of curious what your mark-to-market is in your portfolio? And maybe if you have it by region, like Seattle, Northern California, Southern California.
Barbara Pak: Are we talking about lost lease?
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah, lost least.
Angela Kleiman: That's all right. All right. Well, in terms of the loss lease, we actually are in a much better position at a level even better than pre-COVID. So if we look at July lost lease for the Essex portfolio, it's now at 7.4%. And so and that, of course, varies, Seattle at the highest at about 12. Southern California, in the middle of the pack at about eight, and Northern California at the lowest as well, three and a half.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, awesome. And in your guidance range, what are you assuming as far as like a recovery for the rest of the year and rate for the Northern California market?
Michael Schall: I'll start. The second half of the year, as each -- we have to turn leases in order to impact our same-store or our revenue. And so if you get toward the end of the year, it becomes less relevant and more relevant, obviously, next year. So, take a transaction in October, you only have three months of that new lease in 2021. The rest of this is going to be in 2022. So there's an inherent lagging, concept with respect to what's going on with marker rents with Angela just talked about versus how it shows up on the on the income statement. So I think that's important, in terms of just looking at market rents. We tried to provide a little bit of color on that. And with respect to S 17, is what we're trying to get out that, overall, our economic rent growth on S 17 is at minus 0.9%. And that's a 1/12 of every month throughout the year. So January 2021, versus January 2020, plus February through the year divided by 12, is what that number represents. So we started the year at a rate, in the minus nine to minus 10% range. And that implies to get minus 0.9%, on S 17, that the fourth quarter would be plus 6%. And that does not anticipate a lot of rent growth between now and then, which is pretty typical, we typically hit the peak of market rents in July, at the end of the peak lease season, and then flattens out for the rest of the year. So that's what's assumed in those numbers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks, guys. It seems possible that your markets could experience an extended leasing season, it certainly come up on other calls, and some seem pretty optimistic about the prospects. But clearly, as you identify, there are some risks to take into consideration. So just wondering, kind of how you went about your back half guidance? And did you assume typical seasonality or sort of that another leg up in demand in the late summer, early fall timeframe?
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. And I agree with you, we did not -- we assume more or less the typical, trend with respect to market rents. So kind of peaking in July and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year. As we think about it, however, there are some things that are different, for example, will the tech companies continue hiring normally, what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year, companies get business plans at the -- toward the third, fourth quarter, and then they start implementing them in the first quarter. That's what really drives the peak leasing season. So the question here is, will companies continue hiring at a higher level given COVID than they have in the past. I think there's a very good chance that could happen. I also, this work from home and returned to office concept could have an impact on that as well, if you have more people are moving back into the more urban areas from -- people that were displaced, as California and Washington were shutting down a year ago. If those people continue to come back, later this year that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year. So we've, again assumed based on our experience, and what typically happens to normal curve with respect to rents, but there are some things that are different here. And so we could end up with being surprised to the positive side.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. That's very helpful. And then, Angela, I think you mentioned that you're restarting the redevelopment program? Could you give us kind of the scale of that, or the annual run rate, and then maybe offer up some additional details on sort of the economics, that'd be really helpful.
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. Normally pre-COVID, our run rate was about in terms of units, about 4000 units a year. And what we did was scale back significantly last year. So second half of last year, we only renovated about 600 -- over 600 units, 650 units, so the target during the restart for the second half of this year is to double that. So say close to 1300 units this year. We are looking at a couple of large developments for the future -- for next year that will have no greater opportunities. But in terms of -- just the return on investments, we're actually looking at ranges pretty darn consistent with pre-COVID levels. And so while cost has gone up, but rents have gone up as well concurrently. So we think we're in a pretty good spot.
Austin Wurschmidt: And what are those numbers on the economics?
Angela Kleiman: They tend to range depending on the asset and the scope and the market but I'll give you a range that might be a little bit better than a hard number, they tend to range stay in the high single digits to the high double digits. So it's a pretty wide range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Robert W. Baird.
Amanda Sweitzer: I know line up on some of your comments on ramping up your development spending. Can you provide an update on areas you're targeting for those potential projects, as well as underwritten yields you think you could achieve?
Adam Berry: Hey, Amanda. This is Adam. Were you referring to redevelopment or development?
Amanda Sweitzer: I had thought you mentioned ramping up development along with acquisitions earlier in the call, but I could be mistaken?
Adam Berry: Okay, yes. I'm happy to take that one. So on development, yes, given where our stock is trading, and given some opportunities that we're seeing out there now where we can make sense of accretive transactions. We are definitely looking at ramping up the development pipeline. I’d say our main areas of focus would be primarily Northern California, Seattle. Those I see is probably the two best markets in that respect. But we're looking throughout our portfolio and throughout our footprint for deals.
Amanda Sweitzer: And then, any change in terms of underwritten yield, do you think you could achieve on most projects versus pre-COVID levels?
Adam Berry: So yes, good question. So what we're saying, we've underwritten several dozen deals over the last few months. The deals that we see going down primarily, cap rates have definitely compressed. So on the development side, we're seeing on unthreaded rents, return on cost at about 4 to 4.25 basically. So still a gap between where existing deals are trading, which are on the call, 3.25 to 3.5. We're going to look at numbers higher than that. We've not -- we wouldn't transact at a call to four development yield. But we're going to -- we would be looking at those 4.5 to high 4s.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.
Rich Anderson: So I'm interested in this 17 supplemental or S 17(1) I should say, the migration trends that you referenced in your prepared remarks. Is that everything? Or is it predominantly, kind of close in like Monterey, Sacramento type of net migration or in migration? And does it net out people that are leaving California entirely this? Is this the full number, number one? And number two, what do you think about this 18%? Is this like a sort of a knee jerk response to working remotely but closer to the office? And that probably this is peeking out at that this time? And it starts to come back down? What's the ceiling on this graph do you think?
Barbara Pak: Hi, Rich. This is Barbara. Yes, S 17.1, the 18% is a net number. So if you look back a year ago, we did have out migration, and that's what's showing in the negative 8%. And now we have people moving back and they're really coming from Sacramento and some of the outer line areas within California. But we're also noticing people moving in from college towns. So people, recent college grads are coming here for jobs, and it's really geographically dispersed. I mean, there's no discernible pattern from where they're coming from. It's kind of all over. And we do think that it does speak to the strength of our markets and people coming back and returning after the services have reopened. And the economy has reopened, now we're seeing the people return. And so we think it's a good sign and a good leading indicator. You should note that this Seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well. We're seeing a big in migration in Seattle as well. So we didn't show it here, but it's Bay Area and Seattle both have a similar chart, where there's a big influx. And I think you're seeing it in the rent growth that Angela spoke to and San Fran being up 11% in the CBD and NorCal and some of the other suburban markets in NorCal having bigger sequential rent growth more recently is partly due to this in migration.
Michael Schall: Rich, can I add -- make a broader comment and I would say the broader comment is that the migration out of the West Coast, our view was largely driven by businesses being shut down, and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck, and effectively forcing them to move to somewhere else. And I know that that sort of -- it doesn't fit the narrative, the narrative is that oh, all these people wanted to leave California. I think that reality is completely different from that. And therefore, I go back to my basic comment, which is do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with job growth going forward? And when you look at the components of that, okay, the hotels are now mostly open here on the West Coast, the restaurants are opening, and but we were still at 50% of capacity, a month or two ago. So, we opened completely on June 15. But that process has been relatively slow. And I think that's why job growth has lagged the U.S. as we've come out of the pandemic. But I guess the key point here is, most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration, it was caused by shutting down businesses. And then if you look at the flip side of that, are those businesses likely to reopen given, COVID is mostly behind us. And we feel 100% absolutely convinced that that will occur. And so, when we look -- we have some more broader information on migration in general, and a lot of the same things that we talked about a year or two ago, are still in place, the inflows into our markets tend to be the high cost, East Coast, metros, and the outflows tend to be into lower cost Western areas. So those trends really haven't changed all that much. But Barbara, this S 17.1 is trying to address specifically, the cadence of what's coming in and what's going out. And to your point, yes, of course, everything's in there, right here to try to push a narrative that is not reality, because if we do that, we're just going to shoot ourselves in the foot. So there's no evidence I think of Essex trying to be overly optimistic. And so we're trying to communicate what's really happening out there and what we're really seeing. So I guess I would --
Rich Anderson: Wasn't implying that I just, you mentioned sort of nearing areas, just want to make sure I was looking at the same thing. So the second question, 15, 20 years ago, Mike Schall and Keith Guericke were the heroes with 10% plus growth. And California was the place to be now, if you would, at that point, make some investments in this sunbelt? You'd be a hero, so the torch has passed, at least for now. But I assume your reversion of the mean, is your mind that certainly sounds like what you're saying, and do you see now is a particularly interesting time to be investing in your markets, for all the reasons you just described, but also, it's particularly special because of what's happened outside of California and Washington and what you think might come back? And that will be sort of a narrowing of the performance gap over the next several years.
Michael Schall: Yes, I know it's great question Rich. And our boards pretty focused on this geographic diversity issue, and some of the challenges that we've had more recently, with respect to regulation and other things. But we don't want to get too far away from sort of this longer term pattern, because, it isn't like, we're going to grow, every year the same, conditions change, but we remain focused in our analysis on which areas have the highest CAGRs or rent growth over time. And it may surprise you, because, you can say the West Coast has dropped off of that. More recently, yes, but if you look back 15 years, because I have these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us, Seattle, lead, all the major markets, with a 5.6%, 15-year rent growth CAGR, from 2004 to 2019. So, to the pre-COVID level. And Northern California was pretty close to that. And we start going down the list, and certainly Boston and Miami are pretty attractive in that respect, as is northern New Jersey. But then there are a lot of markets that really have fallen well below that. And so, our whole thesis here has been, let's try to identify the things that promote long-term rent growth and let's invest in those markets. And we can as you know, we've looked at some things on the East Coast before and we'll continue doing that. But I guess, as we think about thing, let me just make a simple comparison, let's compare San Jose with Austin. And, their cities have about the same size, same population. Austin has about 20,000 multifamily units in construction, whereas San Jose has about 8000. We also don't produce very much housing are for sale housing in San Jose, and the median price is well over a million dollars. So as an apartment owner, we look at that and say, are we better off being in San Jose, or in Austin, and we conclude that it's better to be in San Jose. I mean, Austin has to get extraordinary amounts of growth over and above San Jose, which, of course, is driven by the tech companies, which are doing really well, and they hire a lot of people. So I guess I would say the bloom is not off the West Coast. Yes, we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016. When, by the way, we had job growth in the 4% to 5% range on the West Coast, and then it slowed down because of affordability issues, because you can't have rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating an affordability issue. So there is a long-term, approach to the business. And I think that making vast portfolio decisions based on -- with all the unique circumstances and COVID would be misguided.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: First, Mike, seems like in a lot of your prepared comments, the risks of COVID or the Delta variant, throwing a wrench into the recovery seemed like, maybe I'm understanding wrong, like, lower or something that you're really not maybe waiting a lot. And I guess my question on that part is, are you -- have you thought about, the Delta variants, how -- it's spreading a lot quicker. I think I've just seen some studies that say, like, vaccinated people can also read it as well, like, as easily as unvaccinated. And the markets that you're in are most likely to re-shutdown or re-implement restrictions. If cases rise, hospitalizations rise, et cetera. So, given, that's likely to happen as the fall comes, what kind of waiting do you kind of give to that notion of potential hiccup from reimposed restrictions?
Michael Schall: Yes, it is a good question. And an important question. And I guess I would say, unfortunately, we have no way to really figure out what COVID might do going forward. And but we were definitely aware of the risks. One thing that I think is a little bit different in California, clearly we've got population densities that are pretty high. And so the risk of COVID is perhaps greater given that, and I think the government actually has done a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the Essex markets. And I think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world. So the information I have is that the people with at least one shot and are 12 years and older, were in California, Washington about 82% vaccinated versus 67% for the U.S. So, I think that what happened here is, we tried to -- the government has tried to react to that risk by really pushing the vaccination rate, and they've done a very good job of that. So I think that lowers our exposure to some extent, but no doubt, areas with high population density, have different COVID risk than some of the other areas. And in this case, I think it's been dealt with effectively.
Neil Malkin: Okay. That's a really helpful stat. Thank you for that. Other ones for me is, your previous comment talked about, not making, I guess rash decisions or thinking about things on a historic level? And I guess if you look at to large peers, people don't like to say names, but coastal players have recently announced pretty significant capital plans in Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas, Austin. And I would imagine they have boards and a lot of stakeholders that they probably consulted with before they allocate a lot of capital. So, kind of with that being said, does I mean, do you give credence to that at all? I mean, does that -- does it make you think, maybe a little bit more about that? I mean, you referenced that permitting is down in your markets? And maybe that isn't, like, a good thing? Maybe that's like, a bad thing of people are focusing their growth prospects and capital elsewhere?
Michael Schall: Yes, it's a good question and very valid. And this is why we spend so much time in our prepared remarks talking about on with the top 10 tech companies we created that index, so that we could keep our eye on, where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies? Are they moving more to some of these other locations? And if so, what do we do about it? So, I didn't mean to imply actually that, we're so focused on, 15 years CAGRs of rent growth? So definitely, the historical information is important. But we're trying to supplement that in 100 different ways, with a ton of data sources that, that are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like. That's why Angela is talking about how much office construction, if you're going to build office buildings, presumably they're going to be employees in there. And we're going to need to build apartments to house those employees. I mean, these are all indicators of what's happening in the future. Keep an eye on the top 10 tech companies and their hiring trends. Again, both within California and outside of California. Super important in in that regard. Again, I go back to the industries, what are the driving industries? And what are the industries and sort of drive the entire machine? We can -- it's certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that are driving it, they are really the result of a fluent wealthy areas, demanding services. And guess what they pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that. And so I think what's happening here is, we're growing the process of all those people that were just displaced, from shutting down restaurants and other services. We're going to need to draw them back into the area. But I think that given the demand for those services and given the wealth that is been created here, by the tech community, by motion pictures, in Southern California, and other people that want to live near a beach, let's say, those services are in demand and they're going to come back at some -- it'll take a little bit of time, perhaps to do that. But again, we're trying to say, okay, let's stay focused on what are the drivers of the economy here. And again, as I look at it, and hopefully everyone will agree, tech is not going away or hasn't gone away. Certainly all the information that we've given out with respect to the tech companies over time, confirms the thesis that they're here, they're not going away, they continue to invest in our markets. Motion Pictures in Southern California, you can't shoot films where you require 50 to 100 people on a set during COVID, completely shut down demand for content not going away anytime soon. Therefore, there's a very good chance that that is going to resume and I can go try to go on beyond that. But I think that sets the point. If the drivers are intact, the things that follow, the demand for services, restaurants, et cetera will follow. And the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact, and then if don't produce enough housing supply, I would view that as a good day.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: So, Mike, two questions. First, the data on S 17, that is super. So if we were out in the Bay Area, like a month ago and saw San Francisco sort of empty. Are you seeing that with this 18% increase that now like San Francisco would be active and all of the apartment REITs that have reported this quarter, who have all shown the San Francisco to be the weak link that will -- you're saying that we will see that changed substantially over the next few quarters?
Michael Schall: Alex, so you're referring to be this -- move it back to the inner Bay Area portfolio on 17.1?
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes.
Michael Schall: Well, I would say that the trend has reversed and move it back to the Bay Area has begun. I would – yes, I caveat that, I think most of that is the service businesses, restaurants and leisure hospitality is the leader in terms of jobs coming back that was the area that was most severely disconnected during the pandemic. But and then we have coming out us in the not too distant future the tech companies and the return to office program. So I think if that continues that trend, and again, there are a lot of restaurants that converted to take-out-only mode. I think we'll go back to a more normal type of situation where those restaurant workers continue to come back as well. So yeah, I think it's mending not as fast as we want to, again I go back to the initial premise, which is we've gotten all the rents back to where they were pre-COVID with half the employment. I think that's a pretty powerful statement.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. If I'm just trying, I guess, Mike, if you look at like Manhattan, I know you guys are not in New York City. But the city came back a lot quicker than many expected even though work from home, only whatever 20% of buildings have people in them. But city rents and the occupancy rates have rebounded strongly, whereas San Francisco and Seattle Downtown respectively, we're still lagging. So I guess I'm curious if your view is that within a few quarters, we will see the downtown of San Francisco and downtown of Seattle rebound strongly like we've seen in New York based on what you guys are showing in this attachment S 17.
Michael Schall: Yes, it's a good question, Alex. So, New York, if you look at trailing three month of job growth. In New York, it was 10.2%, San Francisco was 5.2% and San Jose was 5.2%. So you have a pretty dramatic underperformance with respect to overall job growth. So I attribute that to again the West Coast needing to open up yet. We were still well into June at like 50% of capacity in restaurants and that type of thing. Whereas I'm assuming that New York. I don't know exactly what they did, but it is something to cause a fairly dramatic difference in terms of their resurgence and employment that hasn't happened yet on the West Coast, I think it's coming, but we're just a little bit slower than some of the other metros, including New York.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, the second question, Barb, on the guidance, you said that because of the mismatch in terms of accelerated debt and preferred equity, redemptions versus what you guys can put out. There is about a $0.10 drag. So is that $0.10 only in NAREIT FFO, but not in company FFO or is it in both?
Barbara Pak: It’s in both. Could the prepayment penalties or fees that we receive this year about $7.5 million. Those are only internal FFO not in core FFO. But what I'm referring to is just a timing issue. We've been redeemed gotten money back early. So we don't have any of the interest income from those investments. And we haven't put any money back to work and so that's the $0.10 that I'm referring to.
Michael Schall: We're looking at -- since that prepayment penalty is just really compensated us for having our money outstanding for a certain period of time, I'm advocating with Barb to change out so that it's not a non-core item because it's really -- we have a minimum earned preferred return and unfortunately, it's showing up in the non-core category rather than core.
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes, that, Mike -- that was going to be my point. You guys are very productive on this and whether you get paid out over time or you get it redeemed early, but they pay up and pay a penalty for that that is core part of your business. So that was my question is why you would exclude the positives that come from this platform and I mean it sounds like you guys are having that internal debate. But I mean you're successful at it and no point in not really showcasing the earnings potential there.
Barbara Pak: Yes. We have looked at it. We have a sense of follow GAAP accounting rules and so it's more complicated than it appears on the surface. But yes, there is an internal debate internally. But what we booked year-to-date has all been non-core for the prepayment fee.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Thank you. Regarding Northern California and the recovery. I think, Angela mentioned in the prepared remarks that July effective rents are still 8% below pre-COVID levels and I'm not sure if that was a market rent concept or for Essex. But I was wondering if you're going against easier comps given you were more aggressive on concessions beginning in the third quarter last year. And if the recovery could be faster than we think.
Michael Schall: Yes, I'll let Angela to comment on the number for San Jose. But I would say what's happened here is, and we had colors on previous calls that have said hey, with negative job growth, how are you able to maintain high levels of occupancy in the cities. And obviously, a great question and the answer is that was of course that we drew people because the price point was lower, we drew people from other places into some of the better locations. So they improved their location given lower rents and so now you look at this equation, 96% occupied people starting to come back and there is no availability and therefore market rents are doing what they're doing. So I think a lot of this is really driven by our strategy during the pandemic and now it will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years because with market rents now back to where they were pre-pandemic level, what is the movement within the portfolio yield, both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents. So in the case of San Jose. San Francisco and Oakland, there is still substantially below the prior rent. So there's still reason to believe that those people that moved in given lower rents will stay, but that may uncouple over the next several years.
John Kim: And so, was that 8% figure that Angela quoted was that for Essex or the market overall?
Angela Kleiman: But that was for Essex.
John Kim: Okay. Mike, you mentioned cap rates in your markets are low to mid 3%, which sounds like it's compressed about 50 basis points at least from last quarter. Can you comment on the assumptions that you think the market is placing now that's changed whether it's rental growth or exit cap rate and whether or not you agree with those assumptions or I believe the rationale?
Michael Schall: I'll start with the comment and the comparison in the last quarter and then flip to Adam to talk about cap rates more generally, but I think last quarter what we said was in some of the hard-hit areas that buyers will performing some rent recovery. So it probably wasn't a whole 50 basis point reduction. It was really that they were using really the current net effective rents. They were assuming a bit higher rent level. So that reconciles part of that. But Adam, you want to talk about cap rates in general?
Adam Berry: Yes, sure. So I think the general assumption that buyers are making is that there will be a full recovery. And by that, I mean with rents greater than pre-pandemic levels. And we're already seeing those rents that we've already talked about during the call. So it's in the low threes, I think pretty robust rent growth over the next few years. And then probably knowing out is what I -- is the various people, I've talked to that with our modeling and then non-exit caps. I think this is as aggressive as ever. So I don't think there's much assumption that there is a big expansion on the exit side. So underwriting has definitely gotten more aggressive.
John Kim: Is there a big difference between your markets or urban versus suburban?
Michael Schall: Yes, good question. So going kind of north to south, Seattle, we've actually seen a pretty big pickup in transactional volume and that's probably among the most aggressive markets that we're seeing in the CBDs on kind of current net effective rents, we're seeing high-twos to low-threes and in the markets that really just too much of a hit on rents, we're seeing those like maybe in the 3.25 to 3.5 range and that is much more suburban outer markets. And then going down very little in Northern California is traded. So that the hard to really opine there, but it's in that probably low threes range and then down to San Diego, Orange County, those markets performed better from a rental aspects. So, those cap rates on current net effective aren't quite as low as what we've seen in those harder hit markets. So it's probably closer to that 3-4, 3-5 kind of range and very little in LA traded as well. So it's down in the kind of low threes but there is very few data points.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: On the federal funds, I think you mentioned in the prepared comments that there was a negligible amount received to-date and that there really isn't much in the guide either. I was curious if you had any figures around maybe what you have applications out for some sort of risk assessment of what you might receive on that?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. Hi. Its Angela here. So out of, I think we reported that we have about $55 million of delinquencies out there and we've applied for about $18 million and to-date, we've received $4 million of it. So about 20 some percent recovery rate. As far as we could tell, it's really more of a slow going because California just has a more complicated and slower reimbursement process. So in our view, the $18 million. We don't view that $18 million as having significant risk from that perspective. The reason we didn't bake it into our guidance for this year is really the timing is the question and just given that the rate of the reimbursement has just been much slower. So that's really the key driver of why it's now in this year's guidance.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And that $4 million, I assume that's largely been this month just given you said there wasn't in the sort of negligible in the first half, is that right?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. For the most part of this month.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then just one administrative sort of one if I could, in the press release, there was a 6.3% blended rate number for July. But then in the commentary, I heard a 4.7 number, I just wanted to verify what those two things, we're talking about?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. So the 4.7% is a sequential month-to-month. So what I was trying to do is provide a real time picture of what's happening in our markets. So comparing July to June of this month, it's already up sequentially 4.7% on a net effective basis. And so what's in our supplement, they blended lease rate is a year-over-year so that compares July of this year to July of last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.
Alex Kalmus: Looking at your Southern California occupancy is quite high and we've heard a lot this quarter from others that the delinquencies are in their portfolios or sort of concentrated in this part of the country. So I'm just curious, what would happen if -- once the moratoriums are up. Does that affect the occupancy levels on a physical basis in your mind, or how do you see that playing out there.?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. It's a good question. Yes, we agree with the others that Southern California and really specifically Los Angeles is a big part of the delinquency, the largest part of the delinquency and therefore there is some question about what might happen, but it's not a huge percentage, and we expect to work with our residents to the extent we can. And so I don't think it will have a huge impact on occupancy overall. So, but it remains to be seen, because we can't envision exactly what that scenario is going to look like. And but it's just not enough, I think to really severely impact us.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much. And just thinking about the regulations on your rent increases that are in place when you're sort of internally discussing the difference between holding occupancy or pushing rate. Is there any momentum to say you'd rather keep the base rates pretty high to then expand a little more there and maybe lose a little occupancy as a sacrifice or is still hold occupancy as a primary driver?
Michael Schall: It's different by in each region and so there is a 1000 different pieces of that equation because there's been so much movement in rent. And so the answer is going to very varied by region, and so it's difficult to generalize throughout the portfolio. But we think that we will be able to work with residents. We've tried to do that in the past that will continue going on in the future and certainly with respect to any of the delinquency that's not covered by some of these programs to make good on the COVID-related delinquencies. We will try to work with our residents that as we have in the past. Again, it's a little bit difficult to try to figure out exactly what that means from different areas because sets of regulations and a variety of different places from emergency orders to state rent control and the like. And so it's sort of a case-by-case basis. It's difficult to generalize.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Adam, I appreciate on the cap rate commentary. I'm trying to square there is really low cap rates to the commentary about ramping or being more positive on external growth because from the cap rates quoted feels like you guys are trading at NAV discount. So can you maybe just help square the external growth appetite and the prevailing private market pricing.
Adam Berry: Sure. Yes, I mean you hit the nail on the head. It's the reason why we haven't been super active on the external growth side, but most of the transactions that have gone down and have not been accretive and to your point from an NAV standpoint not accretive as well. We're seeing a few more opportunities out there that will fit and our stock is reasonably up although still I'd say when you're looking at the low threes that's still that puts us in the trading below NAV range. So we are underwriting everything being more aggressive, where we feel like we can make a difference on growth accretion as well as FFO. But I guess you that. that's why we haven't done much so far.
Michael Schall: John, I would add to that. This is Mike. Obviously, I would add that we're closer now than we were 30 year or 45 days ago somewhere. We're getting close. I mean debt rates have come down quite substantially as you know, and so there at least is a hope that we will be more active, we are looking at a lot of deals, Adam’s looking at a lot of deals. And so we're pricing things out and trying to make the numbers work and again we're going to remain disciplined to NAV of the company versus what we're seeing out there in the transaction area. We picked up the fundamental behind the success of the company over long periods of time.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Now understood things are moving quickly. Maybe just Adam or Mike, pace of prevailing private market pricing today, if you had to double down on the market., you had to exit the market, what are the kind of the top and bottom fix.
Michael Schall: Yes, I'll let Adam deal with that one.
Adam Berry: Good question. Yes. Thanks, John. So double down. I'm a big fan of Seattle in general. I mean I would say East side especially given the jobs picture there. Even though supply is slightly elevated, I think the jobs picture there is significant and it's a lot of tailwinds. To exit a market, you have all of our markets, but maybe [indiscernible].
Michael Schall: So we're definitely interested in actually to have -- that's one property.
Adam Berry: I joke. Yes. Ventura has had a pretty good run here as of late and it continues to do fine but again if we had to pick a market. But like I said, we are focused on our entire footprint and so we'll go in where we see opportunities.
Operator: There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Okay, very good. Thank you, Doug. Appreciate that. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and we know we covered a lot of ground. If there are any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us and we thought it was a great dialog and we look forward to seeing many of you hopefully at a conference and in-person in the near future. Thanks for joining the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-28 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. I'll start today with our first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, including factors that lead us to believe that 2021 will be a year of recovery from the pandemic and then conclude with an overview of the transaction market.  I am pleased to note that Essex was founded 50 years ago in 1971 by our Chairman, George Marcus, and we are very proud of all the company has accomplished. George remains keenly focused on the company's mission, strategy and business plan execution. I also want to recognize the extraordinary effort of the Essex team, which has allowed us to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength and ready to seek opportunity that often comes from associated uncertainty. The Board and senior leadership team greatly appreciate this collaborative effort. Finally, the company's commitment to the balance sheet strength and a growing dividend was reaffirmed with our recent announcement of our 27th consecutive annual dividend increase.  Turning to our first quarter results. Severe lockdowns in California and Washington remained a headwind in the quarter after intensifying last November amid a surge in COVID cases and hospitalizations that has only recently abated. Our very strong results in the first quarter of 2020 and a plethora of pandemic-related regulations and associated job loss were significant impediments to the company's performance this past year, as reflected in this quarter's results, with same-property revenues and core FFO down 8.1% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to a year ago. On a sequential basis, same-property revenues improved by 10 basis points, driven by growth in several suburban areas and particularly in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties of Southern California.  As noted in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 guidance ranges, and we continue to expect improvements in same-property revenue growth, driven by job growth and easier year-over-year comparisons. Apartment demand continues to be strongest in properties farthest from the urban centers and weakest in the cities, both being a function of new apartment supply and pandemic-related job losses. On a trailing 3-month basis as of March 2021, year-over-year job losses were 9.2% and 5.4%, respectively, for the Essex markets and the nation, marking significant progress compared to the 14% decline we saw in the Essex market shortly after the onset of the pandemic and also suggesting that our markets remain early in the recovery process.  Fortunately, the recovery of jobs appears to be accelerating as reflected in preliminary job losses for the month of March 2021, which were down 7.9% for the Essex markets and 4.4% for the nation. On a sequential basis, California and Washington outpaced the nation in March, gaining nearly 150,000 jobs, representing over 16% of the U.S. job growth with less than 13% of the employment base. As we suggested several quarters ago, we expect rents to recover on the West Coast as we recapture pandemic-related job losses that were directly impacted by shelter-in-place orders, including hospitality and service sectors, entertainment and filming and video production and tech jobs that were displaced to remote locations.  Hospitality and service jobs were disproportionately concentrated in the urban areas and wealthy suburbs. For the nation, jobs in hospitality and other services have recovered about 2/3 of their post COVID job losses. By comparison, to date, Essex metros have recovered less than 1/3 of these losses. Given the widespread recent reopening of California cities, these service sectors are again growing and their potential upside represents a promising differentiator for Essex markets over the next several quarters.  Film and video production was disrupted, once again by the COVID shutdowns over the winter months, followed more recently by a surge in film permit applications. Overall, production activity remains below normal for this time of year. However, data released last week from FilmLA highlighted a 45% month-over-month increase in film permit applications for March, as the industry benefited from the recent relaxation of stay at home measures in Los Angeles County. We expect the rebound in production to continue this year due to pent-up demand for content that has been disrupted due to COVID-19. This recovery should provide a positive tailwind for the industry and for rental demand in the LA market.  We are also pleased that many of the top tech companies have announced return to office plans supporting our belief that the hybrid model for offices will prevail with most employees spending a significant amount of time in the office for team building, collaboration, career advancement and related necessities. The largest tech employers in our markets had significantly reduced their hiring plans early in the pandemic, while also allowing many of their employees to work from home. With the cities largely shut down, many tech workers moved to suburban or rural locations or back home with their parents. This trend began to reverse late last year, and we expect to see further momentum in the coming quarters as more tech employers reopen their offices.  As before, we track the announcements of the largest tech companies, and we have provided a time line of planned office reopenings based on public disclosures on Slide S-17.1 of our supplemental. We also provide a graph indicating the strong recovery in job postings for the top 10 tech companies with open positions in the Essex markets now above pre-COVID levels. We also track the job locations for open positions, noting that about 57% of their U.S. job postings was California or Washington as the office location. As of last week, California and Washington have dispensed at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to approximately 47% and 45% of their adult populations, respectively.  Overall, accelerating vaccine deployment and pent-up demand for services gives us confidence that we are now on a solid path to recovery. California's counties have begun to remove restrictions on commerce. And Governor Newsom recently announced that California is expected to effectively reopen on June 15, including key indoor and outdoor activities such as conventions and sporting events. These plans are subject to several protective measures tied to continued low hospitalization rates and sufficient vaccine supplies.  On the supply outlook, total housing permits, both single and multifamily, in our West Coast markets have declined 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis compared to the national average increase of 6.4%. The national increase in permits is being driven by a 13.9% increase in single-family housing permits, mostly in markets with low barriers to entry and rising home prices. In California, the median price of a single-family home increased 12.4% year-over-year as of February. Normally, one would assume that higher home values would lead to increased production.  However, single-family permits in the Essex markets are down 7.7%, which we attribute to a challenging regulatory environment and limited land availability, ultimately leading to fewer deliveries in late '22 and 2023. With large increases in for-sale housing prices, down payments have increased and the transition from a renter to homeownership has become more challenging. At the same time, the combination of lower rents from the pandemic and higher average incomes in the Essex markets has improved apartment rental affordability. We have seen these forces in previous recoveries, and they often result in periods of higher-than-average rent growth.  Turning to the transaction market. We successfully sold 3 apartment communities in the first quarter for $275 million at values that were similar to the pre-COVID period when our consensus NAV was almost $300 per share. As a result, we use property sales proceeds to fund preferred equity investments and repurchase common stock, both accretive to per share core FFO and offsetting a portion of COVID-related NOI declines. The strong rebound in REIT valuations over the past 6 months makes stock buybacks less attractive today, and we are now looking for undervalued or mismanaged property in our core markets to grow externally.  There were relatively few property sales during the pandemic, and most were completed by highly motivated buyers using 1031 exchange proceeds and other sources of attractively priced capital. Several of our suburban markets have rent levels that have increased on a year-over-year basis, and recent transactions have priced in the high 3% cap rate range. In the hard hit cities, buyers appear to be looking beyond the COVID impacts with apartments selling near a 4% cap rate using pre-COVID rents and NOI, roughly equivalent to a cap rate in the low 3% range based on current rents.  Strong apartment values have led to a greater level of redemptions in our preferred equity portfolio, the impact of which Barb will discuss in a moment. As conditions normalize, we are starting to see more properties being listed for sale. The unprecedented changes and uncertainty experienced during the pandemic will likely lead to a robust apartment transaction market as property owners adjust their strategies going forward.  I will now turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first quarter results and current market dynamics. In general, our markets continue to improve as the economy gradually reopens with the vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID restrictions and the recent announcements for a phased or partial office reopening by the major employers, which has contributed to job growth.  Our goal amidst the pandemic was to focus on maintaining occupancy and managing scheduled rent, which will position us favorably for revenue growth in the future. Accordingly, we adjusted our concession strategy to match the improvements in demand, which has enabled our same-property revenues to perform slightly better than our expectations. We have been successful with this strategy. And as a result, we maintained occupancy with scheduled rents decline, representing only 3.2% of the 8.1% total revenue decline for the quarter.  You may recall the underlying fundamentals in the first quarter of last year consisted of a strong economic backdrop prior to the COVID pandemic. In fact, our first quarter year-over-year same-property revenue growth back then was 3.2%, with revenue levels at historical highs throughout the entire portfolio. The strength of first quarter last year created a more difficult year-over-year comparable, which is also the reason why our new lease rates declined by 9.7% in the first quarter, as shown on the S-16, compared to the fourth quarter where the new lease rate declined by 8.9%. Consistent with the discussion on our last earnings call, the year-over-year decline in our major markets was primarily attributed to a combination of job losses from the pandemic, particularly impacting urban CBDs, which also had a greater concentration of supply deliveries.  Here are a few key highlights of the first quarter year-over-year performance by markets. In Seattle, the 7% revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, down 15.7%, whereas the remaining submarkets averaged a 5.2% decline. In Northern California, the 10.9% revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland and San Mateo, averaging a 15.9% decline, contrasted with a 5% decline in Contra Costa County. In Southern California, the 5.8% revenue decline continues to be primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A., which were down by an average of 13%, while our suburban Southern California submarkets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego averaged a 2.1% decline.  As you can see, our suburban portfolio continues to significantly outperform the urban markets. On the other hand, there are signs of improvement in our tech-centric urban markets. For example, first quarter sequential financial occupancies in San Francisco and Seattle CBD increased by 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. In addition, the sequential quarterly turnover rates declined at an average of 5.4% in these markets. We continue to anticipate that the urban CBD markets, particularly in downtown Seattle, Oakland and L.A., will remain impacted by greater concentration of supply deliveries, resulting in elevated level of concessions, which will moderate the recovery.  Although we typically do not place significant focus on sequential performance, because of the seasonality embedded in our business under normal market conditions, as we emerge from the pandemic, we view the sequential cost trend as a better indicator of our recovery progress. From this perspective, we have delivered 2 consecutive quarters of modest total same-property revenue growth, supported by comparable periods of job growth in our markets, which began in the fourth quarter of last year and has continued through the first quarter of this year.  More notable is the 110 basis points in sequential improvement of our average net effective market rent per unit, with Southern California continue to lead our portfolio growth. On average, new lease concessions improved from low over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter to about 1.5 weeks in the first quarter. While the magnitude may vary, this trend is in line with our forecast, where we had expected that market rents in our portfolio, on average, would trough between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Lastly, although office rental market has softened, major tech employers are continuing to expand in our markets.  Google recently procured the rights to build an additional 1.3 million square feet of space in Mountain View and Amazon in Bellevue began construction on a brand-new office tower as well as signing new lease and a development for an additional 600,000 square feet. With our economy approaching 50% reopening, we remain mindful of the market and legislative uncertainties as we continue on the path to recovery. In conclusion, our portfolio is stable with current same-store portfolio occupancy at 96.7%. Our availability 30-day out is at 4.4%.  Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.
Barbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04 per share, of which $0.02 is from consolidated operations and the other $0.02 relate to the joint venture portfolio and lower interest expense. Of the $0.02 beat on operations, $0.01 relates to higher same-property revenues and the other $0.01 is from lower operating expenses, which is timing related.  For the second quarter, we expect core FFO to be $2.92 at the midpoint, a $0.15 per share decline sequentially. Half of the decline is attributable to the loss of income on the early redemption of $110 million preferred equity investment, which occurred at the end of March and the $276 million of dispositions that closed at the end of February. There is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of a portion of the proceeds. And as such, this is causing a $0.07 decline sequentially.  In addition, we expect commercial income to be $0.02 lower as we had onetime benefits related to better delinquency collections in the first quarter that we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. The remaining decline relates to lower same-property NOI due to higher expected operating expenses and delinquency and higher G&A. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and core FFO per share.  Turning to investments. During the quarter, we received $120 million for the redemption of 2 preferred equity investments. One of the investments totaling $110 million was redeemed early as the developer was able to sell the property for a price that exceeded our pre-COVID valuation. We estimate the cap rate at 3.6% on pre-COVID rents and 3.25% on current net effective rents. As a result of the early redemption, the company received $3.5 million in prepayment penalties or $0.05 per share, which compensates us for the lost income on the portion of the investment that was made in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, for FFO purposes, we book this income as a noncore item. Given the strong demand to invest in apartments and cheap financing alternatives currently available, we may experience additional early redemptions of preferred equity investments in 2021.  Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured bonds with a 7-year term at an effective yield of 1.8%. The proceeds were used to refinance most of our unsecured term loans that matured over the next 2 years, allowing us to extend our maturity profile with no impact to interest expense. We now have less than $200 million of debt maturing between now and the end of 2022. Since the beginning of 2020, we have refinanced nearly 30% of our debt, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 60 basis points to 3.2%. This is leading to a significant reduction in interest expense in 2021 and can be seen in the first quarter results via the $4 million reduction to interest expense compared to the prior year.  During the quarter, we raised our common dividend by 60 basis points to $8.36 per share on an annual basis, our 27th consecutive dividend increase. This is a sign of our strong balance sheet and cash flow coverage despite the effects of the pandemic. With approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity and minimum near-term funding needs, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will remain disciplined as we look for ways to invest accretively to create shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question has come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: Maybe just starting on guidance. We saw two of your peers increase guidance today. And I guess everyone sets guidance differently initially. So some could be more conservative than others. But just curious, as you thought about revisiting guidance this quarter, in light of the 1Q beat, how things are trending the rest of the year versus your original expectations? Or are you trying to be a little more conservative and just wait for more operating results to come through?
Barbara Pak: Nick, it's Barb. Yes, we did have a good first quarter, and we did see some favorable outcome on our same-store growth. However, it is early in the year, and there is some uncertainty related to delinquency in eviction moratorium. So that play a factor into it. And then on the preferred equity redemptions, we do have some uncertainty there. We're likely going to exceed the high end of our guidance range on the redemption side. So we're just working through some of the timing on that, and we'll revisit it in the second quarter.
Nicholas Joseph: And how are you seeing the opportunities to redeploy those proceeds into either preferred equity or mezzanine investments?
Adam Berry: Nick, this is Adam. We have a number of deals in our pref pipeline right now that we're working through. The inherent challenge with pref deals is the timing and the lumpiness of when that money comes back and when it goes out. So we are working through that pipeline. We're also looking -- as more deals hit the market on the investment side, on the acquisition side, we're looking at all those as well. So working through it.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just first off on renewals, wanted to touch on that. We saw some softness greater than what we saw earlier in the year. And just wondering when you think with concessions coming down, occupancy holding stable and as we start to lap easier comps, when do you think we can start to see renewal lease rates begin to improve?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. That's a good question there. On the renewals, I think with -- to your point, with a year-over-year comp, that will improve as we lap the pandemic. What we actually are seeing is sequential improvement on our market rents. And so that is starting. And so as concessions continue to abate, and we have built a solid foundation with a strong level of occupancy, I do expect our performance to continue to trend better. But as Barb noted earlier, there are certain factors, right? There's delinquency that's unknown. There's legislative impact that's still uncertain there. And so we wanted to make sure that we factor all those items.
Austin Wurschmidt: So your comments, Angela, just as a quick follow-up on the occupancy levels. I mean, are you looking to push occupancy higher before starting to push harder on lease rates? Or is it at a level where maybe as we get into the peak leasing season, you'd feel more comfortable beginning to push a little bit harder on the lease rate front?
Angela Kleiman: At this point -- at this occupancy level, we're very comfortable holding it. And to us, we see that as a sign of strength to allow us to start pushing rents. But once again, I do want to make sure that we're cautious on our concessions land because that is a function of concentration of supply as well. So there are a couple of different factors. But to your point, yes, we are -- with the occupancy level where they are, we do feel comfortable to start pushing rents as we head into peak leasing season.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Got it. And then could you just provide an update on what percent of leases are receiving a concession today and sort of what the average concession is? And then maybe compare that to what it's been over the last several months?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, sure. I can give you quarter-by-quarter trends. And if you want to go into more granularly than that, we could talk about that. But we talked about in third quarter of last year, we had -- our concessions was somewhere around 3.5 weeks that represented about 75% of our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, that improved to about 60% of the portfolio at a little over 2 weeks. In the first quarter, now a further improvement, slightly below 50% of our portfolio at a little over 1 -- about 1.5 weeks. So that's where things are trending.
Austin Wurschmidt: Do you have any update for April by chance?
Angela Kleiman: I do. April is looking a little bit better, although keep in mind, this is the first 28 days. But April is now down to about a 1 week and at about 45% of our portfolio on average. So things are moving in the right direction.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: So first question is on the accelerated time line of the California reopening of June 15. Just curious. If you spoke about it in the early part of the call, my apologies. I was still on another multifamily call. Are you seeing an acceleration down in Southern Cal with all the service jobs reopening? Or is the tech hiring, growth in tech still outpacing the demand for apartments versus the recovery of service-based jobs that are trying to quickly reopen as we head to that June 15 time lines?
Michael Schall: Alex, it's Mike. That's a good question. We look at -- we all look at it a little bit differently. And 1 of the ways that we're looking at this now is take our portfolio and divide it into 3 categories: the large cities; let's say, the midsize cities; and suburban -- most suburban markets. And clearly, the most suburban markets have outperformed the cities and -- both on actually a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis. For example, our best suburban market is Torrance, which sequentially is up 4.3%. And when you look into the midsized cities, we see improvement. I'd say, it's pretty clear that the improvement in our markets is starting in suburbia and moving towards the cities and unfortunately hasn't really benefited the cities to any great extent at this point in time.  So best-performing clearly is all the suburban markets. And it doesn't matter whether they're suburban Seattle or suburban Los Angeles. And then the midsized cities are sort of second best in terms of recovery trajectory. And then the large cities are lagging pretty substantially. And again, large city hampered by supply, which is greater in the cities, along with these job levers, which improved pretty significantly for the -- the 3-month trailing average job growth was minus 9.2%. And March was minus 7.9%. So there was actually a lot of improvement in the quarter, but we need that to continue. We feel like California got a bit of a late start coming out of in this reopening process. And so maybe from that perspective, we're a step behind where we thought we were, but we're making up ground and things are looking better. Hope that makes sense.
Alexander Goldfarb: I guess, Mike, what you're saying is -- yes, but what you're saying, if I heard you correctly, it doesn't matter what the industry is in the market. The bigger driver of the apartment performance is simply where the property is located. Suburban then midsized cities, and then the last is the urban area. So is that fair?
Michael Schall: Yes, that's fair. And again, the urban areas are where you lost these service jobs, which are concentrated, of course, in the cities, and they have more supply. So it's really that confluence of both of those factors that is causing this. Those -- as you move from the large cities into the midsized cities and into suburban markets, suburban markets have very little supply. So we don't have someone competing with you in a new property next door offering 2 months free plus whatever else they might throw in. So that dynamic occurs mostly in the cities, and that is what is preventing our pricing power in the cities from improving substantially.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, I think it's you guys and UDR and Mid-America are all part of this SmartRent. You obviously had the news last week in The Journal. What is the impact to you guys? Obviously, great to have your investment -- to hit big on an investment. But beyond making money, which is awesome, what is the practical impact as far as operations or the way you guys interact with SmartRent, et cetera?
Michael Schall: Yes. Yes. Thanks for that question. I'd say SmartRent was 1 of the first investments that was made by this consortium of companies that were started by the 3 REITs that are equal partners plus other owners of apartments aggregating -- I think we started with 1 million -- owners of 1 million units of apartments. And now I think it's -- Fund II is up to like 2 million units of apartments. So some pretty substantial ownership. And again, the original concept was to create technology improvements in the industry, operating improvements using technology and rolling them out through the portfolio of apartments that the ownership group together controlled. So that's worked out great. And it's interesting because SmartRent is 1 of the first investments that we made.  And as you noted, The Wall Street Journal announced that SmartRent has entered into an agreement with a SPAC to merge for $2.2 billion, less about $500 million in working capital, which would value the company on a net basis at about $1.65 billion we believe. But there are many steps you noted to complete that process. SPACs have been pretty volatile in the recent past. And so there's no assurance that this is going to -- this will go through. But it seems like the sponsorship of the SPAC is pretty well aligned and very motivated for this to happen. So I feel, ultimately, pretty good about that.  And so there will be some financial benefits. We were -- RET Ventures was an early investor -- seed round investor and then invested all the way through the B and C rounds of SmartRent, so it's a substantial owner. I don't want to get into all the details, but there will be pretty significant potential gain there. But I guess, maybe more fundamentally in terms of the impact, it goes back to the vision of RET Ventures in the beginning, which is to try to bring technologies -- better technology into these companies to improve efficiency and the way we interact with our customer. And SmartRent is an example of that, but there are many other investments.  I think there are 12 additional investments in addition to SmartRent that were made by Fund I and we're on Fund II currently, and we're utilizing a number of those. So I'll give you an example of one, which is a -- it's a -- the customer relationship management function. And we're currently piloting, for example, and we've done several hundred leases in a product that essentially allows you to do the entire lease process from your smartphone and/or from a computer. So we are pretty far into the testing of that. We're also continuing our rollout of SmartRent, which we think is a long-term benefit to both the company and the industry. And so from a technology perspective, we're very excited about what's happening recently.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.
Jeffrey Spector: Great. Just listening to the comments on the call, and again, the sequential improvements you're seeing, Mike, it feels like from at least where I'm sitting compared to coming out of the tech crash, early 2000s, that there's a pretty good backdrop here. And I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I do remember, I don't know how long it took after the tech crash, but at a pretty nice boom. What are your thoughts? And if you disagree, I guess, what's the big negative regulatory issues today? I mean, what's the negative?
Michael Schall: Yes. Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California we had roughly 40% growth in market rents before the bust. So you had this huge surge of market rents because these small tech companies, many of which didn't even have a product identified, let alone revenue, were bringing people to the West Coast. And there were no -- we couldn't produce apartments fast enough to keep up with that demand, and we had spiked 40%. Well, we gave all of that back plus then some in the ensuing few years after that period ended in the bust period. And I remember that period very well because we started selling Northern California and buying Southern California, which Southern California had no discernible benefit from that Internet boom and so assets appeared to be really cheap in Southern California, really expensive in Northern California.  So -- and then it took a long time for markets to recover from that period. I think that set back from the -- from -- essentially the lack of real businesses that went public was a dramatic setback. I think the IPO markets -- it's 20 years later, and I think the IPO markets are only started to recover a year or 2 ago from all of that. So it's taken a long time. Fast forward to today, it appears that this pandemic -- I'd say the response to it has been much different. The governmental response in terms of pumping money into -- and liquidity into the markets and making sure that a pandemic doesn't morph into a credit or financial crisis. And so I give the governmental entities a lot of credit for that.  So it feels like we're through the worst of this and we're coming out the other side, and there's a lot of money chasing deals and asset values are increasing. And so I'd say all of that's a good thing. I'd say maybe if there is a negative, it goes back to what do you do now with the new knowledge and with what you have? Basically you're worse markets historically in terms of growth rates over the last 20 years and now you're best markets. Does that continue on? Or what does it mean for your portfolio? And we all spend a lot of time on that. And Adam is in the middle of transacting around it. So -- but for us, I think that means that we sell some of our lesser properties, some of the properties that, for whatever reason, we think will underperform.  Notably, last quarter, we sold Hidden Valley, which is a property that has 25% very low BMR units, which makes it very difficult to grow. The property is great. It's in a great location, but if you have 25% very low BMR units, the growth rate just can't keep up. So we sell that property, and then we will look for an ability to repurpose those funds into something that has a good long-term growth rate, is in a better area. So that process is ongoing. And as noted -- as Barb noted, there's a little bit of FFO dilution in Q2 as a result of those transactions occurring before we reinvest those proceeds. There's a little bit of drag. And so I'd say that is perhaps a downside, I think. However, the long-term benefits will be very apparent.
Jeffrey Spector: Okay. And then my 1 follow-up -- and I'm sorry if I missed this. I know you talked a lot about the increase in jobs and hybrid, how that should benefit the portfolio. Did you specifically discuss tech workers and the return to your portfolio? Are you seeing tech employees return as renters of the portfolio or benefits from these IPOs? Like where is the demand coming from?
Michael Schall: Yes, Jeff. I think we're starting to see it, but if you -- we have S-17.1 that talks about the reopening. Most of these reopenings are still months or a quarter or 2 away. So yes, I don't think that, that's where we're seeing the benefit. I think it's been recovery as noted in, let's say, the Motion Picture industry is now opening up and there are some service jobs coming back. And so jobs have grown. We're still off a big number, but jobs have grown. I think that the -- in terms of specifically coming back to the office, I think that's been a slow process at this point in time. I don't think it's any -- to any significant degree, it's actually occurred. I think it's ahead of us.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Maybe, Adam, a follow-up on the preferred equity or mezz business. Have the increases in construction costs reached a point where it start -- you think it's going to start dampen -- to dampen deal volume over the coming years? And then a follow-up. Are costs getting to a point where any developers in your current portfolio are having issues covering that service?
Adam Berry: John, yes. So to answer your question, we have definitely seen, as we're working through our pref pipeline, most of the developments have been in the more suburban areas. So they've been lower density, more garden-style product. And so when you look at the increases specifically to lumber, but also to some of the other materials, it is absolutely having an effect on how these deals underwrite and whether or not they'll get built. So we're seeing it, and this is the beginning of it. And developers are trying to work their way through it, and we're working with them. But we definitely see this as an obvious headwind for new supply. And then, John, what was the second part of your question?
John Pawlowski: Yes. Just in terms of ongoing projects, any concerns about debt service coverage for in-process deals?
Adam Berry: No. We don't have any of those concerns. Nothing that we see forthcoming.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Great. And then just final one for me. Angela, any early reads on how retention is faring on leases signed a year ago with generous concessions? Or are you expecting some occupancy slippage or they have to follow up with another round of concessions to keep people signed a year ago in their homes?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. That's a good question. As we go through our renewals and releases and heading into the peak leasing season, what we're seeing is a more normalized behavior relative to pre-COVID. So when I look at numbers like our turns and applications and so that does not lead us to think that concessions itself will be significantly challenging. But keep in mind, concessions is really more of a function of the competitive supply and what the economy is doing. So it's not so much the lease duration itself. And so right now, our markets are only at approximately 50% of the open compared to the rest of the country that is mostly reopened. And so that's more of a factor. And of course, in certain CBD locations like the L.A. and Seattle, where there are still going to be continued supply pressure, we're going to see more because that will be in a more concessionary environment regardless of the lease term.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Just a follow-up on the return to work environment with tech companies. Office utilization is the lowest or among the lowest in some of your major markets, including San Francisco, San Jose and L.A. Is this something you track as far as the Castle weekly data? And is that something that you see having a high correlation to applications or interest level in your properties?
Michael Schall: John, it's Mike. It's -- we don't really know how to track it exactly. So we do try to triangulate across the company with -- we track jobs and we track where our residents are coming from. And certainly, we track migration patterns. But trying to do this at sort of very granular level, I think, is pretty difficult. So what we have tried to do is say, hey, let's keep track of the big tech companies and when they plan to come back to the office. And then we should be able to see the traffic increase as they start coming back in greater volumes. At this point in time, as noted a minute ago, we just haven't seen a whole -- we haven't seen a lot of it. We don't think that's a major part of this recovery at this point in time.
John Kim: What about students returning back to the classroom? Are you seeing it as a tailwind? And can you remind us what your typical student profile is pre pandemic versus today?
Michael Schall: That's another good question. I don't have that granular detail. We track supply-demand mostly by jobs and obviously supply. And we know that there's some demographic tailwinds. And obviously, we know that the students are out there and -- but they're a relatively small part of our occupancy. So they're not big enough to be a driving factor in the broader scheme. The big picture is jobs, I would say, demographics, i.e., people who living longer and therefore consuming homes longer than they have jobs and the overall supply numbers. So we don't get down to that granular level.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Richard Hill: I wanted to come back to the guide. And maybe just breaking a part into its components a little bit more. 1Q was a pretty strong quarter for you. I think you beat FFO -- your FFO guide by about $0.04. Yet you maintained the guide for a full year, which implies somewhat of a cut. And the reason I bring that up is our channel check suggests 2Q is off to a pretty strong start and certainly stronger than 1Q, at least on effective rent growth. I don't know where renewals are, but effective rent growth of new leases looks pretty strong.  So I'm trying to figure out, is it really driven by one-timers that you included in your bridge, that's making you a little bit more conservative? Or is there something in the business that we should be thinking about? Because as I think about in the economy, our economists certainly increased their projections for GDP growth. I recognize you have and you typically don't in 1Q. But I'm hoping you can square that away. I know it's a mouthful, but I'm trying to understand 1Q, what's happening in 2Q fundamentals versus onetimers and what that means for the full year?
Barbara Pak: Rich, this is Barb. So yes, 1Q was strong. And like we mentioned, we are tracking favorable on same-store through the first quarter. And I think what Angela alluded to in her opening remarks was that we just hit 50% reopening at this point within California. And so while we feel good about where we're at, we've had a lot of stops and starts within California over the past year, which leads us to just take a little bit more conservative approach, and we'll revisit in the second quarter. We do feel good about where things are, where fundamentals are. The wildcard is really delinquency, which we've talked about in the past. And you can see in our numbers April did increase from where we were in Q1. And so those are the things that were -- that weighed on us when we looked at our guidance. But it was -- we did trend favorably in the first quarter from a same-property perspective.
Michael Schall: Barb, maybe I can add just 1 quick thing based on what you said. Because in Q1, we think that we benefited from stimulus payments, specifically because we saw delinquency improve kind of in the light of January, February time frame. And so now we get into SB 91, which is the federal stimulus money, and we haven't seen very much of that at all. That remains a big question mark in terms of what its impact is going to be going forward. And we have no way to -- no historical precedent or even way to anticipate that.  So I think that we've always been a little bit conservative and wait to see what happens and let the events occur and then report them as opposed to trying to build them into our guidance. And so I think that's -- it's kind of a philosophical bias that we have. And with respect to delinquencies, specifically, I think it's just hard to predict what's going to happen, not that we think anything bad is going to happen. We'd say SB 91 ultimately can only be good news, but we just don't have a way to time it, to get the timing, nor the magnitude given that we've never seen it before.
Richard Hill: Okay. That's helpful. And the reason I ask because I think a lot of us, both on sell-side investors themselves, are just trying to understand if this is inherently you being conservative, which, as you noted, is in your DNA versus something that's maybe different on the West Coast. But it sounds like maybe just a little bit of a conservative approach, recognizing that the operating metrics are trending in the right direction.
Michael Schall: Right. Fairly put, yes.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: Mike, I think this one is for you. The job growth assumptions that you put in your supplement, is that from like the government? Or is that an internal projection?
Michael Schall: Are you referring to Page S-17, I'm guessing?
Neil Malkin: Yes, I think it's $396,000 for this year?
Michael Schall: Yes, $396,000. Yes. That's from S-17. No, we do our own fundamental research on our markets. Yes, so definitely ours.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Great. Because the reason I'm asking in that, I'm just in general -- I know it's like a million-dollar question, but trying to understand what the path back -- the recovery path or the back to pre COVID looks like. Looking at your markets, I think you're still down 1.2 million jobs from pre COVID. And so using 400,000, that's basically like 3 years to get back to, I guess, pre COVID employment. Yes, I mean, is that -- does that math not really work because of when people come back to their tech jobs? Or how do you guys kind of think about that? Or I don't know maybe underwriting that from an operating standpoint, particularly in your kind of urban areas or your bigger kind of coastal markets, how you see the ability to push rents or the absolute level of rents over the next, call it, 24 months?
Michael Schall: Yes. Connecting those dots is definitely observant. Good question. I would say that what happens is people make different choices when rents increase or decrease. And this goes back to kind of our theories as it relates to rent to income and other things. So when rents decline in the cities as much as they have, people come and fill those units. Now where does it exactly come from? I would suspect that a lot of them come from areas that are generally considered less good. I think now people can move into the cities and because rents are pretty dramatically different than -- lower than they were before. So they were priced out previously and now that they can move in.  And so that presumes that if you're in the markets, this is our theory -- portfolio theory for a long time. If you're in the markets that have good schools, safety, quality of life, et cetera, those will be the beneficiaries because people will move there as long as they can afford it. And then people that can't afford it will be pushed out to the very periphery of these markets. So -- and I know that this seems contra -- everything about what we're saying about suburbia doing so well. But there are select really good suburban markets, the beach cities, for example, in Southern California or even Northern California that are doing really well that are still pretty high-quality areas.  They're just farther from the market. So we're not necessarily talking about them. We're talking about cities that are less quality cities. And people moving out of those cities in order to move into a good location because you would have to say, well, how can you be 97% occupied almost with all those jobs lost? And the answer is people move based on a better value -- rental value or a better life situation in the better quality assets. So -- and I think that's the key is we are not almost 97% occupied. And given that there's not that many vacant units within our portfolio and as people come back, it's not going to take hundreds of thousands of jobs in order to get to the point where we're eliminating concessions and we have more pricing power, because our base is strong. So that's, in the practical world, how it works. So it's not just jobs. It's the consumer choice, given changes in rev levels. Makes sense?
Neil Malkin: Okay. Yes, yes. I see where you're going there. Other one for me is you guys have done a really good job in most of the REITs, have done a good job minimizing delinquency, kind of taking it to the chin early in terms of concessions and letting people leave or paying people to leave, et cetera. But you're also impacted by your surrounding properties and owners, et cetera. So there's obviously a big, I guess, you call it, storm coming in terms of the amount of people who have 6-plus months of back rent that "has to be paid back eventually."  I have my doubts about that in California, but how do you guys see that playing out when that check needs to be written or the sort of the protection abate? And again, not really a big deal in your specific assets, but a lot of people, I'm sure, operators that you compete against have maybe a lot of that. I guess, do you guys think that's going to have a big impact on vacancy? Could that bring more people to the market for selling their assets? Any commentary there would be great.
Michael Schall: Yes. That's an extraordinarily good question. And it's 1 that causes us a fair amount of sleeplessness at night, and we don't have the answer to it. We know that the existing eviction moratoriums lapsed on June 30. And we also know that there is a pretty significant number of renters that over that -- the last year, it's more than 6 months, over the last year or by the time we get to June, it will be almost a year, that will not have paid us even the 25% rent that's required to maintain their eviction protection under SB 91.  So we know that this is going to be a problem. I would also say that there's no way that the courts can keep up with foreclosure processing. So I don't know exactly how that's going to work itself out either. So unfortunately, I'm going to have to say that we're going to work through it. We're going to -- we are obviously a public company. Obviously, we have sort of an obligation to treat our residents thoughtfully and carefully. And so we will do our best to work through that. But I can't tell you exactly what we're going to run into as we get into that period of time. We are absolutely very concerned about it. and we'll have to take it a step at a time, I guess, what I'd say.
Neil Malkin: Okay. And is that why you're maybe a little bit more cautious on your guidance just out of curiosity? Is that 1 of the things that -- I know you didn't talk about it, but could that be 1 of the things that are making you kind of in pain?
Michael Schall: Yes, it is. But at the same time, the people that have -- let's say, we know that there are people that have received various forms of benefits and/or payments and haven't paid their rents. So finally, we'll be in a position to reconcile some of those situations where people are using the laws to shield themselves from paying anything. So it isn't all bad. There is a good element to it as well. And maybe people face with -- if they want to maintain their eviction protection, they're going to have to pay us the 25% of rents that have accrued from September 1 through June 30, to the extent they haven't already paid it. So it's not all bad. It's sort of a -- I would say it's kind of a time for reconciliation come June 30. And again, it's difficult to predict exactly what that's going to look like.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: You've talked a bit about some of the extremes as far as suburbs outperforming urban and some of the markets doing better than other markets geographically. Can you maybe just put some numbers behind it and maybe use the down 6% blended rent number from April? How wide are those extremes? And can you give a sense of which markets are most negative and which are most positive?
Michael Schall: Yes. Dennis, it's a good question. I don't think I necessarily haven't broken out the way that you're referring to it. So let me give you some sense of what we're seeing. So let's take the most suburban parts of our market. The best on a sequential basis -- so sequential quarters is Torrance at 4.3% plus rent -- revenue growth. And Snohomish County up there in Seattle, again, there's a Boeing issue in Snohomish, which is minus 0.4%. And then year-over-year Oceanside is plus 2.7%, and San Ramon is minus 4.2%. So that kind of gives you the brackets around what's happening in those most suburban markets.  In the midsized cities, the best sequential growth is in actually the city of Long Beach and the worst is in sort of North City, San Diego, Long Beach up 3.4%; North City down 0.5%. And year-over-year, Long Beach is the best at minus 2.3%. and San Jose is the worst at minus 10.5%. Again, Long Beach doesn't get a lot of supply, and it's a decent -- a very decent place to live. So I think it's benefited from that. Then in the large cities, the sequential -- on a sequential basis, the best there is West L.A. at plus 3.5%, and Seattle is the worst at minus 2.5%. And then year-over-year, the best is West L.A. again, at minus 11.9% and San Francisco at minus 20.7%. Does that give you some idea of what's going on?
Dennis McGill: Yes. I think that does. And those were revenue numbers or those were at least great numbers?
Michael Schall: Those are total revenue. Same-store revenue.
Dennis McGill: Perfect. And then a separate question, just as you look at the -- each distribution of your renters. I'm not sure if you have this in front of you if you have a way to summarize it. But if you were to look at the distribution of your residents pre COVID end segment them by age, is there any difference between that and what you're seeing on new move-ins today?
Michael Schall: I don't think that we have that data. We have move-outs occurred and what categories, but we're not tracking it by age cohort.
Dennis McGill: Okay. What about -- depending on how you do track it, just the makeup of the tenant base, whether it be income or demographic circumstance, anything that would speak to, whether it's differing from what was common before COVID versus now?
Michael Schall: There is some difference. I don't have any data in front of me. There are some differences in that. Again, because the cities have had such a dramatic drop in rents, a different kind of renter is moving into the cities. And there's definitely more tech workers that are -- given work from home that are occupying housing in the suburbs. But I don't have any of that demographic data. We have it. We just -- I just don't have it with me. So apologize. We can follow-up with you on if we -- if you want to on this.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Bradley Heffern: Yes. Just going back to the delinquencies again. I just want to make sure I understand the April number. So you had the 2.1% in the first quarter and then the April number is 2.7%. I assume that over time, you collect more of that. So are you, I guess, more concerned about delinquency now than you were a couple of months ago because the payments that continue to come in are maybe less than the tailwind that you saw in the first quarter? And I guess how confident are you that, that was really a stimulus tailwind just because it seems like it wasn't really enough to cover a month of rents? And is that really something that -- is that going to be the first source of that capital for people when you have the tenant protections that you do in California?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. That's a good question. And it's a complicated 1 because there's quite a few different moving pieces, right, because this involves legislation, involves behavior and, of course, people's view about their jobs and prospects. And so -- but in terms of -- if you look at the first quarter delinquency, we actually published January and February, and that was about 2.6%. And so March came in significantly better to the point that allowed the first quarter average to be down -- that went down to 2.1%. So April pops back up to 2.7%, which is more of the normalized run rate. And that is why -- while we don't obviously have the exact reason for the sudden improvement in Q1, that is why we can pretty safely point to March, which is when the stimulus was distributed.  And so it's not a perfect science, but it's pretty darn good correlation from that perspective. And where we're at is we don't think it's going to deteriorate further. But at the same time, before looking at -- people are asking us, say, Q1 sequential to Q2 sequential gross revenue is where is that headed. You have to factor into the delinquency, which is a 2.1%, just going back to the more normalized level of 2.7%. So that's 1 piece of it. And as far as the delinquency, Mike talked about SB 91, and we have a team that has really put forth a robust effort to work with our tenants and actively engaging with them to help them apply for this relief.  And so while we are going through that and we're seeing -- we're being able to -- we're able to help our tenants and with their eligibility, the question is the timing, when will we get the reimbursement from the government? And that is -- every city has a different time line. Every city has a different process, and every city approaches the reimbursement differently. And so for us, our view is not so much that it's a huge [Technical Difficulty] is when. And so you back that into, well, what does that mean for guidance? That's going to be lumpy. It's going to be variable. And therefore, we just felt that it was prudent to give it a few more months and see what numbers come in. Does that make sense?
Bradley Heffern: Appreciate the color. Yes, it does. I knew it would be complicated. And then I guess moving over to sort of the dispositions that you've had and the redemptions, it's about $400 million of capital or so there. I guess, do you have pretty good line of sight on what the deployment is going to be for that? Or I guess, more generally, what's your confidence in being able to redeploy that just given that obviously assets on the West Coast haven't become distressed or anything like that? And it seems like there are a lot of willing buyers out there. So I'm curious your confidence in being able to redeploy that accretively.
Adam Berry: Brad, this is Adam. So a couple of things. The 3 dispositions that happened earlier this quarter. Those -- I actually mentioned them in last quarter's call. Those were essentially baked in Q4 of last year. And so we used most of those proceeds at the time to buy back stock as well as deploy new prefs at that point. What's changed within -- from that time until now is the redemptions. And so with that, that's $120 million that was unexpected to come back this soon. So my confidence level on redeploying that money is very high. Like I mentioned earlier, the pipeline on the prefs -- pref equity deals is pretty robust. And it does take time to work through them, but we are highly motivated to do so. And so that money will be redeployed. It's just getting there and moving as quickly as we can.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. And with that, we do thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-05 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I am very pleased to acknowledge the promotions of Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak to their new roles at Essex and greatly appreciate their contributions for many years of dedicated service. Both Angela and Barb will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. At the end of last year, we announced John Burkart’s retirement and we thank John for his tireless efforts and numerous contributions to the company’s success over nearly three decades. As we reported last night, our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower same-property revenue and core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full-year. Similar to the last few quarters, pandemic-related regulations have had two primary consequences: first, shelter-in-place and related orders have resulted in unprecedented job losses; and second, anti-eviction and related laws prevent us from maximizing property performance. Government mandates are constantly changing and they intensified during the fourth quarter given surge in COVID-19 cases. Navigating the pandemic involves extraordinary efforts and I thank the Essex team for their tireless dedication amid these challenges. Overall, our fourth quarter results reflect stability and sequential net effective rents beginning in October and as discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Sequential revenues improved 30 basis points in the quarter, with market rents mostly flat in the cities and modestly positive in suburban locations. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic that we have or will soon reach the bottom in market rent declines. As of December 2020, preliminary three-month trailing job losses in the Essex markets were 7.9% year-over-year, a 150 basis point improvement compared to minus 9.4% for September 2020 and outperforming the nation, which had a 100 basis point improvement from September to December. Even with the recovery of jobs in Q3 and Q4, the nation had 9.2 million fewer jobs year-over-year for the month of December, roughly equal to the number of jobs lost at the worst point of the financial crisis. Our data analytics team prepared S-17 to the supplemental, which is our base case scenario underlying our expectation that net effective rents will decline 1.9% in 2021. The range of potential outcomes is extraordinarily wide for 2021, given many unknowns that relate to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccine deployment and changes in regulation. Our modeling further assumes 4% GDP growth, which should lead to positive momentum in the second-half of 2021. Apartment supply will continue to be a challenge, especially in the downtown locations of Los Angeles and Seattle. Our data and analytics team expects approximately 34,000 apartment deliveries in 2021, a modest increase compared to last year. Also similar to 2020, we don’t expect much for-sale housing production going forward. It’s our experience that affordable for-sale housing competes directly with rentals, once rents rise to a level that approximates the monthly payment of an entry-level for-sale home, and there is little risk of that occurring in the Essex markets anytime soon. Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights 13 recent multibillion-dollar tech initial public offerings for companies headquartered in the Essex markets. Overall, 2020 was a great year for IPOs, with 147 tech sector offerings completed during the year. It’s our view that the IPO market is essential to recharge the tech ecosystem, providing growth capital to early-stage investors and to generate liquidity for reinvestment. Page S-17.1 also illustrates the reacceleration in job openings for the top 10 tech companies, which has increased 38% since the August trough. Our analysis indicates that nearly 60% of the total job postings are located in California or Washington, with the next largest state, Texas, accounting for just 7%. The Page S-17.2 of the supplemental package demonstrates that venture capital investments continued on a record pace in 2020 with approximately $130 billion invested in the U.S. with the Essex markets continuing to receive the dominant share of VC investment. Success in the knowledge-based economy requires a critical mass of highly skilled workers, creating a network effect that draws companies to the Bay Area and Seattle. While only a limited number of venture-backed companies will go public, some will experience extraordinary growth similar to Snowflake, DoorDash, Airbnb and resulting in thousands of high-paying jobs. The environment today has many similarities to the previous recessionary periods, including the financial crisis and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. In both cases, migration out of California was often front page news. In 2020, we experienced higher out migration than normal, especially in our West Coast urban centers. In our experience, people make different housing choices during recessions and it’s not surprising to see many in the large baby boomer cohort monetized the value of an expensive California home to move to less expensive areas as part of the retirement plan. This recession is unique with respect to the extraordinary loss of jobs that involve lower paid service workers, jobs that are concentrated in the city centers and effective employees often had only two choices: move immediately to find work or stay in their home shielded by eviction forbearance laws. As with previous recessions, we expect most of these trends to reverse. We expect that the demand for restaurants, services and travel will recover swiftly as vaccines are administered, bringing back related service jobs. Workers in the Essex markets earn more than in most parts of the country and the draw of higher-paying jobs, combined with lower recent rent levels makes rental housing down the West Coast, the most affordable it has been since 2013. Our recent McKinsey study estimates that only 22% of the American workforce can work from home without any productivity loss. We have been tracking many companies that have adopted work from home models during the pandemic, and we remain confident that the vast majority of companies will ask employees to return to the office when it is safe to do so, likely with increased work from home flexibility going forward. Google, Netflix and Apple are among the largest companies who have expressed their desire to return to the office, many others will follow. Turning to the regulatory environment, a third wave of COVID-19 cases beginning in November and related concerns about hospital availability led to the imposition of severe stay-at-home orders in all of our California markets. Some of these restrictions were eased last week, but all of the Essex markets remain in California’s most restrictive category. Recently, with the passage of SB 91 last week, the state of California has extended COVID-19 related eviction protection from January 31 to June 30, 2021, including pushing back the requirement to pay at least 25% of pandemic-related rent. In addition, the law established a state rental assistance program to allocate $2.6 billion in Federal Stimulus Funds using income levels to prioritize payments and accepting related applications in March. As with similar laws, there are many related requirements and complexities, which we are evaluating. Turning to the apartment investment markets, during 2020, we sold 4 properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contract subsequent to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders in March. Given the wide discount in valuation for public REITs compared to the private real estate markets, property sales remain our preferred source of funds for investment. Since the onset of the pandemic, a relatively small number of apartment sales support our belief that property values have not changed materially since the onset of the pandemic. However, extraordinary changes in rent increasing in the case of both suburban markets and decreasing sharply in some urban locations, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about cap rates. In the suburbs, where rents are generally at or above pre-pandemic levels, property values have modestly increased and cap rates are somewhat lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. Given lower rents and significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate about a 5% reduction in value versus the pre-COVID period, resulting in cap rates for high-quality properties below 4%. As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range, potentially supporting lower cap rates. Vaccine distribution should remove uncertainty with respect to apartment operations and property values. As a result, we believe transaction volumes will begin to accelerate. As we have indicated before, improved cash flow from positive leverage in apartments has historically led to a robust transaction market. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Essex operations team for their diligent efforts to serve our customers amidst a challenging environment caused by the COVID pandemic. Thank you for all your hard work. As for my comments, I will begin by discussing our 2020 results, followed by our outlook for 2021. The overall, our market performed as we expected, despite the headwinds of new cohort related closures and seasonal decline in demand. Currently, the urban core particularly in tech-centric markets continued to remain more impacted by COVID-19 related job losses and office disclosures. In addition, the change in quality of life, resulting from the closures of restaurants and public amenities has driven a temporary shift in consumer preferences. High-rise buildings or communities located in the area with high walk scores have been the most impacted by this shift in demand. Conversely, communities with private outdoor space or more affordable residences outside the urban core continue to experience greater demand, which benefited many of our properties in Ventura, San Diego, Orange County and the East Bay in Northern California. This temporary shift in demand continued in the fourth quarter, where we experienced a 7.6% and 9.9% year-over-year increase in quarterly turnover in CBD, Seattle and San Francisco compared to the portfolio average turnover of only 1.3%. Furthermore, our CBD locations also had a greater concentration of apartment supply deliveries typically accompanied by very high concession levels. During the fourth quarter, we continued our leasing strategy of leveraging concessions on stabilized communities and building occupancy. There have been encouraging indicators from a sequential perspective in that more than half of our same-property portfolio grew revenues sequentially, driven in part by increases in occupancy and decreases in concessions. We have provided year-over-year net effect rent changes for our portfolio on Page S-16 of our supplemental. New lease rates were down 8.9% in the fourth quarter, stable in January, an improvement from the negative 12.2% achieved in the third quarter. Concessions on same-property approval improved from approximately $18 million in the third quarter to $13 million in the fourth quarter. This reduction in concessions is noteworthy, considering the fourth quarter has seasonally lower demand and historically, concessions increased during this period rather than decrease. Key highlights of the same-property performance of our major markets in the fourth quarter are as follows: in Seattle, 4.9% year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, which declined by 13%, while the remaining submarkets averaged a 3.2% decline, year-over-year job growth in Seattle declined by 7.3% in the fourth quarter. In Northern California, the 10.4% year-over-year revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland, averaging an 18% decline, contrasted with a 4.2% decline in Contra Costa County, while Santa Clara County performed in line with the regional average of a 10% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Northern California declined by 8% with San Jose far better at a 6.4% decline. In Southern California, the 7.2% year-over-year decline was primarily driven by LACBD and West L.A. submarkets, averaging a 17% decline, offset by an average decline of 2.4% in our suburban markets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego. Fourth quarter year-over-year job growth in Southern California declined by 8%. Moving on to our 2021 outlook, as indicated on S-17 of the supplemental, multifamily supply as a percentage of stock remained low at 0.9% for our portfolio. While we expect a percentage of the year-over-year growth to remain flat, new completions will once again be concentrated in the CBDs and urban submarkets where supply is projected to increase by 2.1% compared to just 0.7% across the rest of the portfolio. The confluence of minimal supply and extraordinary job losses remain a significant headwind in our urban markets. In Seattle, we expect multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to increase in 2021 by 1.6%, driven by 2.9% in the CBD, offset by a 1% increase in the suburbs, where we have the majority of our units. We have also seen positive office activities by major tech companies as they continue to push forward on expansion projects. In Seattle, Amazon received approval for a 1.1 million square foot project in Bellevue, Microsoft has continued with their campus expansion, and in , Google acquired a 10-acre site for a large campus. In Northern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock in 2021 to decrease by 10 basis points, although Oakland and San Jose CBD are expected to increase by 1.8% and 3%, respectively. Despite the impact of COVID, tech expansion plans have continued in the area. Amazon purchased a 6-acre site near downtown San Francisco. Facebook last month submitted an updated plan for its 1.25 million square foot campus expansion in Menlo Park, and Google continued to work with the city of San Jose for its major new campus at Diridon Station. In addition, the biotech sector continued to be a strong source of office demand highlighted by the recently approved expansion of Genentech’s headquarter in South San Francisco, which would add up to 4.3 million square foot of new office space. In Southern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to remain flat. The most notable increase is 4% LA CBD and deliveries in West LA will remain elevated once again this year. While many uncertainties remain as to legislation and the timing of the vaccine, based on current market conditions, we assume our scheduled rent for the same-property portfolio will trough in the second quarter this year. Because leases are typically 1 year in duration, our year-over-year revenue growth will be negative in the first half and positive in the second half, leading to our same-store full year guidance of 2.5% revenue decline at the midpoint. Lastly, our current same-store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30 days out is 4.7%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call to Barb Pak.
Barb Pak: Thank you, Angela. I will start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a challenging period with core FFO declining 12.5% compared to 1 year ago. This was primarily driven by an 8% decline in same property revenues as a result of higher concessions and delinquencies. As we noted last quarter, we report concessions on a cash basis in our same-property results because we believe this is more indicative of true market conditions. However, we are required by GAAP to treat concessions on a straight-line basis in calculating consolidated revenue and FFO. As Angela mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we provided $5 million fewer concessions than the third quarter, which helped improve same-property revenue sequentially. However, core FFO declined by 4% or $0.13 per share compared to the third quarter, of which, $0.16 is attributable to lower straight-line rent concessions. We expect this line item to continue to be a headwind to core FFO growth in 2021, which I will discuss in a minute. Please note on Page S-8 of the supplemental, we have detailed the quarterly impact of non-cash straight line rents. Turning to delinquencies, we continue to take a conservative approach to reserving against uncollected rents, especially given the surge in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter, which resulted in extended lockdowns in our markets throughout much of the quarter. As such, we reserved against the entire net delinquency balance during this quarter. Our receivable balance currently stands at approximately $7 million, including joint ventures at pro rata share. Based on past collections, we feel this receivable balance is consistent with our ongoing conservative approach. We will continue to assess our delinquency reserve and our net receivable balance each quarter based on collection history and market conditions. Turning to our 2021 guidance, key assumptions are available on Page 5 of the earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We have provided a wider than normal range for same-property revenues and core FFO given the significant uncertainties that remain surrounding COVID and the recovery ahead, including vaccine distribution and eviction moratoriums that are outside our control but could swing guidance in a variety of ways. That said, we felt it was important to outline our key assumptions based on information we have today. For the full year, we expect core FFO per diluted share to decline by 5.1% at the midpoint. The key drivers of the decrease are primarily related to the following 2 items. First, we expect same-property revenues and NOI to decline by 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively, at the midpoint. While current operating fundamentals remain steady in our markets as compared to several months ago, we will continue to feel the negative effects of the 2020 rent declines throughout most of 2021. In addition, due to the eviction moratoriums and regulations that remain outside our control, we expect delinquencies will remain elevated in 2021 and will be a drag to core FFO by an estimated $0.45 per share at the midpoint. The company has a long history of excellent rent collections, and we expect this temporary delinquency headwind to become a tailwind to FFO growth once the various COVID-related restrictions are lifted. Second, we also faced significant headwinds from straight-line concessions. We expect this non-cash item will result in $0.41 to $0.56 per share decline in core FFO, representing about a 4% reduction in growth on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to concessions, we expect they will remain high in the first half of the year before moderating in the second half of the year as the economic recovery takes hold. As such, we expect the impact from straight-line rent concessions to be minimal in the first half of the year, with most of the negative impact we forecasted to fall in the last 2 quarters of 2021. Lastly, on the capital markets activities and the balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we closed $206 million of new preferred equity investments and bought back $46 million of common stock at a significant discount to NAV. These investments are being funded with 3 asset sales totaling approximately $275 million that are under contract and expected to close in the first quarter. This is consistent with our guiding principles of match funding investments on a leverage-neutral basis. For the year, we were able to arbitrage the difference between public and private market pricing by selling $343 million of assets at prices generally consistent with pre-COVID levels and buying back 269 million of stock at an average price of $225 per share, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and creating value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong with minimal near-term funding needs and sound financial metrics. While our net debt-to-EBITDA has increased this year, this is primarily the result of the significant decline in EBITDA caused by the pandemic. As the economic recovery takes hold and the West Coast economies continue to reopen, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve. With ample liquidity and a well covered dividend, our balance sheet remains a source of strength. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the commentary on kind of the dynamic nature of your markets as well as the slides in the supplemental. But I’m just wondering, as you think about kind of post-COVID, right, if we are in a more flexible work environment, putting aside any kind of migration trends outside of the state. But just if there is more flexibility and commuting times change, how does that think – or how does that change how you think about your exposure within your markets, either urban, suburban or even further out? And could there be opportunities that you’re exploring today?
Michael Schall: Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. It’s a good one and this is Mike. We think that there will be more work from home flexibility, but at the same time, we think that employees will be tethered at some level to the office. As I think about the three other very capable people here today, knowing them and trusting them and all these things are a great team effort and teams are better when you really know the people and can trust the people. So I’d say that is key factor that I think. And as noted in the prepared remarks, we’ll keep employees relatively close to their jobs. So having said that, I would think the winners in this scenario will ultimately be the high-quality cities that are near the jobs, but also offer maybe a little bit more affordable housing and good schools, low crime rates, et cetera. So I think that, that will play itself out. And I think those areas we have a lot of cities that are among the major metros that qualify for that. So – and some of them have been pretty hard hit. So I would – I guess I would add to that, some of the cities that are high-quality cities, their rents have been highly impacted by COVID. Certainly, when I think about Northern California and the tech markets, the Peninsula, San Mateo, even suburban parts of San Jose would be major beneficiaries of that because we view that technology is going to continue to be a very strong economic driver. And the tech ecosystem in the Bay Area is incredibly unique. And therefore, we think it will do well.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Michael Schall: Does that answer the question?
Nick Joseph: That did. That was very helpful. And then just one quick follow - or one quick question, I guess, on the rent relief programs. Is that helping residents who are behind kind of fill out or navigate the ability to get rent relief? And is there any kind of rent relief from the government assumed the guidance?
Michael Schall: Yes. As noted on the call that last week, the state of California using federal stimulus dollars started a program or announced a program of $2.6 billion, potentially of rent relief. And the way it would work is the landlord would be required to forgive 20%. And so the reimbursement from these programs could be 80%. That will be predicated on percentages of median income, average median income, so it will provide the greatest benefit to those that are lower income levels. And it’s hard to tell exactly what that means. We just haven’t had enough time to evaluate that program. So I’m guessing that we will have a pretty significant positive impact from it. But again, it’s too early to evaluate.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Nick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you. First, I want to say congratulations to Angela and Barb. And we wish John a great retirement. Thanks for the time today. Mike, in your opening remarks, you commented that you have or soon will reach a bottom in market rents. And I know you’re fairly conservative. And so I take that comment pretty serious. I guess what gives you comfort to say that can you just talk about that a little bit more, please?
Michael Schall: Of course, Jeff, I think it’s a good question, and it’s, I think, probably maybe the most important question out there. So if we look at net effective rents, for the fourth quarter, sequentially, they were down under 1%. So net debt, that’s all the markets. Now there is pretty significant variation between market to market. And part of that is even though we have high occupancy overall, there are parts of our portfolio that have lower occupancy. For example, San Francisco is still at 92.5%. Seattle Downtown is at about the same level. And so, there are areas that we are very highly occupied that are offsetting areas that don’t have the same occupancy and actually below the average occupancy level. And most of that, as Angela alluded to, is related to the supply level. As you can imagine, if you’ve got negative job growth equivalent to right now, still as of December, equivalent to the worst part of the great financial crisis, it is not a great time to be delivering apartment units. And therefore, and the cities are getting the bulk of the supply delivery. So you have this confluence that Angela spoke about, which is negative demand growth and loss of supply and the cities are understandably hit from that. Offsetting that is, we do have markets that are doing very well. For example, Ventura, where rents are up almost 10% year-over-year on a market basis. And so we’re doing pretty well in a lot of these suburbs. Now that leads to this issue that I talked about many times, which is rent-to-income. And it’s interesting that Ventura with its – I think it’s more like 8.5% – 8.5% to 10% rent increase is now about 17% above its long-term historical average of this ratio of rent-to-income, which is incredibly important to us. Whereas in Northern California were 7% below the long-term average of rent-to-income. So everyone looks at this like, hey, the suburbs is going to do a lot better. But when rents go up a long ways, I would question that. And conversely, when the rents are essentially hammered in the cities, it changes the consumer’s view of where the opportunity is. And so our view is long – a little bit longer-term that you are going to see a very significant movement back towards the areas where rents are - high-quality cities where rents are pretty affordable.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. That’s very helpful. And is that what ultimately led to Essex providing the full-year guidance, which is very much appreciated?
Michael Schall: Well, it’s – there is a number of things. We have a whole – I kind of have a philosophy on guidance being an ex-CFO. And if I weren’t here, I’m not sure that Barb and Angela wouldn’t have come to a different decision to be perfectly candid. So – but yes, I mean, our preference is to always provide what we can and to be pretty open with the market. And then you all can disagree with us. But presumably, we have better information than you have, and therefore, it’s up to us to sort of lead the way. So that’s the philosophical position I took and it prevailed.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for all the transparency you provided in the release and in the prepared remarks. One of the things that struck us is that you guys did a really good job early on evaluating occupancy over rent. And I think that’s one of the reasons that you are really starting to see some sequential growth. And you’ve alluded to this a little bit. But I do want to maybe drill down a little bit more on the leases that are coming due in what’s historically the peak leasing season and how you think you’re going to manage through that? I recognize that you said 1Q is going to be tough, 2Q is going to be challenging as well, but how do you think through that? How do you think your occupancy sets you up to manage through the leases coming due, when demand is still not going to be back to where it is?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, hey, it’s Angela here. That’s a good question, and it’s certainly something we actively debate internally with the tactical strategy, right? Well, I don’t think I want to go through our playbook in detail. I would just say that we focus on maximizing revenue, and we do so by optimizing occupancy whenever possible, and we meet the market. And so given where we are, you’re right on point that we did in the third quarter focused on occupancy, which allowed us the fourth quarter to pull back on concessions as we see the market stabilize. And so as we continue to see the how the market performs, we will continue to use that strategy. And the goal at this point is really to try to pull back on concessions whenever possible. And of course, keep in mind, that’s subject to, of course, the supply, which I mentioned in the CBDs will continue to be pretty heavy and assuming a recovery in the back half of the year. So, all those come into play.
Rich Hill: Okay. I think that – I have appreciation for you not wanting to give the playbook away. I would love for you too, but I appreciate why you might not want to. I wanted to – on the other side of the equation, just the job growth. One of the things that, believe it or not I think is misunderstood about your portfolio, is your class AB mix in urban versus suburban? I’m not sure that’s always appreciated by the investor base. So when you think about job growth, can you maybe break down those job growth views relative to white collar, high class – high-paying jobs in urban markets versus maybe the type of renters that would rate class B in the suburban markets?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. And there is a lot to that question, so I will try to unpack it as best I can. Every recession is a little bit different. And normally, we view Southern California as our more typical of the U.S. average and therefore, it’s less volatile. In this recession, it has been incredibly volatile in a certain sector and that is the Motion Picture sector. We didn’t talk about it this time, we have on prior calls and it’s effectively shutdown. And this is like the big wealth generator in Southern California. And so Southern California is probably the biggest surprise relative to prior recessions. For example, in the financial crisis, market rents went down in Southern California about 10% versus about 15% for the Essex portfolio in total. So this time, Southern California looks a lot like Northern California. And I think it’s because of the two key parts of it, again, the filming and entertainment business plus all of these low jobs. When you look at the sectors of jobs that have been demolished, it’s all the lower income segments of the job base, mainly it’s hospitality and restaurants and other services those jobs are down. On the metros, somewhere in the 20% range, which means in the cities which are even higher concentrated, they are even more impacted. So as Angela said, you have got more supply coming into the cities. You also have worse job growth. Again, when we give you the averages, these are averages that more concentrated in the cities. And then when you go north into the tech markets, I think that you have two things that are happening. You have all those service jobs in Seattle and the Bay Area. But you also have, I would say, greater work from home flexibility that is that on the margin has allowed the areas that would generally be that are suburban in nature, most of San Jose and suburban has small downtown up peninsula through Mountain View, where Facebook is located and Google right in that area. Those areas have been greater – much greater impacted. And I think a lot of that is the work from home phenomena. So I think that the – so I think the recovery looks like a couple of things because there is nothing fundamentally wrong with any of these businesses. The Motion Picture business is still a high demand. The technology companies, as noted in the prepared remarks, a lot of venture capital money being invested, lots of investments being made by the big tech companies into locations and buildings. And so everything, I think in terms of the broader economy looks fine, we need those companies to come back to the office to some extent. We also need – there is always people that are retiring and again, selling their expensive California home going somewhere else and then backfilling comes from college graduates coming to take high-paying jobs. So I think that there is a mismatch there, I think that that are leaving the low-income can’t afford to stay, they either have left or are – stay in put given. And then – but we haven’t seen the backfill yet. And I think you’re going to see the back starting in the next relatively soon, and I think that they will start to solidify it because we’re 90-something percent occupied. It doesn’t take that many jobs to sort of fill things up, tighten things up and then concession abating pretty quickly. So that’s how we see it. Hopefully, that helps.
Rich Hill: That’s helpful a lot. One final thing for me, it strikes a core to me when you say you have more information than us. I think that’s very true. I would encourage you if there was anything that you could provide on population migration trends that you are seeing in your specific markets in the coming months. I think that would be really well received. But thanks, guys. I really appreciate, as always, the dialogue?
Michael Schall: Sure. No, we’re happy to give it. And yes, I could give you a little bit of migration information. And again, similar to prior recessions, where everyone focuses on the very short term, which is recessions happen about every 10 years, about every 10 years, I was 50, now I am 60. I make a different decision when I’m 60 when I was 50 about where I live and how hard I want to work in various things. And so that’s part of it. And so lots of people make changes in their life based on what they’re doing and how close they are to retirement and a variety of other things. So I would say a lot of what you’re seeing is just the first leg of what always happens about every 10 years and typically around a recessionary period. But in terms of inflow, outflows, it’s a little bit different by market. We still – the migration into our markets is still dominated by New York and Boston and even some other California metros. So there is quite a few people moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, maybe for better weather or whatever. In LA, the outflow is really Las Vegas, Phoenix and other California cities. And in San Francisco, it’s Seattle, Austin, Sacramento, and Seattle is Phoenix, Boise, Austin, in terms of outflow. And again, all three benefiting from highly scaled workers probably in a lot of the eastern metros and from some California cities. So hopefully, that helps. That’s LinkedIn data and – but our experience is pretty consistent with that.
Rich Hill: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Amanda Sweitzer: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in a little bit more on just the near-term demand you have seen kind of as you have had occupancy pickup, do you have a sense of where that demand is coming from? Are you taking share from other properties in the market or have you really seen renters move over in quality like you have last cycle?
Michael Schall: Well, it’s Angela, I think, put a happy face on it and I will let her comment in a minute, but it’s a battle out there. So I wouldn’t say we are taking anything from anyone. I’d say we are all competing fiercely to – and we all have maybe a little bit different focus. And again, as we have said before, our focus is maintain high occupancy, protect the coupon rent, we will use concessions when we have to, try to be aware of what time of year it is and what that battle is going to look like and plan ahead. So I think we do a good job of that. But I don’t think there is any winners in this current situation. So, we are trying to turn the battleship toward a better day, but it’s not quite here yet. Obviously, apartments, we look ugly when it’s getting better. We lag when your leases cause us to lag and the all-time high in terms of our achieved leases will hit in Q1 and Q2, which is why the year-over-year will look so ugly. And – but things are definitely slowly getting better and I think we will see that down the road, as Angela said, in the second half.
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay, that makes sense. And then turning to the disposition you have lined up, can you just provide more color on kind of a profile of those assets either in terms of age or location and then as well as the buyer pool and if that buyer pool has changed at all from pre-COVID?
Adam Berry: Sure, yes. This is Adam. Happy to answer. So for those three, they are situated throughout our portfolio. And so from – there is really no kind of a general overview of the type of asset they are. In all three cases, these were actually three exchange buyers. And – so to say there is one in the Bay Area, just to use as an example. It’s in a heavily concessioned Bay Area market and the way we are underwriting it as you would imagine, it’s kind of tough to peg cap rates given where current net effective rents are. So we are underwriting it based a couple of different ways. One is on kind of pre-COVID in-place rents. And then looking at current net effective today, on current net effective that deal, again this is a heavily concession Bay Area market. It’s in the low 3s, so call it 3.2, something like that and on pre-COVID numbers that’s about a 3.8 or so. And so that’s the spread. That was underwritten in the fourth quarter. So concessions have has varied before that and sense, but that’s the ballpark, and there still is – there is enough of a transaction market out there where market has been set – the buyers are a little different than – during your typical cycle, but there continue to be deals that they go down.
Amanda Sweitzer: Appreciate all that detail. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats everyone and congrats to John, too, if you are listening. On the topic of eviction moratorium, I am feeling like that could be a messy time when they start to expire, I wonder if you agree? I mean, some people just start paying again, but then perhaps a swath of people say, I got to leave now because they are making me pay. Is there a risk that you could see some volatility in occupancy when those things start to burn off and we kind of try to get back to some sort of normalcy?
Michael Schall: Hey, Rich, it’s Mike. And maybe Angela want to comment as well, but I think messy was a very good way to describe it because I think we are looking – we evaluate it very much the same way. Back in when AB3088, which again was supplemented by this SB-91, 3088 was passed in August and required residents to pay – COVID affected residents to pay at least 25% of their rent by January 31. And then SB-91 ruled that January 31 date to June. So, the 25% is getting larger and that – it definitely will add pressure to that whole situation. And I am definitely not smart enough to figure out how that’s all going to play out. We are all hoping that this federal stimulus money, we have mostly a B type of portfolio. And so we don’t have any quantification of it whatsoever, but that would certainly help a lot because that would potentially pay 80% of the unpaid rent and we would have to walk away from the 20%, but that’s a whole lot better than what we’ve assumed in terms of our delinquencies. So yes, I think we are recovered in terms of the normal to kind of probably slightly conservative case scenario. And maybe there is a little bit of upside here given SB-91. So that’s how I had answered, but you are absolutely right, I don’t know – I don’t for sure know the answer to it.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then you kind of talked about your portfolio sort of characterization B quality. I guess I am a little surprised that the portfolio didn’t do a little bit better with the disruption going on in the urban core, you would think that your portfolio being largely once removed from those environments might have captured a bit more in terms of flow of residents. And it’s easy for me to say, obviously, there is a lot going on in your markets, but perhaps maybe it’s that very characteristic of your portfolio again sort of B quality, not necessarily downtown locations that gives you the feeling to say something like cautious optimism? I am wondering if that’s a driving factor to some of the optimism that you are kind of trying to say today?
Michael Schall: I mean, optimism is – I am not sure we are if optimistic is, yes, it looks like we’ve hit bottom after get it being pummeled, then yes, I guess that’s optimistic. But I wouldn’t say that. I mean, I think that as I said in the opening script and the reason why I put it in there is, hey, this – we’re still at a point where the nation has lost as many jobs as it lost in the financial crisis. And in the financial crisis, our average market rents were down 15%. Seattle was a little worse, about 20%, and Southern California did a little better. So I think we are kind of where we are, where we would expect to be given the extraordinary number of jobs lost. Now it’s not the same as the financial crisis in that you’ve lost these low end service jobs, and they’re mostly in the city servicing at various levels, very wealthy clientele with lots of money. So it’s different, but mostly the same. I would say I am not surprised about where rents have gone in general. And I hope for a robust recovery with vaccine distribution and all that stuff because it seems like a lot of this is really focused on COVID direct outcomes, losing service jobs just because of COVID because those service jobs just aren’t there, they are shutdown by the government. So I think come back pretty quickly because I think people do want to go out to eat dinner and that type of stuff. And so I think it’s going to come back and I hope soon obviously.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And just real quick on the delinquency, kind of just take a reserve against all of the $0.45 hit to this year, I mean, when you really look at that, what’s your experience in terms of then actually not deserving the bad debt tag and they actually become collectible, is it 50% in past cycles or is it hard to say because this one is so different?
Barb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. This cycle is very different than any other cycle. Even during the financial crisis, our delinquency was only 50 to 60 basis points of scheduled rent. So being at 2.7%, which is where we have been the last couple of quarters, is obviously a lot higher. I think in the fourth quarter, we did take – reserved against all of it, and that was really due to the environment. We were in a severe lockdown state for most of the quarter and into January, not really knowing when any of that was going to lift. We decided to take a pause. And we will reassess in Q1 and see where things are at as that goes. And then the $0.45 that I alluded to in my script, that’s really compared to our historical run rate. So for the foreseeable future, we do expect delinquency to remain elevated. This eviction protection moratorium, SB-91 goes until June. And then we don’t know what’s going to happen after that. So we have assumed that we don’t make a lot of progress on the delinquency. It’s not because we can’t collect, it’s a combination of both, people not paying and collections kind of are getting us to that mid-2% range of scheduled rent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning out there, guys. Just a quick one from me. We have covered a lot of ground. But just on this disconnect between reported same-store and FFO, given the cash concession accounting treatment versus GAAP with respect to revenue and FFO. So if we sort of assume the concessions, heavy concessions shut down on June 30, let’s say, which I think is sort of implied in the outlook. Help us understand the cadence thereafter when you would sort of stop seeing that disconnect between the two series, just as we think about modeling that into 2022, it sounds like?
Barb Pak: Yes. Well, I don’t have 2022 guidance at this point. But in the back half of the year, we do expect concessions to moderate, not to abate completely but to moderate. And that’s where you will see – it will benefit same-store revenue growth but the offset will be on core FFO growth given that we will have to amortize the straight line of concessions and so that will mute our core FFO growth relative to the same property growth that you will see. And we expect that to happen in the last two quarters of this year and then 2022 is not something I can give at this time.
Rich Hightower: Yes, right. Thanks, Barb. I guess that part of it for – while the concessions are still heaviest. But I mean, could you – is there a way to walk through the timing, assuming a 12-month lease or something like that, that would say, okay, by this point in 2022 you would see same-store and FFO converge or correlate more in the way they have historically, is there way to frame that out or is it just sort of reaching too far at this point?
Michael Schall: Yes, Rich, this is Mike. Let me add something here. And Angela is in the middle of this, so she can comment too. But it’s more like a battle everyday because we are constantly increasing or pulling back concessions, changing rent levels, trying to find the optimum for net effective rents. And so it’s impossible to model that. And so I’d say, trust us to do a good job of trying to figure that out. We have people that are spending very, I’d say, senior people that are spending a lot of time in the trenches pricing units. Everyone is a little bit different, as you can imagine supply and demand changes on a daily basis. And we just can’t tell you what’s going to happen. We can’t tell you – our guidance is based on something, but the reality is, we can’t tell you that that exactly is going to happen. And the mix of concession and rent differential it could change. And this is – I have been here for a really long time, many of you probably say too long. But it’s unlike any other period I’ve seen. And as a result, it’s very difficult to be too granular with respect to answering these questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. Good morning out there. First, we’ll continue to congrats. So Angela and Barb, as we sit here in New York, on your new roles, that’s wonderful. But Mike, to the point of CEO succession planning, I mean, obviously, we saw Avalon Bay do it. You guys did it a number of years ago when Keith handed the reins over to you. It did seem from the outside that John was being groomed. Maybe that wasn’t the case. But again, on the outside, that’s what it looked like. So can you just talk a little bit about CEO succession? Does this impact anything, does it not? And just any other impact that may come of this or maybe this open up – this opens up spots in the senior ranks to allow you to groom more people to raise the more senior roles at Essex?
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. It’s a good one, really important. We take succession planning super seriously I’m really pleased that I have 3 very, very capable executives around me. And I think as I look even beyond them, we have a pretty deep bench. And you are right I was somewhat surprised when John contacted me late third quarter, early fourth quarter about sort of a change of plans involving him. And I asked him to reconsider. And we all need to live our lives and make decisions. And so we decided on the course, and it probably took too long to come to agreement about what his role was going to be going forward. We ended up with the press release after Christmas, it could have been much earlier, just took time to finalize what that was going to look like. So apologize for the optics of it. Having said that, John is always in our minds and our hearts, and he’s forever a part of the company. And certainly, we wish him well. He’s done a tremendous amount of good the company. So as we think about succession planning, the basic philosophy is the doors to or the pass to the CEO job are always open. And the historical path has been mostly through finance. I came through finance and then ran ops and then up. And – but we want other paths to be open too, including maybe through operations or through investment. So wherever we see talented people, it’s one of my primary jobs to keep those pads open and don’t let them be blocked by people that are – that don’t have interest in being CEO. That’s kind of the key to the whole thing. And then backing off of that down looking at the people below and making sure that they have diverse experiences in moved around the organization. And in the case of Barb, Angela, John, all of them were of rive hats on their way to up the organization. So we expect to continue to do that. And I think that’s the way it has to be in order to have a proper succession process.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, one of the hallmarks of Essex has been investing when there is abnormalities in the market. And Mike, you mentioned something interesting that in the suburbs, the rent affordability index was at perhaps an all-time higher, definitely elevated, whereas the urban areas are below the average more affordable. However, you guys have sold out of the urban areas and been more suburban. So does this make you want to switch and now sell more suburban, get back into the urban or are there other dynamics at work where with this pricing affordability imbalance, you wouldn’t do what maybe you would have historically done prior to the pandemic?
Michael Schall: Maybe I’ll have Adam comment on that, and then I’ll fill in when he’s done. Because he looks at the stuff in a lot of detail, and he – I give a lot of credit because he’s out there transacting when no one else is. And some of the transactions he’s done, we are so close to the pre-COVID period. And I think it’s pretty exceptional to what we’ve been able to accomplish. So Adam, do you want to comment on that?
Adam Berry: Sure. Yes. And Alex, hopefully, this gist of what you’re looking for. We are always – we are looking at all of our markets at all times. And so during this recent kind of recent – during COVID period, we’ve been primarily sellers. And most of those we sold in the CBDs. And we’ve done that for a variety of reasons, and that dates back to – we sold Eteno and downtown LA sold Masso in San Francisco prior to COVID. And those pricing on those deals was significantly above what our in-place NAV was at the time. And so we felt at the time the right decision to make from an arbitrage standpoint was sell those and reinvest in either our existing portfolio, buy back stock or in other assets in suburban locations, the really heavily impacted CBD locations, quality of life, especially, say, in downtown LA, in Soma, in San Francisco has been challenging and will likely continue to be challenging here for the foreseeable future. Many of the, what we consider, what we call suburbs are very densely populated suburbs, and that’s where we see opportunity, and that’s where we see much of the market coming back sooner rather than later. So like I said, we’re constantly assessing where we are. And if there are opportunities in CBD, where we can buy at a good basis, and we see significant rent growth, we’ll do that. But yes, I mean, like I said, we’ve been net sellers here, and we’ve sold – all the deals that we’ve sold last year and then into this year have been within a 2% of our pre-COVID NAV, some above, some slightly below. So that’s been the right philosophy and the right strategy and we’ll assess as we go along. Mike?
Michael Schall: I say it well. Alex, maybe I’ll add one more thing, just real briefly. The walk score issue is pretty interesting to me because the areas with the best rent growth have the worst walk score. And then the CBDs and some of the places that have the best walk score have been hammered in terms of rent. So everyone needs to ask themselves a question, will walk score ever matter again? And my view is it will. And it will be nuanced, and it may not be the highest walk score gives you the best rents. But I just haven’t believe having a nice location, low crime, pleasant surroundings, lots of entertainment and food options, etcetera, is going to continue to be important. And those are in sort of the high-quality suburbs that Adam just referred to.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Zach Silverberg: Hi, good morning out there. Just a quick one for me. Just a follow-up on an earlier one. In your supplemental and in your prepared remarks, you talked about the VC investments and job postings in Essex market. Maybe can you give a little historical context around that? Is there a specific correlation that you’re looking for or bag time or how are you able to sort of quantify this momentum in terms of lease-up or lease rates?
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. I have the experience of living through the Dot-com bubble and then bust. And I would say that what I see relative to that is not even close. During the dot-com bubble period rent surged about 40% in 2 years. It set our all-time high in terms of rent to income level, so rents being at a very high percentage of income level. And contrast that to what I said earlier which is rents appear very affordable. San Francisco real rents down somewhere around 20%. Well, Northern California, in general, is about 7% below our long-term average of rent to income in terms of affordability. And if I compare – if I take a look at that number and compare it to the financial crisis, I think we got to about 90% of the long-term average. So in Northern California, we are at 93%. So starting to feel pretty affordable, again, these are areas that support high income, high jobs, high-paying jobs, etcetera, and the rent levels are now at a point where I doubt that the tech companies are going to at and all that much at the cost of living because affordability has changed pretty dramatically overnight. Now I can change back. It doesn’t take that many new apartment units of demand to come in and take 96% occupancy to 97%, and then it’s a whole different game. But that’s the way that we look at it, we’ve said the band between the rental income, the band between 90% and 110% is kind of the green zone that we do well in. And in the markets that have been hardest hit, we are closer to the 90% of the long-term historical average. And again, in Ventura, we are above the 110%. So it’s – it will change the choices that renters make, I believe.
Zach Silverberg: Got it. I appreciate the color. I just have one quick follow-up on. In your guidance, you’re not really guiding for any development. Can you maybe just comment there? Is there any future opportunity that you guys are looking at? Anything that right now, you guys just sort of haven’t contemplated in the guidance, any color there?
Adam Berry: Yes. Zach, this is Adam. We’re constantly looking at different development opportunities. And we do get exposed to quite a few to work through our pref pipeline as well, and they kind of can both feed off of each other. We have a couple of deals right now where we’re looking at fairly seriously in predevelopment stages where we’re spending minimal pursue dollars. We actually did – we walked away from a predevelopment deal last year, but there continues to be some potential there as well. So we are looking for unique opportunities. The development yields right now are potential, generally speaking, but these two or three that we are looking at ones are really well located, high-quality of life, suburban location. One is really good job center TOD. And then the other one is also a very good job situation with some existing income. So looking at everything and one or two might fit the bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Malkin: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Two questions. One for Mike, one for Adam and also congratulations Angela and Barb as well. First, looking at the sort of recovery that you guys are sort of talking about and then starting in the second half. I guess I just want to kind of understand what you think that looks like in terms of the timeline to get back to like, I guess covered? I asked because you look at your main Essex markets, about 1.1 million jobs have been lost in 2020. And you’re assuming like 3.4% or around 400,000 jobs. So a little under 3 years of that kind of growth will be needed to get back to a level commensurate with pre-COVID. So just based on those things, Mike, how do you guys see that sort of recovery? And I understand the comps in the second half of this year are going to be very easy. But after that, what do you guys kind of think about we are at again like pre-COVID type pricing?
Michael Schall: Yes. That’s a great question. Well, for example, based on the job losses in San Francisco, we should be a lot lower occupied than we really are. And so what happens during the recession is people move closer into the better areas. Plenty of people will say, hey, I would live in San Francisco, but the rents are too high. And so they live within the proximity around San Francisco and commute in. And then once this happens, they make a different choice, and they say, hey, with those rents, there is a backfilling approach. And so I would agree with you. What happens, the natural consequence of that is, and then obviously, there’s another way beyond that and another way beyond that. And somewhere out there on the hinter lands and the very periphery with the Bay Area, you have areas that are not 95% occupied, that be 80% occupied because people make different choices based on pricing. And again, this has been one of the absolutes in my career and why we harp on this rent to income ratio is being so important. So the people – the number of people that moved out of San Francisco versus has been backfilled, but largely by people that have moved in from, let’s say, Oakland or further out and want to live in the city. And then backfill process is ongoing. So here we are at 96%, having lost all those jobs that you just mentioned. And so the question is when those jobs come back, how does this how does this reverse itself? And some of these people will be happy to live in the city for a year and then maybe it will be priced out of the city and will be moved into one of these secondary markets. So you’re absolutely right. But – and again, we price it – this is part of why we price things to keep occupancy high because if we keep occupancy high, we’ll draw people out of the, let’s say, the less desirable suburbs and you wait for demand to come back, and that is our way of maximizing revenue during the recessionary periods.
Neil Malkin: I totally appreciate that strategy. I think it’s the right one. I guess, I am just trying to get at – like totally – it’s great that you have 96% above occupancy, but that doesn’t – the market rents are still terrible. So yes, I guess, I mean like 2022, I don’t know, I’m just saying, like you got – like 2023, are you back? I’m just trying to kind of assess what that looks like for the portfolio. I don’t know if I can’t give that, that’s hard I apologize it?
Michael Schall: No, you are spot on. I mean, unfortunately, we won’t be able to be all that specific about this. I would tell you that part of the reason why we do what we do is because concessions can abate pretty quickly. And I can’t tell you how quickly, and I can’t tell you how many jobs it’s going to take in order for that to happen. But I can tell you that that is typically what happens that concessions as quickly as they can. They can go away just as quickly. We are going to have the overhang from the straight-line rent issue, which is a different factor, but our hope is that we get enough demand. Those tech companies continue to hire people bring – they decide to live somewhere close to the major urban centers or where most of the job locations are. And again, it just doesn’t take that much. But how long will it take to get back to where we were? I mean it’s a battleship, and it’s going to take a year or two at least to get back there, is what I would guess. I mean, the trajectory, as you pointed out, we lost a whole lot of jobs in the nation, and we’ve gotten some of them back, but we are still going to have a shortfall and we are delivering some apartment units. I’d argue that the single-family component is so muted and a lot of markets have a lot more single-family as a percentage of total stock, housing stock than we do. And that is around – I think it was like 0.3% production level will help a lot. And so I think – I would guess that as the restaurants open up. We are going to see a surge of people coming back into the cities in these service jobs, and concessions are going to abate pretty quickly that’s what I think would happen and we will be updating as quarters go by, but it’s hard to tell exactly when this is all going to happen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks, guys. I appreciate you keeping this going. So – and also a lot of great detail in the release on jobs posting and some of the macro forecasts despite all of this uncertainty. Your response to a question on migration patterns that some people left aren’t coming back certainly seems to be the case. But how are you contemplating or does your guidance account for the portion of residents that didn’t lose their jobs or even students that temporarily left your market or campuses in these markets?
Michael Schall: It really doesn’t. I mean, we assume that there is sort of a tailwind, a demographic tailwind in that people live longer, and they retired about at the same time that they used to retire. So they have longer retirements. People live longer, consume houses without consuming jobs. And so there’s sort of a presumption that, that is a demographic tailwind that’s going to be with us as long as live longer. In terms of being more granular than that, we’re really not. And we know those people are out there. There are lots of contract workers and I don’t have that data. It was something that John used to focus on a lot. But a lot of contract workers that left amid COVID and connected with both the entertainment industry and the tech industry. How many of those come back remains a question too. So I view it as when uncertainty unfolds everyone kind of pulls in the companies become less aggressive at hiring. We saw that. We saw the drop-off of tech jobs by the top 10 employers there. And all the contract workers go home if there’s a little bit of a bright spot here the Trump administration was pretty negative on H-1B visas. That will probably open up a bit, and immigration might open up a bit here, which I think will help somewhat. But we don’t try to get more granular other than to look at the supply demand ratio really represented by drop in jobs, that’s probably 80% of the total picture or something like that.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. No, that’s helpful. I appreciate the thoughts there. And then, Barb, I think you mentioned kind of concessions run high in the first half of the year, but was wondering if you could put a finer point on that. Do you expect the net effective pricing that you provided in the release this quarter? Do you expect the pricing you achieved in 4Q in early part of the year that, that reverses because we don’t see the demand come back until maybe later in the year or does it kind of hold around current levels and then improve in the back half of the year?
Barb Pak: Are you referring to S-16, the new and renewal when you talk about net effective pricing? Just want to...
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, correct. I think you were doing gross before and provided some net effective data this quarter.
Barb Pak: I think Angela can talk about pricing, but yes, in the guidance, we do assume concessions remain relatively consistent with Q4 for the first half of the year. And then moderate in the second half of the year.
Angela Kleiman: Yes and that’s a good question, it’s Angela here. On the pricing, I think the way we think of it is that Mike talked about market rents troughing kind of currently, fourth quarter or December, January. And I talked about scheduled rent troughing. And say by the end of second quarter because I was looking at year-over-year. And so there is a couple of different factors, which may be a little confusing. So as far as pricing is concerned, we currently do see – what we reported in January to hold. Keep in mind this is also toward the lower peaking season. So as we progress and if the economy continues to improve, and reopen, we – that’s why we talked about second quarter – I’m sorry, second half of the year being better. But it’s hard to talk about it kind of month-to-month. I think right now, we’re in good position because we had employed the strategy of higher occupancy and which allows us to reduce our concession. And so we’re able to continue to do that and that’s what we are targeting for our guidance for the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Nick Ellico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Sumit Malhotra: Hi, guys. This is Sumit here in for Nick. And I apologize, I know we all asked the same questions differently, but I just want to sort of understand how you guys look at this problem. 2020 wasn’t a normal year for leasing. The cadence actually changed. Most of your occupancy gains happened in Q3. And in Q3, I thought looking at the month-to-month stuff, July was the peak year sort of occupancy burst and then a little bit sort of 50%, 50% split in August, September. You also offered more concessions in the Labor Day kind of time frame. So I guess if everything – the concession side, vaccine aside, everything is sort of – if you look at it from a normal lease expiration schedule perspective, things are weighted towards the Q3. How does that sort of reset the more normal kind of cadence of turnover and leasing unless you invite in shorter leases or I’m just inquisitive on that?
Angela Kleiman: This is Angela here. I think you’re asking about the cadence of our leasing season, and if that’s the case, if that is your question, we would expect that cadence itself for 2021 to be somewhat similar to prior years. And so we would expect, depending on our markets, for the most part, they kind of they start peaking, say, around June and sale peaks later, say closer to July. And that’s – during those times, we tend to have the least amount of concessions, but because our leases also more leases turned during that time, we may – we would probably end up with slightly lower occupancy just by the way the number work. So that kind of gives you the trajectory in terms of our business. But the reason we’re talking about when things trough and the year-over-year comparables because that does impact what happens for the whole year and that behaves differently because of COVID last year. Because second half of 2020 – I’m sorry, first half was 2020 was much better than second half. And so you kind of have that flip in terms of year-over-year growth for first half of 2021 will be much harder and second half will be easier.
Sumit Malhotra: Got it. Okay. Yes, yes. A little more clarity on the cadence is what was what I wanted to hear. So, thank you. And in terms of like when we look at your macroeconomic forecast, kudos to Mr. Paul Morgan and team. I guess, it appears that Northern California has the highest job growth at 3.4%, but the lowest rent growth at minus 3.6%. So there’s a lag. I assume that the lag is related to the hyper concession activity we saw in 2021 and 2020. And so you’re sort of building back from there. But I’m also wondering whether you guys have any sort of factors or discounts for jobs that are created by companies domiciled in California, but have been offered the employees the flexibility to work from anywhere. So is that factor in into your kind of negative 1.9% rent growth forecast, effective rent forecast?
Michael Schall: Let me comment on the minus 1.9. So what that represents is each month, year-over-year, what the market that effective rent differential is year-over-year. So again, if you look at January of this year, the prior year rents were going up, and obviously, we’ve had a big decline in current rent. So you start with a large negative number in January year-over-year. And then as you go through the year, those lines are going to cross because we’re going to end up with a lot easier comps in the second half of the year. And so it really is the trajectory of rents year-over-year. So, it’s going to start with a big negative in January, and then it’s going to go to a mid-single-digit positive by the end of the year and averaging all that out. So January over January, February over February, projected market rents. Average all that out to minus 1.9. So it’s not intended to be because of concessions. It’s really because we’ve had – we start the year – again, the prior year rents were all-time highs. Rents have rolled down a lot. So we start in a hole for the first half of this year. And then we start hitting much easier comps as we get into July, August, September and then our year-over-year would be positive. When you average all that together, month by month, you get 1.9 – minus 1.9%. Does that make sense?
Sumit Malhotra: Yes, got it. And then as far as your job growth forecast as being a driver of that model, does that factor in any work-from-home flexibility versus, let’s say, a model that you built in early 2020?
Michael Schall: I didn’t ask Paul that question specifically but he is a very thoughtful guy and he is well aware and very concerned as well about this work-from-home scenario. But again, our base case scenario is that people will have greater flexibility working from home. But again, as a CEO of a company, being able to have this team dynamic, what we’re trying to accomplish. There are so many pieces of this organization that all have to act in unison. You’ve got to know the people. And so that’s what really makes us believe that this hybrid model where greater flexibility work-from-home, but people that are going to be in proximity, unlikely to be far, far away from the office because they’re going to have to report from time to time, let’s say, 2, 3 times a week. We think that, that is probably what’s going to happen for a lot of workers. Again and I am excluding all the workers that have to sure, which I think was estimated at about 60%, including, for example, all of our property teams, anyone that works in a restaurant, etcetera. There was a lot of jobs. There’s no work from home flexibility. There is no such thing. And I think that the – as you read a lot of these reports and news clippings on this subject, they kind of forget about those people. And so I think it’s going to – again, we will have more work-from-home flexibility. And so baby, the city centers are a little bit less desirable. Even though that’s where the great restaurants are going to continue to be, and that’s where the tourism is going and all other things. So – but maybe the suburbs do a little bit better in that scenario.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.
John Pawlowski: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Angela, just a few questions for you on our Northern California portfolio, so I am just curious your thoughts on the quality of occupancy heading into spring and summer leasing when a lot of leases are that were given 1 to 2 months free comps and expire. Are you assuming occupancy meaningful occupancy slippage in the peak leasing season in Northern California?
Angela Kleiman: That’s a good question. At this point, not likely because the occupancy slippage that we’ve seen last year had that were driven by, say, the consultant switched income or people who lost their job. They already lost their job. They are not going to re-lose their job. And so – and Northern California already is sitting at one of our lower occupancy levels and so I don’t – we don’t expect significant further deterioration from that. We have been able to occupancy there. And so that’s a good sign. And so I expect that we will continue to do that.
John Pawlowski: Yes. But 96.5% is well north of market occupancy. And so I mean there is a lot of private competitors that have an on-occupancy. So as it remains concessionary, I know a lot of the pain is out of the system, but is there any kind of reset in occupancy in your portfolio coming?
Angela Kleiman: I don’t see that. But keep in mind, the – some of the major pain points related to CBD, where you have a lot more supply. And we don’t have as much in the CBDs. And so well, it’s still going to be competitive out there. So I’m not dismissing that. I just don’t see further meaningful occupancy deterioration for our portfolio.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then on the rent side, could you share what you think gained the lease is right now in the Northern California portfolio if you include concessions?
Michael Schall: You are making me cry, John.
Angela Kleiman: Not a pretty number, I can tell you that. So in January we are – okay January or number, close to up, yes. So gain-to-lease for Northern California as a whole is about 8%. But I do want to also give a little context, right, because while loss lease is an important metric, during seasonally low or slow periods like in the first quarter or in the fourth quarter, and market rent has much higher volatility. So it negatively impacts this metric. It is not as meaningful well it’s not something we would want to hang our hat on, which is whenever people ask us we always point them at average because it’s not too hot, not too cold. So this number isn’t great. But typically, during this time, December isn’t great. Obviously, it’s a larger magnitude. But there are a lot of volatility and smaller number of leases turned during this time. So that magnifies that volatility.
Michael Schall: And let me add a little color, John. So overall, it’s about 4.6% on the portfolio. And typically, there is a gain-to-lease almost every December, more like in the 2% range. So again, you’re picking the worst part, bad boy for that. You’re picking the first part of the portfolio. And so I wanted to give you that broader context so that it was taken with a little bit of a broader view of what that looks like.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman. Please proceed with your questions.
Alex Kalmus: Hi, this is Alex Kalmus on for Dennis. We talked a lot about migration, but curious, you guys are now where the tenants that have come – where they’re coming from, like their previous living situation. So are there a lot of apartment through apartment moves or have you also seen some pickup in potentially younger adults living with parents that came back to apartment situations?
Michael Schall: That’s a very good question. And I don’t have the data I wish I had on that. We noted, I think, last quarter that the number of adults living at home was something like 100-year high, right? So there is obviously a lot of people out there that work from home flexibility, etcetera. And I’m pretty sure that, that will uncouple itself in due course. So, most of us don’t want to live with our parents forever. So – but I am sure that, that’s a piece of it. I don’t have the sense that the really hiring has picked up quite yet. But typically, what happens is the new year comes with new budgets and new business plans and things get going really after Super Bowl Sunday. And then we’ll have a much better sense probably in a quarter about what’s happening. And you see you hit one of the key ones, how many adults are living at home with their parents or recent college graduates, for example, that have work-from-home flexibility and can work-from-home, save some money that’s one piece, but there are other pieces. The contract employees coming back, which are big time part of the part of the high-tech industry. H-1B visas people that work are forced to go home because of COVID and potentially can come back. So there are a number of possible pieces of demand that are out there that we can see coming back. I just don’t have a way to monitor them or follow-on.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you for the color. And just hitting on that last point, you mentioned on the H-1B visas. And forgive me if you talked about this earlier, given the overlapping calls today, but is the new administrations, potentially more integration friendly policy, do you see any benefit have you seen any benefits so far and are you expecting any job growth or movement from those change in policies?
Michael Schall: Yes, I do. I mean, I’d say the Trump administration was very tough on the foreign workers coming into the U.S. A lot of the technology jobs, and a lot of, obviously, the technology CEOs have indicated that they need to draw the best and brightest from around the world, and that it’s good for America for that to happen. Some of the policies that the Trump administration followed were not giving work visas to the spouses of foreign workers and just in general not accommodating them making the renewal process more challenging. They also tried to make actually, the process more fair as well. But – so it’s a negative. But I would expect the Biden administration I think I saw something recently. I don’t have anything that I pulled for the call. But I think I said something recently that they will open up in addition to not building any more walls, etcetera, that they will open up the immigration process to foreign workers, which would mean a lot of workers went home because they’re their spouse couldn’t work or they didn’t have another occupation. So it changed the dynamic of that program. So I do look forward – I do think that, that will be a positive, whether it’s a material positive it remains to be seen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
John Kim: Thank you. Is it your understanding that tech companies are going to follow Google’s lead and not require employees to return until September I am just wondering what’s your assumption in guidance as far as the timing of workers returning to office?
Michael Schall: It’s a good question. We don’t – we’re not making any assumptions about that. And that remains one of the unknowns. All the COVID-related items, I guess, remain unknown. Again, our core belief is that most of these companies have announced that they do want their employees to come back to the office. They’ve been a whole series of pushing back to office states, allowing workers being concerned about in the Google’s case, be concerned about making sure that workers have enough flexibility to plan their lives and lease an apartment, for example, somewhere else that they wanted to. One of the big tech companies don’t remember which one told, ask all of their employees to come back into the current country into the U.S. that was a good positive start and a step toward normalization. And – but again, there’s no basic assumption that we’ve made with respect to that. We’re just assuming that with virus vaccine distribution that the world will become much more normal as we approach immunity. And as soon as that happens, both of these companies will come back to working at the office.
John Kim: Okay. And Angela, in your prepared remarks about an hour ago, you mentioned the strength of the life science office market. I am just wondering if there is an opportunity to focus more in some of the biotech clusters that you operate in?
Angela Kleiman: I think that’s an Adam question on investments.
Adam Berry: There are a few markets that we have targeted that on the development side and investment side that are heavily driven by life sciences and biotech. So absolutely, we see that as a continued driver to the economy and it continues to grow.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to participating in the Citi Conference coming up in about a month and hopefully, we will meet with many of you there remotely. But I also hope that sometime in the not distant future, we can meet once again in person. Have a nice day. Again, thank you for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining the call today. Once again, we would like to offer our best wishes to all of those impacted by COVID-19. On today's call, John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Our results continued to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including extraordinary local and state government responses. Our reported results for Q3 reflect these unprecedented challenges, resulting in a 6% decline in core FFO and 6.7% lower same property revenues. Despite a variety of challenges, we were mostly successful in our goal of maintaining occupancy and rental rates to the extent possible, which John Burkart will discuss in a moment. Our first priority continues to be the safety of our employees and residents while deploying technology throughout our portfolio, given a strong consumer preference for touchless interaction. Regulatory hurdles have been pervasive across our markets, creating a new level of complexity and administration for our property teams. As can be seen on Page F16 of our supplemental package, California has developed a four-tier system applied to each county for determining the severity of COVID-19 restrictions. Fortunately, recent changes have been mostly moving Essex markets into less restrictive tiers. San Francisco recently reached the least restrictive yellow tier for allowing offices and indoor dining to reopen, among other improvements. Similar positive changes have occurred across several of our markets in recent weeks which represent welcome news for local businesses and residents. We have previously noted that the apartment business closely follows local housing supply and demand trends and seasonal patterns. Given the pandemic, these normal seasonal patterns were disrupted by massive job losses resulting from the pandemic and related shelter-in-place orders. In April, year-over-year, job losses were 13.7%, followed by a solid job growth in May and June. Job gains then moderated again this summer as shelter-in-place orders were extended upon a surge of COVID-19 cases. By September, job losses in Essex markets were still down 8.7% year-over-year, a positive trend from April but still lagging the 6.4% national average job loss. For perspective in the financial crisis, peak to trough U.S. job losses were 9.1 million over 20 months. This year, the nation lost 20.8 million jobs in just two months. We attribute the greater job loss and slower economic recovery in California and Washington to very restrictive shelter-in-place mandates. We see the recovery path ahead as reversing the job losses in the cities and industries that suffered the greatest impact from the shutdown. Tourism, travel, leisure and hospitality sectors were among the hardest hit and they are concentrated in the urban core of various cities. The restaurant industry provides a good example. Using the open table data as of last week, the number of dining reservations in Los Angeles fell by 66% compared to one year ago, while Seattle and San Francisco both declined 78%. This compares to other large cities like Miami, Denver, Dallas and Atlanta, with only 30% to 40% declines. Similarly, employment in hotels, live entertainment, and local transportation activities are down 37% to 50%. And they should have a strong recovery as cities reopen. In Southern California, the TV and film industry is a significant wealth creator and it was decimated by COVID restrictions. In the third quarter, the number of shoot days began to recover from near shut down but remained down 54% year-over-year. The industry is now trending in the right direction and production permits has steadily increased since June, suggesting employment will continue to rise. Younger workers have faced many challenges in the pandemic, including greater job loss and higher unemployment rates compared to more experienced workers. Employers often delayed hiring and reduce the number of job openings during the pandemic as offices and small businesses closed from shelter-in-place orders. Many college graduates chose to move home rather than relocate in proximity to their new employer as a result of work from home flexibility. As a result of these conditions, the share of 18 to 29-year olds living with a parent increased to 52% this summer, up 500 basis points year-over-year and the highest level in over 100 years. The combination of lower immigration from new graduates and higher out migration from young singles has played out in different ways across our market. We have seen pockets of strength in Ventura, Orange County, San Diego, and outer suburban markets in Seattle in Northern California. By contrast, our urban and tech centric sub markets are deeply discounted to attract residents. Meanwhile, tech companies are speaking with their pocketbooks, companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon continue to expand their real estate footprint in our markets. Notably, Facebook's expanded campus in Menlo Park, and their acquisition of our REI new headquarters in Bellevue, Google's continued plans for urban village in San Jose, and Amazon's continued growth in Bellevue and other sub markets in the Seattle area. As always, we continue to monitor the pace of job openings amongst the top 10 tech employers in our market. And while these numbers are down year-over-year, we are encouraged by recent increases in openings from 9 of the 10 companies in our survey. While today's 17,000 openings are significantly lower compared to the pre-COVID period, today's level is consistent with the pace of hiring they experienced in 2016 and 2017. It appears that the most successful tech companies in the world remain committed to our markets, and most of them have announced work - return to office plans in 2021. Turning to our initial thoughts about 2021, we plan to provide annual guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings report. There are many moving parts to the guidance discussion, including the impact of the winter's Coronavirus trajectory, the timing of vaccines and improved therapeutics and any new government stimulus measures. With that said, we base our modeling on the consensus of third-party economists for next year's GDP growth, which is currently around 3.7% and compares to this year's minus 3.6%. If that proves accurate, we would expect to benefit from positive tailwind in the form of steady employment growth and rising consumer confidence. In addition to the boost from an improving job outlook, the potential for a COVID vaccine to become widely available next year is an obvious positive that would reduce the need for social distancing and shift the work from home dynamic from a requirement to a lifestyle decision to come to several negative such as potential pay reductions for remote workers, lack of face-to-face collaboration and networking, and potentially fewer career advancement opportunities. Finally, with respect to our year-over-year growth trajectory next year, we would expect to hit an inflection point, during the second quarter as we anniversary the steep COVID related declines. This could set the stage for gradual improvement in rental growth in the back half of 2021. Again, assuming further easing of COVID related restrictions. Our data and analytics team completes its own fundamental research on supply, indicating around 33,000 apartments supply deliveries in 2021, which is similar to 2020. While that continues to represent just below 1% of our apartment stock is still too much supply until the pace of job growth accelerates further. As with the past several years, the 2021 apartment supply estimates from third-party research providers are well in excess of our expectations, implying a ramp up of deliveries that we do not believe is feasible, given skilled labor constraints within the construction industry in our markets. Turning to the apartment investment markets, we have now sold four apartment properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contracts subsequent to the implementation of shelter in place orders in March. Given the wide discount and valuation for public rates compared to the private real estate markets, we continue to market additional properties with the goal of funding at a minimum all of our investment needs through dispositions. Other than the AIMCO sales that were part of its announced reorganization, very few sizable apartment transactions occurred during the quarter. Generally, the number of properties being marketed has been extremely limited since March and is now slowly increasing. Therefore it remains too soon to draw conclusions about cap rates going forward. In the suburbs where rents have remained relatively stable since the start of the pandemic, cap rates and property value should not change materially compared to the pre-pandemic period. In those suburban areas, we expect high quality properties to sale in the low-to-mid 4% range in terms of cap rates. Given significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate a 5% to 10% discount to pre COVID valuations, with a few sales that we've seen in these markets assuming a fairly rapid rent recovery. As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range. Significant positive leverage and active sources of debt significantly limits the amount of distress of the markets. Finally, I'll end with a brief comment related to California Prop 21. Including the extraordinary opposition effort coordinated by the Californian's Responsible Housing Group, I would like to commend the leadership of this group including RM, John Eudy for their unrelenting focus its steadfast effort in opposing this flawed proposal. Prop 21 would surely make housing shortages worse in California. The No on 21 Campaign has assembled an amazing constituency consisting of hundreds of organizations, including Veterans Groups, Affordable Housing Advocates, the California NAACP, the State Chamber of Commerce, and scores of others along with Governor Newsom. Almost every newspaper in California supports defeating Prop 21. We all greatly appreciate your effort. And now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. I want to start by thanking the E team. Throughout this period of extreme volatility and complex regulations, they acted thoughtfully and tirelessly to serve our customers. We were successful in our objectives of building occupancy during the third quarter by using various pricing strategies, including concessions along with leveraging our technological advantage. We've significantly improved our response times in the overall customer experience. Our strategy of using upfront concessions when appropriate reduces the impact of the market dislocation on the rent roll. As noted in the table on the bottom of page 2 of our supplemental, our scheduled rents for Q3 2020 is down only 40 basis points from the prior year's quarter. This positions us favorably for revenue growth as concessions continue to abate and our year-over-year comps become a tailwind. As of mid-October, we're offering concessions of three to four weeks in less than half our portfolio compared to over 75% of the portfolio in the third quarter. No material concessions are being offered in Orleans, San Diego, Ventura, in Contra Costa County. Occupancy in these four counties currently average 97.9% with an availability of 2.5%. Like the fact that we are seeing solid signs of stabilization in many of our markets, I do want to acknowledge that we continue to hear anecdotal stories of owners who reacted slowly to delinquency and rapidly changing market conditions and are now attempting to improve their occupancy position during a seasonally slow demand period. As a result, there may be upcoming challenges in various markets. Consumer behavior related to COVID-19 including consumer preference for larger units, private outdoor space, stairs instead of elevators and communities within commuting distance to employment hubs, yet located in proximity to outdoor recreation amenities continues to impact demand in the marketplace. Turning to our Q3 2020 results as presented on Page 2 of our press release, year-over-year revenues declined by 6.7%. While the year-over-year revenue growth continues to decline due to the change in the rental market post-COVID, the improvement in the sequential revenue decline is consistent with the signs of stability that we're seeing in the market. Although we're not currently giving guidance, I want to remind everyone that the combination of a very tough occupancy comp of 97.1 from Q4 of last year and the fact that lease transactions on average are below last year, it is likely that our year-over-year fourth quarter revenue growth will decline from Q3. Turnover in the quarter increased 73 basis points from the prior year's quarter. Communities with certain attributes were the key contributors in this increased turnover, specifically high rises, communities with markets with a greater demographic of college students and Silicon Valley contracts and consultants. On the regulatory front, various governmental bodies have enacted anti eviction and other resident protection. California recently passed AB 3088, which is a positive step toward replacing the patchwork of local ordinances to COVID-19 related delinquency. Impart AB 3088 prohibits eviction for nonpayment of rent between March 1 and August 31 of this year, establishes a minimum future payment threshold to protect against future eviction and establishes access to small claims courts to pursue collection of past due rent. Washington State has similar regulations expiring at the end of this year. While we continue to see many residents paying down prior balances, we also continue to work with our residents on solving delinquency issues. Lastly, expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by increased property taxes in the Seattle market, and COVID-19 related impacts such as PPE, and higher utilities driven by increased usage from residence for home for longer periods of time. Utility increases in Q3 were offset by year-over-year reduction of 12% in electricity costs, as a result of the various green initiatives we have executed. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market year-over-year revenues in Q3 were down 1.6%, while year-over-year occupancy for the period was flat. The greatest declines continue to be in Seattle CBD where revenues declined 5.6% followed by the east side with a 1.1% decline. Revenues in the south and north sub markets saw increases of 30 and 60 basis points respectively for the same period. Seattle job growth in Q3 declined 8.1% year-over-year. However, Washington unemployment in August remained 60 basis points while the U.S. average of 7.7. It's worth noting that Seattle home purchasing activity increased during the third quarter. On a trailing three-month average from August, year-over-year home prices were up 12% in August. In August alone, home prices were up 17.4% on a year-over-year basis. Moving to Northern California, in the Bay Area market year-over-year revenues in Q3 were down 8.5%. Occupancy for the period was 96.2 a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. Oakland CBD in San Francisco continue to be our most challenged sub markets in Q3 with year-over-year revenue declines of 16.5% to 17.1% respectively, compared to San Jose, where revenue declined 7.2%. In the same period, Contra Costa saw the decline of 4.6%, however, sequential revenues in this sub market increased by 1.6% from Q2. Bay Area job growth declined 9.7% year-over-year in Q3, mainly driven by job losses in leisure and hospitality and trade, transportation and utilities, all heavily impacted by the state's required shutdown. However, there are positive signs of growth in the market. Several Bay Area tech companies filed for IPO during the third quarter, including McAfee, Airbnb, Snowflake and Unity Software. In addition, Google unveiled their plans for a 1.3 million square foot tech village in Mountain View. This new development will have a capacity problem of 6,000 additional employees. Carry home purchase activity picked up during the third quarter on a trailing three-month average from August. Year-over-year home prices in the Bay Area were up as much as 8.6%. In August alone, San Jose market home prices were up 20% year-over-year while San Francisco and Oakland were up 14% for the same period. The increases in home prices makes the transition from renting to homeownership even more difficult, and it shows the continued long-term demand for housing in our markets. Then in Southern California, year-over-year revenues in the third quarter declined 7.3% while occupancy declined only 20 basis points. The LA market continues to be a challenge. In Q3, our West LA sub markets saw the greatest year-over-year decline of 16% while our remaining LA sub markets declined between 9.1% and 12%. LA job growth was minus 9.7% in the same period, while unemployment remained the highest of our markets at 15% in August. In Orange County, Q3 year-over-year job growth declined 10.8% while revenues declined 2.6% and occupancy increased 1.4% in the same period. I do want to note that quarterly sequential revenues in our Orange County sub markets actually increased by 1.9% in Q3. Finally in San Diego, our year-over-year revenues declined 2.1% in Q3. The Oceanside sub market however continued to grow revenues by 2.3% in the same period. San Diego job growth declined by 8.9% for the period. Currently our same store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30-days out is at 4.5%. And our fourth quarter renewals are being sent out with no increase. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, followed by an update on capital markets and funding activities. As noted in our earnings release, and early on, this was a challenging quarter with declines of both same property revenues and core FFO per share. The 6.7% decline in same property revenue growth is primarily driven by concessions and delinquencies. We report concessions on a cash basis in our same property results. Because we believe this approach provides a true picture of current market conditions. The cash impact of concessions was 500 basis points. So, excluding this, our same property revenue decline would have been 1.7% instead of 6.7%. Conversely, on our consolidated financials, with straight line concessions in accordance with gap in calculating core and total FFO. Keep in mind that when concessions abate, our approach will impact the future performance in two ways. First, our year-over-year comparison unstained dollar revenue growth will be favorable. Second, the opposite effect will occur on our FFO growth because there will be a headwind as we continue to straight line concessions over the life of the lease. Onto delinquency, we are encouraged to see total delinquencies declined during the third quarter relative to the second quarter. On the other hand, given the current environment and related uncertainties, we maintain the same approach as last quarter and reserved against 75% of our delinquencies with third quarter. This may prove conservative is California law allows us a clear path to collection of COVID-19 related delinquencies as temporarily provided in AB-3088. The negative impact from our delinquency reserve to same property revenue and core FFO growth was 1.6% and 4%, respectively. Please see the bottom of Page two of our press release and S-15 in our supplemental for additional details. Turning to capital markets. In August, when interest rates dropped down to a level close to the 52-week low, we opportunistically issued 600 million of bonds, consisting of two $300 million tranches, an 11-year and a 30-year maturity at an effective yield of 1.75% and 2.67% respectively. The yield on our 30-year bond was the lowest on record of any Triple B plus rated issuer at that time. Since then, we have repaid a $300 million bond, that's mature in 2022 and have plans to pay up all remaining 2021 maturities at par. The net result is a very low risk maturity schedule for the next two years, was only a $350 million term loan to repay in 2022. As for funding plan for investments in the stock buyback, our structural finance investments are funded by the redemption and our development commitments is less than $73 million over the next two years. Incidentally, because the pandemic has caused delays in development deliveries, our development NOI for the next year will be lower than we expected. Because we are not as far along in our lease offs as we had originally planned. On the stock buyback year-to-date we have repurchased around a million shares at an average price of about $226 per share. We have match funded the stock repurchased with $343 million of property sales, which is comparable to our pre-COVID consensus NAV of close to $290 per share. While we have been opportunistic in arbitraging the compelling discount between our public and private NAV, we paused our share repurchases when COVID-19 caseloads and hospitalizations 32 summer and severe shelter in place orders were issued. Even though we have transacted on a leveraged neutral basis and have reduced our net debt, selling assets also reduces EBITDA. Accordingly, we continue to be mindful of the impact and the debt-to-EBITDA of the impact on adjusted EBITDA ratio in the context of our stock buyback strategy. In summary with minimal near-term funding needs, nothing drawn on our line of credit, and approximately $1.7 billion in total liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong. And we continue to have the flexibility to be opportunistic, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thank you and appreciate all the operating update on the call. If I'm looking at page S15 of the supplemental the operating statistics for October, I know they're done on a gross basis and not taken into account concessions. I know you said concessions were abating. But I'm wondering if you can give the operating numbers do renewal of blended when taken into account concessions for both October and then the third quarter?
Michael Schall: So let me see if I can give you some more information. I may not give you everything there, but let me give you some more information. Number one, on that note, it shows that the market rents the decline in market rents has improved. And that is true. But the fact is last year, we had an easier comp. So I want to make sure we have the context, whenever you know, it's always a challenge with transparency, giving out more information and then not having all the context. So there's a little bit of a headache when it shows how the October rents have improved year-over-year. But that said, our markets are doing well and across the board and showing signs of stabilization or they're actually improving. So I want to make sure we get the right message across as we get to a read and further, you'll see that number reverses a little bit. I don't want people thinking, oh, now things are getting worse. It's not the case, it's just the year-over-year comp. But as we get into what's happening in October, as far as for concessions go, we have - we started the October reducing concessions. And this is off of a Q3, which is over 75% of our transactions had concessions of roughly a month. And then we moved into October the first couple of weeks, and we were at less than 50%. And then as we move into the second half of October, we're actually now at less than 25%. So we're doing that while maintaining occupancy or improving occupancy and while maintaining low availability. So, all those pieces are going in the right direction at Essex. Again, we don't - we're not in the market, we're part of the market, but we're performing very well within that marketplace. When we look at the break between renewals and new leases, there's definitely more leasing incentives on the new leases typically running 3.3% is what we have in there was accurate. On the renewals, it's usually less than a week. Obviously, there's less of an incentive, this is already - people already in the property. Does that answer your question, Nick?
Nick Joseph: That sounds very helpful, and especially the color on the year-over-year trend. And then maybe just the second question. Angela, I appreciate the commentary on the share repurchase program. What would get you to restart it and I'm wondering, obviously, the stock is below where you are purchasing and for some of the reasons that you discussed. So what would get you more aggressive there? Is it price? Or should we expect it to be paused for the near-term regardless?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, I think, Nick, if you look at how we manage our capital allocations, we're not really going to deviate too much from that plan. And so, the key commentary I have is really to make sure that we also at the same time preserve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And so, it'll be a little bit of all of the above what are we selling? And what price and what's the impact on the EBITDA reduction? At the same time, what are our opportunities to reinvest the sale proceeds? So there - if we have more preferred equity for example, then that certainly will be an important piece. And of course, the other piece is where the stock is trading, right. And so, it's all of these things I guess, that factored in.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Sumit Malhotra: I this is Sumit here with Nick. Just a question on cash delinquencies, I know there are 2.2% of scheduled rents. And you recently at a conference earlier in September spoke about positive delinquencies. So could you provide us with an update on how collections are trending on the delinquency side? And how much of this 2.2 will likely head into mid-2021? Also, do you have any delinquencies creeping into your utilities expense side like some of your peers?
John Burkart: Yeah, okay. So, overall, delinquencies are definitely improving. And you can obviously see that from Q3 versus Q2, there are some underlying trends there that occur. And so what's happening is, we are collecting a little bit more in prior delinquencies which is a good thing. Again, I've said all along, we're working with all of our residents. And the great, great, great majority are showing very good behavior. So we are getting a little bit more on the current month's delinquency, is a slight uptick. It kind of ties in with the reduction of the federal aid, but it's really not that material overall. Again, the pitcher delinquency is improving. And so my expectation as we move forward, we continue to have the economy opening up. Although, we still have negative year-over-year job comps, they're getting better and better. And so if on a local level, we actually had seasonal job comps, they would actually show seasonal growth. So things are actually improving out here and my expectation is that delinquency will continue to improve as we move forward. As it relates to utilities or any other line item, they're really running a similar path to the rental delinquencies. If the people who are unable to pay rent are really not paying delinquencies but, yeah there's not paying all of it. So or they're paying a percentage, but the percentage is type of thing. So it's a very parallel path, if that makes sense.
Nick Yulico: Yeah. Hey, guys, Nick here. Just a question - bigger picture question maybe for Mike, what is sort of the biggest selling point you can get investors right now about your portfolio and addressing some of the bigger worries out there, such as potential increase in rent control in California the fact that tech workers are working remotely, and they are in some cases moving to other states like Washington, where there isn't a state income tax. With all that being said what are people missing about the Essex story right now? And I guess, the other thing I'm wondering is, you talked about it sounds like transaction cap rates staying low, much lower than what your stock price implied cap rate is right now. So I mean how do you think about asset sales in this environment as well?
Michael Schall: Yeah, Nick, those are great questions. And I guess I would start with the latter point you made which is the disconnect between public real estate markets and private real estate markets and trying to monetize that difference. And as Angela stated, we paused a bit in the quarter when the COVID cases were increasing. And it's interesting. We think that's just an obvious benefit for operating the machine in forward direction. We are issuing stock and incurring debt and buying property at a positive differential or arbitrage. And we think that that works pretty well in reverse direction as well. So I'd say that is an obvious way to add value, add NAV per share, add FFO share to the company given the current dislocation. I'd also mention that when we look at the amount of job loss we've had, the rent growth, or the rent reductions that we've seen are really I guess, I would say to be expected. And I know everyone is focused on this work from home issue. But if you just look at LA jobs still as of September down 9.6%, San Francisco down 10% and Oakland down 11%and largely driven by things that will - a big portion of them will come back. Like for example, the tourism, restaurants, hotels, the motion picture business in Southern California. Those are the tech industries. But there's nothing fundamentally wrong with them. And I think that most of the rental revenue loss that we've incurred is just a directly attributable to job growth. And so, I think that this will unwind itself and it's already started to unwind itself as Mr. Burkart just outlined in numbers that are slowly getting better or still, I would say in a pretty tough spot with respect to employment, we need that to recover. But the balance sheet is incredibly well positioned. And we do have some ways to add value to the company. And so we see opportunity there. So I guess that's how it answers your question.
Nick Yulico: All right. Thanks, Mike.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. My first question actually was similar to that last question. But, Mike, maybe we could dig a bit deeper into the work from home part? Because, as you stated, it, that seems to be the number one concern for the stock, I believe you said again, as Nick said, cap rates are flat in the suburbs. And did you see talk at least is only minus 5% in the cities verse, I think your stock is implying more of a 20% 25% discount. So the work from home maybe just, can you just talk about that a little bit more and why you're so comfortable that that's not going to impact Essex?
Michael Schall: Yeah, hey again, it's a great question, Jeff. Thanks for joining the call. I guess our thesis is that the hybrid model will likely prevail. And many of the jobs that are in the cities require a physical presence, I would make that point, virtually everything that connects with a customer, from hotels, to restaurants, to bars, et cetera, the motion picture industry where it is pretty hard to film without people being present, et cetera. And so, we see that as probably it's too much focus on, let's say, the tech community, and not enough focused on the number of jobs that are required to actually physically be there to do your job. But, I guess, and thinking about this, and in looking at what others have said, it's pretty interesting. There's obviously a big debate out there. And, the Netflix CEO, for example, said, he doesn't see any positives from working from home. And another CEO, the Zillow CEO says, the easy decision - the easy part of the process of working from home is making the decision, the hard part is actually implementing it. And I think what he means by that is, there are some pretty serious issues that come along with work from home, that are going to take a lot of time and effort to work out. And I would mention, let's say potential for less pay to the employees, how does the compensation issue work out. The productivity issues, how do you continue a culture of collaboration and a vibrant culture when people don't see each other? And I think, it's we found we're largely remote at this point in time, we've found that it's pretty difficult to resolve significant business problems where senior executives have different perspectives on things, when in a work from home type of environment, you're much better off together. So, again, we are thinking that the hybrid model is probably be going to be the main path going forward. The hybrid model will have required some tethering to an office at some point in time to try to keep those collaboration and the vibrancy and the culture together. And so, we still see ourselves has been pretty well position. So, someone may not live in a city, let's say, but we'll live somewhere, potentially nearby, certainly within driving distance. And we don't see that as a bad thing. We have properties in fact, most of our properties are actually out in suburbia. And so, we think we're well positioned for that. And by the way, the other key point here is, we're not producing a lot of housing, and there's not going to be a lot of housing produced out there. So already, as John said earlier, already, we're starting to see rents increase now in suburbia as that dynamic plays out. And they're reducing in the cities and the areas that have previously had higher rents. And so, the market is compensating for all of these issues, as it always does and the decision a renter might have made six months ago, can be very different from the decisions that they're making today. So, net-net we think we're very well positioned and again, we have properties throughout these markets and throughout the commutable locations near the job centers, and we think that's still the right strategy.
Jeff Spector: Thank you, Mike. My follow up would be are you able, you mentioned, I believe that 9 out of the 10 companies you're tracking, you're seeing an increase in job postings. Are you able to track for those postings? I guess, if they're advertising, hybrid, work from anywhere. Is there a way to quantify that or not? No, it's not possible?
Michael Schall: Yes, it's - Jeff, it's hard to do. I mean, we in our September presentation, we gave out the dates for office re-openings of some of the top 10 tech companies, but the reality is that they are moving back to some degree, as if there's another phase of or surge of COVID cases, maybe those get pushed back. It appears and looking at, there was a recent Microsoft announcement that gave greater work from home flexibility, etcetera. But I guess, from our perspective, most of the top 10 tech companies have worked via return to work dates out there. And I think that's significant. Because if they were going - all of them were going a 100% work from home as a couple of smaller tech companies are doing, that would be one thing. But most of them have returned to work dates. And even if they get pushed back a little bit, I guess the significance here is, as long as they ultimately are going back to the office as in some way or another, I think that will solidify the connection to the office. And either way, no one's going to pick up the apple spaceship and move it somewhere else. So, it's there for a reason, there are a lot of services there, including daycare and all kinds of things. And it's meant it's there for a reason. And I don't think that that motivation goes away anytime soon. I guess, you're back to the top 10 tech companies in the job outlook, those are data that we take off their websites, and do our own survey, and have tracked what they're doing for many years, because they're so important to our mission. And they, as I said, they're off their peak, which was actually in March of this year by a reasonable amount. I think, looks like somewhere around 27,000 jobs in March open for the top 10 tech companies down to about 17,000 - about 18,000 is the most recent number. And but, now starting to move back in the other direction. So, it looks like that is starting to get better, not worse.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hightower: Yeah, hey, good morning out there guys. Covered a lot of ground, but I guess Mike, just a follow up maybe on a prior thread. As we think about COVID cases rising here in the US and globally and you're seeing renewed lockdowns in places like Europe. I mean, how does that make you feel about California potentially being first in line to take a similar posture in the months ahead if current trends continue? And then I guess, on the flip side, I mean, given just lowered seasonality in terms of leasing volumes, do you think the impact of that happening would be a lot less material than what occurred during the sort of the second and third quarter?
Michael Schall: Yes, Rich. Hey, you know what I got to say, I greatly appreciate the work that Evercore ISI has done on this issue on the COVID tracking, etcetera it's been fantastic. And we all use it. So, thanks for that. I think that California has been super conservative when it comes to dealing with COVID. And as I said in my prepared remark that means that it accomplished two things at once, it really curtailed the number of the case spread throughout California. And at the same time, it muted our recovery very significantly. So, we're now I think, at a place in California where things are actually in pretty good order. Not that it can't change, and I believe that what will happen is the state will be very vigilant in terms of pushing us back into a more restrictive tier if they have to. But I think as we sit here today, I think we're in a better spot than some of the areas that have been more open, and have let their economy flow more freely. So, we'll take this on a day by day basis. But we look - it looks like California and Washington are actually very well positioned. And I don't think that you would see this, with the chart on Page S16, I don't think you would see this pretty significant movement to reopen the economy, if that wasn't the case.
Rich Hightower: Yeah, that makes sense. And then, just for quick clarification, I think John mentioned 4.5% availability 30-days out at this particular moment, just how does that - give us some context around that, how is that compared to sort of normal for this time of year or year-over-year or along those lines?
John Burkart: Sure, yeah, no that's actually very good overall. I mean, going into this part of the season, Essex as a general rule, we like to have higher occupancy and lower availability going into the season where there's a decline in demand season like and sitting at 4.5% right now availability is a good spot. It's consistent with where we've been in the last several years, the team has worked very hard to meet the market, and very interactive trying to understand what the consumer wants, and off of that and leased our units up and get quality paying tenants. And I think they've done a terrific job, you can see it in our higher occupancy even into October that 96.6. I mean, that's just really, really doggone good. Now, again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in Q4 of last year, we were at 97.1, the market was very, very strong. And so we still have some headwinds. But in context, I think the whole portfolio is doing very well, if either signs of strength in some markets like Ventura, Contra Costa, Orange, and San Diego, or we see good signs of stabilization in many other markets. Or I'll mention, say, in San Francisco and Oakland, for example we see the beginnings of this backfill, that's starting to happen. And we mentioned this before, how in our markets, they are desirable places to live. And so when it's really a value proposition, so when the price gets to the right point, consumers make changes. And so what we're starting to see now, from January through September, the average was about 6% move ins came from the outlying areas, and this is far off commuting places, like say Antioch that we're moving into the Oakland area, and or San Francisco. And the numbers vary, but they're fairly close to that 6%, average all the way through pre-COVID, post COVID, all the way through. And now in October, that number jumped to 14%, literally just jumped. And you look and you say okay, what's going on there, I would say this is the super commuters, the people that they're tethered, as Mike said to the employers. Employers are opening up, and they're looking and saying, I have now my value proposition is to move into San Francisco, move into Oakland, and at a lower price point, avoid that commute. This is a great deal. It works for me. And we're starting to see that. That's a real deal thing that actually happened. So, when I look across our markets, again, I get the strength in certain markets. I get the stability in others and I get the very positive signs in the most challenged places like San Francisco and downtown Oakland.
Rich Hightower: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Good morning. You provided some helpful commentary on the incentive in response to Mike, Joe's questions. But I was wondering if you could provide some additional granularity as far as the effective blended rate growth rates in the third quarter and October?
John Burkart: Well, I guess I'm going to look at effective that one month is 8%. Right. And so if we go three weeks, or three quarters, it adds about 6% off of our lease rates, and that would be one way to look at it to get down to that number. But the reason why I'm not going there is I think it's a little bit misleading, to be honest. I mean, we tend to get into this almost bond mentality of doing a calculation and if we did that, I would have gone back in the last several months at GE rent spell this huge amount net effective. And today I would be saying, oh my gosh, rents have moved up this huge amount because concessions are abating. And I think both of those can be a little bit misleading. As Mike has said, for years, concessions can come into the market and go out rather rapidly. We've used them as a tool to increase occupancy as leasing incentives, and to much lesser extent as in renewals. And so my preference in this case is to really look at it and say, okay, what's going on with our street rents, or market rents or coupon rents and then concessions, where they add? They came into the market in a really big way in June. We use them to increase occupancy pretty dramatically, that's worked. The concessions are abating, we're pulling them back. And I think that's the bigger story. But if you get lost in the net effective rents I'd say, you'll have to go all the way back and say they sell a lot. And now they're increasing. And I think - I don't think that's the best way to look at it.
John Kim: Should we be adding the free rent period to the 12-month lease, or is the 12-month inclusive of the free rent? In other words, is it 12-month lease or 13 only?
John Burkart: It's typically 12-month lease. And yes, if you try to get to net effective again, as I said, you just take the concession amount and say okay, if it's a month, it's 8%. And you'd make that adjustment. So I mean, that's the simplistic way to get there. But again, I just don't think that's the best way to look at what's happening in the marketplace right now.
John Kim: Okay, and my second question is on your suburban portfolio. I was wondering if you could categorize what percentage of your suburban portfolio is transit oriented or is densely populated suburban versus, I guess, your more typical garden style suburban portfolio? And if you do have the breakdown, is there a difference in the performance between the two?
John Burkart: Well. I don't have the details of the breakdown with that. But I will tell you as it relates to performance, transit oriented is really not what's driving anything right now. It's basically a lot of people aren't taking the transit. So they're not on bar and they're not on caltrain. If they're commuting, they're on the road. We've seen that many different ways, but we also see that how much used cars are getting bid up, people are opting to drive. But what we do see is, again the walk-ability as I've mentioned previously, it's the higher the walk-ability typically relates to the higher the price per square foot in rents. And that if you were to look at one correlation that would be the units that are negatively impacted the most. And on the other side, is the lower dollars per square foot or lower walk-ability of the units that have benefited the most in this situation, if that makes sense.
Michael Schall: And hey, John. This is Mike. In our September presentation that's on the internet, there actually is a - there's a chart that describes exactly what John shows you, which is the change in asking rents by Walk Scores on Page 21 of that presentation. So hopefully that'll help. And if you have any follow up questions, give us a call.
John Kim: Very helpful, thank you.
John Burkart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Hey John, I have a question for you. Because I think we maybe have a little bit different take on some of the questioning on this call. I think the market understands that apartments are under pressure. It's one of the worst kept secrets in the market right now. And I frankly, don't think that market is surprised that same store revenue is going to get worse in 4Q and 1Q. I think what the markets looking for is seems to be less bad. And if I think about what you reported last night, particularly for October, you showed that, right. Occupancies improved, leasing spreads were less bad. And so, I think you were making some really important comments about demand as rents come down. So my questions are really - I guess, are really simple one in theory, have we seen the bottom? Do you think that rents have come down enough to attract that incremental demand? And really are we going to start to just reaccelerate from here? Because I really think that the market just need to see less bad, stable to improving occupancy and less bad leasing spreads. So if we're there, I think that's a real positive.
John Burkart: Yeah, and wish you could ask me this in June of 2021 and we can cook for that course of positive. But, obviously, I don't know the future. What I'm trying to point out is, we do have signs of strength that a third of our portfolio is actually moving increasing occupancy rents, stability in large portions of the portfolio. We are not the market, we're a participant in it. And there's some others in the market that are trying to play catch up right now. So, I see volatility going forward. And then recognizing that seasonally, usually Q4 and Q1 are the low points, it would be hard for me to say that I would believe that Q3 is, it turns out to be a low point. But there's just volatility in Q4. A lot of pieces out there, no one knows what's going on with COVID and everything else, but we're feeling good. There are certainly things have improved from what we saw in June and July, which was tremendous amount of activity, trying to find where the market was, we found the market, where the consumers are interested. To your comment, has places in San Francisco and Oakland I brought that comment up, because we are starting to see that people from outlying areas as super commuters are now moving in that value proposition works for them. And that is a very good sign. It's going to be I call it a leading sign. So, that is a good thing. Those markets are still tough and the word acceleration gives me heartburn. But the stability, yes, strength in some other areas, certainly, we're starting to see sequential improve in those four counties that I mentioned. So, overall, I feel much better than it did last quarter, let's put it that way.
Michael Schall: Hey Rich, this is Mike.
Rich Hill: Yeah, go ahead Mike.
Michael Schall: Yeah, let me just add one additional item to that. And that is, normally this time of year, we feel pretty good about giving guidance for the next year. And as john said, we don't this year largely because of the COVID uncertainty or unknowns that we talked about in the opening script. It's just, the world can change so rapidly, and for the better or for the worse and it's not - it's things that are completely outside of our purview of understanding. So, we regret not giving our normal guidance on Page S16 for next year. And but we just can't or they're just too many unknowns. One thing that we're focused on and it's so important on Page S9 of the supplement, our average monthly rental rate is down 40 basis points, and we're trying to hold occupancy, we're trying to hold rate. And if we can do that with, again with jobs still down 8.7% on average, and down 11% in Oakland and 10% in San Francisco, trying to hold rate while we have that much job loss, worse than the financial crisis, I think is an amazing piece. So that's what we're trying to do. And we remain both.
Rich Hill: Yeah, that's really helpful, guys. And like, I would just reiterate to you, given where valuations are right now, I don't think the market needs to see you get back to where you were in 1Q '20. I think the market just needs to see less bad. And I think that's why October was encouraging. That's maybe a long way of saying, if we're not catching a falling knife anymore, and it feels like there's some stability emerging, that sounds like a positive. So, look forward to future updates, guys. Good work on the quarter.
John Burkart: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. So just one quick question for me John, as your private competitors play a little catch up on the occupancy side and as larger rent resets, kind of ripple through sub markets in some of your outside of your portfolio, do you expect occupancy to slide here, coming in the next several quarters?
John Burkart: I don't, I wouldn't say that I expect it to slide. I think the team is doing a phenomenal job. We are very aggressive getting data, we have proprietary data hub, and we pull all the data together. We have daily meetings, pricing and strategy meetings. And it is just an amazing team with leadership all the way through it. And so, we're meeting the market. So, we know that a unit that's vacant, does not earn any revenue and we just for years laughed at the proud and vacant concept that it just doesn't get you anywhere. So we typically are doing 12-month leases and we meet the market and try to understand it, meet it in and stay occupied. So, I don't see the occupancy declining a lot. 96.6 is high but maintaining I'd say 96 and north of 96 I think is what I would expect to see for the next couple of quarters. And then, normally as we start to get into the 3Q - 2Q and 3Q and there starts to be more turnover, that has an impact on reducing occupancy just because of the nature of the turnover. But we will continue to try to maintain higher occupancy. And I just expect there to be volatility and I brought that up, because I don't want people to be surprised by headlines from different vendors saying this is happening here and that's happening there and also thinks that the whole market is going away. There's just individual players that are really struggling right now. There are some people with lost occupancy in the third quarter, which was probably not the best strategy. And now they're trying to figure out what to do.
John Pawlowski: Okay. One follow-up there, are any markets in Northern California where you've taken concessions off and you think you'll have to put them back on into the winter?
John Burkart: No. I mean, it floats around. I mean, right. We're going to use them where we need them. But we have it's - again, we're meeting on a regular basis to figure this out and figure out what where the market is, and what's happening. But I'm not looking right now and expecting huge obvious weakness in one spot or another, I expect volatility. And so to that extent, what I mean by that is yeah, we'll make pricing adjustments as necessary if things pop up. But it's more like whack a mole, and then trying to maintain a good position throughout this situation.
Michael Schall: Hey, John, one quick comment. This is Mike. Just one quick follow up with to what John said. Generally, nothing great happens in the fourth quarter, because hiring which is also affected by COVID. But generally, in Q4, companies just wait until Q1 when they have new budgets and business plans, in order to regain resume hiring activity. So you end up with sort of the worst of both worlds. You end up with less hiring, and of course, the supply deliveries keep coming. So keep in mind that that dynamic is definitely is probably greater this quarter, given the pandemic related issues than it has been in the past. So, really, I think we need to get into the New Year before we have really a great sense of what direction we're going to be going in.
John Pawlowski: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey everybody, thank you for taking the question. First, just curious, given you guys were more aggressive with concessions over the summer to the extent that others are playing catch up. Curious where you kind of peg your in-place effective rents today versus market rents?
John Burkart: Our in place effective rents? Well, do you mean like last delays where are we at?
Austin Wurschmidt: So, yeah if you take into account concessions, looking at your effective rents today, how far below or at market are you so to the extent things do soften further, you've already put in some cushion and to the extent the market is coming to you, versus you having to cut further ultimately?
John Burkart: Sure, again, most of our cuts have really been along the lines of concessions, and we've backed away from those. As we noted, our market rents are down about 5.8% in Q3 2020 over Q3 '19. So we've made adjustments down, it varies by market, obviously with San Francisco being greater and other markets much less. But the market as a whole is really hanging in there, as a general rule with the consumer has been looking for is concessions, leasing incentives, and we've continued to structure our pricing along those lines to meet the consumer where they're at. But what we've seen is that over the recent time, certainly over the summer, things were pretty intense. And then as we got into the fall, this need for concessions backed away. And the more we backed away, the more we're able to continue to maintain occupancy and low availability. So, if necessary, we'll adjust, but right now, we've already dropped our market rents by say 5.8%.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay, yeah, I guess I'm just generally looking for sort of a loss to lease type number. You're more full today, and your loss to lease?
John Burkart: Yeah, our loss to lease is like 3.6% if we look at it that way. Yeah upside down, okay. Yeah, gain to lease sorry. Gain to lease.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Gain to lease, got it, okay.
John Burkart: It's like not have been use to saying that, I mean just lastly, we have gain to lease.
Austin Wurschmidt: Right. Okay. Fair enough. And then in your comments on work from home and you think things kind of get more back to normal over time, you guys are more suburban. So as restrictions get lifted, concerns around the virus, e-services are back up and running. Perhaps the urban cores, take a little longer, so the concessions remain elevated there. Is there a risk that you lose residents that had moved out to more suburban locations, but ultimately want to move back into urban cores and closer to their offices as things do begin to return back to normalcy?
Michael Schall: Yeah, Austin, this is Mike. And John alluded to some of this a minute ago, when he was talking about the October movement of other Northern California markets back into San Francisco and Oakland doubling from the previous numbers. So that definitely there is a there is movement. And largely, it's because of the price differentials. We've discounted now so much in the cities, that they are a relative value compared to the suburban areas. And suburban areas rents is more recently have actually increased, which again, as long as their price differential continues to expand between the cities and the suburban areas, you're going to see more people moving back in. So we think this is just the normal operation of the markets and compensating for find the rent that sells the units in the marketplace. And so, most people don't focus on that relationship of what rents are doing in the suburban markets versus the urban markets, the reality is it very much affects consumer choice. And so now more people are choosing to live in the cities at a lower price point.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. That makes sense. Okay, thanks for the thoughts.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Santos: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered so just two quick ones for me. I was wondering if you could comment, sorry, if you covered this already, on any sort of future or further operation or balance sheet initiatives that you could look to for cost savings just in the face of continued revenue decline. And then second, I was wondering if you could comment more specifically on whether or not you've considered investing in markets outside of California, just given all the California - the issues California faces both near-term and long-term?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. Actually, I would say the pressure on costs are - have increased in COVID. As you can imagine, we had a relatively small collection department, it's now much larger. As you can imagine, selling and changing price and strategy is much more complicated now. So I'd say the business - in terms of operating the business, it's more complicated. But as noted in our - again our September presentation, there are some bright things that are happening. And one of them involves technology, where we said that technology will probably lead to a 100 to 200 basis points improvement in margin overtime. And as I said in my prepared remarks that the consumer has accepted technology actually prefers technology given COVID. And that has allowed us to move pretty strongly into deployment of various different types of technologies. And so there is definitely promise there for reduced cost. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?
Daniel Santos: I was just wondering, if you could comment more specifically on whether or not you considered investing in markets outside of California, just looking all the over-hang?
Michael Schall: Yeah. If we can come to believe that advocating for good housing policies in California is something that we're going to do, we're going to be activated, we're going to spend a lot of time and some money doing it. We think that overall, it makes sense to do that, because it's pretty hard to find what we have here. The combination of supply constraints and very vibrant businesses that are growing rapidly, and which is really what drives rents. It forms this virtual cycle of rents push up, wages and then wages allow higher rents, and you will find that in very few markets. So, we do have a process involved in our strategic planning activities that look at other markets that are similar to the West Coast. We don't think any of them are quite as good as the West Coast. But we continue to look at it, obviously, we're just interested in one thing, we're interested in adding value for shareholders and growing the company. And so, if we see the right set of conditions, we would be compelled to take a hard look at it.
Daniel Santos: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Security. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Malkin: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Thanks for staying on. Appreciate you giving me the time. First one is on the preferred equity side, you continue to be active in that. I would like you originated a couple, one was stabilized. And that was the first time I've seen you do that. Can you just talk about what that market kind of looks like? I thought that, stabilized assets are easy to finance with the agency debt. If you just maybe talk about it, that's a new trends you're seeing or maybe overall, what kind of opportunities you see in that part of your business?
Adam Berry: Sure, Neil this is Adam. So, we've definitely seen, we're still very active in the market and have seen more, there is ample debt out there for stabilized assets. But underwriting has definitely has been more challenging for some sponsors. So, we are seeing more and more opportunities on the stabilized side. And you saw the one that we just funded this quarter, and probably a couple more in the pipeline coming down.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then I guess, next question is for Mike, as people talked about the coastal issues, but you're talking about Amazon and Google growing in Seattle, Northern California, putting their money where their mouth is office space. I just, again, kind of maybe want to go back, I've looked at some subleasing data. It looks like the square footage available for sublease has gone from like 1.4% to 4% in Northern California. You look at companies like Facebook and Google who have talked about like around 50% of their workforce being remote during regional location. And then, Reddit said, they're not going to adjust compensation based on location, usually, these companies follow each other's moves. So, I guess, how do you think that the framework around the tech markets or at least in those areas in the West Coast isn't at least partially impaired, given those main driving forces from those large companies?
Michael Schall: Well I guess this is the moment that I would say, I'm glad I'm not an office company, because I agree with what you're saying. Definitely, there's plenty of lease space out there. Although, the vacancy rates that I have don't show huge increases this quarter versus last quarter, but obviously, these things take time to play out. And I guess I'd be cautious to say that, it seems like things are changing rapidly. And, but I still think that we should take some time to wait and see what happens, because, right now, on the work from home thing, again, as noted in the script, it's a pretty much a mandatory thing right now, as opposed to a life's choice that it will be sort of in a post COVID period. So, I think there's a lot of change just being forced upon us. Again, we believe in the hybrid model and we think that that's what will take place going forward. And in fact, we think we'll adopt that model as a company as well, because there are definitely some benefits to it. But at the same time, I'm hyper focused on the culture here and the vibrancy of the company as we all are, everyone in this room is. And, that is critically important to us. I just don't see how you maintain that via whist exclusively and work from home type of format. So, I don't know what's going to happen exactly with these things. But again, I think there's good reason and a lot of issues that need to be resolved on the work from home model, for it to be successful and no doubt there will be some bumps in the road. So, as long as those employees remain within the major metros, I think that we're in good shape. And, they may not we may not get the rent growth in San Francisco, but we will get it out into in the suburban markets. And we'll continue to do pretty well, I think.
Neil Malkin: I appreciate the feedback. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Calmes with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Calmes: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just kind of wrap my arms around going back to the public and private values. If we think about in your opening remarks, you said that there's a 5% to 10% discount in the pre-COVID pricing. But if I think about where volumes are today, there's a significant drop off from last year. So, if we were running at a hypothetical normal rate, would that imply a deeper discount if we were there right now?
Adam Berry: Hey, Alexander, this is Adam. So I think, to Mike's comment in the earlier script, the 5% to 10% discount that he was talking about was more urban core markets. We've actually seen valuations on suburban assets be at or above pre-COVID levels. You're right. And that volume has definitely been off of what it historically is. That being said, we're constantly in the market talking to potential buyers on potential dispositions. And there are enough out there that the market is being met, I'd say at that kind of at or above pre-COVID pricing. But just as an example, the deal we just sold in Glendale this week, that sold on pre-COVID pricing, or pre-COVID rents at about a 3A cap and that was about 4%, above our pre-COVID value. Cap on concessions and you're in the low-3s. So yeah, we're still pretty confident that the spread and what Mike mentioned that 5% to 10% discount on core markets, we think that still kind of flows through despite the lack of volume.
Alex Calmes: Got it. Would you call it even a scarcity premium on sort of those assets?
Adam Berry: There is definitely that potential. Yes.
Alex Calmes: Got it. Thank you. And just in some of the tax plans we're seeing in the Biden administration. If he were to win, he thinks about 10:31 exchanges and eliminating that. I just want to gauge just how big of a factor that would be in California transaction market? Are you - do you know what percentage that would be?
Michael Schall: This is Mike. It's hard to tell. I mean, this year given lower revenue, which is not a good thing, we have plenty of room in terms of taxable income to sell some properties and not have a REIT or dividend issue. So, but it will vary from year to year. And they're already given the Prop 13, they're already - it's already a headwind in selling some of our California properties as well. So, it's hard to tell. That's more of a hypothetical question that it depends on the circumstances and what we see going forward. So it's a difficult one to answer.
Alex Calmes: Okay, thank you for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Amanda Sweitzer: Great, thanks. Just a quick one from me here, have you seen a change in tenant credit quality as you've had more of those values to be [ph] intravenously including those super commuters you're referring to? And then, just for context in past downturn, do you see greater turnover among those value consumers when you do eventually look to raise rent?
John Burkart: Yeah. So as far as the tenant credit quality, no, we have not seen any decline there. It's a situation where if you have a job, you continue to maintain going forward, and then you're able to rent and if you don't, it's a terrible situation, but you're not going to become a new renter. So we haven't seen any declines there. As it relates to turnover, from that type of situation, yeah, the answer is, yeah, there are sometimes I can think of an almost a funny story where we had a resident that moved from one of our outer properties up in Seattle to downtown. They transferred within Essex. And then as the market picked up, this is after the last financial crisis, they moved back into the property that they had started with. And they're very nice person and they wanted to stay with Essex, is an Essex client. But they really did take advantage of the pricing changes. And, again, it's that value proposition that they were making personally between their commute in pricing and everything and making that decision. And that's what we do see goes on. Of course, that's the backdrop there was the rents in Seattle went up, because the economy was growing, demand was increasing because of jobs. And so, the fact that, that person moves out, it really going to impact the overall economic picture. It was a rent rising then.
Amanda Sweitzer: Make sense. Thanks.
John Burkart: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste: Yes, good morning out there.
John Burkart: Hey Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Good morning. First question for me and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you guys discuss what drove that $8 million increase in non-residential revenue from second quarters up to $19 million? And I guess I'm curious what was behind that as well. And if this builds level, we should be forecasting near term plan on it?
Angela Kleiman: Hey Haendel, it's Angela. Sure, I see a $19 million increase. I have on the property levels…
Haendel St. Juste: It's sequentially it's from $11 million to $19 million, this quarter, not $8 million.
Angela Kleiman: As in to 19, you know what I'll have to get back to you because when I look at our S2 from quarter to quarter, second quarter to third quarter, a growth from $5 million to $6.3 million. So, it's one that is being [indiscernible]
John Burkart: Where are you looking?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, where are you looking?
Haendel St. Juste: Looking on the - sorry one second, Page S8, I'm looking at the non-residential other line items in third quarter $19.8 million versus second quarter of $11.4 million.
Angela Kleiman: Okay.
Haendel St. Juste: Looking up bottom line, I was just curious if that was something you had readily available, but certainly can follow up if it's going to take a bit more digging? And then…
Angela Kleiman: No, it's - And that is straight line rent. I think that's where you're looking at line rent.
Haendel St. Juste: Non-residential other income $19.847 million. Right, so, doesn't really look like any other event. We'll do the follow up. Mike, maybe I guess following up on -
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, it's straight on rental and commercial - on commercial. I think that's what it is. But we'll follow up with you. But I think that's what that is.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, fair enough. A question then following up on Daniel's question about new markets, we've talked about this over the past few quarters, few years. I guess I'm curious, what are your peers mentioned Salt Lake City specifically? So, I'm curious to know how the market like that ranks on your hypothetical list and maybe you could, disposition proceeds because that's a use of the source of capital for entering new markets given what seems to be a hesitant here to for more stock buybacks?
Michael Schall: Yeah Haendel, it's a good question. Actually there's a bunch of cities that you can put in that category. They're smaller metros; Boise would be another good example. But there are others as well. I guess, from our perspective, we want to see enough liquidity in the market from an investment perspective, enough local buyers and sellers to create a pretty strong market. And that's one of the issues in each of those markets. The other issue is relatively inexpensive, single family homes. And I think everyone should be very careful with this, about this point in the cycle, because we're starting to see rapid increases in single family home prices. And as soon as you get to a level where, it's more attractive to buy a home than it is to rent an apartment, those markets tend to get hit pretty hard. So, this is why the supply constraints we measure very broadly to include how all types of housing and for sale as well as rental housing, because we've learned that lesson before. We were once upon a time in the city of Portland, another good example of this, although it's a bigger metro than Salt Lake City in Boise. But in the city of Portland, we made some investments based on an urban growth boundary that surrounded Portland that limited the amount of housing production. And we exited Portland actually, because they expanded their urban growth boundary to allow for the production of 10,000 single family homes that are relatively inexpensive price, which made our apartments much less attractive in the overall Housing Choice that were available to consumers. So, I hear that, we like those markets are growing very rapidly. There's definitely money to be made, but there's definitely a higher risk associated with them.
Haendel St. Juste: Yeah, thanks for that, Mike. And one final question not to split here, but I guess I'm curious on what you guys are seeing on the demand side for studio apartments? Can you just - given that they tend to be the younger or more nimble renters and as people have fled from the city, certainly in search for more space, curious to how the incremental demand or any pricing power emerging in that part of the portfolio? Thanks.
John Burkart: Well, I wouldn't use the word pricing power and attach that to studios. Basically what we see and we look slice and dice at numerous different ways, but as it relates to say, just unit type, clearly, the three bedrooms have higher demand than two bedrooms than one bedroom, than studio at the bottom. Generally, what we see within the marketplace is the studios now have lower occupancy. And again, this ties back to some of my comments were when we look and see where turnover was or where there's demand issues, this is connected in part to say studies, it's also connected to Silicon Valley consultants and those types of things. It also connects to the COVID preference where people want more space, and lower price per square foot. They want more private outdoor space, usually studios have limited private outdoor space. So, yeah there's no question that studios are impacted more than the other unit types, if that answers your question.
Haendel St. Juste: Certainly, but also curious, if there's been any incremental move certainly the idea that we're looking for some proven in the second group, it's curious when you start to see any at all on that more challenged piece of the portfolio?
John Burkart: Fair enough. We're doing a little bit better, but we're also doing everything we can to figure out the best way to market those units, whether they be as a second office, or whether it be in different discount prices. So, yes, there's a little bit more incremental demand. In context, I would say that it's a balanced picture, because we're working very aggressively to figure out how to market those. And what I would say is, the decline has stopped. There was a noted decline that occurred in the spring on studio, they occupancy. That stopped, it flattened out, and we're now improving a little bit. But again, I think there's other factors involved.
Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thank you, guys.
Operator: There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Very good. Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. Hopefully, we'll have a chance to meet with many of you at the upcoming day week in November. Stay safe out there. Thanks for joining us. Good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining our call today. The unprecedented reactions from the COVID-19 pandemic have presented many challenges that have affected every part of our business and indeed our lives. We'd like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19 and thank you for participating on the call today. On today's call, John Burkart and Angela Kleiman, will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Our reported results for Q2 reflect these unprecedented challenges as we reported 5.1% decline in core FFO from a year ago, representing an abrupt turnaround from very favorable conditions throughout this economic cycle. Our first priority upon receiving COVID-19 related shut down orders was to ensure the safety of our employees and residents, while reacting thoughtfully to shelter-in-place restrictions and regulatory hurdles that had been especially pervasive across our markets. Unprecedented job loss from mandatory shutdown orders in March suddenly insignificantly reduced rental demand, leading to lower occupancy in April, followed by a steady recovery throughout the quarter. Ultimately occupancy fully recovered and was 96.2% in July. Delinquencies also spiked due to job losses in anti-eviction ordinances, which often contain collection forbearance provisions. Proposed regulations that could further impede collection of COVID-19 related rent receivables led us to adopt a conservative approach to bad debt. During the second quarter, the direct cost of the pandemic in the form of greater residential and commercial delinquency, lost occupancy and COVID-19 related maintenance totaled $27 million. We view these costs is mostly temporary and have seen improvement in each category second quarter. John and Angela will provide additional detail as part of their remarks. Fortunately, the economy improved quickly from its April trough as measured by resumed job growth, lower continuing unemployment claims and fewer warn notices. In addition, many businesses have found ways to adapt to the virus by creating new safety protocols and procedures. After declining nearly 14% in the Essex markets during April, by June year-over-year your job declines had moderated by almost 400 basis points to 10.1%. We expect gradual improvement to continue in the second half of the year. Turning to the West Coast markets, technology companies are a primary driver of wealth creation and growth in the Bay Area in Seattle. Most of the leading tech companies remain in a growth mode with minimal damage to their business models and many of them such as Amazon, Netflix and Zoom have benefited from the shelter-in-place restrictions, resulting in greater market share. Generally, it appears that many large tech companies have slowed their pace of growth, while allowing greater flexibility for employees to work-from-home. We track the open positions at the 10 largest public technology companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market. Recently, these companies had approximately 17,000 job openings in California and Washington. These large company tech jobs are down by about a third on a year-over-year basis and are now at about the same level since we saw in 2017. Many of the top tech companies including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce are planning for employees to return to the office and have established related dates, which range from October 2022 to July 2021. This is consistent with our comments during our June NAREIT meetings, whereby we expect employees in the post-COVID era to have a greater work-from-home flexibility, while also needing to report to the office at various times to maintain team dynamics, acclimate new hires and pursue career opportunities, all of which require periodic face-to-face contact. Venture capital has continued to flow at a healthy pace according to the most recent data. However, we understand that the mix of investments is more focused on companies that have business models that are not directly impacted by COVID-19 and have lower cash burn rate. Southern California has a more diversified economy that has outperformed during previous recessionary periods. While San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties have generally continued this trend, Los Angeles County has notably underperformed. L.A.'s preliminary unemployment rate was 19.5% in June, well above the level implied by recent job losses of 12.3% on a trailing three months basis, and partially explained by the usually large number of gig and freelance workers in L.A. that are not captured by the BLS payroll survey. Filming and content production is the key contributor to jobs and wealth creation in Los Angeles, and the industry came to a temporary standstill. Film L.A. reported that the number of shoot days during the second quarter declined 98% from the prior year across television film and commercials. Despite these challenges, the demand for content is unabated amid the pandemic, and there are reasons to be optimistic. In a joint report called a Safeway Forward, various organizations including the screen actors guild have outlined the process for content production amid the pandemic, which is building production momentum. A key factor impacting all of our markets is the loss of leisure and hospitality and other services jobs, which represented from 12% to 17% of total jobs at June, 2019 in the Essex Metros. Compared to the total jobs lost in the Essex bucket this past year, these service jobs declined an average of about 30% year-over-year with the greatest declines in Seattle and San Francisco. These job losses are throughout each metro area, although the downtown locations had the greatest concentrations of affected businesses. We see the recovery path ahead as reversing the pandemic related declines we experienced this last quarter. In the near-term progress will depend on the direction of COVID infection rate and the associated governmental limitations on business activity. Given the COVID-related shutdown of film and digital content industries and its potential for value creation, its recovery is essential in Los Angeles. Fortunately, that recovery is underway with the recent restart in a production of daily TV shows such as Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune in Culver City and several soap operas produced by CBS and ABC. Necessarily crowded motion picture sets and safety mandates will probably make this a slow process. Wealthy areas create demand for restaurants, bars and other services and the related jobs contribute to housing demand, particularly in the cities. That makes service jobs systematically important to housing, and we believe that they will recover. Finally, mostly of the technology industries are in great condition and should be expected to resume greater hiring and growth. Along with unspent wealth accumulated during the pandemic, we expect the recovery of jobs to be strong as the outlook for managing the pandemic improves. In light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, the course of the pandemic and governmental responses have become intertwined with job growth and other economic outcomes. Thus, we've made the decision to withdraw our forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental until we have better clarity on the direction of the pandemic. Finally, turning to the apartment transaction market, we sold two properties during the quarter, both of which were placed under contract in May. Pricing for both represented a small discount compared to the pre-COVID period. Both properties were in downtown San Jose, continuing the theme of the past few years of selling downtown locations that are more susceptible to added supply and a diminishing quality of life. Going forward, we expect to grow the portfolio near major employment centers that offer a better living experience. Generally, the transaction market had been slow to recover with very few closed apartment sales and even fewer properties being marketed. The industry is working through key issues in the selling process, such as travel restrictions and due diligence challenges. Given a dearth of transactions, it's too early to conclude on how buyers will value apartment properties going forward. A few closed transactions since the onset of the pandemic traded at prices at or near pre-COVID levels, suggesting that, highly motivated buyers have taken a longer view when valuing property by treating the COVID-19 specific impacts such as delinquency as a purchase price adjustment, rather than long-term reductions in NOI or higher cap rate. At quarter end, we had two additional properties under contract for sale. Both are smaller properties and one of them closed in July. Going forward, our intent is to mostly fund our growth with disposition proceeds. We announced one new development deal in suburban San Diego and we have a robust preferred equity pipeline. As before, plenty of money is searching for distress real estate which will be scarce with institutional-grade apartments, given extraordinarily low financing costs. As with prior recessions, the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac virtually assures a source of liquidity for apartment. Yields or cap rates for apartments generally substantially exceed long-term interest rates and related debt and the resulting positive leverage remains a powerful force in the market. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don't change immediately in reaction to events, but rather seek to reflect the longer term financial performance of a property. At the end of the day, we believe that, the transaction markets will like to recover because lower interest rates will provide sufficient incentive to offset greater perceived risk. Historically, we found opportunities to add value as markets transition and in periods of disruption. I'm confident that, we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of our performance. And now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Our priority during this period was our people, the safety of our residents and our employees. I'm incredibly proud of what our team accomplished and how they worked together to serve and support our residents through this challenging time. Thank you, E team. Looking at the second quarter of 2020, the occupancy challenges that we faced early on related to a reduction in demand when the initial stay-at-home orders were implemented as opposed to an exodus of existing residents. During May, traffic increased substantially and we took advantage of the relative strength in our market by lowering our rental rates and offering significant leasing incentive in certain markets of two to eight weeks on stabilized properties, leading to an increase in our same-store occupancy of 110 basis points in June. The relative strength in the market continued into July, enabling us to increase our asking rent, decrease our leasing incentives and add another 80 basis points in occupancy. Our availability 30 days out as of the end of July was 10 basis points lower than where it was last year at this time. As our customers adapt to the new COVID-19 environment, we are seeing some consumer behavioral changes that make intuitive set. For example, with the current work-from-home practices, the value proposition of living in downtown San Francisco has temporarily changed since the restaurant, entertainment and sports venues have shut down. Additionally, the value of having more private indoor space presume calls, high speed internet and access to open space for outdoor activities have increased demand for suburban assets despite being a greater distance from corporate offices. We have also noted that work-from-home has turned into work-from-anywhere as we've seen several consultants moving back to their original home and continuing to work for their West Coast employer. Regarding the work-from-anywhere theme, we believe this trend will reverse when conditions permit. We were all positively surprised by the ease in which we all adapted to Zoom and believe that this experience will have a lasting impact on future same-day business travel. However, the loss of a personal connection frozen screens and barking dogs in the background, so the Zoom cannot replace the value that comes from in person interaction. If I heard someone say recently, I am done with living at work. We see the changes in consumer behavior within our portfolio, our same-store portfolio in Contra Costa, Ventura, Orange and San Diego at higher occupancies today than in pre-COVID March. Turning to our Q2 ’20 results as presented on page two of our press release, year-over-year, revenues declined by 3.8%. On delinquencies various governmental bodies have enacted and continually extend resident protection along with prohibitions against late fees and eviction. These regulations have been a strong headwind for the industry and our markets compared to other metros. Thankfully, they are temporary in nature. Referring to the S-15, delinquency for our total portfolio on a cash basis was 4.3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 34 basis points in the second quarter of 2019. In the month of July on a cash basis, delinquency was 2.7%, which is down from the prior month. In July, 18% of our same-store assets had positive delinquency. Meaning the delinquency line item contributed positively to the revenues due to residents paying past due amount. We appreciate that our residents continues to prioritize their rental obligation. Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment, our operations objective continues to be focused on maximizing revenue. Given current conditions, our strategies will evolve as the market changes and will vary across our market. For example, we will likely run lower occupancy in urban markets such as downtown San Francisco while targeting higher occupancies in highly desirable suburban markets, such as San Ramon. Overall, we believe that market occupancy has fallen about 150 basis points, and our same-store portfolio is expected to run at a lower occupancy for the remainder of the year. As noted on S-15 our supplemental and consistent with our expectations, our new lease rate, excluding leasing incentives, were down 5.8% in July compared to the prior year’s period. We expect that market rental rates will remain depressed in the fall due to the seasonal decline in demand. That said, some of the historical factors such as contractors moving home in the fourth quarter are not an issue since they've already moved out due the work-from-home policies in place. On to tech initiatives, we continue to make considerable progress on the technology front as our employees learn how to optimize our new tools. For example, we currently have several leasing agents that are leveraging these tools that enable them to be two to three times more productive than the average leasing agent. We are seeing similar progress with our maintenance systems as well. Our emphasis will continue to be on people first, if we try to bring everyone up to speed. However, we expect that through the increased productivity and natural attrition, we will both lower our headcount and increase our compensation to our top performers. Another advancement in our technology roadmap includes the development of our mobile leasing app that is on target for pilot at the end of this year. The app is fully integrated with our other sales tools and will fundamentally change how we interact with our prospects, providing them with a simple, seamless 24/7 mobile experience. Finally, we are now offering ultrafast internet offered by market leading fiber providers that 10% of our assets, and we expect to complete installation at another 50% of our assets by year end. The ultrafast service is in great demand in our current work-from-home environment and is expected to be a great value adds asset for our residents. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market year-over-year revenues in Q2 was down 20 basis points and occupancy was down 1%. The greatest decline during this period was in the Seattle CBD revenues declined to 70 basis points followed by the East side with a 20 basis point decline while revenues in the South saw an increase of 10 basis points in the same period. In July, unemployment in Washington remained 90 basis points below the U.S. average of 10.7%. In the same period, Amazon's job openings remained at just over 8,000 a year-over-year decrease of about 25%. Moving to Northern California and the Bay Area market, year-over-year revenues in Q2 were down 3.4%, revenues in San Francisco open CBD declined by 6.3% and 7.8% respectively although San Jose revenues declined only 1.5% in the same period. Tennessee job growth declined the least of our markets in Q2 and was a hundred basis points below the US decline of 11.3. In Southern California year-over-year revenues in the second quarter declined 5.7% well occupancy declined 2.1%. L.A. was our hardest hit market with a year-over-year revenue decline of 8.6% in Q2. Our L.A. County sub markets have declined between 8.4% and 9.7% in the same period with the greatest decline in L.A. CBD. The L.A. economy has been the most impacted out of all our markets with an unemployment rate of 19.5%, leading to a higher delinquency rate than our other markets. In Orange County, the South Orange submarket outperformed North Orange submarket with year-over-year revenue decline of 2.6% and 5.1% respectively in the second quarter. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year revenue declined 2% in Q2 with the exception of the Oceanside submarket, which grew revenues by 2% in the same period, likely benefiting from the military stay-in-place order through the end of June. Currently, our same-store portfolio’s physical occupancy is 96%. Our availability 30 days out is at 5.5% and our third quarter renewals are being sent out with an average reduction in rate of 1.4%. Thank you. And then, we'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll start with a few comments about the quarter followed by an update on our funding plan for investments and the balance sheet. As noted in our earnings release in earlier comments, this will be a challenging quarter with declines in both same property revenue growth and core FFO per share. The 3.8% decline in same property revenue growth is primarily driven by two key factors. First, we took a conservative approach and reserved against, approximately 75% of our delinquencies, which negatively impacted our same property revenue growth by 2.9%. This information is available in a new table at the bottom of Page 2 of our press release, along with other additional details. Second, we report concessions on the cash basis in our same property results, which reduced our growth rate by approximately 1% compared to using the straight line method. The combine negative impact to same property revenue growth from both of these accounting treatments is 3.9%. As for our core FFO per share growth, the total negative impact of delinquencies in the second quarter is 20%, without this, our core FFO per share growth would have been positive 1.5%. More details are available in a new reconciliation table on Page S-15 of the supplemental, along with additional disclosures on operations. On to operating expenses, same-store expenses increased by 6%, primarily driven by Washington property taxes, which have increased approximately 15% compared to the prior year. As you may recall, taxes in Seattle decreased by 5% in 2019, resulting in a difficult year-over-year comparison, our controllable expenses have remained generally in line with plan for the rest of the year. Turning to funding plan for investments and the stock buybacks, we are expecting to spend approximately 205 million in 2020 between our development pipeline and structural finance commitments. In addition, we have bought back 223 million of stock year-to-date, bringing total funding needs to 428 million. As for funding sources, we expect 150 million of structured finance redemptions and we closed on the sale of three assets for 284 million. In total, we have 434 million of funds available which covers all new funding obligations this year on a leverage-neutral basis. Moving onto capital markets, the finance team was very productive in the second quarter, securing a $200 million term loan, which was used to pay down all remaining 2020 debt maturities. In June, we opportunistically issued 150 million in bonds, achieving a 2.09% effective rate for 12-year CAGR and use the proceeds to pay down our line of credit. Lastly on the balance sheet, our reported net to EBITDA was 6.4 times, an increase from prior quarter primarily related to how we account for delinquency reserve. Adjusting for the impact of delinquencies, our net debt to EBITDA would have been six times. With nothing drawn on our line of credit, an approximately 1.4 billion in total liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to maintain our discipline approach to capital allocation. Thank you and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Spector: Just looking at some of my notes from the remarks between Mike and John, on your thoughts on periodic contact at the office, first work-from-home and some of the initiatives that John laid out, I guess, just big picture. Can you clarify at least today, how you think your portfolio is positioned for what you think may be? I'm sorry I was a little confused between the different comments.
John Burkart: Yes, why don't I go ahead and start with that. This is John. I think we're actually positioned very well and what we're seeing is, people wanting to different value propositions. So, they're looking for our assets of which we have many that have a little bit lower price point or dollars per square foot, a little bit more space. They're in great locations as it relates to outdoor recreational opportunities, and then of course, access to high-speed and going forward gig speed Internet. So I think we're positioned very well for that. What we're seeing is, at this point in time, many of the tech companies have decided that they're going to defer occupying the buildings, a range of dates really starting from October through one of them throughout July of 2021. But in no cases, do we see that becoming permanent. And then again, it gets back to this reality of people are now realizing that as much as we all kind of suck it up and we’re impressed with Zoom and really worked hard to make things work, which is fantastic, something is being lost. And with the competitive juices flowing, we strongly believe, the companies will want to bring people back together and they see the value like they've always saw the value in having that. And there's also another piece to it, which is, I can speak anecdotally. I was talking to someone over the weekend and they mentioned the idea of moving in the extended commute zone and their employers said, that's fine, buy you're going to get a 20% to 25% pay cut, obviously completely negating their perceived value of a lower real estate prices. So, no doubt, they're not moving and we think we're positioned very well for the long run with our portfolio. Does that answer it? Mike, do you have there?
Michael Schall: Yes, Jeff. Let me just add a little bit more kind of America point of view, because I totally agree with what John says. And I think that, things are in ultimately pretty good order considering the fact that we've had a 10% loss of jobs in June. So, that's an extraordinary number of jobs being lost and more than the financial crisis. And as a result, that's going to impact our performance and our economy. And there are a couple of pieces that are just so fundamental and these are the things I tried to bring out in my script. Basically, tourism is shut down and obviously the West Coast tourism is a pretty big deal. A lot of people like to go to San Francisco and to the various L.A. places. But with restaurants and bars shut down, those services are not available and you probably can't get there. It is difficult to get there given all the various shutdown orders, et cetera. And the other kind of key parts to our economy are certainly the film and content production in L.A., which we'd realize exactly how big a problem that was with respect to your COVID-19 and prevention of COVID-19, and producing content. And then finally, the tech flow down that I commented on in my scripts. So, all these things are actually things that are demanded in the marketplace and they will recover. And yes, it'll take time and we're certainly disappointed about the second wave and the renewed shutdown orders. In many cases, restaurants and bars were open for a couple of days and then shut down again in California. And so this has been incredibly disruptive in California and has made it difficult to get traction on things that really matter. Generally speaking, we have areas with pretty substantial amounts of wealth. Wealthy people like to consume services and including restaurants and bars, also people that have a choice between living in the hinterlands where you can make $15 an hour versus working in the city in a restaurant job restaurant type job, making $50 an hour. That's why they're, that's why people go to city. So basically, most of these relationships and activities have been shut down, again on a temporary basis, and I think California has been incredibly, let's say, vigilant with respect to these shutdown orders. They've been very extensive throughout the market places and continue to have an impact. So, with the easing of that and with better COVID news, I think you're going to see things open up relatively quickly.
Operator: Our next question, it comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Bilerman: It’s Michael Bilerman here with Nick and Mike. In the press release, you talked about Cares fund that Essex started with donations from executive officers, and it says, you intend to distribute up to 3 million of that 3 million was it all donations? And do you expect to use corporate cash as part of it? Or is it all led by executives?
Michael Schall: No, Michael, it's a combination of both. And we set up at the beginning of the crisis, we set up a resident response team and they found extraordinary needs out there. And including people for example that didn't have money for food and other essential needs. So, we – actually, the executive group in that case essentially donated some money to provide meals for people. And then we realized that even more broadly, we have other needs because there are people that have lost their jobs and don't have great prospects for getting another job. And so, we wanted to have an entity that would provide relocation money and similar types of services. And so we decided to set up the Essex Cares entity in order to do that. So in that situation where it's not doing them any good, they need to move on in their life and find something. If we can provide those relocation benefits, it's good for them. It gets them into a better place. And, in our case, we have -- and I mentioned ordinances so we can evict them anyway. So, it's probably better for everybody. So, I think that this is a good example of finding sort of the common good as it relates to the current situation and providing an opportunity to let people move to pursue their life and better their life.
Michael Bilerman: Right. So -- and then -- so how much of that $3 million was corporate cash? How much was donations? And how much capital do you foresee Essex contributing going forward to these initiatives?
Michael Schall: Well, I don't think we've decided exactly. I think the portion that came from the employee pool is somewhere around $500,000 and the rest came from FX, but that's not a not a perfect number, but a rough number, that's what we did.
Michael Bilerman: And then, the 2.5 is prospective? Or was there an expense in the quarter for the corporate cash then?
John Burkart: Michael, let me address that. So, there were expenses during the quarter, but we set the entity up toward the end of the quarter. So, what happened during the quarter was already expanded. And essentially, we created the entity in response to the needs that were out there and what we were seeing on the ground when we're dealing with the people. Our resident response team consists of some 50 to 60 Essex employees, and they're talking to our residents, couple times typically. And again, they're trying to -- we came up with a basket of needs and people that were really in difficult situations. And so, this is intended to respond to those needs on more of a prospective basis.
Michael Bilerman: Okay, this last one on the topic. Is the 2.5 million that's going to be Essex corporate cash? How are you going to treat that? Are you going to treat that as a cost of revenue? Are you even included in same-store? Or are you going to treat it completely separate from the financials?
Michael Schall: Well, I’ll let my financial guru talk that. Angela?
Angela Kleiman: Michael, that’s a good question. I think it depends on what it's being used for. So, for example, if it's for groceries or to relocate our tenants, it'll be a G&A item. But if it's for something that’s revenue related, impacting, say, delinquencies, it would be a contra revenue items. And so, at this point, it’s too early to see where that geography lands. But the intention is really more of a G&A item, and we'll see what that means anything.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. I apologize if my phone dies in the middle of this call. We're in the midst of getting a pretty bad storm. I think a lot of people on the phone might be as well. So, I want to come back and talk about a topic that you've spent some time on the past, which is valuing occupancy versus rent growth. And if I'm looking at sort of your metrics, I think you're at 94.9 in 2Q, you've gone up to 95.8 as of July. But new renewal spreads are obviously negative and maybe even a little bit lower than where they were in the quarter. So, I'm just wondering, if you can give us an update about how you're thinking about occupancy versus rent growth at this point? And when you think that you might be in a position to push occupancy and renewal and new leases be less bad than they are right now?
John Burkart: Well, this is John. That's a great question. Well, again, as Mike had mentioned, we started in a hole in April really related to the shelter-in-place and just the demand stopped for a period of time. So, as we moved in as traffic increase pretty dramatically in May and then we took advantage of that decided to fill up the portfolio, and big picture there's a thing that we like, which is, let's not be proud and vacant. And vacant unit really obviously earned nothing, so we made the decision to get aggressive and offer some leasing discount or leasing incentives to enable us to gain occupancy and we ultimately gained about 200 basis points of occupancy between June and July, and that's positioned as well. We subsequently pulled back on concession and we're still offering them in certainly market-by-market, it depends. But taking some of our markets suburban markets like the San Diego, Orange County, Ventura, Contra Costa, in many of those cases, we've pulled back quite a bit on concession and those occupancies are riding higher. And in actuality, they're actually higher, as I mentioned in my remarks than they were in March. So, we look at it and say, the best thing is to position ourselves so that we're leading the market and not allow ourselves to be sitting vacant. And so, that's why we took that action. Right now, we're in a pretty good spot and we're just watching the market on literally a daily basis, understanding what's going on. There are some areas that are more distressed. Certainly, San Francisco, we only have less than a thousand units there, but San Francisco is definitely under stress. And I'll also know San Francisco about 30% of our units are so our studios and studios are clearly a challenged unit type in this market. The process has moved out so that's also putting a little bit of excessive pressure on the San Francisco market in our numbers. Does that answer your question?
Rich Hill: Yes. Yes, it does. And I wanted to maybe just come back to that a little bit more and think about the impact of concessions, and you might've talked about this a little bit earlier on. But if I'm thinking about this correctly, new leases were an average -- new leases saw an average of one to two months of concessions. So, I'm just trying to think about how we're supposed to think about the net effective rents. Can you just walk us through the effective portion of it? Because it seems like, it could be down a lot more than what the headline suggests. So, I want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.
John Burkart: Yes. So concession, I mean, think of it in this particular market, I would think of it very similar to a development of lease up, where you offer concessions to incent someone to move. And obviously, there's certain real cost of moving and then there's just the pure motivation of moving. And so, when we desire to fill up our portfolio, we offered concessions. It's not really reflective on necessarily market rents are lower. Doing often the concessions enabled us to gain a significant amount of occupancy. So, I would look at it that way. I don't want to answer around though. There are clear to concessions in the marketplace. We were more aggressive because we wanted to fill up our portfolio and we've now backed away quite a bit from that. Our average confessions, I know in the supplemental, you're looking at saying four to eight weeks and that was pretty common. But the average concession during June was closer to 4% or four weeks for a little bit less than that that we used to, which enable us to fill out. So, there was a range. We clearly got assets and then serial concessions and some that were at eight weeks and sort of tendency a footnote in the financials.
Rich Hill: Got it. Got it. And so, just to be clear, and I'm sorry for belaboring this point. But it's hard to compare across names and that's what I'm trying to understand at this point.
John Burkart: Yes.
Rich Hill: The new and renewals are headline without the concession, right?
John Burkart: That is correct. And I'll ask you to throw in one more comment on the renewals to get a little clarity. The renewals go out typically 60 days plus into the marketplace, both we're trying to give our customers time to make a decision. And then, there's certain laws that prevent us from sending them out, say less than 30 days. And so, what can happen is the market can move between the time you send the renewal out, which is what happened in the second quarter and when it actually becomes effective. So, we would have had renewals that were effective in June that may have been signed in March, if that makes sense, always get a leg of the market rent, which are happening at that point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks guys. And just building a little bit, maybe even more, you know, John it sound like you said that into July incentives have been proved even more. So, I mean, relative to that four weeks or last in June, have you virtually eliminated concessions at this point across most of your markets given where occupancy is today? Or is it the two weeks? Can you give us, help us quantify that? And then what the impact is from an effective rent perspective?
Michael Schall: Sure. So, it moves around daily literally, but I can tell you that for a period of time, we completely eliminated them out of San Diego, Orange, Ventura and parts of a Contra Costa. Subsequently, we've moved back in week to two weeks here and there, other markets, and it's certainly Seattle falls in that bucket as well. Other markets like San Francisco, we continue to offer concessions somewhere in the range of four to eight weeks. it depends And San Mateo, pretty high with concessions and a similar number of weeks. And Silicon Valley is a mixed bag, but there are concessions in Silicon Valley, especially near the least ups. There is both Downtown Oakland and Silicon Valley and then some in San Francisco, where there's lease up that obviously is a concessionary market. But we are pulling them back and we're going back and forth. And part of it is, we run the Company as a portfolio and not asset by assets. So where we see opportunity where the markets are stronger, like Orange County and San Diego, Ventura, we're going to allow that to increase the occupancy increased a little bit more and offset some of the areas that are a little bit weaker like San Francisco.
Austin Wurschmidt: No, that's helpful. And then how frequently are you using concessions on renewal leases to retain tenants? And could you quantify what that net effect of spread is in July versus last year?
John Burkart: Yes, so with renewals much less, it's probably about 10% of what we're doing with the new leases and the renewals go out without any concessions. They can get negotiated in depending upon the situation. But our renewals, really, I expected the renewable going forward. That'll really dry up because the market is changing right now. And so, where we were in June and what we negotiated in June, we negotiated less in July and probably less again in August. So, maybe a week or something or less than that, I mean, because again, most of them don't even have concessions for the renewals. So we’re not really trying to extend some of the move that's where we’re trying to intent some of the move that’s because they come into play because it really is a matter of they have moving costs. And so there's kind of this exchange that goes on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: A few questions here, John in hearing your response to everyone's questions, it sounds like things improved in July. And then since then they have improved. So, where I think Mike who talked about or you talking about rent pressure in the back half. It sounds like that's more like you're not pushing rents positively, but you're seeing good demand. Most of your markets, we're seeing occupancy and that you're really not concerned about the back half for a repeat of the softening that occurred in early in 2Q. Is that a fair assessment?
John Burkart: I'll start. I'm sure Mike might have some comments. But there's a lot of risk factors out there, Alex. So certainly factually, today, the market is better today than it was yesterday, the day before, et cetera. And this is all a good thing. And we feel good about that our portfolio is positioned very well, all things considered. But there's obviously things that are happening, related to COVID that throw risk factors. There is some unusual, there are some positives, as I mentioned earlier consultants, they usually move out in the fourth quarter, well, that's not going to happen because they already moved out. We didn't have insurance come in, and therefore they won't move out. So, those are positives that may enable us to have a longer leasing period. And then, there's some interesting things going around some of the colleges, for example, many of them are doing partially online. And that requires you to be very tethered to the university because you may be online for a class and then a half an hour later, you have a lab on site, but you still need to live right at that university and they cut down the occupancy. My family just went through this and my daughter got bumped out of her spot. So, she's now an apartment. And so, there's things like that that are positive, but there's obviously risk factors out there. And I'll flip it over the Mike if you have more to add there.
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex suddenly, I try to tie this in, pretty specifically back to what's going on, on the job front. And, John, so John mentioned, the things you've done better and probably didn't draw enough attention to this. But in my script, I said, year-over-year job growth declines have moderated almost 400 basis points to 10.1%. So, from my perspective, things are really horrible in April. We fell off a cliff in terms of occupancy, and a variety of other things. We had an additional challenge in that we had all of these anti-eviction ordinances. And if someone wanted out of their lease, given the backdrop of having an anti-eviction ordinance, we were actually, I would say, motivated to let them out of their lease probably to a greater extent than many other places would be. And then, so, we did so that accounted for sort of the occupancy drop, and then you things got better. And again, job declines, moderated 400 basis points and the results got better. And so I would, that's kind of the point of my script is to say, we need things to continue to get better. And that's going to be intertwined with the COVID-19 experience going forward. And we remain hopeful that it's certainly -- we certainly believe is going the right direction. We certainly believe that mankind and potentially a vaccine or therapeutics or whatever, it is going to continue to moderate the picture. But we did positive developments, certainly, as it relates to the shutdown orders. And once again, it looks like we're hitting a new peak on this second surge. And so, maybe we can open the restaurants again and we can do some other things. I was talking to some people recently about restaurants in Palo Alto, and they're shutting down, partially shutting down the streets, so they can move more and the tables out on the streets and then have a traditional restaurant experience outdoors, that won't work in the winter, but in the summer that'll be great. So, there is incremental improvement for sure, and just good thoughtful people can overcome a lot of these challenges. So, I would expect certainly the progress to be ongoing. But whether we can take a big step forward or when we take the big step forward, we're still unclear as to when that might be. Hopefully that makes sense. So, we're making progress. We want it to be faster. It's a little too slow, but it seems to be going in the right direction.
Alexander Goldfarb: Right, But I guess to the point Mike, you guys – obviously, none of us can predict the future, but from what your properties and your reasons are telling you today, you felt comfortable, as you guys said pulling back discussion. You've seen an uptick in occupancy, and I think with the exception of like the Downtown L.A. or downtown San Francisco, it sounds like most of your markets have been responding well to the actions that you guys have taken. You didn't identify maybe I missed, but it did sound like you identified markets are still weakening and getting worse and getting softer yet, correct?
Michael Schall: Yes. I mean, that's a fair statement Alex. So, San Francisco is still challenged. We're trying to figure that one out, but it's a very small part of our portfolio. But the other markets clearly responded to pricing and we've said this back that we saw traffic increased pretty dramatically and that's when we made the decision to get aggressive and lease up the portfolio. So, yes, our pricing was intended to increase occupancy. It worked very well. We've pulled back from that. We're maintaining occupancy, it's still, we're working very hard. We're watching things daily, but we're, we're not seeing things fall backwards in your words. San Francisco again is a little challenged, pretty challenged.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just the second question, on the delinquency, it sounds like you guys let people leave move, the ability to do so or whatever unlike New York. So, you guys let people leave. Their rent, the delinquency came down. The people who are in there do you expect the people to be money good or these are sort of the freeloaders that are just hanging out for free rent and they're never going to pay. They're never going to leave the unit.
Michael Schall: There's going to be, I mean, there's no doubt, there is going to be a mixed bag of people. But like I said in my remarks, we had 18%, around one out of five assets where we had positive delinquency, meaning it contributed to revenues because people that owed us were paying back payments. So, there's a lot of hard work and people out there, we continually see these headlines, people struggling to get the unemployment payments. So, my sense is as the money is coming through, many of them are trying to make a good effort to pay us. In the end, there will some that take advantage of us. There always are. But, I don't think that's the majority. But how it worked out, certainly as this thing drags on, it becomes harder to tag, and so we're cautious on how this whole thing plays out as it relates to collections and delinquency.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hightower: I hope everybody is well. Just to maybe steer the conversation in a different direction here. Mike, what's your updated take on the policy risk landscape Essex? And certainly, we could be having a very different conversation 90 days from now the next time your reports. So just where do we stand on different bills and Prop 21 and so forth?
Michael Schall: Yes, there's definitely a lot to talk about. So, Rich, if I miss them, you can just follow up and ask again. But obviously, the biggest one that we're most focused on is Prop 21 here in California, which would amend a law that was passed in the mid nineties to promote housing construction called Costa Hawkins. And, so it would severely change that law and bring back potentially forms of rent control that really don't work that really discourage housing production in all the cities that they adopted. And, it's interesting that we already have statewide rent control with respect to AB 1482, which passed last year, along with about 18 other bills that were intended to try to jumpstart and to increase the amount of housing that was available in California. But in fact, in the case of AB 1482, the apartment industry did not oppose that bill because we thought it was a reasonable finding the middle ground of the need for more housing and the need to protect tennis. So, we thought that the legislature did a very good job of that. But Prop 21 is brought by someone that is not involved in the housing industry. It's a special interest group. And so, they are continuing that campaign. In our case, we decided to keep our entity that we used to by Prop 10 in 2018 alive, and essentially the same group of people lead that entity and are the opposition team on with respect to Prop 21. And they've made a lot of progress. Polling continues to be fairly similar to what it was and as it relates to Prop 10 at this time, maybe a little bit better than that because AB 1482 was passed. The politics I think are somewhat different in that we already have statewide rent control. So why do we need this other rent control proposal? And the campaign is proceeding well, there are something like or somewhere over a hundred organizations and you can see them all representing seniors, labor, community groups, et cetera that have joined Essex in opposing Prop 21. And there is a website if anyone's interested, which is noonprop21.boat. And I go to that website and see it. So, we're optimistic about it. We're fully a hundred percent support of it and we’re raising money and we’re preparing for the final showdown. So that is the story on Prop 21. Rich, maybe before I go on, do you have any follow ups on Prop 21?
Rich Hightower: Yes, that was a great summary Mike. You mentioned that polling Prop 10 maybe a little bit of things back. And is there anything other than the obvious, the COVID environment, that’s driving that or are there any takeaways from that element specifically.
Michael Schall: Well, it's difficult to see exactly how COVID is going to play out as it relates to that. Obviously, rents are declined and certainly since AB 1482 was passed, rents have declined. So, why not give 1482 a chance to work because it seems to be working. And again, what is the need for another ballot proposition that effectively attacks the same issue that the legislature has already acted upon. And I think that that issue actually helps us because, again, we have a legislative solution. So, why do we need to go to the ballot box? Certainly with respect to the sponsor that has very little to do with housing, and, and fight that battle. So, but that's where we are. And, we'll we will see, I mean, there'll be more coming out on Prop 21 in the coming weeks, so happy to discuss, if you want to call separately or whatever. And then, I guess I would also mentioned the porphyry of anti eviction ordinances, which are incredibly difficult and you're like, John, I give great credit to the ethics team because sorting through city, county state, and even, federal laws with respect to and I think ordinances and all the different things that are that are out there, there's a tremendous amount going on. They are constantly changing all of these various eviction ordinances being extended different terms. I think that there will likely be some legal action on some of them because they're pushing the envelope with respect to I think, what would normally seem to be appropriate in the circumstances. And I throw out as an example that San Francisco permanently banning landlords from eviction. This is at any time in the future for COVID-19 delinquencies. So, I mean, we definitely have an uphill struggle with respect to collections. And to the extent, it almost appears that if you never have to -- if you never have to have accountability for your delinquency, then it almost seems like and we can't -- there's no late fees, there's no interest charges, you almost make create a scenario where there's no incentive to pay the landlord. So, this is the dilemma because we're not in many cases allowed to ask for documentation of a COVID-19 hardship and normal things that one would expect. So, this continues to be an ongoing dilemma.
Rich Hightower: Okay, appreciate the call. And I guess one follow up, if I may, the incentive being a landlord and somebody might also be called into question longer term. I mean, what's your sense of risk to the portfolio from a capital allocation standpoint? And obviously, it's nothing you can turn on a dime or do quickly. But how do you think about diversification sort of beyond your current core markets in that sense?
Michael Schall: Yes, we're here for very specific reasons. So, we -- I think we're actually pretty diversified as it relates to the major metros on the west coast, which, again, it's a big part of the globe, global economies while I think California and Washington or something like a fifth largest economy in the world. So, we're not talking about a small area and what we've done is tried to diversify with respect to product and in many, many cities up and down the West Coast. So, I think we're actually more diverse than that might seem. And having said that, why are we here? We're here because supply and demand for housing is very attractive and rents grow better over time. And so, if there were other places that had similar long term rent growth as the West Coast, we would likely be there. But that doesn't exist. And so, we're trying to maximize the growth of the portfolio over time and do it in a thoughtful way and certainly a risk adverse way, and diversify the portfolio within the West Coast, which again, it's a very large area. And so, we will look at and we constantly look at other geographies and other opportunities and we'll continue to do that. We certainly do that once a year in our strategic planning session with the Board, which comes up here in September. And so, we'll continue to do that and maybe this will change it a little bit, but I would say, the anecdote to maybe a little bit less diversity is a very strong balance sheet. So, you have to withstand the periods of time when there is more volatility and we've done that. And as a result, we believe that, we have kind of the best of both worlds. We have a very strong balance sheet that can withstand significant shocks and on the other hand have among the highest long-term growth rates and rents.
Rich Hightower: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Anderson: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Maybe there should be a new proposition to cap rent decline -- 
Michael Schall: Hey, Rich. We'll vote for you for governor.
Rich Anderson: So, I'd like to get back to the concentration, West Coast concentration here. Point Mike a get it the big economies, big area of the country, but still a lot of common knitting in the state of California, that's sort of a singular problem. One thing I've noticed about you guys over the years is, things have a tendency to change over a shorter period of time than your peers. I remember back that supply issue on quarter, you were kind of having trouble pinpoint at the next quarter things certainly were much better. And I have that a little bit wrong, but I know I'm close. And saying that things change in perhaps maybe in months for us that might be measured in quarters for your peers. And I'm wondering third quarter had a very different flavor, is there a real chance that we could have a conversation three months from now that could vastly actually different than the tone of the press release that you release last night?
Michael Schall: It looks like it's starting to abate finally, but I think it might be a little bit longer term than that. Having said that, we fell off the cliff in terms of occupancy in April and again, because of these anti eviction ordinances, we were probably more aggressive at letting people move on with their life if they lost their job and needed more affordable housing than some of the others. And that caused vacancy to decline more. And, but it also set us up to find a tenant that can be a good long-term tenant. And so there were some definite trade-offs during the quarter, and then playing catch up with respect to using concessions to build occupancy as John alluded to definitely cost us something. And again, as in July, we're in a much better position and we don't have that. We don't have that overhang that we have to deal with.  So I would say that's incrementally better, certainly unemployment going from improving by 400 basis points. That's going to help us in the quarter. So there is good news out there and but as I tried to allude to in my comments, we need the film production business to come back. That looks like a choppy road. And even restaurants, all the service jobs and restaurants and bars, et cetera, that looks like a somewhat choppy roads. So cautiously optimistic and we'll see, but I do think the next quarter will be better than the last that's for sure. 
Rich Anderson: And then the concentration question, and you mentioned this you're always going to look at some other markets, and I don't remember when it was probably 15 years ago when you were looking at Baltimore and country, is your radar that far away or is it more closer in to the West coast area, perhaps at Denver or something like that? 
Michael Schall: Yeah, it's a little above. I mean, what we try to do is look at other major metros, similar to the West coast, there's some element of supply constraints. We look at the stability of the economy and the federal government in Washington DC is pretty darn stable employer of people. And so it tends to do better when things are or not ongoing, well, although it also can produce a fair amount of apartment supply at the same time, so that comes back and hurt it. But, we look at things much like trying to find markets that are like the West coast, which are very difficult to find. And then we also consider blurring the line. So at what point in time might we go to some of the other markets that are near our existing markets, but just a step further out.  We own an asset in Santa Cruz. We've owned assets in Tracy and the inland empire. And, I'd say, you know, our experience there is, those are very much timing markets. And so, is there a possibility of example, setting up a coinvestment type entity, which inherently will have an exit for a period of time and then exit and do more a timing type trading is something that we also consider and so I'm not sure what we're going to do. I do know that, from feedback from our board that they are going to want to take a harder look at this issue. So we'll be having more robust conversations about it. 
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Security. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Malkin: So, maybe talking about the development side, or the external side, started a JV development, just curious how that side of the business is going and the appetite level, hearing this only kind of distress in the market, and not really on the acquisition side, but more on the development land, pre purchase. Those types of things. Can you just talked about, what you see there? Have you gotten more inbound calls and how do you see, maybe the next, six to nine months shaping out on that side of the ledger.
Adam Berry: All right, well, this is Adam. So, I can cover this and Mike feel free to hop-in. So, as far as the stress goes on the land side of things, landowners are incredibly stubborn when it comes to decreasing their expectations on land values. So, yes, lots of inbound calls. But very few yields that seem to be getting a dry now. We haven't seen much if any decrease in construction costs so that coupled with some challenging a challenging rental environment, there's very little that we see right now that would pencil. We continue to be aggressive on the on the private equity side, because there are there are a number of legacy deals that that are out there searching for funding and construction lending standards have gotten somewhat higher and we've gotten more conservative with our with our prep underwriting. But even still, there's still a relatively high demand for that though. Like I said, we continue to have a robust pipelines. And that's probably where the, the main focus is going to be for the immediate future.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. Other one for me kind of been talked about, it seems like on each call, to talk about regulation and things like that continued to get, I don't know, worse and worse extreme. Can you just maybe talk about a couple of things in particular, AD1436, which I think is the statewide codified in the statewide 60 moratorium, either the sooner of the end of state of emergency plus 90-days or April 2021. Just maybe what's going on there. And then, the other thing I guess part D would be you look at like proper trash in Seattle. You look at a lot of these things are deep on the belief, a lot of a lot of issues that, although you are diversified as you say they're very much a function of the California and Washington I'll say, mentality type. So, I'm just wondering how you navigate through that process or approach these, these things that seem to kind of come out at you on a more frequent basis?
Michael Schall: Yes, it is a great question. And I will say that we are surprised at the incredible, both number of eviction related and tenant protection related bills that come out of this. And it certainly in the short-term, we had our own our own self imposed limitations for 90-days on evictions and rent increases and a variety of other things. So I think that is something that is just appropriate and proper in dealing with this -- with the pandemic. But there's a point at which, and I would guess it will getting near that point that, things go too far. And so what we try to do is both certainly comply and understand all the existing ordinances that are out there. And again, they're at all different levels of government and they constantly change. And at the same time, try to advocate in our discussions with CAA and others like for example, if a resident, if this goes on for some prolonged period of time, if a resident was a certain amount of funds, shouldn't, they have some affirmative responsibility to prove their COVID-19 affect or impact or something like that.  And work with their tenant. There is a steer out there that, there's going to be widespread evictions, you're following this situation. And I look at it and we're realistic people, we have no interest in that, just mass evictions at all. In fact, we're better off working together, but it needs to be on several level playing field. We need them to essentially prove their or acknowledge their COVID-19 issue. And then we can react and try to do what is thoughtful for both of us. So the laws as they're currently constructed don't do that exactly. So there's a bunch of laws out there as you point out that prolong the eviction process and not just limited to the one you mentioned, but just on an ongoing basis.  And it still remains to be seen what happens with those laws. I mentioned, in San Francisco, the inability to evict anyone at any time indefinitely for COVID-19 delinquencies. And I'm not sure exactly how we get paid back on those particular delinquencies. So this has been a, an ongoing issue and certainly it's disappointing from our perspective, then that we have no ability to control our destiny. And it seems like people have the ability to essentially do things they shouldn't be allowed to do. So I'll leave it at that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Calmes with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Calmes: Just looking at another discrepancy between pockets, or would it make sense for the match funds your positions? Or are you looking to get a little more progressive on --?
Michael Schall: Yes, Angela in her remarks talked about mass funding, firstly, everything that we do going forward. So that definitely is the plan and not just buy a stock, buy back preferred equity and others. So Angela outlined the her sources and uses for the rest of the year. So I think we're good -- I think we're on the same page with respect to how we're going to do that. Maintain a very strong balance sheet.
Alex Calmes: So looking at rent collecting month over month, what is usual for patched up in the following marker for doing thing.
Michael Schall: A little bit hard to hear your question. So I'll repeat it. So I get it right. You're asking what the usual cadence for rent collection is if someone's delinquent, I think, and you were just in a different time. Because normally if someone's delinquent, we're going to obviously communicate with them either come up with an agreement with them, which case we're pretty reasonable. If they over the month rent, we're going to let them have a prepayment plan that's going to work over a reasonable amount of time. If they don't want to communicate, we're going to give him a three day notice and start a process and work through that.  So normally that's how it would go where it is today. Some of those options are not available. The communication is, and again, I'm very pleased to see that without any current hammers, we're seeing people step up and make payments on what they owe. Some people wanting to enter payment plans, others not they're concerned about whether they'd be able to keep those, but they're still paying more than their rent. And so we're seeing good behavior out of people in general. Hopefully that answers your question. 
Alex Calmes: I’m looking more for, percentage pass that you’re collecting 94% April rent at the end of April, and enter contract with you in May. Is there basis point catch up that you have been seeing? Or has it been mostly negotiated.
Angela Kleiman: Hi, this is Angela here. If you’re looking at the amount of revenue that is not reserved, we are essentially at over a 100% collected for same store, which means some of that of course goes towards delinquency. But keep in mind this is only July, one month. And so to John's point, we are seeing good behavior and most people are trying to be responsible, but it just too early to be okay what does that trend mean given this is July numbers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski : Just one follow up for me. John can you help me just understand whether your comment where elevating concessions aren't indicative of where market rents are. Because in certain markets, it feels like every, a lot of big private and public developers are four to eight weeks free. So it feels like the market clearing price of rents transcend demands, market rents across your portfolio. If all your competitors are four to eight weeks free, is is down in the neighborhood of 15%. Could you just elaborate on that? 
John Burkart: I'm glad to, first I have to give you guys some credit, you've done a nice job trying to track things. So I appreciate that it's out there, but I would say what we're picking up and what ethics does is got of frustration out of not having a great market data, because some of the vendors aren't doing a great job. We created our own proprietary database. So we've got over a thousand assets and we're tracking. And then what we find is different days, different competitors are offering concessions. They're doing it in different units. And so there are commonly assets there that are offering maybe four day a week. But that doesn't mean that those are the only units that are renting. And what we saw back in June was many of the bigger owners were trying to gain occupancy. Increased absorption, just like a very large development lease, ultimately, are multiple leases competing against each other, that works for us and can't speak for our peers that that works for us. And so we're backing off, and we're continuing to find that we're receiving leases in many cases, without concessions, not all those cases San Francisco is different in your asset by asset we have different plans, but that the idea of having a concession to help pay the moving cost to them, some of the move has paid off for us.  And again, we're generally backing off now, when you get into a very competitive spot like downtown Oakland in the CBD or San Francisco or downtown San Jose, there's lease up going on in LA, there's lease up going on and so things get blurred a little bit because you've got to lease up, consider offering concessions. If you're stabilizing down the street, you're probably still offering large concessions. So, there's a little blurring going on. But we are seeing as you get down to other markets that like say, Ventura, lots of Orange County, San Diego, in many cases, conditions just drying up. And that's kind of what can happen with secession isn't there in the market, and then they just dry up rather rapidly. And we are seeing that happen. So, the overall, again, really as a tool to increase absorption, and I understand your ideas and that effective, but the reality is we try to use them to increase absorption and they worked well for us. Does that answer your question?
John Pawlowski: It does, it sounds like it's more of a debate over duration. So, if these concessions ever to continue for the next six months, effective rents have to be down 50-ish percent across these markets. Right. I mean, it's just, -- it's just too lucrative a market?
John Burkart: And again with us, yes. Why reference we gain 200 to 190 basis points in occupancy because there was an impact from we offer concessions, we increased interest in tax, and we're backing off of that. So, that worked well done to create excess demand. So, yes, -- if they went on forever, yes. Then they're part of the market. That'd be different.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim : John, mentioned in the prepared remarks. The value proposition of Downtown assets is defined with the Bourbon. And I was just wondering if you could remind us of the breakdown that you have or that you identify as Downtown or urban versus suburban. market?
John Burkart: Sure, well, yes, we look at about 10% urban and 90% suburban. And there's, obviously can be some blending that goes on certainly as you get into some of the locations in Southern California, where it's, kind of blended but overall, we look at 10% we have very little incentive to under 1000 units in downtown market in our store portfolio.
John Kim : Okay, and then on this profession discussion, which I know it's already interesting property results, but if we are assuming four weeks of construction as an average there might be higher than that in the second quarter, then that would imply reasons were down 10% renewables are down 8%. And I think there's no better compression level but I'm not really sure. If I'm in the sector, basis level, it's gotten better just given where the waste is sorted, have gone so I was wondering if you could help quantify that difference between the second quarter in July, as far as the effective rent change.
John Burkart: Yeah. I can definitely tell you on that. If you were to look at it truly on net effective and in this regard the increase in absorption, so just weird advanced transact net effective. They definitely get better in July. And they're going to comment on the renewals, not all the renewals concessions and in many cases it was a week or something like that. So, it wouldn't be translate to a, let's say, an average of an 8% or one month on the renewals. That's the renewals were closest to offer 1% somewhere in that area. But on the new leases, again, the focus was on the new leases with the concessions to increase absorption. So, in some of that has gone away. And so, if you look at it purely that way net effect, yeah, definitely rents are up in July over June.
Operator: The question comes from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Zach Silverberg: Hi and good morning be out there. Just a quick one on capital allocation. I'm just curious, in the press release, you mentioned more stock buybacks. Where does the stock buyback program fit into your best use of capital today? And how do you view this moving forward?
Michael Schall : Yeah. Hi. This is Mike. Yeah, we've slowed down a little bit on the stock buyback, and the thought there is that, the affects of COVID-19 are going to be with us for a longer period of time. And so, the impetus to do a lot of stock buy back quickly is less important. We are constantly watching debt-to-EBITDA and some of the other balance sheet metrics. And so, if you're selling assets to buy back stock, you're going to need to do leverage along the way, because as you sell an asset, obviously your EBITDA shrinking. So, we're mindful about how we do stock buyback. We're still very interested in it. It is still one of the things that is important to us. But, and again, funding it along the way with asset sales is an imperative action with respect to all of what we're doing. So I'd say, at this point in time, as Adam mentioned that, probably the preferred equity pipeline is going to be our go to source, given that, there are fewer providers out there and therefore we have a better selection of transactions to pick from and would be that. And, we definitely like co-investment transactions when the transaction market gets better and we see more quality assets that are trading. And obviously, it depends on what guys are trading out, but this idea of buying, let's say four and a half type cap rate with your cost of debt in the low to mid twos, that generates a whole lot of cash flow and is pretty attractive transactions. So, I think we're going to have opportunities on the external side and actually, I think this is, the fun part of the business, when there's disruption in the marketplace and lots of opportunity and we get to pick what the best use of capital is, I think that's what we do exceptionally well. Does that answer?
Zach Silverberg: Another quick one from me. You guys mentioned a mobile leasing app that you're developing. Do you have any sort of project return targets around this and what percentage I guess of your portfolio is completely touch less for a customer from the lease up process? 
Michael Schall: Sure. So we're not giving away the metrics at this point in time on that, but I can tell you it'd be quite a change from the perspective of the customer being able to come in and lease on a mobile iPhone, literally set up, obviously some setting up the appointment all the way through to getting approved instantly and moving forward. So we're very excited about that. We think that will give us a great customer experience and positioned very well going forward when you're talking about the touchless, at this point in time, really we have, from a tour perspective and otherwise we can go touchless all the way through other than of course once they get to the site, they're going to move in. But, we're touchless across the board in that sense, does that answer the question? 
Operator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for closing comments. 
Michael Schall: Very good. Thank you operator. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. Certainly our best wishes to you and your families during these very challenging times. And we hope to see you all either in person or on Zoom someday soon. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time. And we thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining our call today. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. These are challenging times as we manage through unprecedented events in our nation’s history. We would like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19, their caregivers and those participating on the call today. We reported a strong first quarter results last night, exceeding the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by $0.07, with the results for the quarter mostly unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted in the press release, we withdrew our 2020 FFO guidance ranges. Generally, we believe providing FFO guidance and related assumptions is an important aspect of investor communications. However, in the current environment, we believe that the range of probable outcomes for Essex is too wide to be useful to investors. Since the initial shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area was announced on March 17, the nation has experienced over 30 million unemployment claims, and economic uncertainty is as great as I have ever seen. Key variables in the government’s policy response are impossible to model such as the duration of the shutdown, the possibility that a second wave of infection could occur and the effectiveness of social distancing during a phased reopening of the economy. After a prolonged debate, we made the difficult decision to withdraw our core FFO guidance. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics: a recap of actions taken in the past 2 months in response to the pandemic, a review of our updated estimates for rent growth in our markets as can be found on Page S-16 of the supplemental and insights into what we’re seeing in the West Coast property transaction markets. Turning to our response to the pandemic, we have been very impressed with how the Essex team has responded and adapted to the dynamic and unprecedented conditions created by COVID-19. As the scope of the pandemic became more clear in early March we created a COVID response team comprised of senior leadership to gather information and act decisively. To maintain essential property operations, we implemented a variety of social distancing practices at each property; provided incentives and tools to push nearly all transactions online, over the phone or through the mail. We acquired and distributed PPE to our on-site staff and expanded training for safety protocols. We transitioned 5 corporate offices to work from home and implemented a virtual management process with daily contact via teleconference. In addition, we conducted weekly live video conferences that were available to all Essex employees to ensure consistent messaging and unity in a chaotic time. Communication is important during periods of uncertainty. And on March 23, we issued a press release to outline for investors, employees and residents how the company is going to assist those that are financially impacted by COVID-19, including protection from eviction and late fees, creation of payment plans and dissemination of information about governmental and community resources. The past 2 months have required urgent responses to many complex issues, including many unknowables related to the pandemic itself, a plethora of well-intentioned but imprecise government regulations and properly balancing our obligations to stakeholders in the spirit of corporate responsibility. With that backdrop, it’s essential to recognize the tireless efforts of the Essex team amid great concern for their health and safety of their families to rapidly and thoughtfully react to the crisis. Well done, team Essex. Turning to the West Coast rental markets, we have prepared a scenario for our 2020 rent growth expectations on Slide S-16 of the supplemental that incorporate macro U.S. forecasts for GDP and job growth that are prepared by a broad spectrum of industry and Wall Street economists. While the span of forecasted outcomes is wide to an unprecedented extent, there is a common expectation that the U.S. will experience double-digit declines in second quarter GDP growth and an overall contraction in the economy in 2020, with job losses for the year estimated at around 7%. In summary, we expect approximately 900,000 job losses or 6.6% in our West Coast metros in 2020 compared to the net addition of 207,000 jobs from our estimate last quarter. An approximate 14% reduction in estimated total housing deliveries from last quarter is not sufficient to offset the impact of negative job growth, leading to our belief that market rents overall will decline an average of 2.8% in 2020 versus last quarter’s estimated 3% increase in market rents. The extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus programs that have been implemented by the federal government have already helped stabilize capital markets and should limit the risk of financial contagion. If you consider by contrast the major stimulus programs from the Great Recession, they occurred roughly a year after the recession started. But in today’s case, they were just days and weeks into the crisis and have been much larger in scope. On Page S-16.1 of our supplemental, we highlight the impact of the $600 per week federal supplement to unemployment insurance that was part of the CARES Act. While the effectiveness of the program has been muted by processing delays at state unemployment offices, the weekly checks have started to arrive and will substantially offset the income loss for a large segment of the population that has suffered from job losses and furloughs. We highlight this program because it hasn’t received much attention. Given these benefits, the income shortfalls for lower to middle income workers are much less severe than they would have been otherwise. And in some cases again, at lower and middle income levels, some workers will receive more in unemployment benefit as compared to their compensation. Finally, I will turn to the apartment transaction market. Yields or cap rates for apartment transactions generally exceed interest rates on related debt, and the resulting positive leverage is a powerful force in the market. Unlike the great financial crisis, large banks have maintained relatively conservative lending standards and strong liquidity and capital positions, and interest rates have declined further since the crisis began. As an example, we recently received a quote for a 7-year Fannie Mae loan on a joint venture property with a fixed interest rate of 2.75%. We believe these factors will be sufficient to avoid widespread distress in the apartment space. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don’t change immediately in reaction to events but rather seek to reflect the longer-term financial performance of a property. Generally speaking, many potential buyers are seeking a higher cap rate as a result of the pandemic. However, apartment owners generally have no distress, and exceptionally low interest rates provide the opportunity to improve cash flow through refinance to take advantage of record-low positive leverage. As a result of these factors, the spread between buyer and seller expectations has widened and the gap separating them is probably around 30 to 60 basis points, likely resulting in fewer apartment transactions in the near term. If our stock price was higher, we would be an aggressive buyer in this environment. Historically, periods of disruption have resulted in great opportunity for Essex. I am confident that we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of outperformance. And now I will turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by echoing Mike’s sentiment and recognize our associates who are working hard to provide our customers the best service in this essential business of providing housing. Over the past few weeks, we have seen countless demonstrations of the Essex spirit throughout our community. Our teams have shown grit and determination in the face of rapidly changing working conditions. But even more, they have shown compassion to each other and to our residents, from proactively reaching out to those in need, buying residents groceries and even obtaining and distributing personal protective equipment. In addition, we have published resources on our website to assist residents in finding the financial assistance they may need during this time as well as created a library of resources for residents whose children are home from school or who are simply looking for productive ways to use their time during this crisis. Most residents and prospects have been understanding of the changes we needed to make at our communities and appreciative of the great efforts of our team to continue to provide exceptional service during this time, a big thank you to our e-team, our residents and the community. We are truly all in this together. Turning to our first quarter 2020 results, we achieved 3.2% revenue growth over the prior year’s quarter. The results were in line with our expectations. Although this is the Q1 call, I believe everyone is more interested in recent events post-COVID shelter-in-place orders, therefore I will be focusing on specific April metrics and recent market activity. I will begin with general comments and move on to the markets. As this situation is unprecedented, with numerous key variables impacting both supply and demand, my commentary on the future market expectations and conditions relies on numerous, generally positive assumptions such as the relaxation of the shelter-in-place orders in the near future, a reduction of new supply entering the market and a restart of the economy in an orderly way. Currently, the rental market is disrupted. There is a gap between the bid/ask price for rental transactions at certain properties in the market. Rental transactions are disproportionately occurring at stabilized properties, offering 2 to 4 weeks free rent, while other properties are losing occupancy. April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up approximately 1.5%, while financial occupancy declined 1.3% compared to the prior year’s period. We are currently offering various leasing incentives, which includes 2 to 4 weeks free rent. I expect the market will move back to equilibrium in June as the shelter-in-place requirements are relaxed and we enter the summer leasing season. Historically, during periods of reduced demand, our portfolio has benefited from people taking advantage of lower pricing and moving from the outlying areas to the core areas where our portfolio is located. I expect the same market dynamics to play out in the coming months. Looking at operations post shelter-in-place, leasing applications in our portfolio bottomed the first week of April and have increased each week since that time. Our same-store financial occupancy decreased 1.3% in April from March. Roughly half of the decline in occupancy was due to COVID-19-related lease breaks. The remainder was related to reduced leasing velocity. This last week, we have seen activity increase dramatically. Our tours increased 47%, and our applications increased 62% over the prior 4-week period average. The initial shock appears to be over, and now the market is moving to equilibrium. Now we will turn to April delinquencies, delinquencies in our total portfolio on a cash basis was 5% in April compared to 33 basis points for the full first quarter of 2020. As the magnitude of this crisis became more apparent in March, we acted immediately to form a resident response team to engage with our residents in understanding their situations, identifying resources for them and partnering with them to get them back on to firm financial ground. As noted in S-15, approximately 4,600 tenants, representing 7.4% of our total portfolio, completed our online request form in April, confirming that they had been financially impacted by COVID-19 and requesting assistance. 36% of those residents paid their April rent in full. Another 36% made a partial payment averaging about 50% of their rent and 28% were unable to pay their April rent. Residents representing 60 basis points of our portfolio requested to move out immediately, which we allowed, enabling the residents to move forward with their life and the company to potentially avoid future delinquency. Of the residents who stated they were financially impacted by COVID-19, 16% were in the food and beverage industry; 9% each in retail and personal services, which relates to fitness, massage or beautician services; and 7% each in healthcare, transportation, construction and professional and business services. 2.2% of our residents are delinquent, and we have been unable to contact them. However, some of them have made partial payments. Interestingly, the delinquency at the property level within a selected market had fairly large variations. Certain properties were substantially more impacted than others. I believe this disproportionate impact is the root cause of the market dislocation. I would compare it to randomly located new lease-ups aggressively attempting to increase occupancy. Owners at the highly impacted buildings with respect to occupancy and/or delinquency as well as those who are struggling to compete in this new virtual sales world are likely to be the ones aggressively offering concessions. On to expenses, as Mike has mentioned, we have withdrawn our financial guidance. However, I want to note some expense considerations. Utility usage and related expenses will be higher due to the shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, we expect a significant ongoing increase in expenses related to personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies as well as related increased labor cost due to new cleaning protocols. Finally, to protect our employees and residents, we have stopped performing non-emergency work orders in occupied units. We have provided residents with self-help videos and other resources to help them fix many of their own issues. However, we expect that there will be some level of pent-up work orders as conditions change. Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment, our technology vision and related operating strategy that we have been executing positioned us well going into this rapid change. Our cloud-first strategy enabled a relatively smooth transition as the stay-at-home orders were implemented. We remained fully operational while rapidly transitioning to working from home. The new operating environment of social distancing requires a solid digital presence, including video tours, digital maps, self-help information and related videos as well as smartphones for FaceTime tours and other similar tours. We made the decision early on to rapidly accelerate our technology-enabled transformation, completing the implementation of our mobile maintenance app 2.0, our sales lead management system 2.0 and several other initiatives, shaving 4 to 12 months off the original rollout plans. As the restrictions are relaxed, we are positioned well for this new environment. Our operating strategy going forward will balance occupancy and market rents, maximizing revenue. We will likely operate at a lower occupancy than we have over the past several years. We will continue to leverage our technology platform and operate consistent with the social distancing protocols by using a combination of virtual tours and live video tours, where our sales associate is either on site touring a prospect via phone, or the resident is on site and the sales associate is live answering questions and explaining various features and benefits of the particular unit and amenity. Our smart lock digital entry systems enable us to provide access to vacant units for self-tours, thus eliminating the need for agents to be on site to provide access. These were very challenging weeks for certain, but we are emerging from this challenge stronger and we are well prepared for the future. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 6.1%, while financial occupancy declined 80 basis points compared to the prior year’s period. Delinquency in the northern technology-driven markets, were lower. In April, delinquency in our Seattle same-store portfolio was 1.8%, the lowest in our same-store portfolio. Moving to Northern California, in the Bay Area, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 17 basis points, while financial occupancy declined 1.2%. Delinquencies for the same period in the Bay Area were 3.9%. Our Santa Clara County submarket had the lowest delinquency at 2%, while Alameda, San Mateo and Contra Costa County were 4.1%, 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively. Consistent with the rest of the market, our 4 Bay Area lease-ups, 500 Folsom, Station Park Green, Mylo and Patina at Midtown, had very little activity since late March, which was the result of both the construction challenges as well as reduced demand in the marketplace. Continuing South, Southern California same-store economic rents were up 1.1% year-over-year in April 2020, while financial occupancy declined 1.6%. In the same period, our Southern California region had a higher delinquency overall in our same-store portfolio at 7.5%. Ventura and San Diego delinquency was at 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Orange County delinquency was 7.5%, and L.A. County delinquency was 9.4%. Our L.A. CBD and Woodland Hills submarkets were the hardest-hit at 12.1% and 13.8%, respectively. As of April 30, our same-store portfolio’s physical occupancy was 94.4%, and our availability 30 days out is 6.5%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I will briefly comment on our first quarter results then provide an update on our funding plans and the balance sheet. We had a strong start to the year with first quarter same-property NOI growth of 3.9% and core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.07 and achieving a 7.7% growth compared to the same period last year. As noted in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance as a result of the unprecedented uncertainty caused by the COVID pandemic. Subsequently, we have enhanced our disclosure by providing additional data on April operations and more liquidity details on Page S-15. Turning to our funding plan for investments, stock buybacks and dividends, during the first quarter, we committed $106 million of capital towards structure finance investments at an average yield of 11.2%. The funding for these investments is expected to start around September and occur over a period of 6 to 12 months thereafter, which means our funding needs for 2020 is only about $40 million. Similarly, our development funding needs for 2020 is also de minimis at about $75 million. This represents 50% of our total development commitment shown on Page S-11. In fact, approximately 90% of the current development pipeline is expected to complete lease-up within the next year. We have begun reducing our exposure to direct development several years ago because the rate of construction costs increased at a greater pace than rent growth, ultimately compressing yields. Hence, this is consistent with the plan we have discussed on previous calls. Moving on to funding sources, we expect to receive a total of $215 million from structured finance repayments, of which $115 million can be allocated to our investment needs noted earlier and $100 million can be allocated to fund our stock buyback. Since we have repurchased $176 million of stock, the remaining $76 million will be match-funded with cash flow from operations. As for our dividends, during the first quarter, we raised the annual dividends by 6.5%, which represents the 26th consecutive dividend increase. We are proud of this track record, which few companies have achieved. Even though cash flow from operations may be lower than the original plan for this year, the dividend remains very secure and covered by free cash flow. With over $1 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities in 2020 and our funding commitments well covered, Essex remains in a strong financial position. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Mike, you mentioned the transaction market and that your cost of equity isn’t where you would like it to be, but if you see good external growth opportunities, either repurchasing your shares or on the acquisition market, would you execute an increased near-term leverage?
Michael Schall: Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think at this point in time, given this incredible uncertainty, we would like to stay more leverage-neutral in terms of how we approach our different investment types. Not to say that we won’t sell property in order to pursue other types of opportunities, but at this point in time, until we see greater clarity because I would say at this point in time there are more unknowns than knowns out there given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic itself. And so we are going to remain fairly conservative when it comes to leverage for the foreseeable future.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just maybe on operations, you mentioned the concessions that you are seeing on some stabilized properties, what sort of concessions are you seeing on lease-up properties today in the different markets?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. The lease-up properties just going back to the stabilized just for a second, what we are seeing is we are seeing 2 to 4 weeks pretty common is where we are seeing rental transactions. And I mentioned the comment as far as dislocation because simply looking at asking rents and assuming that asking reflects the actual rent, that’s what I’m getting at. It doesn’t necessarily reflect that. Where the transactions are occurring is where there are some level of concessions that are going on out there. As we move from the stabilized market, and that, again, back a step, that really relates to what I see as a dislocation that’s caused by the impact of some of the delinquencies hitting certain properties and not others, kind of creating many lease-ups out there. I think that will abate in the near future. As we move to the lease-ups, the lease-up concessions are closer to 2 months, and there are some other specials that are going on. Again, the whole market just kind of expanded out from shorter concessions on lease-ups and no concessions on stabilized, to 2 to 4 weeks stabilized and basically 8 weeks on a new product across the board. Does that answer your question?
Nicholas Joseph: Yes. That was very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning out there. I am curious what your thoughts are on the collections across your markets, married with the comment you said regarding the slow rollout of unemployment benefits and then also balancing that with some of the tenant activism that’s made headlines of late?
John Burkart: Yes, I will take that. What we are seeing, I am going to start with an amazing event and we are really seeing some good people that were impacted by situations outside their control, really all trying to figure it out and do the right thing. I don’t want to focus on the potential of a few bad actors. The reality is we have a lot of great people that are working hard. Our resident response team is engaged with them and we are seeing good behavior by really the majority of those people. I acknowledge there are some people we haven’t connected with. But even those people, some of them have actually paid some levels of rent. They might just be a little bit shell-shocked from this whole situation. My expectation is that as the government assistance rolls out, that people will probably make as much rent payments as they can. And then again, as I mentioned, we do expect the relaxation of some of the shelter-in-place requirements and a somewhat orderly challenged, but orderly economic improvement. And so we expect to see people starting to go back to work, being able to pay rent. And for those that can’t pay rent, they may end up moving out. But again, our markets that we’re in benefit from this chronic undersupply. And so what we’ve always seen in the past is whenever there is some level of a shock, it takes some time, 1 to 3, 4 months, and we start to have people from the outside areas moving into our markets and supporting occupancy and therefore, rents. So I see – I have a somewhat optimistic view as to how this goes, but again, I want to be very candid that where we are today, there is a little bit of dislocation going on right now.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. What do you think the likelihood that you collect some of that unpaid or delinquent rent is over time as some of those benefits roll in?
Michael Schall: Hi this is Mike, Austin. We don’t know. Honestly, that falls in the bucket of we actually have more unknowns than knowns, which is why we didn’t give guidance. I think this is one of the key issues out there. And historically, as John said, we have somewhere around 30 to 40 basis points of delinquency. And it does not present an accounting issue. We just assume. Effectively, we treat it on a cash basis. And so it’s a little bit different now. And fortunately, because of the timing of when all this happened, we have pretty much 3 months to work through those issues and have better information. We know, historically, that the further you get away from the move-out date, the more difficult it is to collect. And that’s just our experience over time. And so we are motivated to move pretty quickly and which of course, many of these eviction prohibitions and other governmental actions prevent us from doing that. And so as John said in his prepared remarks, which I think is important here, that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I will move out, we are going to likely let them out of their lease, which means that we are going to have a little bit more turnover, but we’re going to control the unit at a time when, again, because of these eviction prohibitions, we don’t have a lot of choices. So we’re working through all that. It’s, I think, one of the more complicated issues that we have to deal with, with respect to this whole challenging scenario.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. And I know there is still a lot of uncertainty, but you guys kind of leading into this had preferred equity over ground-up development. I am curious as you think about coming out of this and how you want to be opportunistic how are you weighing those types of investments?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. And Adam is here too so he may want to add something, but yes, we still like the preferred equity investment. We are not in the first loss piece. Again, we come in to those transactions at the point in time that they are beginning construction. So costs are known, financing is in place, et cetera. So we are not taking a great deal of risk upfront. And typically, those deals underwrite to somewhere in the high 4 to low 5 cap rate and they were of course at around the 85% loan-to-value ratio, which means our effective cap rate is somewhere in the mid-5s. So, the chances of having distress at that level I think is incredibly unlikely. And in terms of investment policy going over – going forward, direct versus preferred equity, I will let Adam handle that.
Adam Berry: Yes. To echo what Mike has said, we continue to aggressively pursue on the pref equity side throughout this crisis. We’ve underwritten deals a little more conservatively, increased interest rates commensurately with our additional cost of capital that’s happened over the last month or so. And we’ve continued to identify deals, and we’re in the process of due diligence on a number of pref equity deals. Going forward, there are definitely development deals out there and we will continue to track and monitor. There is some expectation that costs will come back toward us with decreased construction. We haven’t seen any of it so far, and we have our finger on the pulse with a number of pref equity deals out there right now. So haven’t seen a decrease in pricing, and sellers are very, very hesitant to decrease their pricing expectations. So I think the development world will take a little pause, but we continue to like I said aggressively pursue on that side.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thank you. All very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Yulico: Hi, everyone. I just want to first ask on the market rent forecast you gave, which is for market rents being down about 3% this year. Can you just give us a feel for how fast that could manifest in your portfolio in terms of a decline in new lease rates? And I guess I am also wondering if the impact could be bigger than that on a short run basis and you assume some sort of recovery in rates in the back half of the year, any perspective there would be helpful?
Michael Schall: Yes, Nick. This is Mike and I am sure Mr. Burkart has an opinion on this one as well. So I think what you have here is a shock to the system. And anecdotally, lots of people that can’t afford their apartment, potentially moving to different places and other things. So that will be the shock to the system. And then there’s a recovery. The recovery is almost always people backfilling from further-out locations into areas that are closer to the jobs, and then we benefit from that over time, but this takes time to play out. So this presumes, since we were up 3% in Q1, on S-16, last quarter and now we are at minus 2.8%, it assumes a pretty dramatic drop-off in market rents. Of course, we don’t turn units. We turn units ratably throughout the year. I think part of that, because we enter what’s traditionally a more seasonal period, so the fourth quarter is a little bit more challenging for us on the demand side anyway, we still have the deliveries of apartments into the markets. And so we think it will be pretty choppy going into the fourth quarter, and then we think it recovers from that point on. So the other point I would make is John’s comment about stabilized concessions. I think that stabilized concessions are assumed to continue in our economic growth forecast on Page S-16. And again, just to remind everyone what this is. This is a scenario based on macro factors, effectively supply demand factors. When you throw them into our model for what happens with various supply demand factors, what happens to rents, this is what we get. There is still a whole bunch of unknowns on top of this. Again, the policy issues, will there be more regulation in these markets, which we don’t see. We think there has been plenty of regulation, actually, but we don’t know what’s going to happen with that. The cadence of move-ins and move-outs, we can’t predict that. And the collection of the delinquency is another challenging subject. So that’s why we decided to give this data on S-16 without giving guidance because there is a whole another level of assumptions. And we think that there is enough very large assumptions embedded in S-16 that it just didn’t make sense to push it further.
Nick Yulico: Okay, that’s helpful, Mike. And then just in terms of supply if we look, Oakland and San Jose are two markets that are facing some of the biggest supply deliveries in the second quarter, third quarter of this year. Is your sense that any of those projects have now been delayed in terms of timing? And then also, if you could just maybe tell us in a real-time basis what you are seeing for projects that are delivering and lease-up, I mean is it you mentioned 2 months earlier. Is that the norm in these markets, is it worse than that? Thanks.
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s – it can be worse than that. But I would focus you on the percent of supply, total supply to total stock, which is at 0.6% for the portfolio. And Northern California is a little bit higher at 0.7%. But then, again, Northern California also has more momentum. I think we believe that tech markets are the winner here. And because their business models are pretty COVID-19-resistant for the most part, not that venture capital hasn’t been affected, it has a little bit and jobs haven’t been affected they have. Although when we look at, for example, the top 10 technology companies, job openings are down a little bit, but they’re still very strong. So our view is that the tech markets do better here, and we’ll continue on the path of leading the West Coast markets. And obviously, that’s been a key part of our investment. So I guess what I’m saying is I would be less concerned about supply in Northern California, given the strength, the overall strength of the job markets and the companies here. Probably, if we have a concern, even though it appears to be the least amount of supply, it’s Southern California because it doesn’t have the job drivers that Northern California and Seattle have.
Nick Yulico: Okay, thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Malkin: Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to – I just wanted to kind of go back to the question that Austin brought up. I believe in your supplement, you’ve called out 2% of the delinquency is – or 2% of the total rent is people who are not affected by COVID but haven’t paid. So that’s basically the moral hazard. I guess I would be interested in, if you can at all, Mike, just maybe walk through what markets you’re the most concerned about. Obviously, people are talking about rent strikes. It seems like the legislature and judges have no interest of pushing through evictions anytime soon. I guess any more color on how you see that kind of playing out, when you see the eviction, I guess, the market normalizing? And how much worse could that moral hazard get as we continue to have an elevated unemployment environment for a longer period of time?
Michael Schall: Yes. It’s a good question. And I believe you’re talking about, on S-15, the 2.2% which is the percentage of units delinquent in April not requesting assistance. So I guess most of that category is people that we haven’t heard from. And I think that there are really 2 components. There is the moral hazard component, those that just want to take advantage of the situation, the various laws and the reluctance of the courts to process evictions, et cetera. But I think there’s another piece of that, which is people that are just overwhelmed and/or, for whatever reason, ignore their notices. So I think it’s still a little bit early to tell exactly how that breaks down. I guess, from my perspective, that’s not a huge number in the scheme of things because I know when we were talking to our Board, we gave them a much larger range of delinquents. And so I think our actual experience is better than what we thought. And I was concerned that, to your point, that if you’re going to give people, there’s no hammer as it relates to evictions, maybe in late fees for some period of time as part of our overall program to try to help residents through this difficult period, etcetera, that there might be more of those people that just say, oh, I’m just not going to pay rent. Keep in mind that they still have a credit issue, and so there is a reason to pay rent. They still owe the money. And we still fully intend to pursue the collection effort. And we will have to approach it a bit differently, given the magnitude of it. And so – but we’re going to still push hard to collect it where we can. So this falls within one of the unknowns, and we’re not sure exactly what’s going to happen with that category. Fortunately, it’s only 2.2%.
John Burkart: Yes. Mike, let me just add. In my comments, I mentioned that those are the people that we haven’t spoken with. But I also said some of them have actually paid partial payments. So to be clear, you can’t look at that group and say that they’re a moral hazard. I’ll give you an example. One of the things we did at Essex is we – early on, realizing the challenge that this was for so many people, we identified residents that have been challenged with us in the past. They may have had reviews that they wrote that they were upset with for whatever reason, and we reached out to them just to check and see how they were doing. The feedback we got was amazing, but what we found is many people were somewhat shell-shocked. They really just weren’t interacting with the public. And so we had people that were saying, wow, call me back next week. And so I think how this impacted a lot of people were some people just kind of went back into their units and just disconnected from everything, and then others were just trying to work through it. And maybe they were working, and they’re connecting with other people. So I don’t associate the 2.2% as being reflective of moral hazard. I recognize there may be some of that out there. But I think people will come along, and we’re seeing good behavior overall. We’re hearing amazing stories. So I wouldn’t associate that with moral hazard.
Neil Malkin: Alright. I appreciate the detail. Yes. Another one I have is, in terms of the H-1B visa program, I know a lot of that goes to tech. I know a lot of that goes into your markets. And so I’m just wondering if you have any sense as to what that looks like going into the summer. Is that sort of demand or occupancy that you assume now will be lost? And then the venture capital side as well, I guess, sort of like the two in a specific to the West Coast had these demand drivers. I just had questions on that?
Michael Schall: Yes. Yes, this is Mike again. We haven’t spent a lot of time on the H-1Bs, given all the other things that we’re working on. Anecdotally, we have not heard – in terms of what they’re actually doing, we know that they don’t qualify generally for unemployment. And therefore, to the extent they’re displaced, then maybe there’s a possibility that they will go home. And so that’s out there. But it’s just – it’s too hard to tell at this point in time. And I’m sorry, I missed the second part of your question.
Neil Malkin: Yes, sure. Sorry. I was just asking about venture capital, you had alluded to it.
Michael Schall: Thank you. Yes, yes. Yes, venture capital. So yes. No, I did. I did. Yes, venture capital, I mean, it still remains strong in our markets, still above the dot-com era. The last funding by quarter last quarter was – first quarter 2020 was $12 billion versus about $10 billion in the dot-com period, so still strong. Again, anecdotally, we’re hearing that venture capital valuations are dropping pretty substantially by a big number. We also – when we go through the WARN notices or the notices of layoffs, there are a lot of venture capital-funded companies that are on that list. So trying to figure out how to kind of continue operations at a time when valuations are not really attractive. So I would put this in the bucket of still a lot more unknowns than knowns as the venture capital world is trying to figure out what to do. I know, in our case, we have our technology fund consortium of – that the REITs and other multifamily owners put together. And we’re seeing some pretty attractive deal flow as a result of that and lower valuations overall. And so we think it’s actually a very good time to be an investor in technology at this point in time compared to the recent past.
Neil Malkin: I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Spector: Good afternoon and thanks for all of the color. If I missed this, I apologize. Can you discuss May collection so far, what you’re seeing?
John Burkart: Yes, you didn’t miss it. This is John. They’re materially consistent with April. One thing I would say is, because of when the fifth falls, things can move around a little bit, but we’re right on path with April.
Jeff Spector: Okay, great. Thanks. And then I believe, Mike, in his opening remarks, talked about an expectation for a decline in market rents in 2020. I believe I heard negative 2.8%. Just given what’s going on, it just – it doesn’t seem so bad to me. Again, I know it’s down, and you were expecting up 3%-plus. But is that correct? And can you put that in perspective, let’s say, versus what you saw during the tech crash or Great Recession, that minus – was it minus 2.8%?
Michael Schall: Yes, Jeff. Yes, keep in mind, this is actually published in S-16 of the supplement, where we try to give you an idea of what we think market rents are going to do on average for 2020. And so we come to 2.8%. However, keep in mind, we have 3% rent growth, market rent growth in the first quarter. So to average 2.8% for the year, we expect rents to decline pretty substantially between now and year-end. And again, I go back to John’s comments about stabilized concessions because if you give away a month free, that’s actually a pretty significant reduction in market rents. And I think it’s somewhere in that magnitude where we expect, again, as we’re working through all the delinquents and some of them are moving out, and we’ve created more units than we would ordinarily have to rent and now we have to draw people into those units that we think we’re going to have to provide more incentive to do that. And so that will be probably mostly in the form of a concession. But I think that’s the environment for the rest of the year, and then I think John points this out too, then we probably hit equilibrium at some point in time, we would say, toward the end of the year. And then I think things can recover from that point. Does that make sense?
Jeff Spector: Yes. And can you compare that – the minus 2.8% for the year to, let’s say, what happened during the tech crash or Great Recession?
Michael Schall: Yes. Well, overall, market rents declined in the financial crisis about 15% over a couple of years. In terms of – but keep in mind, we don’t actually realize that or realize it over time because we have leases in place. And I actually have these numbers. So in 2009, the reported revenue drop was 2.8%, and 2010 was 3.3%. So we had 2.8% – same-property revenue dropped 2.8% in 2009, 3.3% in 2010, on an overall, about 15% reduction in market rents. And so as you can tell, I mean the reported numbers are pretty dramatically less than given leases in place compared to the market rent numbers. Does that help?
Jeff Spector: Yes. It’s very helpful. And I wish everyone well. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
John Burkart: Thank you. You too Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I was interested in the commentary about the increased tours and applications in the past 4 weeks and trying to compare that with the 140 basis points of occupancy that was lost during April. Do you think that with the increased activity, that occupancy has basically troughed already and how do those metrics compare year-over-year?
John Burkart: Yes. So the – I definitely believe that activity troughed, it troughed in the first week of April and the commentary that I gave related to the last week versus the April average, and it was up substantially. Our applications were up over 60%. So we saw a lot of market activity. So, very good outlook going forward, what we are seeing is the market is moving toward equilibrium. We are offering some level of concessions. People are renting units. Things are going in the right direction. That’s a good thing. As it relates to year-over-year activity, we’re definitely lower. It’s a little harder to compare because when you look at, say, tours, we’re up an infinite amount on virtual tours right now. We had no virtual tours a year ago. And so when you’re trying to compare those numbers, it’s a little challenging. That’s why I gave away the trough, which was the first week of April and then this last week, where we are in comparison. We’re continuing to see this with good leasing traffic, good activity. But overall, definitely, the market for April was and we call it shell-shocked, it was less than what it was a year ago in April, but given exact comparisons, it would be misleading.
John Kim: Okay. So the activity is a good leading indicator. I was wondering if you could also clarify the difference between financial and physical occupancy on S-15? That’s basically 100 basis points and I’m...
John Burkart: Yes. Financial occupancy relates to whether or not someone is in our unit for the full month of the period, whatever the period is, compared to our scheduled rent, whereas physical occupancy is just simply looking at the units and whether or not they’re occupied, so the – at one point in time. So, our – we quoted our physical occupancy as of April 30, which was on that day, whereas our financial occupancy for April would have been the whole month, so a little bit different. The reason we were doing that is we’re trying to give out to people, again, full transparency, give a good understanding of where we ended up because we did end up lower than where we were for the month. I will say, though that things have picked up and is what you would expect. It’s consistent with what I’m saying. We do expect occupancy to continue to pick up. I think that was probably our low point. When you think about it with traffic being in the low at the first week, that’s typically going to relate to occupancy being in the low several weeks later and then all of a sudden, it picks up. So this whole thing is working out as expected consistently. And I expect our occupancy will continue to pick up going forward, which it is right now.
John Kim: So is it fair to say that the physical occupancy is a leading indicator for the financial, and then the tours and applications are, I mean, an indicator for both?
John Burkart: Yes.
John Kim: Okay, thank you.
John Burkart: Sure. You welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. And I apologize for the background noise. So a few questions. First of all, I think you guys are pretty bold to let tenants do their own home repairs. I can’t wait to see the photos of the aftermath. But two questions. So first, Mike, can you just – you talked about the different markets, and Seattle’s strongest, the Northern L.A. suburb’s the weakest as far as rent collection. Can you just – maybe I missed it, but can you just give us some color on urban versus suburban? And especially that you guys have sold down, you’ve been selling down your urban exposure, so just sort of curious how you’re seeing your portfolio rent collections, etcetera, play out between that dynamic?
Michael Schall: Sure, Alex. Good question. And yes, I don’t want to see the drywall patch job that our residents do for sure. Let’s see. The – I think...
John Burkart: Yes. I mean I can talk about their delinquency. Yes, I’ll talk to...
Michael Schall: Why don’t you just start? Yes.
John Burkart: The delinquency, first off, Alex, we are a high-service shop, so some of the self-help might literally be replacing the light bulb. But anyway, the – as to the delinquency, as I mentioned, we aren’t really seeing a high-rise versus low-rise of rent. We’re not seeing correlations as it relates to that. When I look at the – what occurred, certain assets were impacted more than others. And when I dug deep into that, you could see the logic, like an asset that perhaps is next to a mall or one that’s highly impacted by a school, and you could understand what was going on. But then when I tried to apply that fact to other assets that had similar situations, next to a mall, 10 miles away, or highly impacted by a school, the results weren’t the same. It was really interesting and unique. And what I did find, though, is that there was a submarket distinction, and that’s why I brought up the submarkets. And so Downtown L.A. was highly impacted. And that’s why I brought that one up specifically as was the Woodland Hills and Woodland Hills has exposure to the entertainment industry. So we did see those types of impacts. We also saw regional impacts, less in the Pacific Northwest. And of course, there, we have a lot of assets on the Eastside, many of them are garden-style and that type of thing, really low impact. And then in the middle was the Bay Area, and in more in the South, we had greater impact. Some of it was the Disneyland effect.
Michael Schall: Yes. And Alex, let me pick up on that. So yes, we have sold some buildings in the downtown. MaSo, as you’ll recall, was sold in Q4 of last year and 8th & Hope the year before, one in Downtown San Francisco, one in Downtown L.A. And I would say, most of that motivated by some of the issues and the grittiness of the downtown and our expectation for some of the areas to be cleaned up more quickly and transition more quickly than they did. So I think that, that continues to be a pretty significant issue here on the West Coast. And our performance has been – it’s been okay in the downtowns. It hasn’t been great because of some of those factors. And so our – we become more suburban over time. And again, with we want to own property in the, I would say, B- to A quality area, in areas near jobs and never too far from the major job nodes. And I would say that suburban generally has outperformed the urban here on the West Coast. I realize that, in other markets, you can have different outcomes.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is sort of going to that geographically, obviously, New York, here, we’ve been really hit hard. But speaking to folks in the rest of the country, including out even in the Bay Area, it seems like COVID has really been much less of an impact and that there’s a sense of people who want to get back to their jobs much quicker than the politicians want. So in your view, do you sense that there’s this pent-up demand where people are ready to get back to their jobs, and you guys may even rebound quicker than people think just because the level of COVID is less and the people are just far ready for it because they don’t have to rely on mass transit or do you think that it will take longer to reopen in your markets?
Michael Schall: It is the million-dollar question. And certainly, I don’t have an answer to it. I put this definitely in the unknown category. I think that we tend to have high-income levels out here, and the people that are earning high incomes want to consume services. And the services, for the most part, restaurants and a variety of things, those services are really not open at this point in time. So I think that there is a motivation to start opening things up again. Having said that, there – I think the governmental entities are incredibly, let’s say, conservative and concerned about surge capacity and some of the other issues that go along with it. So we’re going to take it one day at a time and can’t exactly predict what’s there. But I totally agree with you. I think that the demand for services is building and is pretty intense out there. And so hopefully, that motivates. We’ve seen various different things on the news about this in terms of closing the L.A. beaches. Boy, that’s a tough one, but because people want to get out and go do things. So I can’t exactly tell you what’s going to happen, but I definitely can feel the pressure building.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the negative 2.8% macro forecast. And by the way, thank you very much for that. I’m sure it’s not easy to put together right now. But I think one of the things that I’m certainly trying to understand, and I think a lot of people are trying to understand, is the cadence of that. And I’m not looking for you to give a specific guide. But maybe if you could just walk us through if you think you’re going to see a deeper 2Q ‘20 trough and then a quicker rebound. Or is it going to be more stable but down over the course of the year? And the reason I asked the question is I think about your – I think it was a negative 7% job growth forecast for the year, which is a little bit more severe than Morgan Stanley was projecting, which maybe suggests that you’re expecting it to be delayed out but maybe not as deep in 2Q. So any color you could provide on that? That would be really helpful.
Michael Schall: Yes, Rich. This is Mike. And I think I went through some of this previously. But the job forecast and the GDP forecast or estimates, again, we survey a wide range. We don’t do any fundamental research as it relates to the macro economy. And as there is wide dispersion of what people think is going to happen. And as we sort of triangulated all that, we got the minus 900,000, 6.6% job loss in our West Coast markets. So that’s where that came from. We don’t – again, we don’t add – we don’t try to add value. We just try to report the facts as it relates to that. What this has intended to do is take those macro forces and consider what would happen with rents in a normal situation because we don’t have a COVID-19 model because we’ve never been through this before. But in a normal situation, if you had minus 6.6% jobs – job growth and you had about 0.9% apartment deliveries, what would happen with rents? And so that’s where the 2.8% number came from in terms of our rent forecast, minus 2.8%. And again, that compares to plus 3% that we achieved in the first quarter. So in order to average minus 2.8% for the year, when you to start with 3 months of 3, yes, things get pretty ugly in the second half of the year. We view this as more just part of the shock of – to the system. There’s been an extraordinary shock to the system. And I think John’s equilibrium comment is the right one. We need to get back to equilibrium, and there will be short-term pain in order to get back to equilibrium. And best I can tell, it’s going to be somewhere around 1 month free on stabilized communities, which is sort of embedded into the minus 2.8%. So that’s where it comes from. And – but this is just our modeling. This is what happens in our rent forecasting model when you put these various pieces in. Again, it doesn’t reflect a COVID-19 scenario and the extraordinary uniqueness of the situation. So it could be different. And again, this is why we didn’t follow up with this and then push into guidance because there’s a whole another set of assumptions that would go into that.
Rich Hill: Yes, yes. And that’s helpful, and I recognize I’m asking a tough question. It sounds like, given the 1-month free concessions right now, and hopefully, those will burn off towards the end of the year, maybe we could assume something more than severe than the negative 4.75 that the average for the next 3 quarters would assume in 2Q and then gradually getting better because I think you had noted that you begin to inflect in 1Q ‘21. So I was just trying to get my hands around what does that average look like. And it sounds like it might be a little bit deeper in 2Q but then start to get better as the year progresses?
Michael Schall: Yes. In our model, it gets progressively worse because, again, you have seasonality that comes into the equation. Although we would say Q3 is normally our best quarter, let’s say, and we’re not going to get the benefit of the positive seasonality, and so maybe the negative which typically comes in the fourth quarter will be more muted. But we just don’t know. So we – the way that our model runs is it gets progressively worse, and then we’ll hit bottom sometime in Q4 and then rebound from there.
Rich Hill: Okay, that’s helpful. And I will follow-up with any questions, but thanks guys. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hardik Goel: Hey guys. First of all, thank you for all the great color on all the work you have done and Mike, congratulations on buying back stock. Second downturn in a row, that said, I really wanted to get your thoughts on – you guys talked – you guys track the labor market really well. We’ve gotten great commentary in the past about what job trends are like. What does your work there really tell you about not just startup employment but employment from the big tech companies and how would that compare to last year? Can you contextualize that?
Michael Schall: We can. Let’s see – let me pull out a slide on the big tech companies, which I have here somewhere. But again, we – there is a piece of it that we don’t know and that is to what extent do things open up as we – as California and Washington open up, how many of those jobs will come back. Will it be half the restaurants that get – that become filled given social distancing? And that’s kind of our best guess, but that, of course, means that the other half don’t come back immediately, and what happens with them. So this is part of the unknown with respect to that part of it. And again, I think the good thing about our markets is that we have high-income people. We generally are in the better areas. And people have the – want to consume services, which are not there right now, but I think there’s going to be a lot of pressure to bring them back. So I guess that’s the first statement. In terms of specifically, our process of tracking what’s happening with the top 10 tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, we have, let’s see, total openings at 22,900 as of May 1, 2020. So that compares to last quarter of – at March 27, it was about 28,000 or 29,000. So there’s been about a 20% reduction there. But if you go back in time, you hit about the same level as Q4 ‘18 in terms of the number of open positions, so Q3, Q4 ‘18 in terms of the number of positions open. So I would put that in the still-strong category. And even though it’s off, it’s off the all-time high that we achieved last quarter. So I think still pretty compelling. Does that help?
Hardik Goel: And just as a follow-up to that. I think John mentioned a few times – and that is really helpful, by the way. John mentioned a few times equilibrium pricing. And I was just wondering what do you guys see as equilibrium maybe in 2021 once we are past some of this uncertainty. Is it the economic environment stronger than 4Q ‘19 or is it something where we still have a 6% unemployment rate and pricing power inherently is not as strong as the late cycle?
Michael Schall: Yes. Again, I think this is – goes within the category of, hey, there has been an extraordinary shock to the system and the markets are trying to find equilibrium, but they’re changing as time goes on. Again, there are people that are on unemployment. Some of them will be brought back and – to work. And some of them won’t have a job, given you’re probably going to chop the capacity of a restaurant in half, for example. And maybe that’s made up with delivery or pickup type services or whatever, but it’s just going to be different. And I would say it’s beyond our ability to really predict with any degree of certainty when it comes to what that scenario is going to look like, which – but it will – we will have equilibrium. Historically, when you talk about the great financial crisis or 9/11 or the dot-com period, these periods go on for maybe 18 months and then kind of turn the corner. In this case, I think we’ve had all the negative part of that 18 months in 1 month. And so it’s all been compressed, and then now we have the second part where we’re hopefully hitting bottom and now we’re recovering. So I would expect that whole process, therefore, to compress to maybe 9 months or something like that.
Hardik Goel: Got it. That’s really helpful. And just if you would oblige me one last one. Could you give us a range of the prices in which you bought back stock? I know the average was 2.27 and I maybe reaching here, but I have to try?
Angela Kleiman: Hi. This is Angela. I think you’re trying to be a troublemaker here. So let’s just leave it as is. That’s our average and that’s what we report. Yes, I’ll give you some credit for trying.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Just one for me. Mike, there has been a flurry of cities to enact their own type of rent freeze measure, and I realize most of them won’t really impact your portfolio at all because they abide by Costa-Hawkins. There’s a few examples of cities kind of violating Costa-Hawkins right now, but again, a de minimis impact, at least from our lands in your portfolio. When you step back and you evaluate the legislative landscape, is there anything on your radar that would prohibit your renewal pricing power beyond your own proactive 90-day window? Is there any issues with any cities later in the year where you won’t be able to push renewals?
Michael Schall: Well, John, I know you guys tracked us pretty well, and we do, too. And there have been all kinds of proposals out there. Fortunately, most of them have not moved forward. And in California, obviously, we have AB 1482, which is statewide rent control, imposing a cap of CPI plus 5 with a cap of 10. So we’re managing through that environment. Fortunately, the more aggressive proposals have not been adopted, thank goodness. I would say the one that was most concerning, really, maybe two of them, one is L.A. extending the rent payment program out a year. And then there’s the judicial council that essentially is not going to hear eviction cases for some period after the state of emergency is raised. So we track it, but we think that, for the most part, we’re working through it. And as John said, the good news is that most of our residents have chosen a higher path of working with us to work through their situation. And again, I look at that 2% bucket that hasn’t communicated with us as being probably, ultimately, good news with respect to those that aren’t trying to take the maximum advantage of these various laws.
John Pawlowski: Got it. Thanks for taking the question.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Schall: Wes, you there?
Wes Golladay: Well, sorry, I forgot this whole mute function. Sorry about that. Looking at S-16, the 2.8% rent decline, have you made any adjustments to the Essex model for the CARES Act neutralizing job loss?
Michael Schall: No. I don’t – no, we have not. Again, this is – take the macro inputs, job growth, GDP growth, supply, and it’s straight, this is what comes out of our model if we put those factors in and again, for the marketplace. So I think the CARES Act will definitely help. That’s referring to S-16.1. And the pretty great unemployment benefits that are out there, I think that helps with respect to people hopefully being able to stay in our units longer and paying rent for a longer period of time and minimizing the damage. Even if they pay a half a month, that may be okay. At least they don’t accrue a balance that becomes so large that they just can’t – we just finance it. So I think it will help. It will help more on the delinquency side probably than it will on the rent side.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then did you comment already about retail exposure?
John Burkart: No. I’m glad to hit that. Retail is a really small part of our portfolio, like 1%, 1.5%. Our retail delinquency was basically about half of the retail tenants paid what they owed. So it was roughly in line with other things I’ve seen in the industry. That group of retail where they’re located at multifamily sites typically are relatively handing out their service providers. So when the business shuts down, they struggle. We’re working with really all of them and are pretty hopeful that they will be able to reopen back up. And we also will work with them on payment plans. So – but that group was hit hard, and we’ve seen that really across the industry in everything I’ve seen.
Wes Golladay: Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste: Hello good morning out there. 
Michael Schall: Good morning Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: So Mike, I guess I was intrigued by your comments earlier on not being afraid to capitalize on the transaction markets should the right opportunities emerge. And I had flashbacks to the time around the great financial recession when you guys backed up the truck and acquired a sizable amount of newly completed or near-completion construction and lease-up type of assets. Those deals you’re going to merge with BRE were instrumental in lowering your portfolio age and broadening your submarket and price point selections in your California market. So I guess I’m curious if you would be similarly interested in buying up busted condo projects or development lease-ups in size. And would you be more willing to cull from the bottom of your portfolio to fund it or perhaps use a fund structure to pursue these types of deals?
Michael Schall: Yes. Haendel, those are great questions. I guess the difference between now and the great financial crisis, in the great financial crisis, you had mortgages being made to people that couldn’t afford to pay them back. And the amount of distress within the housing sector was extraordinary, as you’ll recall, which created this opportunity to buy vacant brand-new condo buildings at 50% of replacement. There is nothing even close to that out there at this time. And again, my comments in the script about record-high positive leverage. If you take a typical deal that might be a 6, let’s say, 6.5 un-levered IRR with positive leverage, you’re probably in the high 9s to low 10s, somewhere in that zone in terms of IRR – levered IRR. So I think that, that is going to prevent any kind of significant distress within the markets. Of course, there are always some transactions that manage to find very aggressive lenders, and they manage to leverage our property up to 90% or more. And they’re out there for sure, but they are few and far between, I would guess, at this point in time. So in terms of our basic view of transactions, we view it as, okay, what can we do with our portfolio on a leverage-neutral basis? So what’s the arbitrage ability within our portfolio? What can we sell and replace at a higher overall yield or growth rate or IRR, let’s say? And how do we transact? So we’re always thinking about it that way. And so I would say that preferred equity is still pretty important to us. It’s still sort of at the top of our list. And also, I would say, certainly, joint ventures, which take greater advantage than on our balance sheet, or a little bit higher leverage than the joint ventures at – when we begin, and then, of course, that leverage drops over time but utilizes the leverage to a small extent or to some extent beyond that. So I would say those 2 things are transactions that we’re looking at and are interested in. And I didn’t mean to exclude Adam from this discussion because he’s the expert at it. Adam, what did I miss?
Adam Berry: You nailed it all, Mike.
Michael Schall: Did that help, Haendel?
Haendel St. Juste: It did. It did. I appreciate that. I want to go back to an earlier question, I guess, from a different angle. Just I’m curious if you’re hearing anything in terms of rent forgiveness bills being contemplated in California and Washington beyond the tenant protection on – for the temporary ban on evictions that we’ve been hearing here. As I’m sure you know, New York state is kind of contemplating such a forgiveness bill. I think it’s NY S1825. So I’m curious if there’s anything you’re hearing. And it’s – just more broadly, as a concept, does that even work? Or how would that work? Just the idea of the government stepping in and telling landlords to forgive 1, 2, 3 months free rent. So curious on maybe what you’re hearing and what you’re thinking on that.
Michael Schall: Well, clearly, this is California, and so you’re going to hear some of those things and there have been various proposals out there. And we don’t think that they’re constitutional, but that doesn’t necessarily stop them from being circulated. There actually is a bill in Sacramento, AB 828, that would give the courts the right to force landlords under certain circumstances to reduce rents by 25%. We think it’s unlikely. But it’s out there. We think it’s very unlikely. We don’t think it will happen. And again, from what we understand in all these discussions throughout the West Coast, which are mainly cities, there have been a lot of proposals, but the city attorneys have been pretty good at pointing out the legal peril with respect to that position. So they have – those bills have not been passed. And I think at this point in time, it appears that we’re beyond that period where we’re getting what seems to be a new legal mandate a day. We’re kind of beyond that period now, and I think we’re more in the period of let’s figure out how to get back to work and open up. So I think that, from a timing perspective, the time for those bills has come and gone.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts.
Michael Schall: Thank you
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for closing comments.
Michael Schall: Yes. Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Please call or e-mail us with any questions or comments. And our best wishes to you and your family during this challenging time. Thank you. Good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you everyone for joining our fourth quarter 2019 call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will review our 2019 results, summarize our expectations for 2020 and provide an update on the West Coast investment markets. Beginning with our results. 2019 was a successful year for Essex as we generated 6.4% core FFO per share growth, representing over 50% better growth than contemplated in our original guidance. Same-property NOI grew 3.9% in 2019, which was at the high end of our original guidance, reflecting stronger job growth than we had assumed. For example, Q4 2019 job growth averaged 2.3%, 50 basis points above our initial 2019 estimate. Once again, the tech dominant markets in Seattle and Northern California are leading the way with recent job growth of 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively. Southern California, where economic growth generally resembles the United States, recently added jobs at a rate of 1.5% on a trailing three-month basis. In addition, continued apartment construction delays resulted in less competition in 2019. We estimate that approximately 33,000 apartments were completed in 2019, about 7% less than expected. We continue to believe that tight construction labor market conditions will prevent significant acceleration of supply deliveries. John will provide more color on fundamentals in a moment. Our initial outlook for 2019 did not assume a significant improvement in the cost of debt and equity capital. In early 2019, we eagerly bought back our stock at a significant discount to consensus net asset value. As volatility in the capital markets abated and our cost of capital improved, we altered our business plan and began actively pursuing investment opportunities. As a result, we are pleased to report that we exceeded the high end of our acquisition and preferred equity guidance ranges from the focused effort of our investment team. In 2019, we added ownership interest in eight properties for $856 million, as further detailed on Page S-15 of the supplemental. These communities are mostly located in the tech centers along the West Coast and submarkets we know well and expect to be added to the portfolio’s growth profile. We also committed to over $140 million to new preferred equity or subordinated debt investments, significantly better than our production in 2018. In summary, 2019 demonstrated how we attempt to add value throughout the economic cycle. 2019 was also an important milestone for Essex as we celebrated 25 years as a public company with some notable achievements, a 17% compounded annual rate of return for our shareholders since the IPO through the end of 2019. In other words, $100 invested in our IPO would be worth over $5,000 today, with dividends reinvested. Through several economic cycles, our business model has generated an 8.4% compounded growth rate in FFO per share and a 6.4% rate of growth in our cash dividend, which has increased every single year. We were very pleased to learn that Essex was recently added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index. I'd like to thank all of the longstanding partners, the Essex team and shareholders who’ve contributed to the Company's achievements over the last quarter century. Turning to our outlook for 2020. We continue to see healthy demand for rental housing. Recent job growth for our West Coast markets continues to exceed the 1.7% forecast for 2020, on page S-16 of the supplemental. However, we continue to believe the job growth will likely decelerate in 2020, given tight labor market conditions and a low unemployment rate, which was 2.7% in the Essex markets as of November, down 50 basis points from a year ago. Turning to slide S-16.1 in our supplemental. We highlight a central theme of our West Coast focus. The chart on the right of this slide demonstrates that job growth has remained strong on the West Coast, and reaccelerated in 2019, diverging from the rest of the nation. On the left side of the chart, we note that multifamily permit activity in our metros peaked in 2018 and has declined about 14% from that peak, again, a divergence from the recent trends outside our markets. Rising construction costs and a challenging regulatory environment continue to compress development yields in most of our markets, which should lead to fewer supply deliveries in the future. Our delay adjusted supply estimates for 2020 have not changed from our original estimates last quarter. Notable changes year-over-year indicate about a 30% reduction in Seattle apartment supply in 2020 and about a 45% increase in Northern California. Tight labor market conditions on the West Coast continue to push incomes higher. Per capita personal incomes are estimated to have increased 6% in our markets in 2019, significantly higher than the U.S., average of 3.9%. Personal income growth has outpaced rent growth in most of our markets since 2016, which is leading to improved rental affordability. Consistent with this trend, the percentage of customers who moved out for financial reasons or a rent increase, was almost 16% in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2019, this factor accounted for less than 8% of those moving out. Despite last year's outsized media coverage of the failed IPO of WeWork, or the disappointing stock performance of other unicorns, the outlook for economic growth and new jobs in our markets remains favorable in 2020. Having closely followed Silicon Valley for the past four decades, we're not surprised to see volatility with respect to VC-backed companies. The venture capital model assumes many failures, which are more than offset by the hyper growth of the most successful investments. Bay Area venture capital investments dipped in the second half of 2019, but remained at healthy levels, well above this cycle’s average pace of investment. We continue to track over 26,000 job openings listed in our markets by the top 10 largest tech firms, a 12% increase compared to a year ago. The largest tech companies continue to add commercial square footage at a rapid pace, which John will comment on in a moment. Overall, we are tracking over 38 million square feet of office construction in our core market, which is almost 70% pre-leased and underlies the need for more housing. Turning to the investment markets. Cap rates remain stable, with A quality properties and locations trading in the height 3% to low 4% range, while Bs traded 25 to 35 basis points higher. In this environment, we are looking primarily for A minus to B minus quality communities in markets with the best long-term growth prospects. Six communities we acquired from our co-investment partner earlier this month are consistent with this strategy. We are pleased to increase our stake in these high-quality communities, while earning a $6.4 million promote from significant value creation from our partners and shareholders. The majority of our development pipeline will be leasing up in 2020. We have experienced our share of development delays due to a challenging construction labor market. However, we remain pleased with the initial customer response at our development communities and the current leasing pace. We continue to pursue development opportunities, but often see a better risk reward relationship within preferred equity and other structured investments. That concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to John.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. For the full year, we achieved 3.4% year-over-year same-store revenue growth, which was an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year's growth rate. Huge thank you to our E-Team for their outstanding work in improving the customer experience while delivering top results. Our fourth quarter 2019 results were fantastic, with 4% revenue growth of the prior year's comparable quarter. This was driven by strong market and bolstered by our shift in strategy to increase occupancy in preparation for both the seasonally slower demand period and expected elevated supply in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. This resulted in 30 basis points growth from the increased occupancy. We additionally had 40 basis points growth from other income, which included some one-time items such lease breaks. Overall, our markets continue to show strength, driven by year-over-year job growth, 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, which exceeded our expectations by 40 basis points. Income growth continues to outpace rent growth, improving affordability in our markets. Turning to 2020. Our guidance of 3.1% revenue growth at the midpoint contemplates rent growth for our portfolio of 3%, consistent with long-term CAGRs in our market and what is outlined on the S-16 in our earnings package. Additionally, we have factored in a slight reduction in occupancy of 10 basis points, as well as the negative impact of rent rollbacks related to the recently passed California assembly bill AB 1482, which is a 10 basis-point headwind for our California communities. Regarding expenses in 2020, we continue to see pressure on utilities, taxes and wages with offsets in controllable, resulting in our midpoint guidance of 3% for our year-over-year operating expense growth. In terms of supply, the bulk of the new apartment deliveries continues to be in downtown location. We project that 2020 deliveries will be about 65% lower in our suburban sub-markets compared to the downtown urban sub-markets, consistent with 2019. Only 12% of Essex’s portfolio is concentrated in downtown urban sub-markets. We estimate the demand, supply ratio in our markets, assuming it takes two new jobs to absorb each new home, to be 1.7 times, meaning demand is continuing to exceed supply across our West Coast markets. Lastly, we continue to drive our vision of optimizing our portfolio’s performance through our strategic tech investments, various platform initiatives, and asset optimization through data science and analytics. Recently, we implemented a new lead management system in our call center, and plan to roll it out to the communities this year. Also in the pipeline is our plan to upgrade 20,000 units for smart home technology and rollout our mobile maintenance platform 2.0 across the company. Shifting now to an update on our market. In Seattle, our same store revenues in the fourth quarter were led by Seattle CBD with 5.4% year-over-year growth, while other Seattle sub-markets grew between 4.4% and 5%. On jobs, Seattle remains the strongest major U.S. market for job growth in the fourth quarter, growing 3.3% year-over-year. This growth was mainly due to an additional 32,000 jobs in the top four paying industries, a 57% increase from the prior year. Regarding major tax activity in the market in recent years, Amazon has committed to a sizable footprint of nearly 3 million square feet in Bellevue area while recently putting up 770,000 square feet for sublease in Seattle. Although we are seeing some local geographic movement, several other major tech companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook have recently expanded their footprints in Seattle. As mentioned on a prior call, Apple announced it would expand its Seattle workforce by more than 2,000 employees by 2022, a significant increase from its current census of 450 employees. Other activity in Seattle includes, Airbnb expanding by 60,000 square feet and Bank of America committing to 116,000 square feet of Amazon sublease. On the other side of Lake Washington in Bellevue, Facebook preleased an additional 325,000 square while of Alibaba expanded their footprint by 50,000 square feet. Office supply and demand is strong in the market with over 9 million square feet of office space under construction, 79% of which is preleased. Multifamily supply in Seattle was down substantially in the fourth quarter and we expect it to decline about 30% in 2020 from 2019. Combination of strong income and job growth as well as declining supply is leading to tight market rental condition. Moving to Northern California. Year-over-year same-store revenues in the fourth quarter were led by San Francisco achieving 5.4% growth, followed closely by San Mateo 5.2%, Santa Clara at 4.6% and Alameda at 4%. Job growth from the Bay Area averaged 2.6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland grew at 3%, 2.9% and 1.8% respectively. The Bay Area continues to maintain higher job growth in top paying industries compared to the bottom paying industries. Office expansion in the Bay Area remained robust in the fourth quarter. This includes biotech expansion activity, about 540,000 square feet made up of Amgen’s new lease in down town San Francisco and Zymergen’s new lease Emeryville. In the South Bay, Google expanded by over 800,000 square feet adding a new lease Sunnyvale, in addition to acquiring a trio of Cisco buildings in San Jose. Airbnb grew their South Bay footprint by signing a 300,000 square foot lease in Santa Clara. There is currently over 15 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, over 70% of which is preleased. Looking at 2020 multifamily deliveries in the Bay Area, San Francisco deliveries are expected to be slightly higher than in 2019, most of which is concentrated in downtown San Francisco and San Mateo. San Jose is expected to see twice as many deliveries in 2020 than in 2019. And in Oakland supply deliveries will remain elevated in the broader market throughout 2020 with significant supply continuing to be delivered into downtown Oakland, while Fremont will get an influx, half of which will be for sale condo. Heading further south to Southern California. Year-over-year, same-store L.A. County revenues for the fourth quarter were up 3.5%, led by Woodland Hills with 5.5%, West L.A. with 3.7%, and the Tri-City submarket with 3.7%. The L.A. CBD submarket continues to decline with revenues down 1.6%. L.A. job growth in the fourth quarter was 1.5%, 10 basis points above the U.S. average. On supply, we estimate consistently high deliveries throughout 2020 in L.A. County. Deliveries in the L.A. CBD submarket are expected to remain high at 4% of stock, but down materially year-over-year. Our West L.A. and Woodland Hills submarkets will see more new supply in 2020. Moving down to Orange County. Year-over-year fourth quarter revenues were up 4.2% in the South Orange submarket and 3.1% in the North Orange submarket. Total 2020 supply in Orange County and San Diego remain consistent with 2019. However, deliveries in both counties are expected to decelerate through the year. Lastly, in San Diego, our year-over-year fourth quarter revenues were up 2.8%, led by the Oceanside submarket with 4.9%, followed by Chula Vista with 4% and North City with 3.3%. Job growth for the period was a healthy 2.3% year-over-year, led by professional business services, which made up almost a quarter of the growth. Apple made progress on their plans to grow the footprint in the San Diego market by pre-leasing 200,000 square feet of office space in the Sorrento Valley. Our Q1 renewals have been sent out at about 4.4% and our portfolio is currently at 97.2% physical occupancy with our availability 30 days out at 3.9%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I will start by providing some color on our 2020 guidance, followed by an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. The key assumptions for our 2020 guidance are available on page five of our earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We're guiding to a midpoint of 3.1% for same-property revenue and NOI growth this year. Overall, operating fundamentals in our markets remain healthy, as we continue to assume steady market rent growth, near the long-term averages and for our West Coast market to continue to outperform the U.S. average. Compared to 2019, we're expressing a modest acceleration in Seattle and a slight deceleration in California, largely attributed to demand and supply trends commented earlier. Moving on to the core FFO guidance. We are expecting a growth rate of 4.2% at the midpoint in 2020. As discussed in our previous call, we have a short-term headwind from the repayment of a highly accretive mortgage-backed security, which generated a 17% internal rate of return for Essex shareholders. The lost income from this investment accounts for approximately $0.18 of headwind in 2020 or 1.3% of our 2020 FFO growth, and mostly explains the sequential decline in core FFO between our fourth quarter results and the first quarter forecast. Our 2020 guidance also includes the recent acquisition of a 45% joint venture partner's interest in a $1 billion portfolio. We expect to recognize a $6.4 million promote from this transaction as well as a remeasurement gain in excess of $225 million, which incorporates small impairments of $18 million recognized in the fourth quarter. This gain and promote will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 and both are excluded from core FFO. We remain committed to our co-investment platform as it provides for an alternative source of capital and an attractive risk-adjusted return for investors. Over the past three years, we have generated incremental earnings for our shareholders from promote income totaling approximately $66 million. Lastly, on capital markets activities. In the fourth quarter, we issued $150 million 10-year unsecured bond at an effective 2.8% interest rate, prepaid several mortgages with 2020 maturities. Consequently, we only have $280 million of maturities to refinance this year. We continue to maintain our discipline to optimize our cost of capital and will remain thoughtful and opportunistic. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong with over $800 million of available liquidity. That concludes my prepared comments. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. With the move to a high occupancy strategy, what are you guys assuming for blended lease rate spreads for 2020? And then, could you also tell us what the spreads look like for the fourth quarter of 2019?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John speaking. So, the -- going forward, what we're looking at in guidance again is 3.1%, and that's really made up of about 1% -- or sorry, 3% rent growth as we have on our S-16, as well as some other income. When you say the blended, it would blend to that. We pretty much do not push our renewals above the market. We keep them consistent with the market, so they really run together. And that keeps it simple and it keeps it focused on the customer experience, which is critically important.
Austin Wurschmidt: And so, what is that blended number versus what it was in '19?
John Burkart: Sure. So, in 2019, all in, obviously our revenue came in at about 4% for the fourth quarter, 3.4% for the year. And that was really about 3.2% scheduled rent, which would be the blended number and the remaining amount relates to other income items.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thanks for that. And then, just curious what led CPPIB wanting to really dissolve that -- the venture and what opportunity set do you see across those six communities?
Angela Kleiman: Hi. It's Angela here. We have an excellent relationship with our JV partners. And the exit really relates to the timing of the investment. These properties were formed as individual joint ventures, and most of them were formed back around 2010. So, at this point, we're near that 10-year term. And so, it made sense to have a discussion for the exit. And so, going forward, we actually have continued to have active conversations about future opportunities as they come up. But, as you know, we decide to put an asset or investment in joint venture, it's really driven by a function of trying to optimize the cost of capital. So, it depends on where the stock is trading, where the asset sales are coming in, et cetera.
Austin Wurschmidt: Did you consider I guess, selling outright, or was the plan all along really to buy out their interest?
Angela Kleiman: Well, you see that we actually sold one of the assets in joint venture in the fourth quarter as well, and that was Masso. And so, and that was a very attractive sub-4 cap rate sale. And so, we do evaluate whether it makes sense to bring it on this wholly owned, or really what's the best return for our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb, Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: So, just following up on Austin's question on the CPPIB. Can you just provide a little bit more color on funding? Was there anything transacted or was it sort of an even trade? And then, two Angela, what the benefit is for 2020? Obviously, you guys are working hard to backfill that CMO. So, just curious how much this played a role in providing an FFO assist for 2020?
Angela Kleiman: Alex, I'll talk about the funding and then Mike will chime in on the overall strategy. On the funding, we use our line of credit to bridge the closing, but our intent is to finance -- refinance with long-term debt. And on the equity portion, now since the portfolio is actually unlevered, we won't need to raise as much equity to be leverage neutral. So, this will allow us to be opportunistic in our equity issuance or we may sell assets depending on market conditions.
Michael Schall: Yes. And Alex, I'll just add real quickly. Keep in mind that we had a promote, which is noted in the press release. And we also have the different tax base than what the tax base would be at market. And therefore, our yield is a little bit higher. And that helps make these transactions attractive to us.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Maybe I missed it. Did you provide what benefit this is on an FFO?
Angela Kleiman: It's incorporated into our guidance. And so, if you look at our -- we have a line on accretion from external activities. That does include the CPP transaction among others.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then, second question is, Mike, your favorite topic, regulation and taxation. So, with all the fun of Prop 10 2.0, Prop 13 split roll. Maybe you can just address your thoughts on what you guys see the Governor in Sacramento as far as increased taxation, if they do the split roll? And then, how you think the Prop 10 2.0 is shaking out at this point?
Michael Schall: Yes. Alex, I think it's a good question, and it came up very early in the call today, so all good. So, as I probably reported recently or actually last -- late last year, there were 18 bills that were signed by Governor, some dealing with housing. The biggest one was 1482, which is a statewide rent control initiative. Following up on that, there's been some pretty big allocations of funding for housing, $1.75 billion last year and $500 million that has been discussed as part of the ‘20 to 2021 budget. And so, I think that the political environment here is to try to wait and see what happens with these large investments and with 1482 as opposed to go to the ballot box and try to create a whole different scenario with Prop 10 2.0. So, I think that the politics for the matter are the legislature has acted and the state is funding, the housing shortage issue to a pretty substantial extent. And let those things run the course. So, that's what we hope happens. Obviously, Prop 10 2.0, they submitted around 950,000 signatures in December. We're still waiting to see if the ballot qualifies. I'd say that compared to the first go round, obviously, we're early innings. And so, the proposal has not received a great deal of attention at this point in time. And as I go back to think about Prop 10, the early polling was that it would pass. And that was noted obviously throughout the investment community. And it was in fact overwhelmingly defeated in the end. And even though this current proposal is a little bit more palatable to the owners, I still think that it will be difficult to pass. And by that or in support of that, I would suspect that it will be an ongoing discussion, and we will have an entity that will essentially commit to a robust opposition to Prop 10 2.0. And, again, given the outcome of the last go round, I expect it will be successful once again.
Operator: Our next question is from Shirley Wu, Bank of America.
Shirley Wu: So, my first question is for John. So, as you go into this new first half of the year with more downtown supply, and you're really focusing on that occupancy. I just kind of wanted to get this sense of in terms of cadence of that 10 basis points of occupancy headwind, how's that going, how do you anticipate that to play out through ‘20? Is it going to be pretty much an equal spread, or is it going to see more deceleration in the first half first versus the second?
John Burkart: Well, good question. So, let me step back a little bit and explain the occupancy or why we made an adjustment. We take a lot of effort, a lot of effort in understanding supply in the marketplace. And of course, we know from history that seasonally demand slows down in the fourth quarter and first quarter. So, as we ended up the third quarter, we held out as long as possible. And then, we rapidly made some changes to increase occupancy, getting ready for what we saw as a little bit of market disruption and most certainly in Northern California where the supply was going to hit the market during this lower demand period. As we continue through into the -- in the first quarter now, we're still at good occupancy. And we expect to most likely carry that occupancy, but the reason why we did it is to put ourselves in a position of strength, so we don't have to. So, we if we start to see some isolated pockets of lower pricing, we may hold back and allow a little bit of occupancy to go down a little bit. So, we've positioned ourselves well, remembering, every time we lock in a lease at the beginning of the year, it impacts the entire year of course, 12 months. So, we're really got -- have our position -- ourselves positioned strong. All that said, I expect our occupancy will be higher in Q1, it'll go down in Q2 and Q3 and then pick back up in Q4. Does that answer your question?
Shirley Wu: Yes. That's extremely helpful. For my second question, Angela. So, previously you did mention the earlier redemption, which played out in 4Q. So, I was just kind of curious, is there still that expectation for more deals in your portfolio to be redeemed early or are those mostly done so far? And in terms of pipeline what's in the works to backfill from those deals?
Angela Kleiman: Hey, Shirley, that’s a good question. We do expect heavier redemptions in 2020. And I think you may recall that that we have talked about carefully, investments tend to have a three-year life and sometimes they get extended longer, which is terrific. And so, the redemption timing can be lumpy. So, as for 2020, the redemption outside of the mortgage backed security investment, and so on the preferred equity event, it's about $145 million. And it's -- between the first half and the second half, it's pretty even and maybe a little bit heavier in the second half. And of course, you have -- there's probably somewhere around 110ish. So, that's the cadence. As far as the pipeline, Adam will chime in on that.
Adam Berry: Yes. Shirley, this is Adam. We're pursuing and underwriting several deals in parallel at this point on the pref equity side. These deals inherently have a long lead times, just like any development deal. So, when they actually come to fruition, it can always be an unknown. But, we are pursuing many and have quite a few in the pipeline.
Angela Kleiman: Yes. And Shirley, you may recall, we have a guidance between $50 million to $100 million, so it’s 75 midpoint. So that's a good number too for modeling purposes. And then, the one thing I'll add is really the timing of the funding because they do lag a little bit. And so, you want to layer that consideration.
Operator: Our next question is from Nicholas Joseph, Citi. Please proceed.
Nicholas Joseph: You highlighted the decrease in permit in your markets? But given the current pipeline and the tight construction environment that you talked about, when do you expect the actual benefit from the decline in terms of delivery? 
Michael Schall: Yes. Hey, Nick. It's Mike Schall. I think that when we look at permits, you're looking a few years out, and there is a natural lag there. So, connecting the drop in permits over the last couple of years, I think we're still looking down the road in terms of when that actually comes out. Keep in mind that California, unlike many places around the nation, has a much longer period as you go through the permitting process and delivery process. And I think that's complicated to some extent by the lack of -- or the tight labor markets in construction in terms of getting things finalized and moving ahead. So, I'd say, we're looking beyond 2021 to really see a significant impact.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then, maybe following up on Shirley's question, and I think in your prepared remarks you talked about continuing to pursue development but seeing better risk adjusted return with preferred equities and the other structured investments. Obviously, you can get a better return from those, but there's a difference in duration and length of investments. So, how do you think about the size of both of those and the stickiness of the cash flows?
Michael Schall: Yes. I'll start big picture. And then, Adam can take it from there. Generally speaking, it's a risk reward equation. And we will do direct development. And I would say more to bottom of the cycle, because conditions at the bottom of the cycle are typically better. And by that, I mean, there's less pressure on construction costs. The cities are more receptive to development because they're trying to keep their construction labor force at work. And so, they're more willing to permit. [Ph] As you go through the cycle, more and more impediments. And I can use a variety of examples for that public artwork projects that are part of your deal, more difficulty in getting the phasing or temporary certificates of occupancy, et cetera. So, the headwinds become more substantial. And so, within the preferred equity, I mean, we’re looking at the same deals we otherwise could do as a direct developer. But, we are looking at that risk reward continuum. And we're saying, all things being equal, let's do acquisitions and preferred equity as opposed to more direct development. So, having said that, I'll turn it over to Adam, because he has been pretty active at looking at development deals. And it's not that we are -- and actually he's found a couple that he likes. So, we're looking at those. We just try to make good decisions and certainly be aware we are in am cycle, and again, construction cost increases and all the other related factors come into play. Adam, do you want to add to that?
Adam Berry: Briefly, yes. I mean, we continue to underwrite and track all the land deals throughout our markets. Unfortunately though, given dramatic increases that we're seeing in construction costs relative to where NOI growth has been, we just -- we've been able to see this real time through our prep equity program. Generally speaking, we aren't seeing the necessary yield premium to really pursue the majority of the development deals out there. As Mike mentioned, there are some that fit into that parameter and provide the adequate risk adjusted return, but for the most part deals are tough to pencil right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Just two questions, kind of both Seattle related. You guys spoke pretty positively about job growth out there, the strength that you're seeing. I think, you mentioned supply was going to be coming down. When I look at your 2020 outlook, you've only got at the midpoint about a 20 basis-point acceleration in revenue growth in Seattle. I'm just wondering, the commentary would suggest maybe the market is a bit stronger than that. So, I'm just trying to figure out -- are you just trying to be a little cautious here? Is there something that keeps you more or less flattish, or how do we sort of interpret that?
Michael Schall: Sure. That's a fair question. And at this point in time, you're right, Seattle is doing really terrific. Its rents are roughly 5% up year-over-year. At the same time, the unemployment is very low. It's 1.7% in that zone. So, we do expect the employment growth rate to slow down, and that's partly driving it. We are showing in our S-16, employment slowing down pretty significantly across the board, still staying 50 basis points over the U.S. over the U.S. average for the Essex portfolio, but slowing down because of the low unemployment. And Seattle has the lowest unemployment of all the areas. So, that's the scenario that we have out there. At this point in time, obviously employment is beating that expectation, and we'd love to see that continue.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. And then, I guess as kind of the other side on the expenses, clearly, you had very low expense growth in Seattle. I know there were some kind of tax benefits, real estate tax benefits you got. Can you just sort of remind us of the aggregate benefit in 2019 from that that kind of acts as maybe a headwind on the expense side in 2020?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. It's a good question there. On the Seattle property tax, it was an interesting year in 2019, in that our property tax bill actually came in lower than 2018, and it was all driven by assessment bills. And so, what that means is definitely from a year-over-year perspective, we have challenges on the comp. In terms of how we think about Seattle property tax, because it's not -- it’s one of those things -- those numbers are just not as [indiscernible]. So, in 2019 it was 3% lower than the prior year from the assessment. But the five years before that those increases were in between 13% to 17%. So, in 2020, what we try to do is kind of thread the needle and looking at like a base run rate of 6% and then you add into it the refunds. We're looking at kind of low single digits, the 8, 9% for Seattle property tax increase. 
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Malkin: Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm not sure if you answered Austin’s question in the beginning in terms of the new and renewals that you had in 4Q. But just curious as what you're kind of seeing in January for new and renewals, and what occupancy stands at for the portfolio today.
Michael Schall: Yes, sure. So, let me go back to make sure I answer that. I may have missed that. So, in the fourth quarter, new rents were about 2.2%, renewals were about 3.5%. And really, the bigger difference was in Northern Cal where the supply was coming into the market. Going forward, in the first quarter, I'll answer a question on renewals, they went out at about 4.4%. Today market rents are a 2% to 3% up year-over-year. And that's really a factor of where the slow demand period. So again, it always is a little bit of wonky in December and January. We expect us to -- we expect to achieve the market rents we have laid out in our S-16. And of course the strongest market as I already mentioned is Seattle.
Neil Malkin: Right. And then, what’s occupancy?
Michael Schall: Occupancy is 97.2.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. And then, next one, preferred investments obviously you've highlighted is what you guys are choosing to do in terms of capital allocation. Just curious on either the current book or the ones you're underwriting, is there an option, are you trying to get options to actually roll your preferred into equity or essentially take ownership of those deals when they complete, or is the financing market just too easy for the developer to sort of get permanent financing?
Adam Berry: So, this is Adam. We look at it several ways. I'd say the most basic kind of down the middle of the fairway, pref deal is going to be paid off after a certain period of time, whether it be two, three years. We do however -- with every deal, we have that conversation where there are potential hybrids, where there is that potential to convert into equity. And it is on a deal by deal basis. And we're seeing probably a little more of that opportunity now given where we are in the cycle.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson, SMBC. Please proceed with your question. 
Rich Anderson: So, on the MAA call this morning, they kind of outlined a sort of a silver lining in the supply that the rents are 25% above their in place rents. And so, it's an opportunity for them to deploy some redevelopments on. And so, a little bit of a good and a bad situation. Do you see a similar dynamic in your markets, considering you also are sort of B, B plus type of product? Is the incoming new supply, while problematic, provides some opportunities for you to redevelop and sort of find that middle ground between what's being delivered and where your market - where your rents are today?
Michael Schall: Yes, Rich. It's a good question. And I'll start and lateral to John after that. I guess, from our perspective, you can't produce a B. So, there -- and therefore all the supply is in the A category. So, the closer you are to the A, the more impacted you are by the concession environments and the new delivery. So, in addition to that, you have this -- where's the supply going, which tends to be more urban downtown as opposed to suburban. So, all of these things are factored into that equation. And I think that we are seeing the best opportunities to redevelopment -- to redevelop in the suburban B markets. And so, I would suspect that that will continue. John, anything I missed there?
John Burkart: Yes. No, I think you picked it up.
Rich Anderson: Great. And then, second question, perhaps for anyone. But, any comment on Park Merced? I know you know were gathering that years ago and not this time with AIMCO jumping in. I’m curious if you took a hard look at it, soft look at it, not looked at it at all? Anything, any kind of color would be interesting.
Michael Schall: Yes, Rich. This is Mike again. It was pretty broadly marketed. And so it wasn't as if that was acquired deal. It was marketed around. And when I think about our preferred equity business, we think about really two things. One is, development deals where we're coming in at the last minute, just before start -- just before the start, so we know what the construction costs are. So, we are trying to take that construction cost risk off the table in those deals. And then, we also will do preferred equity on stabilized portfolio, which actually was the first go round that we had with Park Merced when we - as you alluded to, we had invested in it once before at a much lower value by the way. And so, this transaction is neither of those, because it is looking at the development deals and trying to assess how they might look. And so, it didn't really fit our basic strategy. And, we will from time to time deviate a little bit from our strategy, if we really see a lot of value. But, we just didn't think that was applicable or appropriate this time.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I was wondering on the CPP portfolio, if you could provide some color on where the assets are located? Do they contribute immediately to the same-store pool? Or will it be 24 months from now? And also, how do you think the performance of this portfolio will be on a same-store basis relative to your existing consolidated assets?
Michael Schall: John, so as Angela mentioned, we sold Masso in Q4. So that was in Downtown San Francisco. And so -- and Angela, why don't you take it from here?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. And the rest of the portfolio, it's all throughout Northern California. So we have one in San Mateo, one in Dublin, one in Pleasanton so in the East Bay, and San Jose, and of course, Walnut Creek. So those are the locations, but it's all Northern California. And as you know, we built these and have operated them. So we know the assets very well and certainly like them very much and glad to have all of them into our consolidated portfolio. They will be in the same store next year because, as you may recall, we roll them in, and we'll have one year of comparable results before we add them to the same-store pool.
John Kim: Okay. And can you just remind us why the co-investments generally are accounted for under the equity method when you own, in many cases, 50% or more of the joint venture?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. It's an off-balance sheet because of the control reasons. Our partners have essentially comparable approval authorities on basic items like budgets and financing, and so it's really a technical reason.
John Kim: So is there anything different in asset management that you're going to do as you take these assets under your control?
John Burkart: Yes. This is John speaking. No, not at all, the operationally, asset management-wise, we operate all of our assets consistent -- in the consistent way. Our partnerships, we have great relationships, and we don't have an Essex way and then the other way. It's, I call it, the family, it's all one way. We operate in an integrated approach across the board. So there won't be changes there. We do like the locations of the assets quite a bit. They're in the technology markets that are growing, and we're excited about that. But there's not a change like -- would happen when we're buying an asset from a third party.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hill, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, guys, Mike, maybe I'll start with you. Just wanted to think about the age of your portfolio and sort of the age of your assets within your portfolio? And how that influences your capital allocation decisions to maybe buy some assets and sell others?
Michael Schall: Sure, Rich. Yes, our portfolio, as you note, is a little bit older than other portfolios, and I would attribute most of that to the fact that we produce less than 1% of our stock, of our housing stock per year. And therefore, as you can imagine, over 20 years, you produced less than 20% of your stock, and therefore, 80% of your portfolio is more than 20 years old. So just a fact of life, and we think that this is a very good thing that we don't produce a lot of housing in general. And so I think it's just -- that is the nature of our markets, and we are a reflection of our markets. In terms of opportunity, again, I would say, you can't build a B. And therefore, you see less competition. And so I'd say, generally speaking, at the early part of the cycle, maybe the As outperform the Bs, synergy up later on in the cycle, the Bs outperform the A, so all of those broader themes are out there. And then I would also say that as the A product becomes more luxury oriented, it opens the door toward very thoughtful redevelopment programs where we can add value. And add a yield that is higher than the cap rate and benefit both from the growth embedded in the redevelopment program and the increase in the value of the portfolio when you cap it out. So it's kind of all those things.
Rich Hill: Got it. That's helpful, Mike. John, quick question for you. Look, we definitely agree that there's not enough supply of apartments relative to demand, sort of, picking back up for what Mike said. And so look, I think a lot of the questions on this call have been about supply, which is obviously a near-term consideration. But we've always thought demand and job growth is a big long-term driver over the medium to long term. So I was wondering if you could just maybe take a step back and help us think about what are you looking for in your West Coast markets where demand could accelerate to the upside? And maybe what makes you -- would leave you a little bit more cautious?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. What we see right now is, as I mentioned, we have great demand in the Seattle area. And that combination with the great demand and the decline in supply is tightening up the rental market quite a bit, that's terrific. As it relates to cautious, it gets back to just the temporary impact, the disruptive impact of the supply entering the market. And that, again, is largely located around the downtown locations. There's some level of that certainly in L.A., although L.A. is getting a little bit better, a little bit less supply than last year, still downtown L.A. is problematic. Oakland to some extent, but of course, Oakland is -- you have to understand Oakland. It fits into the broader Bay Area. And so whereas L.A., downtown L.A., sits there in its own market. Oakland is really interrelated to San Francisco because people take BART across. So you have to look at the demand in a broader area there. But it's the supply that causes some concern, and it's temporary as you noted. Does that answer your question?
Rich Hill: Yes. Yes, yes, it does. It sounds like what you're saying is that the demand side of the equation remains very, very strong. And although, tech is diversifying across the United States, tech remains very strong and the economies you operate in are quite diverse.
John Burkart: That's true. And I would say with the tech, it is -- it does -- it is going across the U.S., but the headquarters are still here and the highest paying jobs are still here. So it's -- they're doing a natural thing as far as taking more of the back office and moving that out and then taking other components of the business, but the creative design, the top-notch aspect of the tech, really still located in West Coast. You find that in each of the different companies that are out here, the major companies. And so it's that and the incomes that are tied to that, which really drives income growth, and that is certainly beneficial.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Guinee, Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
John Guinee: Great. Just building on the current discussion, the great affordability migration is alive and well, and although you have a really good property tax-driven competitive advantage in your markets and with an ability to really grow outsized FFO. Any chance you would ever look at the higher-growth markets, whether it's Denver, Phoenix, Austin, Portland, places like that?
Michael Schall: John, its Mike. Well, we've been in Portland before and exited Portland and we do look at it from time to time. It's definitely on our list. Portland, the reason why we exited is because they had an urban growth boundary that they essentially kept expanding, and we convinced ourselves it was not supply constrained. So I guess it depends on what housing and how these markets adjust. So in our experience, it's not just the apartment supply, but relatively inexpensive single-family housing meant that essentially as soon as rents get to a certain level, people go, you know what, I don't need to pay this rent anymore. I'll just go and buy a house. And so we look at that dynamic of what we charge for rent and what the comparable house and how difficult it is for our renter base to be diluted by homeownership. And so if we could find markets that satisfy and that look appealing from both those perspectives, good job growth and the overall amount of supply is somewhat limited and the transition from a renter to a homeowner is somewhat limited. We think that, that is a good market. Practically speaking, and we go through this process with our Board every year in terms of current markets and other possible markets. So Portland is definitely on that list. And there are some other markets that are on the list as well. Generally speaking, they are the more supply constrained markets.
Operator: Our next question is from Hardik Goel, Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hardik Goel: As I look at your guidance, your same-store revenue guidance, just focusing on Northern California. That range of 2.6% to [3.6%]. Can you give me some color around what has to happen in the market for 2.6% to be achieved? And then what has to happen for 3.6% to be achieved? What are the scenarios there?
John Burkart: Well, it really revolves around supply of new homes and then demand and that interaction. The -- we obviously believe we're going to hit the midpoint, that is the probable target. But the impact, the disruptive impact of supply coming into the market in Q1 could negatively impact things. Again, at that point, you're locking in rents, lower rents possibly, for a longer period of time for the year. On the other side, if supply gets delayed and it moves into the higher demand season, Q2, Q3, that's beneficial. So it's a range we expect to hit the midpoint. We knew there's enough supply\/demand dynamics going into this. But if they move around a little bit on us, that will adjust that. Does that make sense?
Hardik Goel: No, it does. And just as a quick follow-up, I noticed you guys are going to be planning on being net acquirers and you discussed why with your cost of capital. Just the type of product you're looking to buy, is it going to be more of selling older stuff that others see us value-added and buying recently built stuff? What is kind of the niche there that you're targeting?
Adam Berry: Okay. So on the dispo side, this is Adam. On the dispo side, we're going to target the assets that have been slower growing within the portfolio in order to maximize our overall portfolio growth. On the acquisition side -- on the disposition side, our target is between $100 million and $300 million. As you noted, we expect to be net acquirers this year. And again, we're looking at just increasing shareholder return overall. So we're going to be looking at our higher growth markets. And as Mike alluded to earlier in the call, we're going to be looking at that probably A- to B category, the brand-new stuff, as we've seen over the last few years, given whereabout the supply is coming, that product has not grown nearly as well as the Bs.
Hardik Goel: Got it. And then are there plans to renovate something when you buy it? Or is this something you like to look for something that's already -- that doesn't need any incremental capital?
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. Yes, we do just about everything. So if it needs a renovation plan, we will build that into the pro forma. And if it's in good quality shape, we will look at that as well. I mean we're really sort of agnostic as to where the property is from, again, that, let's say, the B- to A level, it's all about growth as Adam suggested. And if that growth comes from redevelopment, we're happy with that. If it comes from us understanding the market and growth rate a little bit better than everyone else, so be it. Again, we're totally focused on what is the return of what we're buying versus -- compared to the portfolio as a whole. And that's how we make those decisions.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski, Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Just one question for me. John, you mentioned there is a 40 bps lift to other income this quarter, largely due to lease break fees. It's a lot larger than the last several years in the fourth quarter. So just curious, what's driving the outsized lease break fees right now?
John Burkart: Yes. Lease break was one component, it's the biggest component and I called that out. There was other items as well. But yes, what was driving the lease breaks really relates to the supply that was coming into the market in Q4. And again, that goes back to our decision as we saw that the supply was going to start hitting the market, and we filled up or increased occupancy. We did anticipate this type of thing to happen. But you go into the low demand period. The concessions start to increase at the new supply, and you get to about eight weeks free in some cases, and people will break their lease and transfer. So that's what was driving it.
Michael Schall: Actually, John, I can add that the move out to purchased homes was -- has recovered a lot and was at 12.1% in Q4, a little bit higher than it's been in the recent past.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stevenson, Janney. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon. Mike, does the continued legislative environment and ballot initiatives in California make condo projects any more attractive in certain submarkets? And any chance we see some of the under-construction apartment projects go condo before leasing?
Michael Schall: Yes. And that is a good question. One of the conundrums that we've experienced over the last several years, as we bought many failed condo buildings in the last cycle, and we had hoped to convert them back to condos and sell them at a lower cap rate than we could otherwise sell apartments. We have not found that that's the case at all. In fact, if anything has gone the other way, we've produced more rental housing, much more rental housing than we have for sale housing, and that's been an ongoing dynamic. So we haven't seen that spread that we had hoped for in purchasing a condo versus an apartment value, and which of course is what triggers tha . And with the recent past increases in the price of the single-family home being in the minus 3, I think in San Jose to about 1% in the best of our locations. It hasn't helped that condo versus apartment valuation.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then I think I heard you guys say that the negative impact of 1482 is 10 basis points in 2020. Given your supply issue commentary, do you guys really have that many units where you'd be raising rents by more than 5% plus inflation this year if you could?
John Burkart: Yes. So we are -- this is John. Where that negative impact comes, it hits the revenue. It really relates to short-term rentals and the premium associated with that. And so oftentimes, at the end of a lease, we will always give our customers the options they want. And on the short -- if they want a shorter-term option, there's a premium related to that, and 1482 restricts that premium, and so that's where the 10 basis point headwind comes from.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And does 1482 restrict fees for like parking and other stuff? And is it based on gross or net effective rents. In other words, most of the apartment REITs are operating on an effective rent basis, does 1482 lead you to offer a higher face rent and then use concessions to get to essentially a market rate level? Or does the legislation see through that game?
Angela Kleiman: That's a great question. And like a lot of legislation, things aren't always spelled out as much as we would all like. So that's not necessarily contemplated in the legislation. My sense is that it will get addressed in the courts. But it's really focused on rental revenue and not other revenue. But as far as the details of that, I think it will get resolved somewhere in the future.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And so there's no clarification right now whether or not it applies the face rents or net effective?
Michael Schall: We interpret it as being applied to face rents.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. So if a unit was renting -- if market rent was $1,000 for 12 months, you guys could theoretically raise that rent to 1,200 and offer two months free, and be in the same place economically and have ability to have more greater rent growth in the 5% plus inflation by just discounting less?
Michael Schall: Yes. I mean, first, let's go back a step. So the 1482 really impacts renewals, right? When a unit goes vacant, it's the market rent. So at the end of the lease period, we typically and the residents typically respond to direct renewal. There's not generally concessions in there. And we are not anticipating going that direction.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Just curious, given your sub-50% turnover, and it keeps heading south every year, whether or not you get into a situation where you actually are going to need at some point greater turnover.
Michael Schall: Yes. No, I mean, frankly, I love the fact that we have lower turnover. I think it's reflective of quality of service out of the assets as well as being fair. We meet the market. We're not trying to push rents beyond the market. We're fair in how we price things. And again, I think that the site teams are doing a terrific job. So I think the lower turnover is reflective of that. I'm not sure it's going to go much lower than that. It -- there's a natural need for people to move.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Schall for closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming Citibank Conference. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-26 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mike Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Mike Schall: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments before we open the call to Q&A. I will begin by highlighting that our third quarter results exceeded our expectations. Core FFO per share for the quarter was $0.04 better than the midpoint of our guidance, which represents 6.3% growth compared to the third quarter of 2018. We are pleased to raise our full year core FFO guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint. This is the third time this year we've increased our core FFO per share guidance, which is attributable to a solid summer leasing season, dramatically improved cost of capital compared to the start of the year and continued execution by the Essex team. John and Angela will provide more details about the quarter and the increase to our full year guidance in their remarks. Turning to our expectations for 2020 rent growth in the West Coast markets. We have continued our practice of providing our baseline and key budgeting assumptions on Page S-16 of the supplemental. This is intended to be a scenario based on macro level forecasts, such as U.S. GDP and job growth that we obtained from third-party sources. Key to this scenario is our ground-up research on apartment supply throughout the Essex metros. In recent years, apartment supply has become more concentrated in California's urban areas, resulting in periods of high rental concessions that often substantially impact submarket pricing power.  Therefore, apartment supply estimates are more important than ever, and our delay adjusted supply estimates for 2019 have proven invaluable in targeting acquisitions and dispositions. Overall, we expect 2020 to look much like 2019, representing the continuation of rental growth near long-term averages. Overall, we expect market rents in the Essex targeted areas to grow an average of 3% compared to 3.1% in our S-16 forecast a year ago. Once again, we expect very tight labor market conditions, exemplified by a very low unemployment rate of 3.3% as of August 2019.  This is down 20 basis points from a year ago and is expected to slightly reduce job growth for 2020 compared to 2019. The tech market should continue to significantly outpace the nation with 2% job growth expected in Northern California and 2.4% in Seattle. Our outlook for supply in 2020 contemplates similar apartment supply deliveries compared to 2019 for a total of around 35,000 apartments in the Essex metros, with meaningful variations in certain markets, including lower apartment supply in Seattle and Orange County and higher supply in Oakland and San Jose. There are several positive factors and confirming indicators that impact our 2020 forecast. Tight labor markets may constrained job growth, but they also push incomes higher. While higher wages will pressure operating expenses, they will also help relieve pressure on the housing affordability issue that has constrained growth rates for the past several years. We have added Slides S-16.1 to the supplemental this quarter to demonstrate the historical context for the West Coast superior income and job growth compared to the rest of the country. Income growth in Essex markets has outpaced the nation by 12 percentage points on a cumulative basis this decade and has accelerated in the past several years. Office development continues to expand at a healthy pace. All of our markets are building out new office space to accommodate strong demand. Seattle and the Bay Area currently have 19 million square feet of office space under development or nearly 4% of existing inventory, which compares to national average offers, office growth of just 2%. Each of our markets had very strong office pre-leasing and solid absorption in the third quarter as well as positive rent growth compared to 1 year ago, with San Jose and Seattle office rents up 11% and 5%, respectively. Hiring at the top 10 tech firms, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, continues to be very strong. These companies currently have 25,000 job openings in California and Washington, up 19% as compared to the third quarter of 2018. Amazon's job openings in Washington are up 52% compared with 1 year ago. And it's also notable that Facebook now has over 5,000 employees in the Seattle market, while Google and Apple are also expanding rapidly in South Lake Union. Turning to the transaction market and acquisition activity. We transitioned from being a net seller of property in 2018 to a net buyer in 2019 given a dramatic improvement in our cost of capital throughout the year. As a result, we are pleased to have exceeded the high end of our acquisition guidance range this year, with $660 million of acquisition deals closed through September 30, and we expect to remain active for the remainder of the year. The acquisition market has become increasingly competitive as positive leverage is a powerful force for multifamily housing.  The higher demand for apartments has been accompanied by more property being marketed. In late 2018 and early 2019, there was a slight upward pressure on cap rates, and this trend has reversed with cap rates down about 10 to 20 basis points. We believe that we added value by reacting quickly to changing market conditions. In terms of cap rates, recent activity indicates that A properties in A locations typically trade between a 3.9% and 4.1% cap rate with B properties in B locations trading 20 to 30 basis points wider.  We remain selective in this environment, and we will, and we have significant advantages, including great research, strong relationships and track record and a robust balance sheet with ample liquidity. As noted on previous calls, we continue to favor preferred equity investments over direct development primarily because yields are compressing given that construction cost increases have exceeded rental and NOI growth rates for the past several years represent a significant headwind to direct development. Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on the passage of California's Assembly Bill 1482, 1 of 18 housing-related bills that were signed into law by Governor Newsom earlier this month. Most of these new laws are expected to remove barriers to build more housing, incentivize affordable housing and fund housing production. AB 1482 will generally cap rent increases to CPI plus 5% and is intended as an anti-gouging measure. At Essex, we've had a longstanding practice of limiting renewal rents to 10% and do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our results. With rent regulation a recurring theme amongst legislatures across the country, we remain committed to California and will continue to advocate for smart housing policies. With that, I'll turn the call over to our COO, John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Q3 was a good quarter for Essex. Overall, our markets follow the historical seasonal pattern with the market rents peaking in early August, a little later than normal. As a result, we continue to favor achieving market rents over higher occupancy, taking advantage of the strong market conditions to lock in higher rents into September, allowing our same-store portfolio occupancy to dip to 95.8% or 60 basis points below September 2018. This strategy enabled us to increase year-over-year scheduled rent by 3.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year's period. For comparison, year-over-year scheduled rent growth in the third quarter of 2018 was 2.5%. This 100 basis point increase sets us up in a better position going forward. Our total same-store market rents were up 3.4% year-over-year in the third quarter over the prior year's period. Revenues for the same period grew 3.1% with financial occupancy of 96%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year's period. On a trailing 12-month basis, portfolio turnover rate was 46.3% through September. This is a 200 basis point decrease from the prior year's period. Finally, we continue to be on pace to achieve the 3.3% midpoint of our full year 2019 same-store revenue guidance. On supply, multifamily supply growth as a percent of stock is projected to be 120 basis points higher in downtown urban submarkets during 2020 at 2% versus suburban markets at 80 basis points. Concentrated downtown urban supply is a consistent theme in this cycle in the West Coast markets. Looking forward, we continue to be excited about the various platform initiatives that we are working on, including our new CRM that we're collaboratively designing with a third-party vendor, our mobile maintenance platform 2.0 as well as our smart units and many other initiatives.  We are tracking over 40 separate initiatives or workflows, all directed at improving the customer and/or employee experience as well as leveraging technology to reduce labor. The initiatives are at various stages in our process from design or proof-of-concept to pilot to rollout, and their impact will be felt over the next 1 to 3 years. Turning now to an update on our markets. In Seattle, our same-store market rents were up 5.2% year-over-year in the third quarter. Submarket revenues for the same period grew at 4.7% in the Seattle CBD, 3.7% in the East side and an average of 4.7% in the North and South. Seattle MD remained the strongest major U.S. market for job growth in the third quarter, growing 3.4% year-over-year, with the top 4 paying industries adding over 30,000 jobs, a 60% increase from the prior year. Along these lines, major tech company expansion was healthy with Amazon job openings remaining around 11,000 for 3 consecutive quarters, while Facebook continues to expand in the market. With multifamily supply forecasted to decrease about 25% in the second half of this year, the Seattle market is benefiting from the delivery slowdown. Moving to Northern California, same-store market rents were up 3.9% year-over-year in the third quarter. Revenues for the same period were led by San Francisco achieving 6.4% growth; followed by Santa Clara at 3.6%; Alameda at 3.4%; Contra Costa at 2.9%; and San Mateo achieving 2.5%. We continued our 3 lease-ups to Bay Area. Mylo is now 27.3% leased, offering 6 weeks concessions. Station Park Green Phase 2 is now 63.3% leased, offering 4 to 8 weeks concessions. And we started lease-up of 500 Folsom, now 10.8% leased, offering 4 to 8 weeks concessions. Regarding Mylo, the Santa Clara market is very strong. We have the asset 28.2% pre-leased in mid-August prior to units becoming available. However, as a result of construction delays, we lost several leases. Job growth in the Bay Area averaged 2.7% year-over-year for the third quarter. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland grew at 3.3%, 2.8% and 2%, respectively, with all 3 markets seeing the largest gains in professional business services. Tech expansion activity was robust in the South space, mainly attributed to Google's acquisitions activity, including 16 acres of land in Sunnyvale, 56 properties near San Jose's Diridon Station and an additional 1.3 million square feet of office space in the submarket. Looking at multifam supply in Northern California. The deliveries are heavily weighted toward the second half of this year with double the number of units coming online compared to the first half of this year. As a result of the increase in supply during the seasonally low demand period, we expect the Bay Area market to be choppy for the next 2 quarters with isolated buckets of weakness from the supplies. Heading further down south, same-store market rents in the region were up 2.3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Job growth in our SoCal markets averaged 1.2% in the same period, L.A. at 1.2%, Orange County at 1.1% and San Diego at 1.9%. L.A. County revenues for the third quarter were up 2.7% led by Woodland Hills with 4.6%, West L.A. with 3.3% and the Tri-City submarket with 2.7%. As expected, L.A. CBD declined by 3.6% as the submarket continues to feel the impact of concentrated supply in the downtown urban area with stabilized comps offering up to 8 weeks concessions on new leases. In Orange County, year-over-year third quarter revenues were up 2.7% in the South Orange submarket and 1.4% in the North Orange submarket.  Lastly, in San Diego, our year-over-year third quarter revenues were up 2.3% led by the Oceanside submarket with 3.5%, followed by North City with 2.1% and Chula Vista with 1.9%. As the market enters a seasonally slower demand period, which is usually the fourth and first quarters of the year, we have adjusted our approach to favor occupancy. Our Q1 renewals have been sent out at about 4.5% and our portfolio is currently at 97.2% physical occupancy with our availability 30 days out at 3.5%. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I will start with a brief overview of our third quarter results and the increase to our full year guidance and provide an update on our structured finance investments and balance sheet activities. Beginning with our third quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded the midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance by $0.04. This was primarily driven by investment activities and low interest expense, including favorable refinancing and higher capitalized interest from development delays. Following these results, we are raising our full year core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 to $13.33 at the midpoint, representing a 6% year-over-year growth.  The revised guidance range assumes we sell a large urban asset in Northern California in the fourth quarter, which is owned in our co-investment platform at a 55% pro rata share. The sale of this property will take us to the low end of our full year disposition guidance range in the low $300 million. Turning to our structured finance investment activities. The recent decline in interest rates in a strong transaction market have enabled developers to either refinance or sell their development projects. As a result, there has been an increase in early redemptions of our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments. During the third quarter, we have $31 million of early redemptions, and we currently anticipate an additional $110 million of redemptions in the fourth quarter. As we maintain an active pipeline, we plan to reinvest the proceeds from these early redemptions and achieve comparable yields. But until the reinvested proceeds are fully funded, there will be an impact to core FFO on a temporary basis. In addition, during the fourth quarter, our investment in a collateralized mortgage obligation, which was originated back in 2010 for $70 million, will mature. As a result, we expect to receive a payment of approximately $80 million. This investment has been highly profitable for our shareholders, earning around a 470% return over a whole period. It is another good example of our opportunistic approach to investing.  However, replicating this investment in today's low environment, low rate environment will be challenging and will lead to an estimated FFO per share headwind of $0.14 to $0.18 in 2020, subject to reinvestment yield and timing. Lastly, on capital markets activity, we also took advantage of the decline in interest rates to issue $550 million of unsecured bonds in the third and fourth quarter with a coupon of 3%. The majority of this debt is being used to repay secured debt maturing in 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider our refinancing alternatives to optimize our cost of capital. This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: First question is really around Prop. 10, 2.0. And I guess, since the initial Prop. 10 vote in 2018, other than AB 1482 getting passed, I was just curious what else has changed in your mind that could potentially swing the vote in 2020 in your view.
Mike Schall: Okay, Austin, it's Mike. Yes, we certainly hope that we would not be following up on Prop. 10 this quickly, but here we are. So to the contrary, actually, we are hoping that the bills passed would be given time to work. And so anyway, what's happening currently is signature gathering is ongoing for the proposition. They're somewhere around 600,000 signatures. They probably need around 900,000 signatures in order to get rid of the duplicates and unregistered voters, et cetera. So they still have a ways to go. As you know, we've kept our Californian for Responsible Housing entity in place that was used as part of the Prop. 10 battle, and we're just starting to focus on the proposal. But I would say, remember that Costa Hawkins Prop. 10 was overwhelmingly defeated in 2018, a lost in all but 1 county in California. It was a decisive victory. And again, I think the politics are a little bit different this time in that the, I think the Governor and legislature would like have some time for the existing bills to work before going to the ballot box. So I think it's still too early to tell exactly what's going to happen, but we are definitely focused on it. And we're organized and ready to fight it as needed.
Austin Wurschmidt: But would you say anything sentiment-wise from the voters that either changes to the proposed bill or something amongst, I guess, just voters in general that they're taking a different view because we all know that it obviously was voted down pretty significantly in 2018?
Mike Schall: Yes. So I think that there have been some changes that make it more palatable to voters, but again, less palatable in another sense. So it exempts individuals that own 2 homes or less, for example, from the provisions. But then again, there is a vacancy control element, which I think will be viewed as being undesirable. So I think that there are offsetting pieces there. And again, I think the politics are very different this time because, as you'll recall, with respect to Prop. 10, the Democrat party endorsed it. I think that's very unlikely this time. So we still think that it doesn't get supported and will be voted down. But again, it's a little bit early to come to that conclusion, I guess.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Appreciate that. And then I know you said there's not a material impact from AB 1482. Was just wondering if you could put a finer point on that and what the impact to 2019 same-store revenue growth would have been if we were looking at that being implemented Jan 1 of this year.
John Burkart: Yes, this is John. The, again, from Essex's perspective, for years, we have done a couple of things. One, we self-imposed rent caps, which are relatively consistent with 1482. And number two is we typically, we always focus on the market and we try to bring the renewals slightly below or at market. So we're not really ahead of the market with our renewals. So with that said and the fact that rents are growing roughly 3% a year, it probably would not have had a material effect on '19 and nor will it on '20. The types of issues that you can run into is if you're pushing ahead of the market or, so there is a little bit of friction as it relates to the term. Sometimes, shorter-term leases get some price premiums, but we have relatively few of those. So I don't see it having really a material impact on our business, but we'll obviously include whatever that will be in our guidance when we issue that next quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I was wondering on the CPI with 5% rent cap, what do you think that will have as far as impacts on your renewal rates and your same-store results?
Mike Schall: Yes. John, I think John will probably want to add to this. We run our renewals and new leases, new lease rates at pretty similar numbers for the September '19 year-over-year. New was 3.1% and renewals 4% overall for the company. So because of that, again, as John said, we don't see it having a huge impact on our portfolio. John, do you want to add to that?
John Burkart: Yes. No, I mean that answers that. Again, it's the way we operate, it's, again, consistent with how we've operated for years with self-imposed caps, with how we look at the market and how we look at our renewals with respect to the marketplace. So yes, again, I do not see a material impact. There may be minor impacts as it relates to terms and how we adjust, and we're working through all that right now, but it's just really not a material impact.
John Kim: Okay. And then my second question is on now being that acquirer with the cost of capital getting more attractive, are there any major underwriting assumptions that you're doing differently this time that you, that you're taking now versus before? And can you update us on where you see the best return as far as acquisitions, preferred investments and development?
Mike Schall: Sure, John. This is Mike. In terms of underwriting, we look at things much like we have in the past. We will look at every transaction based on the submarket rent growth. And again, our research department ranks our submarkets by 4-year rent growth divided into 30 submarkets. And so we're trying to invest in the top performing submarkets from a rent growth perspective over that period of time. So that's how we do that. And we'll call the portfolio with respect to the bottom part of that hierarchy. And in terms of best overall performance, I think that on acquisitions, we look at it relative to the portfolio.  So in other words, what are the returns that are available in the private markets versus what other, what returns are implied in the stock and try to understand how we create value, how we can create core FFO per share and NAV per share growth. Both of those metrics are the key to what we, how we look at an acquisition and then, of course, whether we use on balance sheet sources of money versus our co-investment program. So all these factors go into how we underwrite a transaction and how we approach it and really no different from before.
Operator: Our next question is from Trent Trujilio with Scotiabank.
Trent Trujillo: On your 2020, I guess, preliminary outlook there, the job growth forecast for Southern California looks to be basically a continuation of what we've seen year-to-date. And now as you look at your markets and think about you seem to do a deep dive into office space requirements, tech growth, VC funding and other factors, would you say that Southern California job growth has a higher likelihood to surprise the upside or downside than what you put in that forecast?
Mike Schall: It's a good question. I wish I have that answer. And it would, if I did have that answer, it might influence what we, what our decision-making is, but we tend to gravitate. At this point in time, if you look at the top part of our portfolio from a growth perspective, it still remains the North and the tech markets. Although definitely, Southern California is betting, benefiting from some of the tech companies moving operations to Southern California. I think Seattle is benefiting more from that trend out of the Bay Area, but Southern California definitely will get some advantage. As in Southern California, it's been in this low 1% range for several years. And so to bet that it's going to move a lot is probably unlikely, I would guess. It's a huge, it's the, the largest part of our portfolio. It's a huge amount of people and jobs.  And so it's hard to make that work. It's a more diversified economy, more reflective of the United States. And so practically speaking, I think that the job forecast is not going to vary by a whole lot. If you look at this past year, we said, originally, Southern California a year, going to a year ago, the '19 forecast. Southern California would be at 1.3%, and we had Northern California at 2%. So we've done quite a bit better in Northern California. It's currently at about 2.7%, and Seattle has done a lot better. So it's really been driven by the tech markets. And so I think our view is ride that tech wave. And we think Northern California and Seattle are the best way to do that.
Trent Trujillo: Appreciate the color on that. And then looking at your development schedule, I noticed that Station Park Green Phase III looks, it's nearly complete and yet construction cost went up about $10 million or $58,000 a unit versus last quarter. Can you talk about that a little bit more and maybe provide some context to why that is and how that's perhaps affecting your view of future development starts?
Mike Schall: Well, yes. We, I've commented actually in the script and many times before about this difficulty of direct development in that construction costs are growing much faster than rents, and it's compressing development yields. And as you see us go from Phase 3 to Phase 4, you see the cost go up pretty significantly. Again, as it relates to Phase III, specifically, it's caused by shortages of labor and longer periods that the building that's under construction and similar type problems. And so again, this is, I'd like to say that we're different from the comments that we make about direct development, but we are part of that world. And so you're seeing the outcome.
Operator: Our next question is from Shirley Wu with Bank of America.
Shirley Wu: So my first question has to do with the supply that you've seen in '19. So in your '19 forecast, you guys forecasted around 35,700 units coming online in '19. So I was curious about the slippage that you do anticipate going into '20 and what submarkets those were, are probably going to be in.
Mike Schall: Yes, Shirley. This is Mike. Yes, there are some nuances here. As to '19, we were actually very close. If we go back to our original expectations for 2019, we're still very close to that number. So I give our research department great credit for doing the, such a good job building the supply pipeline up and being pretty accurate. There was, there have been some delays that were a little bit greater than what is implied on our forecast, but it's really been something that has added a lot of value. What will change between '19 and '20 is the sort of the cadence of the supply delivery. So in 2019, in Q1 and Q2, we had roughly 16,000 units delivered out of the 35,000 total. In 2020, that will go to about 19,000.  So we're actually projecting that Q4 2019 is the peak on a quarterly basis to supply. So even though it looks like it's the same number year-over-year, the reality is that it's peaking now and will decline throughout 2020. This will have an impact on pricing in that we will have more supply deliveries in the first and second quarter, which, obviously, are more impactful to our 2020 guidance. And, but again, as we've noted on, in our presentation at the BAML meeting, overall, we hit the peak on building permits in a couple, a year or 2 ago. And so we're now down about 13% from that number. So we think that we get the peak of supply as to permits. We think that we'd hit the peak as to deliveries in Q4 2019, and it looks like we get better as the year goes on in 2020.
Shirley Wu: Great. So then I guess, just to follow-up on that. Your strategy going into the early '20 would be to keep occupancy and to pull back a little bit on rates then.
John Burkart: Our strategy going forward, you're saying. Yes, as I mentioned in my remarks upfront, our portfolio right now is at a 97.2% occupancy, and that was very purposeful. We held out, benefiting from the stronger peak leasing season and the peak in rents, which was later this year, again, another good thing that we benefited from. But then we rapidly repositioned the portfolio, recognizing the supply that's coming at us.  So yes, we will hold out higher supply, but, I'm sorry, higher occupancy, but more than that, we positioned our portfolio, which will enable us to avoid some of the lows. When I say choppy, what I mean is, occasionally, people start pricing units down too aggressively. And if we're in a good position like we are in right now, we'll have the ability to hold back, wait a week and hold back and let things clear up and then lease our units. So I do expect our occupancy to come down some from the 97.2%, but we'll generally favor occupancy for the next couple of quarters, for sure.
Shirley Wu: Got it. So my next question is on expenses. So year-to-date, your expenses are up 3%., but you maintained expenses at 2% to 2.4%. So I guess, how should we think about the rest of the year with just the different buckets in expenses and admin and R&M was a little bit higher for the quarter as well?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. Shirley, it's Angela here. On the expenses side, it's tough to look at quarterly run rate and then try to assume what that means because expenses are, by nature, very lumpy. And you'll see that last year, our expenses ran higher in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, whereas this year, it's a little bit more throughout the year. And when we set our expense planning with the team, what we don't do is we don't focus on when they're going to execute certain expense items. It's really whenever it makes sense for them to do so and if there's a good window to do so. And so at the end of the day, you'll see that lumpiness and it's probably going to continue. Having said that, we are expecting to come in, in our guidance range, and we are on plan as far as the expenses are concerned.
Operator: And our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nick Joseph: I appreciate the color on the operating strategy. And sorry, if I missed it, but what's the current loss to lease for the entire portfolio versus this time last year?
John Burkart: Sure. Let me start. The loss to lease is obviously a function of the market rent versus scheduled rent. And so as I mentioned, we had a phenomenal year this year, increasing our scheduled rent 3.5%. So we took a lot of the rent that was available in the marketplace, the 0.5%. So we took a lot of the rent that was available in the marketplace. And then we also held out longer for adjusting our portfolio, which meant, that said, our numbers are 90 basis points for September of '19 versus 150 basis points for September of '18. But again, because of these adjustments, a better way to look at it is really recognizing that the, if we average August and September together for both years, they come up actually equal. So we're about in the same spot as we were last year, but we drove more money down to the bottom line because of the market conditions and how we played it. Does that answer your question?
Nick Joseph: It does. That's very helpful. And then Mike, maybe just on the transaction market. For assets broadly that are impacted by 1482, what do you think the cap rate impact could be going forward?
Mike Schall: It's a good question, Nick. For sure. I don't think it's going to have a huge impact because as long as CPI plus 5% is somewhere around 8%., the market is not underwriting 8% rent growth. And so you may have some years that you're coming out of a recession, for example, where you might be constrained by those current parameters. But I think the marketplace is underwriting longer-term rents. I know everyone on the call looks at things much shorter term, the markets take the longer view. And you don't get anywhere near CPI plus 5% in terms of long-term rent growth. So I think it will have relatively small impact on transaction values.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: I wanted to come back to the supply comments just for a moment and really ask 2 questions. First, and foremost, just so I'm clear, it sounds like supply has just been pushed out a little bit into 2H. 4Q '19 is the peak and that will still have some ripple effects through 1Q and 2Q. But once we get past that, if I'm thinking about this correctly, we should finally be past the supply. Am I thinking about that correctly?
Mike Schall: This is Mike, and we don't have our numbers for 2021 yet, so flying blind a little bit, but I definitely agree with what you're suggesting. We think that the peaks have been had with respect to permits, and we're starting to see it on the deliveries. And so I think it will level off at a level that will be quite a bit below the 35,000, but there's still plenty of interest in development. So we're not saying it's going to a nominal amount. We're just suggesting it will trend down. And I think it continues into 2021.
Rich Hill: Yes. Helpful. And I want to come back to your comment about plenty of interest in development. And Mike, I just want to play devil's advocate here for a second. You've noted that interest rates have really helped your acquisition volumes, and there's a tremendous amount of negative yielding, fixed income, debt globally, by our count, around $15 trillion. Is there any scenario where development yield, or do development suddenly begins to reaccelerate because development yields actually look really compelling on a relative basis, particularly in markets like San Francisco?
Mike Schall: Yes. I mean, definitely, I think that, that could happen. It tends not to happen later on in the economic cycle because you have things that pull against you. Labor shortages cause construction cost increases to be very large. And that is a top-of-the-market phenomena, generally now bottom of the market phenomena. For your assets and rents are at pretty high levels. So compare it to the 2012 to 2016 period where we were growing same-property revenue, an average of 7% per year, that's not likely to happen at the top of the cycle given the constraint of rent to income and affordability.  And so we try to triangulate this stuff pretty carefully. And what we've thought is, as I said in the prepared remarks, preferred equity is a better way to approach that because we're coming in late in the process. We're coming in at the point the construction begins. The costs are known. The bank financing is in place, et cetera. And similar to one of the deals that we did a couple of years ago, Century Towers, where we would take both an ownership position in a development deal, as well as a preferred equity piece. So we would consider doing that. But the point is we want to come in late in the cycle and, because that's where you get better growth and cities generally are more agreeable to helping make development work. And just the whole scenario is better.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Rob Stevenson: Mike, of your 3 acquisitions this quarter, it looks like 2 JVs and 1 wholly owned. How do you guys think about how much more aggressive you can bid for deals in a 50% JV with the various fees and promotes than you'd be comfortable bidding for a wholly owned asset? I mean, does the 50% JV structure allow you to bid 25 basis points lower, 50 basis points? How meaningful is that gap when you're able to bring the co-invest program to bear?
Mike Schall: Yes, it's a good question. Actually, the, we have a partner on the other side. And if we're going to pursue something, which will generally be the larger transactions in a joint venture mode. We're working with them on these scenarios. We generally have a sort of an internal benchmark sensitivity analysis as to whether it's more beneficial for us to be in a JV format or on balance sheet. And essentially, over time, we go back and forth in terms of, depending upon the cost of capital and the impacts on core FFO per share and NAV per share.  So we're constantly changing the mix. And, but I would say, we're not trying to push the pricing because if we start pushing the pricing, guess what, we start affecting future deals. And so we want to buy properties that we think are well suited, well located at an attractive yield, a yield that works, it adds value both from a core FFO and an NAV per share basis and not influence the market. So that's our basic program. It really hasn't changed a lot. And I cringe a little bit about the thought of, oh gee, we should bid more because we can bid more. We really try to avoid that.
Rob Stevenson: But there has to be some sort of gap there, right? I mean whatever it is, because, otherwise, at this point in the cycle, given your $20-some-billion entity and opportunities are more scarcely capital for you, you do them all on balance sheet, right?
Mike Schall: Well, no, not really, actually. So in the sensitivity analysis that I was talking about, we need a certain premium to NAV in order to utilize our balance sheet as opposed to a joint venture transaction. So just working through the math on these things. And so right now, our preference, strong preference is to use joint ventures. You will notice that we did do one deal on balance sheet, but it was a relatively small deal township, and it, that was driven more by the size of the deal rather than its overall impact.  So that's how we look at it. Again, it's not in our best interest, I don't think, to try to push the market cap rates down. We want cap rates to remain as high as possible. So, and then it's really the other way around. Our transaction people try to find high-quality deals in markets that are going to grow and then we try to find the best capital to fund that deal. So the transaction comes first. The capital decision comes second.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then second question. Year-to-date, average monthly rental growth in the same-store portfolio was 3.4%. How much are you seeing expansion in fee growth in the same-store portfolio, pets, parking, trash, et cetera, and how we sort of reached the point, not only in your portfolio, but it is an industry when you're sort of maxed out on the fees, you can charge the residents that you're already charging $4,500 a month for rent?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. The fee part of it is running just slightly in front of the base rental revenue at this point in time. But that said, there's a level of change that's going on within the different line items. For example, you have cable and you have the cable cutting, so that's going down. At the same time, parking is going up. And then there's few other line items that are moving, where pets is fairly flat. So I think longer term, there'll be some opportunities. I had mentioned a while ago, we were working with, renting some of our amenity space to nonresidents.  And at the same time, I commented that immediately, 2 of our peers picked up, that off the call and with our same vendors. So we're pretty quiet about the details that we have going on but, going forward at least. But I do think there will be some level of opportunity with that. The big thing though always is rents. And Essex has always been focused on our assets, on our locations, on our research, and that will always be the number 1 most important aspect of Essex. But we do try to enhance our returns wherever possible.
Rob Stevenson: And how meaningful are the overall fees or whatever you're calling fees out of the revenue standpoint these days?
John Burkart: You're talking a few percent.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Mike, on the rent regulation, on AB 1482, and then you got Prop. 10 2.0, I thought that part of 1482 superseded whatever local towns wanted to do. So what would overturning, and maybe that's not correct, but what would overturning Costa-Hawkins do given the implementation of 1482?
Mike Schall: Yes, Alex. Actually, 1482 does not affect what current rent control regulations that are in place. So it sits separately from that. So those regulations remain in place.
Alexander Goldfarb: Right. I didn't mean overrule the current regulations. I thought it governs stuff going forward. Is that not the case?
Mike Schall: Well, you have Costa-Hawkins out there, that's a statewide law. You have 1482, that's statewide law. And then you have the local regulations. And maybe I'm not understanding your question. But each of them sit as a separate entity, and they, one does not supersede or overrule the next. They, you have to comply with each of them. Does that make sense?
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes. No, Mike, that absolutely does. That absolutely does. And then the second thing is, Angela, you mentioned the $0.14 to $0.18 of headwind. And I think, if I heard correctly, that was from the early repayments that you got in third Q and that you're expecting in 4Q. So maybe just a question of how quickly do you think you can put that to work. And then, Mike, you spoke about the competition or what's going on in your preference for the developer equity. But clearly, others, your peers are getting into that business. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how you guys view a deal for income versus underwrite a deal that you may actually want to own the asset at the end.
Angela Kleiman: Alex, on the structural finance and, comments, let me just make sure I clarify. So on the early redemption of, that's coming toward us in Q4 of $110 million, that does not relate to the $0.14 to $0.18 headwind for next year because we do expect to backfill those prefer equity investments. So the question really is there will be some headwind because as these deals get backfilled, they don't fund immediately. They tend to take up to 6 months to fund. And so that's one item, and I don't have a specific number for that at this point in time. But I highlighted the 14 to 16, I mean, $0.14 to $0.18 because that's more meaningful from a single investment, and that relates to the CMO that we originated back in 2010. So it's separate from the preferred equity. And that's a onetime item for that instrument.
Mike Schall: And then, Alex, I'll try to hit the second part of your question. So when we realized that there definitely is more competition for preferred equity, that's definitely a true statement. We feel pretty good about the relationships that we have formed, and a number of our relationships have come back for a second transaction. And so we feel pretty good, and we feel like we have an advantage there relative to others. We're a known quantity. We've been in the business a long time.  We have great construction lending relationships that we can marry with our preferred equity, et cetera. And we've always tried, and I've commented on this on the call, too, to leverage those preferred equity investments into other types of relationships, either by trying to get an option to buy at the end. And we generally don't get an option to buy primarily because the developer thinks it's worth a lot more than we do at the end of the construction period. So that's been a headwind. So you end up, you would take a much lower yield and then have an average transaction at the end. That's not attractive to us.  We do have a seat at the table. There have been several of these transactions that we've either purchased at the end or purchased shortly after construction completion and/or converted to a longer-term, lower preferred interest that keeps us in the capital structure. Again, as I said in my comments, one of the, there are a couple of opportunities to do some direct development, and this would be one of them, which is marrying our preferred equity with a direct ownership interest in the deal, where we're coming in, again, later on in the process.  So we continue to look for ways to leverage the preferred equity into other types of transactions. And for whatever reason, this whole series of refinances, I think we looked at a couple of those deals, refinances and sales Angela referred to in the comments, looked at some of those deals. But a number of them, we did not, we just went on and sold the property and/or we didn't want them. So again, I think that preferred equity keeps us in the hunt from a variety of perspectives, and it's worthwhile and it's also great financially.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Really just one question, Mike. As you sort of think about AB 1482 and some of the other potential legislative changes, has it sort of altered your investment strategy as it relates to submarkets, age of assets, types of buildings that you're willing to buy? And conversely, is it impacting how you think about the portfolio and what you might want to sell going forward?
Mike Schall: Yes. Steve, good to hear your voice. It does, to some extent, I guess, beginning at the, a couple of years ago when this risk was increasing, looking at our portfolio from the perspective of the cities that have really horrible rent control, rent control that basically shuts down new development. It was essentially fixed by Costa-Hawkins in that Costa-Hawkins prohibited pernicious forms of rent control to older property in effect. So I'd say we have been more cautious with respect to those cities.  They'd be basically San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Monica, et cetera. But beyond that, I think that the discussion in California has become a pretty balanced discussion in that it's not just about protecting the renter, which is obviously important, and it's why 1482 was a bill that the California Apartment Association did not oppose, but at the same time, don't change the ability or the attractiveness of developing more housing because there's an enormous shortage in California, estimated by one study at 3.5 million homes and probably getting much worse.  That was as of 2015. It's probably gotten worse since then. And maybe another way of looking at it is, I think, in this cycle, we produced about 5x more jobs than homes created in the Essex markets. So 270,000 jobs to 55,000 homes. So the housing shortage is getting worse, not better. And the last thing we need is to shut down the development pipeline. So I guess we view 1482 as a balanced proposal. We view the amendment of Costa-Hawkins as essentially an anti-growth, very unbalanced proposal. And so that's how we look at it. So I guess it would change it in a couple of very specific areas in terms of where we want to own property, but it hasn't had a huge impact on the overall company.
Operator: Our next question is from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.
Hardik Goel: I've got 2 for you today. The first one, on supply, just to understand your thinking here. I acknowledge permits are down 13% over the last 12 months in our markets. But if I look at the pipeline of units that have been started, that pipeline, whenever it's slated to be delivered, if I just add up all those that have started, that's 5x what's been completed over the last 12 months. So even if I assume like a really high abandonment rate or I assume a lot of it is delayed, it seems like it's a multiyear supply pressure kind of thing that's maybe either in late 2021. Is that consistent with what you're seeing? How would you think about that?
Mike Schall: Yes. No, it's not at all consistent with what we're seeing. I mean here's the problem. I mean the data vendors have a very difficult time trying to weed out which projects are shown 3 different times: by name, by location, by, and you really need to sort through that data and really understand where it is in the process. I know there are a lot of metros in the U.S. that you can take a permit and/or a start and you can go out 24 months and you have an apartment building. It just doesn't work out here. And so you really have to be involved in a more fundamental level, driving the assets, understanding what they look like, where they are in the development process in order to get a good estimate what's going to be produced.  So, because for 2020, if it's not under construction right now, it's not going to deliver in 2020. So I think we know, again, 50 units and more is what we do, but we send our people out and they drive the buildings because we view supply as being a critical thing. Supply used to be more scattered around, throughout our marketplaces. It's become much more concentrated. And as a result, we have to understand it much better than we have in the past. And so that's why we spend a lot of time on it, getting that right. So we feel very comfortable in our 2020 numbers. And yes, sorry about the basic data that's out there. It's tough to follow.
Hardik Goel: No, that's really helpful. And I completely agree to 2020 kind of outlook. It's just hard to see through to 2021. And just to follow up on what you just said, what does that pipeline number look like in terms of, I mean you said it takes so much longer to build in California. That must mean that if you look at what's under construction right now, you can see through the visibility is higher for 2021 as well, right?
Mike Schall: Yes, you're right. Yes, you are right. We just haven't focused on 2021 yet. So we'll get there. We'll be talking about 2021 next year. I don't have that information right now. I'm sure it exists within Essex. I just don't have it right now. And I suspect that, again, as you go through 2020, you have a pretty significant drop-off. You start with 10,000 units in Q1 and you have somewhere around 7,000, 8,000 units in Q4. So that drop-off is definitely there. But I just don't have the next steps in front of me, and I don't want to make it up.
Hardik Goel: Sure. And just lastly, if you could share the new and renewal for the quarter, just those spreads.
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. So for the quarter, our new leases were, on average, the, here we go, sorry, 3.4% and the renewals going out in the fourth quarter, 4.5% on average. The actual achieved for the third quarter was 4.2%.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Mike, the acquisitions this year have been focused in Northern California. Can we expect the Northern California bias to continue next year if your cost of capital stays advantageous?
Mike Schall: It's a good question, John. The pipeline right now is pretty heavily weighted in Northern California and for, maybe to add a little bit of color to that, we see this rent-to-income ratio at about 103%. So incomes have done really well in Northern California, and so that becomes less of a constraint. And Southern California has not really kept up to that number. But we hope that we can also buy in Seattle. So those 2 markets would be our focus. But we might buy an asset or 2 in Southern California as well.
John Pawlowski: Okay. John, could you help us quantify a bit the choppiness you're referring to in Northern California that you expect over the next few quarters and just be a bit more specific? If, so for instance, if Northern California today, on average, is printing 3.5% revenue growth, if choppiness hits, what does that trajectory of revenue growth look like this time next year?
John Burkart: Sure. So the choppiness really relates to what's going on with market rents at any point in time, not necessarily revenue. There's a difference, obviously. That, in part, was why strategically we filled the portfolio up to 97.2% and are in a good position going forward. So what I'm expecting the, as I mentioned, in Northern California specifically, the supply is twice as much in the second half of this year, '19, as it was in the first half. And unfortunately, that's coming at a time when demand is seasonally slower or lower. So that will impact market rents, and it will largely emanate around where the supply is being delivered.  So you can, you can imagine, in places like downtown Oakland, where there's a little bit more supply, there will be an impact. But in the sense of revenues, we're obviously not giving out next year's guidance, but we're reaffirming this year's guidance. And it really, I don't see it having a huge impact on us because we positioned ourselves well to avoid that. I think there'll be some headlines of rents being down. But again, I use the word choppy because it's not that they're going to be down long term. You got to step back for a second and realize the Bay Area is a very strong market, has very strong job growth. There's supply that's coming into it. Big picture is under 1%. So we're in a good spot. It's just going to create some headlines of lower rents for the quarter and probably into the first quarter of next year, and that's what I'm really referring to.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Understood. Just a follow-up there. One submarket that stood out within that broader healthy backdrop this quarter was San Mateo and just in terms of the sequential trends. Anything specific there on the demand side that you're seeing outside of lumpy supply hitting?
John Burkart: Yes. No, that one is really a market that the results there for the quarter for San Mateo are really a result of the market being strong. And what I mean by that, actually, it's a very strong market. And I think our own ops team got over there. Skis on that a little bit. And so we had a vacancy decline of over 200 basis points in that market, which is what drove that number. But that's obviously resolved. So it was really the function of the market being so strong. They got, I think, a little bit overconfident with that particular market.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC.
RichAnderson: 15 minutes before the call starts, this is what I get. An hour and 10 minutes in. So thanks for sticking around. But I do want to ask a couple of, so when I think of the Essex perhaps of old, you're always kind of at least a couple of hundred basis points better than the national average from a same-store growth perspective. And you're kind of more, by your standard, more pedestrian type of internal growth today. Is it all entirely this concentration of supply issue? Or are there other dynamics, perhaps on the demand side, that have changed such that kind of a return of Essex as being this premium growth provider are perhaps gone for a while?
Mike Schall: It's a good question, Rich. Appreciate it. I'd say every economy, every recovery period is a little bit different. And so there is no one size fits all. And there will be times when we, I think, pretty significantly outperform. And this business is one, I think reasonable people would agree, that rents and incomes have to grow pretty close to one another over long periods of time. And so, but this cycle, I think, is somewhat different. And I said earlier, from 2012 to 2016, rents grew. Our same-property revenue grew 7% a year. And that was much faster than incomes. And therefore, we created an affordability issue, which we are now mending. And it is getting better. So we see, I don't think anything has changed. I think we are in the markets that generate the highest CAGRs of rent growth over long periods of time. And certainly, this cycle seems to be pretty strong. We got a lot more, a lot better rent growth for a long period of time, which I think everyone has forgotten. But it's set up this affordability issue, and we're working through that. And you know what, we've made progress, a lot of progress. So from, as I mentioned before, from 2010 to 2015, rents outgrew incomes by about 220%. If you look at that number from 2010 to 2019, rents outgrew income by about 30%. So it's getting tighter. And we are solving that affordability problem, and there will be a point down the road where rents will do better.
Rich Anderson: Okay. That's great color. And then very early on in the call, you mentioned how supply is really concentrated in the urban areas, which you generally are not. And I'm curious if you've been able to quantify how well Essex has done relative to your urban counterparts from an internal growth perspective. Is there a number that you track to see how you're doing purely on that, using that supply observation?
Mike Schall: Yes. This is Mike again. I think that there are just fundamental differences between us and the competitive set. And I think one of the key differences is that we, our focus is core FFO per share growth and NAV per share growth. It really is not tied to the same-property metrics that are quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. And why does that matter? Why would it disconnect? Well, it would disconnect to the extent that you make investments in property or you overinvest in property, for example, which use capital dollars. And yes, it will push up your same-property revenue growth, but it doesn't actually add value on a bottom line basis. So when you look at large capital investments, capital investments that have relatively short duration income, we're less excited about that.  We are interested when we do renovation projects, for example. We're looking for a long-term return consistent with real estate. And there's lots of things that can be done, investing in personal property, shorter-term, revenue-generating type proposals that can make those numbers look better. That's not our focus. Our focus is on growing income and core FFO per share, cash flow over long periods of time. And I think, go look back at the chart, Rich. There, I think the proof is in the detail. There's actually one chart on our, in our presentation that, I think, sums it up, which is we produced a long-term, 25-year CAGR. We've been a public company for 25 years. The CAGR of shareholder return is 16%. I don't think there's a lot of companies that have done that over 25 years.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: I just have 2 questions and 5 follow-ups for each of those questions. The first one is I saw that your notes receivable increased by about $145 million this quarter. Is that a change in classification of that remix that I think you were talking about selling? Or is that something else? Some color on that would be helpful because that's a pretty large amount.
Angela Kleiman: The notes receivable increase on the income line is really because we have 2 bridge loans associated with the acquisitions that we provided to our joint venture. And so those are, once again, temporary in nature, but they do generate some income for a couple of quarters of their outstanding until we secure permanent financing.
Neil Malkin: Okay. I know that a lot of questions have been asked about supply, but some, I'm trying to dig into the data. It looks like the East Bay, San Jose, 2 of your largest markets, supply is expected to, as a percentage of existing stock, should go up by more than double. And even if you assume this double counting phenomenon you're talking about, that would imply that like almost all the products are double counted. So I guess, is it just a gross error in the vendor, like Axiometrics, for example, that is massively overstating the impact? Or any, again, any help there, trying to understand because to me, it seems like you're setting up for a situation like we were a couple of years ago when the Bay Area had rents that fell precipitously due to clusters of supply relative to job growth that was not of the early cycle?
Mike Schall: Yes. I might preface the history with I think you're referring to probably 2015, '16, when the Bay Area slowed pretty dramatically. But again, still very positive. And back to my prior comment that if rents get too far out ahead of incomes, it creates an affordability issue, which is like a constraint. It isn't a supply-demand issue. It's a constraint issue. But people make different decisions like doubling up, tripling up, whatever. And so that becomes a factor. Again, back to this rent to income in Northern California, it's currently at 103% of the long-term historical average, which makes it more affordable than Southern Cal at 109%. And so we think that Northern Cal is essentially fixing that affordability issue faster than everyone else. Our numbers, and again, I can't comment on that, as to the data vendor. And we realize it's challenging to get accurate data with respect to supply. Having said that, as I said previously, we were really accurate in 2019. I give our people a lot of credit for doing the hard work of putting this together. But if I just look big picture at 2020, we expect in Northern California about 72,000 jobs and we are producing about 18,000 total housing units. So 11,000 apartments and 6,400 single-family homes. That relationship is 2:1. So candidly, we need more housing in Northern California, and it doesn't appear that there's a supply-demand issue with respect to that. I mean you would, so I think it looks good. 72,000 jobs should translate to about, demand for about 36,000 homes, total homes, not apartments, so total. And we produce about 18,000. So that still seems to work as far as we're concerned.
Neil Malkin: I hear you on that. I just, like I said, I mean, some of the data providers, they have addresses, names, a lot of details. So I mean it just seems like it's odd that they'd be off by such a large amount. So maybe that's something I can look into more.
Mike Schall: Well, maybe just go back, go back a year and look at what the projections were and then look at what they are now. I mean I think that's probably the best way to do it.
Neil Malkin: All right. And then last one. Short-term rentals are becoming a little bit more talked about. I just wondered, just given the, especially your types of markets, maybe a higher transient or migration-related demographic. Are you, how much, if any, are you looking to put that into your portfolio? Is that something that you're seeing more demand for, more interest in? And if so, what kind of role do you see that playing in your portfolio?
John Burkart: Well, this is John. We are, of course, always looking to figure out how we can maximize the value of the assets. And so we do explore different opportunities and evaluate the impact. What we see oftentimes on, if you're meeting like the overnight type rentals, we see that, that has a negative impact on the quality of life for our customers or other customers and ultimately hurts our overall market, hurts our market rents. At the end of the day, it creates issues there. Having, you can imagine having people coming in with all their overnight stuff through the leasing offices and into the amenity space.  And they have a different frame of mind, a very short-term frame of mind as opposed to the tenants that live there, and it's their home. So we continue to look for opportunities. And there are some situations where that's working, where people are taking a floor or a building and segregating it that way to basically define different spaces. But there are still issues then with the amenities crossing over. So we'll constantly look at that, but I think it's not a huge opportunity at this point in time unless something changes.
Operator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Mike Schall: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for participating on the call today. We hope to see many of you at NAREIT in a few weeks. Have a great day. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-25 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. We welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments before we open the call to Q&A.  Results for the second quarter of 2019 exceeded our expectations with core FFO per share growing 6.1% compared to the second quarter of 2018. We are pleased to raise our full year core FFO guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint, which is attributable to strong operations and improving cost of capital and solid execution from the Essex team. Angela will provide more details about the quarter and the increase to our full year guidance in her remarks. 2019 is playing out mostly as expected with market rents for the Essex metros remaining unchanged at 3.1% as detailed on F-16 of the supplemental, generally the tech markets continue to outperform led by San Francisco and Seattle, while Southern California has lagged expectations. Looking at job growth on Page F-16 San Francisco's estimated job growth was revised upward from 1.7% to 2.6% pushing its estimated 2019 rent growth to 3.5%. As noted last quarter. Southern California job growth had a slow start to the year and has since experienced a modest acceleration. June trailing three month job growth in Southern California was 1.3% equal to our forecast on page F-16. We will briefly comment on several indicators that support our expectation for continued job growth and housing demand, all of which are consistent with our belief that the West Coast vibrant economies remain well positioned for future growth, beginning with office development which continues to perform at a healthy pace and is required for job growth. For the nation, under construction office properties represent 2.1% of existing office stock; within the Essex footprint all counties except Orange and Ventura are producing new office space at a greater pace than the national average. The Bay Area leads the West Coast in office development with over 16 million square feet or 4.9% of stock currently under construction. In Seattle, nearly 5 million square feet of office was under production or 3.3% of stock, not including the planned expansion of the Microsoft campus with an estimated 3 million square feet of office space. We also track the job openings at the top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market. As of June 30, these job openings were up 19% year-over-year and remain near all-time highs since we began tracking the data several years ago. It's worth note mentioning that Amazon continues to actively hire in Washington State where it has approximately 11,500 job openings. Venture capital financing remains at record levels in the Bay Area this past year with about $60 billion committed and the Essex markets accounted for 62% of all US venture capital funding. San Francisco led all US markets in BC funding the past year with almost $42 billion invested followed by Silicon Valley with almost $19 billion invested, the highest levels recorded over the past 20 years. Unparalleled access to skilled workers and growth capital continue to attract entrepreneurs to the West Coast. Recent IPOs Uber, Lyft, Slack and Pinterest should catalyze growth given greater access to capital and improved liquidity, they join other publicly traded tech companies, many of which continue to expand in the Bay Area. Google for example was actively buying or leasing additional office space in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley communities of Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose. In San Mateo County, Facebook and YouTube expanded in San Bruno, Burlingame, and Menlo Park. We believe that a stronger IPO market will likely drive other long-term benefits to the local economies. By one estimate, several recent IPOs have created 6,000 millionaires which will ultimately unlock previously illiquid equity positions. At some point, some of that wealth will likely be redeployed, which will increase consumption and set the stage for new start-ups down the road. A strong labor market, shortages of skilled workers, and low unemployment rates continue to push incomes higher. Essex weighted average unemployment rate was 2.9% as of May and the median household income grew an average of 5.3% in the second quarter. With market rents growing in the 3% range, rental affordability continues to improve in all of our markets. Turning briefly to apartment supply our delay adjusted estimate of around 36,000 apartment deliveries in the Essex markets in 2019 has not changed and we expect a similar level of deliveries in 2020 albeit with some meaningful regional variations. Turning to the investment markets, our outlook has much improved relative to conditions experienced in 2018, significantly lower interest rates and strong equity markets have substantially improved our cost of capital. In 2018 we were a net seller of apartments using the proceeds to reinvest in development, preferred equity and to fund stock repurchases. We are now mostly focused on acquisitions and preferred equity investments. We are pleased to announce another accretive acquisition this quarter, which was a high-quality property in a market we know well. At this point, we hope to exceed the high end of our acquisition guidance range of $400 million. Overall market conditions for acquisitions have not changed much this year despite the dramatic reduction in interest rates. Apartment buyers continue to target value-add opportunities, which results in greater competition for these deals that leads to compression and cap rate spreads between value-add and core properties. Even newer properties are being marketed, with a claim of a value-add component. In this environment, we remain focused on our disciplined underwriting process with market selection and timing our primary concern. Our disposition activity on the other hand will likely end up below the low end of our $300 million to $500 million guidance range given our improved cost of capital. Finally, we note that shortages in the construction labor force continue to cost development delays, both in the Essex pipeline and more broadly. As noted on our prior calls, the combination of long entitlement processes in the coastal markets at a time when construction costs are growing significantly faster than NOI compresses development yields. For these reasons, we continue to believe that preferred equity investments in apartment development deals generally offer superior risk adjusted returns over direct development. That concludes my comments. Overall, we are very pleased with our company's progress year-to-date and wish to thank all of the Essex employees for their hard work. I'll now turn the call over to John.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. We are starting the second half of the year with strong momentum, achieving 3.5% revenue growth in the second quarter. Financial occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.6%, 10 basis points below the prior year's period and 30 basis points less than the first quarter, while market rents were up in Q2, an average of 3.4% over the prior year's period, setting us in a favorable position as we lock down peak market rents. Our turnover in Q2 2019 was 46.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is down 3.2% from the comparable period ending Q2 2018. Although there are some pockets of weakness to supply interest in the local market offering large concessions. The West Coast markets overall are performing above our original expectation, largely driven by better employment growth in the Bay Area. As a result, we are raising our same-store gross revenue guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to a midpoint of 3.3%. I'll note that third-party economic research estimates for Essex market rent growth continues to be inaccurate. For example, one vendor stated that our June 2019 rents were up only 40 basis points over the prior year when in reality, they were up 3.8%. Strategically, we will continue to favor achieving market rents over higher occupancy, taking advantage of the strong market conditions to lock in higher rents. Regarding new multifamily supply, the pace of deliveries in Essex markets remains in line with the delay adjusted forecast we introduced last fall and we are maintaining our estimate of roughly 36,000 apartment units this year, which is consistent with 2018 volumes. Our estimates remain below third-party projections, but we expect additional construction delays in the back half of the year to bring third-party figures down closer to our forecast. Construction remains concentrated in a handful of urban core submarkets led this year by the downtowns of Los Angeles and Oakland. Deliveries also remain elevated in Seattle, but strong job growth is supporting the rapid absorption of new units and we are encouraged that the pace of new deliveries in Seattle is poised to decelerate in 2020. Beyond 2020, we would highlight that new multifamily permits in the Essex markets are down 11% over the past year on a trailing 12-month basis, suggesting that the near-term pace of deliveries represents a plateau followed by gradual deceleration of new supply growth. Moving on to a market update. In Seattle, employment growth continues to outpace the US and other major East Coast markets posting year-over-year growth of 2.9% for the second quarter of 2019. Amazon job openings remain at peak levels while office absorption stored in the second quarter as large deals were delivered and occupied. Each of our four submarkets North, South, Seattle CBD and Eastside performed well, growing revenues between 3.2% and 4.5%. Moving down to Northern California, job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.5% year-over-year in Q2 led by San Francisco at 3.7% growth. As Mike mentioned, the continued expansion in the Bay Area is evident in the recent IPOs of sustained highs in VC funding. In the second quarter, we started two lease-ups. Milo, a 476-unit property in Santa Clara is now 22% pre-leased offering one month free rent. Station Park Green Phase II with 199 units in San Mateo is 24% leased offering concessions up to six weeks. Last, we started pre-leasing 500 Folsom with 537 units in downtown San Francisco scheduled for initial occupancy in the third quarter. Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was strong on the Peninsula submarkets with San Francisco achieving 5.9% cemetery of achieving 4.4% followed by San Jose at 3.9% and Fremont with 3.6%. San Ramon and Oakland CBD came in at 2.4% and 2% growth respectively compared to the prior year's quarter. Continuing South, Southern California continues to perform at the lower end of our markets, largely due to lower employment growth, the region and LA County each achieved 1.3% year-over-year job growth, which is in line with our jobs forecast on Page S-16. Revenue growth in Q2 was led by Woodland Hills with 5.2%, Long Beach with 4.7%, West LA at 4.4% and Tri-Cites with 2.1%. Our LA CBD revenues were down 2.2% due to the impact of the supply with the downtown lease ups offering six to eight weeks free rent plus other incentives, such as free parking. In Orange County, jobs in the second quarter ticked up 1.2% year-over-year. Revenue growth in North Orange submarket achieved 3.3% growth, while the South Orange submarket achieved 1.8% growth over the prior year's quarter. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth in the second quarter was 1.6%, 10 basis points higher than the US, the Oceanside submarket continues to lead the San Diego market in year-over-year revenues achieving 4.8% growth in Q2, followed by North City and Chula Vista submarkets with 3.6% and 2.6% growth respectively. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is 5.2%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO , Angela Kleimen.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll start with a brief review of our second quarter results then focus on the increase to our full year guidance. Beginning with the second quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a core FFO per share of $3.33 which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.1%. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance and represents an $0.11 beat to the midpoint, the key components of this out-performance are as follows, $0.03 from same property revenues, $0.03 from lower interest expense, non-same-store revenue and other miscellaneous items, and $0.05 from property tax savings and refunds primarily from lower Seattle millage rates for 2019. This is contrary to our experience from the past several years, where our Seattle property tax increase had been in the mid double-digit range. Favorable year-to-date results enabled us to increase the midpoint of our same-property revenues by 25 basis points. While the benefits from tax savings and refunds enabled us to lower the midpoint of our same-property expenses by 80 basis points. The combination of these revisions resulted in a full year same-property NOI growth of 3.7% at the midpoint, which is 65 basis points higher than our initial outlook and near the high end of our original guidance range. In addition, we are raising our core FFO per share guidance for the second time this year. For the full year, we are raising core FFO per share by $0.20 to $13.20 at the midpoint, approximately $0.13 of this raise relate to improved NOI expectations, and the remaining $0.07 comes from a combination of lower interest expense, acquisitions and preferred equity investments made to date. On the preferred equity investments, we have exceeded the high end of our guidance of $100 million and this is primarily a result of larger deal size in this year's transactions. Lastly, onto the balance sheet. In the second half of the year, we have around $100 million of debt maturities and we have the ability to prepay $290 million of debt, which matures in 2020 without incurring any prepayment penalty. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider our refinancing alternatives to optimize our cost of capital. Currently, we have approximately $1 billion available to us and our 1.2 billion lines of credit and our leverage level remains conservative at 5.5 times debt to EBITDA. I will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Richard Hill, your line is now live. Please proceed with your question. Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Trent Trujillo: Hi. Good morning out there. So these same-store revenue guidance raise was very nice to see. You brought up the low end of the range. So, Mike, with the positive market conditions you cited, how much consideration did you give to adjusting the top end of the range?
Michael Schall: I'll start with that and then maybe Angelo will have a comment. Obviously, we hit the top end of the range in Northern California, but we were pretty close to the midpoint or a little bit above the midpoint and the other markets. And so, we thought there was plenty of room within the range. So we didn't need to move it. We cannot move rents super quickly because we have to turn the leases. And in the second half of the year we turned fewer leases than we do in the first half of the year. So I think that the guidance range is appropriate where it is now. Angela, do you have anything to add?
Angela Kleiman: We had guided to a tougher first half and a lighter second half originally with the midpoint at 3. And given where the first half came in, certainly, we are comfortable with where our guidance range is at this point. But having said that, keep in mind that the second half now will contemplate heavier supply. And so, in that environment, it didn't make sense for us to raise the high end of the guidance range.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. I appreciate the commentary there. John, you mentioned turnover keeps improving on a year-over-year basis. How long is that sustainable and is there a level of turnover, at which point you say you will start implementing larger rate increases?
John Burkart: Well, as far as the rental increases, we are very focused on our customers being fair in their entire experience which, of course, includes what they pay. And so, we typically will not raise rents above the marketplace, that's effectively set in the marketplace. As far as how low can turnover go, I would love to see it continue to go lower. I think what's driving the lower turnover at this point in time are a combination of factors, one of them being the fact that our assets are well located, of course, they always have been. So that hasn't changed. But what does change is the quality of life in many of the metros, the traffic continues to increase and as it increases it makes our assets better relatively than other options. So that is one angle. Another angle is we continue to focus on the customer experience at the sites, and we do have room to continue to improve that. We will continue to work on making all of our customers have the best experience possible. And finally, affordability overall in all of our markets continues to improve as incomes grow significantly faster than rents. And so, it's putting a lot less pressure on people to move for financial reasons, whether it's further away from their jobs or it's other areas. So I do think there is some continued room to run. I think it works best for both our customers and ourselves to have lower turnover. So we're pretty pleased with it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. You're seeing more attractive acquisition opportunities versus the recent past. You mentioned you may have exceeded high end of acquisition guidance. So how large is acquisition pipeline today?
Michael Schall: Yeah. Hey, Nick, it's Mike. The acquisition pipeline is pretty decent. I would say that the fact that we're going to exceed the high end of the range is more a function of not having a real aggressive high end of the range given conditions at the beginning of the year, which we had a much higher cost of capital. And as we fast forward to today, interest rates have declined pretty dramatically and there's a lot more interest in property. So I think it's more a function of there's enough deals out there and our pipeline is a few hundred million, but there is no guarantee we're going to close all or even some of those deals, but we are much more in the hunt this year. Again, if you go back to last year, we weren't able to make the numbers work. We were selling property. We are a net seller of property, selling property 8th & Hope in downtown LA, for example, for a sub-4 cap rate and buying stock back, the conditions are just so much different. So we are back much more interested in the acquisition market.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. So then just maybe on the funding side, historically, you've been pretty active on issuing to repurchase shares if it makes sense. Looks like for most of the second quarter, you're trading above NAV, but given that acquisition pipeline and kind of the use for net capital, so I think you're issuing ATM equities in the second quarter?
John Burkart: Angela will have an answer to this, but I'll start. I mean, the simple answer is that we're debt-to-market cap is about 22%. So we just don't need to deleverage the balance sheet. In fact, we don't have any interest at all in deleveraging the balance sheet further. And we feel like we've managed it to where we want to be sort of late in a economic cycle. And so we're perfectly comfortable with where it is now and in fact could increase leverage a little bit, not that we're necessarily planning to do that, but we feel comfortable doing that. Angela, do you want to add to that?
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. Hey, Nick. In terms of the equity issuance activity, if you look at our acquisitions to date, we really didn't have a need because it will require via a down structure and the preferred equity investments, they fund over time inevitably and so the funding is very small. But generally speaking, in addition to Mike's comment on our leverage level, we do look to match fund our investments relative to the cost of capital to optimize that yield. And so even though our staff may at any given point in time be trading at above consensus NAV, we will still look for ways to make sure they -- that funding is the most attractive and we have, as you know several alternatives to how we can fund an investment. And so it may, may or may not be the common equity issuance as the first thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, thanks for the time. Mike, you mentioned you view preferred equity, there is a more attractive risk-adjusted return versus development. So I'm just curious what it would take for you to restart the development pipeline or what spread maybe you'd need between cap rates to justify the risks you see today.
Michael Schall: Yeah, Austin, it's a good question. And again the driving dynamic there is that construction costs are growing faster than rents in general and with entitlement processes in California stretching out 3 years to 5 years, in many cases, you end up in a potential for lower yields on development than you otherwise have. I can cross out with the preferred equity where we're coming in just before the start of construction. So all about pre-development period is in the past and we're coming in and starting construction the next day. And so the risk-reward equation is much different. Having said that, we look at a lot of development in transactions and so it's not for not trying to make them work. We just had been pretty selective given where we are, our perception where we are in the economic cycle, and the risk-reward equation. And to get us interested in direct development, we would like to see between 100 to 150 basis point cap rate premium to stabilize yields, which for a quality property, let's say, are around 4% right now. So we'd be looking for that. And again, looking at the risk profile of what the entitlement process looks like, how long it's going to be in some of those other considerations in terms of our direct development appetite.
Austin Wurschmidt: I appreciate the thoughts there. And then just second for me,you discuss 2020 supply is going to be or is projected at this point to be a similar level as 2019. But you did mention, there are some variations in where that supply is concentrated. Could you just give us a little more detail of some of the moving parts by region?
Michael Schall: Sure, of course. Our research team goes and drives all most of these sites. And so we have really good intelligence and as John mentioned, some of the data vendors have much different numbers for multifamily supply projections, and we think our numbers have proven pretty accurate. So really, kudos to the economic research team for that. But, so, as you point out, yes, we have about 36,000 units in 2019 and about the same number in 2020. The big movers are number one in Orange County which goes down about 40% and actually San Jose goes up about 40%. It's not a tremendous number of units, goes from 2,700 units at 3,800 units and Oakland will go up about that same percentage. And then we will -- and then Seattle goes down about a third 2,900 units. So those are the driving forces. And again, it nets out to about zero increase.
Austin Wurschmidt: All right. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Shirley Wu: Good morning there guys and thanks for taking the question. So, John, earlier in your call you and even previously, you mentioned that this year it's emphasizing more of a rate growth drive from occupancy. And occupancy actually was down 10 basis points compared to what you would have imagined with 20 basis points you mentioned earlier this year. So I was wondering what's going on there and just the strong demand that you're seeing and if that's going to continue in the rest of the year. Or if you just continue to expect that occupancy to come down to about 20 basis point you mentioned previously?
John Burkart: Sure. So the simple answer is yes. For the year, I expect it to tick down 20 basis points from where it was last year. But within that, a little bit more detail. So, yeah, as was mentioned earlier, the supply picture, there's more supply that is coming on to the market in the second half, it's about an increase of about 25% and it is my expectation because seasonally demand goes down, just a normal aspect of our markets. So as the supply increases and demand slightly decreases just because of seasonal factors, I think there'll be an increase in concessions and that will cause us at the end of the day to compete harder by either offering concessions at some of the stabilized assets or increasing what we're doing or allowing some things to go vacant longer. At the end of the day, I expect that there'll just be a little bit more pressure and that's part of the answer as to why we increased guidance where we did and we're comfortable with it.
Shirley Wu: Great, thanks for that color.
John Burkart: Sure.
Shirley Wu: And moving on the CapEx side, I noticed that in 2Q, it was slightly higher than the usual run rate and I was wondering if that, you can get a little bit more color and if that was a one-time thing and how we should expect capex to trend for the rest of the year.
John Burkart: Sure. Yes, the original guidance anticipated an increase to 1,600 a unit range and I expect that to be closer to a run rate than where we were. There are numerous factors that have -- that drive this, the same factors that drive the increase in development costs that we talked about on a regular basis, increased labor and materials costs. So that's the big factor and then of course some of the newer buildings with the systems and other things that we have that we bought and built, they also typically run higher in capex as on a per unit basis, not a percentage but a per unit basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hightower: Hi, good morning out there guys.
Michael Schall: Good morning, Rich.
Rich Hightower: So I've got a two-parter on affordability here. So I heard the stats, Mike, that you put out in terms of affordability and rent growth and income growth. I'm wondering if you're actually seeing affordability improved empirically in terms of the new leases that you're signing, if you're noticing that in sort of the screening mechanism. And then separately from that, we've started to see home values and home prices in the Bay Area maybe roll over a little bit, maybe in other West Coast markets as well. Is there any read through on affordability related to that or is that sort of a separate issue?
Michael Schall: Yeah, those are, those are all great, great questions. It's hard to get down to a very granular level on this affordability issue. We've been tracking this for the better part of 30 years now, and it's one of those market indicators, kind of bigger picture indicators that we know is really important and by that, I would say, let me give you a couple of statistics. So between 2010 and 2015 we had 20% higher rent growth versus household income growth. So we had rent growth that dramatically exceeded household income growth and I think that caused some of the concerns that we've had and we've been talking about this affordability issue for the last couple of years, largely because of that, that statistic. And then from, if I look at it from 2010 to now, that 20% higher rent growth and household income is now 13%, so we've actually moved the needle pretty significantly as it relates to that rent to income ratio. So I think that is incredibly important and I think it's one of the things that we would put on the top couple of considerations for these markets. We have grown rents very substantially over long periods of time. I think between 2012 to 2017 our same-store revenue has gone up by about -- by an average of 7% per year. So that's a lot of, a lot of growth. And as we know, incomes were pretty stagnant coming out of the financial crisis. And so we, again, think that is a really important issue as it relates to home prices, which as you pointed out, I think they're down 6% in San Jose and up about 3% in San Francisco and everything else, all of our other metros are between those two numbers. And I guess what I would say is the year before was exactly the opposite, we had exceptional home price growth and I think there is a lagging indicator here with respect to interest rate. So I don't think you've seen home prices recover given pretty significantly lower interest rates. So I would expect these home price numbers to get better from this point on just given mortgage rates.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Yeah, I think that's helpful color. And my second one here, maybe as a follow-on topic. Do you care to opine at this point in the calendar on the Rental Affordability Act that is I think currently gathering signatures as far as the ballot initiative for next year?
Michael Schall: Yeah. You know, the, we keep track of it. And for those that don't know what that is, it's essentially the industry is calling it Prop 10 2.0 and where there is a potential for a ballot proposition that would amend Costa-Hawkins in, on the 2020 ballot. And there has been a certain amount of money that has been contributed by Michael Weinstein to support a signature-gathering effort. It's, I think, too early to tell exactly where that's going, Rich. We obviously track it pretty carefully and we kept our entity, Californians for Responsible Housing alive and well and organized in case of this. So we'll wait and see what happens. And because there's also the Assembly Bill 1482 which is the statewide rent control law, which started out as a, an anti gouging type of proposal and it's currently in the Senate and it would cap rents at CPI plus 7, at least that's the current proposal, again, it's in the Senate, could still be modified from here. But I think that that is pretty indicative of a better balance with respect to the discussion on housing, on the need for housing in California. Again, going back to the governor's campaign, campaigning on producing 3.5 million homes in California by 2025, that's about 600,000 a year. By way of background, we produced about 80,000 a year for the last 10 years on average. And so he as recognized the need for more housing and at the same time trying to balance that with the protection of the tenant base as well. So I think it's a more balanced discussion and I think that we will have to see where these things come. You're going to see action on AB 1482 long before you see -- get an update on what might happen with respect to Prop 10 2.0.
Rich Hightower: All right. Very good. Thanks, Mike.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning out there. Mike, maybe just following up that last question on the whole rent control and discussion on California. Are you seeing any seepage of what happened here in New York where the restrictions and then in the, the regulation that was passed when they renewed rent control are so onerous that it actually discourages landlords and housing, are you seeing any of that creep into the California political landscape where California wouldn't want to be outmaneuvered by New York or is it where Sacramento sort of being led by Governor Newsom that wants to promote housing and is more cognizant of factors or legislation that would inhibit that?
Michael Schall: It's a good question, Alex, and thank you for that. I guess in New York, my perception is that that all happened very suddenly and there was a proposal and it was passed almost before people could have time to properly react to it and understand the unintended consequences of it. Whereas I think it's different in California because we've had this dialog going back to the Prop 10 especially a year ago, and in so doing this dialog of regarding rent control in general has been ongoing. And again, this is why I think the governor, his comments are so important noting, another thing he noted was that there is a perverse incentive not to produce housing in California for variety of reasons, and again he is recognizing the need for balance in that equation. And so I think we have a better discussion here and I think that it's been thought-through at a greater level than probably it has in some of the other states around the countries.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then moving to Seattle or actually Bellevue specifically with all the investment that Amazon is doing in Bellevue and focusing their office development there, are you guys sort of reassessing how you want to play the Seattle market, do you think that we would see you guys do more investment in Bellevue or maybe your existing footprint, you're happy with where it is based on the growth that Amazon is looking at for Bellevue?
Michael Schall: It all depends on yields and risk. We love Bellevue. We love downtown Seattle. I'd say in general, we're becoming more suburban focused than urban focused because of a number of issues. There's more supply in the urban core. I'd say actually both with respect to office development but also with respect to apartment development. And so trying to avoid the cities that are having these large concessions because you've got three, four or five lease ups competing with one another at the same time. So it's difficult to project forward that far. These concessions literally change on a weekly basis. And so I think our strategy is evolving too. Hey, let's just try to avoid the areas that have massive development given that the rent growth in those areas has been suppressed for pretty long periods of time now. So we will continue to monitor and I can't predict whether Bellevue or Seattle is going to outperform until we're a lot closer to looking at a deal.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning. John, you talked about the development pipeline and concessions earlier. When you layer on new supply and stuff that was completed a year ago that might be having its first renewal, the five developments that you either currently have in lease-up or will in the next quarter or so, are any of those of a concern in terms of concessions that you guys think that you're going to need to lease some up? I think you said Milo was currently one month free. And then I think it was Station Green, the first phase was six weeks. Anything that's going to be outside of that sort of range?
John Burkart: Well, let me give a kind of a broad answer there. So when we delivered vacant unit, we are greatly incented and this is really why it's logical why many of the developers are doing what they're doing as far as free rent. It's not a matter that the market is weak. It's the matter that they're trying to drive a significant amount of absorption fast because your option one is vacant unit, option two is a lower net effective with the qualified resident and getting cash flow. So we have the same economics there and, of course, it's different when we own the asset, I mean, when we have -- for our same-store assets, right. But we are one of those players on the development. So what we try to do is look for what works best in the marketplace and what the consumers are looking for and react to that. So I expect we'll increase our concessions over time. It is within our plan to do that because it usually happens as we get into the fourth quarter. But we make these decisions literally daily and definitely reviewed intensely weekly. So we'll just follow it. But all of our -- you can tell by the pre-leasing performance, the markets are strong, and we feel very good about all of our developments where they're at.
Rob Stevenson: Any of them facing extreme new supply as Mike was alluding to before?
John Burkart: No, we are not in -- at this point we're not in a situation where we have extreme combat.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, Angela, if I look at the same-store expense growth year-to-date 2.9% sort of implies a low ones for the back half of '19, is that all on property taxes or is there something else that's going to drive same store expenses down to the low 1% range for the back half of 2019?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, you're right, it's actually, mostly driven by property taxes. So between the millage rate coming in lower than expected, and we of course have some refunds that we're recognizing in the second half. Those are the two key drivers.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. So if I can squeeze one more in. Maybe other than market concentration, what's keeping you guys sort of BBB+ from the rating agencies versus an A- like Avalon and Equity?
Angela Kleiman: Believe it or not, it's really market concentration.
Rob Stevenson: Okay.
Angela Kleiman: That's the key driver.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, I think the rating agencies are so focused on the number of states versus the relevance of the actual state. I mean, California as we all know, has the -- it's like the third largest GDP and incredibly diverse and large. Having said that, I think just the fact that it's one state is what's tough with the rating agencies to underwrite.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford: Hi, good morning. Google announced it was looking to develop about $15 billion of real estate in the Bay Area with Lendlease, it sounds like a significant chunk of that is earmarked for residential. Do you see this as a significant medium- to long-term supply the threat that could be large enough to potentially affect rent growth, market rent growth in the region?
Michael Schall: Yeah, this is Mike. They're not alone. Microsoft has a program. I think Stanford University has some discussions about mainly student housing, but there are some other proposals of corporations getting involved in housing. It remains difficult to figure out exactly what's going to happen in the short term, I don't think there'll be any actually short-term impact, these are mostly over longer periods of time. And I think a lot of the corporate housing is probably strategically important to them and their hiring given that one of the key reasons not to come to the Bay Area is concern over housing and housing price. So if you can assure someone that's relocating to the Bay Area that they have a home, I think that's a major positive in the hiring process. Overall, I don't think that any of this given the cost of housing and the size of these programs, I don't think it's going to have a material impact on the markets, but again we'll face that down the road ways.
Karin Ford: Got it. And then my second question is going back to your development pipeline. You've got an extraordinary amount of lease-up and development coming in the Bay Area in next six quarters, including 500 fulsome and you talked today a lot about the strong environment in those markets. Do you think your yields on those could outperform your underwriting and can you share were the deals are penciling today?
Michael Schall: I think that we've talked about stabilized yields a little bit and maybe I'll echo those comments stabilizing somewhere in the 5.5 range. And this is not today and it won't be next year, but it will be a couple of years out. As you can imagine, development deals have, for example, retail components and the retail components are important because you don't want to have -- a lot of people don't want to move into a construction projects, so you want all of that construction to be done. So that yield is a few years out. And so I think that for the next year or so, you will see some positive increment but not dramatic.
Karin Ford: And is that 5.5 yield number on trended rents are on rents today?
Michael Schall: No, on stabilized rents.
Karin Ford: Stabilized rents. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning. A quick follow-on question on the…
Michael Schall: Good morning.
Drew Babin: Good morning. On the lease-up properties coming in getting delayed, did that explicitly caused an increase to the FFO guidance where some of these properties you might have some initial drag, obviously, taking on the expenses, mid lease-up that might now occur or early next year? Is there any kind of dynamic there in '19 versus '20 with those development projects getting pushed out?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, Drew on the FFO guidance, the delay impact which ultimately I think you're looking at the higher capitalized interest on our S-14, it's a couple of pennies, let's say $0.02 and for this year. So what that means is, of course, some of that dilution is going to get push next year as we continue to lease out, but I think the one positive is that this dilution instead of being as concentrated as we saw that occur this year, it'll be more moderated and it will just occur over time similar to the impasse of supply delivery, that if they all come at once it's obviously much tougher to digest if they were to, say, happen more ratably over time. It's much more manageable.
Drew Babin: Okay, thanks for that. And I guess one more topic kind of related to the corporate housing question. Should some of these projects really, the rubber meet the road, and some of them getting titled, some of them proceed, would Essex under the right economic conditions ever consider partnering with one of he corporations in some kind of project? And I guess, what would you need to see for that to make sense for Essex?
Michael Schall: Drew, this is Mike. A lot of these corporate housing entities have -- or proposals have included an RFP-type process, and so there might be some opportunity to work with some of these companies, and they'll be exposed more broadly to the development community. So it probably isn't going to be just us and it will be several projects over periods of time. So I'd say it's too early to tell exactly what it means. And again, we track pretty closely as you know the total amount of competing property that's going to be entering the rental pool down the road. So if we saw a huge impact, I think during the construction period gives us time to react as well. So what exactly would those terms be, we work in a joint venture on many development deals and the markets for those terms depending upon what side you're on change over time. And we're looking to actually at some joint venture development deals as we speak. They're complicated enough that I don't think I can reduce them to magnitude. We're going to look at more broadly at the yield premiums that -- to acquisitions measured today with market rents today that I talked about a little while ago. And whether we do it in a joint venture or ourselves really is a function of how much risk is there upfront in the deal, how much money do we have to spec and how long a period of time do we have to spec it in the pre-development period before you begin construction, and every deal is a bit different.
Drew Babin: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Did we lose the -- I don't hear anything.
Angela Kleiman: Operator, are you still there?
John Burkart: Operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. Glad we're still on. Going and looking at that slide you put in last quarter, you had the one about the permits falling quite a bit, I'm trying to use that slides to have good supply data. I wonder if you guys can give us some insight on when you think peak supply will be in your markets, it looks like next year will be comparable, but is it going to be the same thing in 2022 as well in 2021?
John Burkart: Well, yeah, no, this is John. Our expectations, it starts to tick down. So as I mentioned, we're really at a plateau right now and we expect it slowly starts to tick down going after next year. So yeah, where you, like, put it that way, we're at peak supply right now.
Wes Golladay: Okay, fantastic. And then when we look at those permits, I mean, they're falling quite a bit since we started by the middle of last year, is that mainly due to the cost that you cite where the rents are not growing fast enough or do you think the political uncertainty is also having a big factor in that?
John Burkart: I think, yeah, I mean…
Michael Schall: Both, yeah, both. It's all the above. It's how much risk do you take and what types of yields are you expecting, how do you get compensated for that risk. And I'd say maybe adding to that is the project sizes are getting bigger and bigger and that the cost per unit is -- has increased pretty dramatically. So you need more, more equity and a lot of these deals. And as we see this in the preferred equity environment where in that pre-development period costs are going up faster than rents and when we come in with preferred equity sometimes, these deals are short of equity given cost increases and that's causing some delays there. So it's all this. But yes, it all involves the relationship between construction costs and development deals.
Wes Golladay: Okay, and one final one, if I may. Do you have the new and renewal leasing for the quarter and you're most -- your loss to lease?
John Burkart: Sure, I can give that to you. So the new leases for the quarter, second quarter were up 3.4% year-over-year or prior year's quarter and the renewals in Q2 came in at 4.4% year-over-prior year, and loss to lease you asked we are at 3.5%, which at this point in time because of seasonality is going to be at the high point. So I'll compare it to last June. So last June we're at 3.3%, so it's about 20 basis points better than last year and within that, So Cal has ticked down some, so it's a 2% loss to lease and Nor Cal and Seattle have gone up, so Nor Cal is 4.6% and Seattle is a 5%, all average rate of 3.5% for June.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Anderson: Thanks, good morning out there. So I recall many years ago you guys were kind enough to offer a 10% cap on annual rent increases. And I'm wondering, obviously, that's a moot point today. And, Mike, I'm asking is that situation of excessive rent growth fundamentally over in your opinion in your markets or is it simply supply and that has to kind of readjust where you could get there or is there, the political side that if you've dare to go there again that you get, you reignite sort of the rent control conversation to a higher level?
Michael Schall: Yeah. Hey, Rich. It's a good question. I think where we are in the cycle is probably a key consideration there. You tend to get more rent growth when you go through a recessionary period, there's very little development, and so jobs start growing and you end up with a supply demand imbalance for housing and you can push rents more aggressively than we can now, now being constrained primarily by income growth and affordability type issue. So as it relates to the 10%, you're exactly correct. We internally capped our renewals at 10% for many years, well, when we had much more robust rent growth and we would do it again. I think it's, number one, the right thing to do, but I also and always concerned about we are always concerned about the impact on local regulators, etc. For example, when residents get a very large rent increase, they often go into the city Hall and tell the local officials about these huge rent increases and we get phone calls and push back almost immediately. And in fact, in some cases, in connection with CA and some of the rental groups, we take part in trying to mediate some of these situations. So I think it's just a good practice to cap renewal rents at 10% and it's something that we've done and we would do again.
Rich Anderson: Okay, great. And then on your earlier comments on office development, I found interesting as I usually do, but I'm wondering if you guys also track pre-leasing of that office development, which is really where the rubber meets the road as it relates to future demand for multifamily, there could be some stupid development in there?
Michael Schall: Yeah, Rich, it for sure will, can change and -- but eventually, I think the, those office buildings we would all agree will be completed. So yeah, you're right. In the short term absorption really matters. In the longer term, the fact that the property exists is probably what matters more. John, you want to comment?
John Burkart: Yeah, and all this add in, the developments on the West Coast overall that Mike was referencing there about 75% pre-leased on average across the market. So huge pre-leasing going on and that is the nature of most office development these days, they typically have a big portion of their tenants before they break ground or at least in our markets.
Michael Schall: And let me let me end with one final comment, Rich, and that is, we're always concerned that people are going to find California less desirable and some of the tech jobs move to Austin, for example. So again, the fact that big investments are being made in our markets is really important to us. We view that as sort of a leading indicator. What are the tech companies doing? Can -- everyone is concerned about migration out of California, we're concerned about it as well. Again, we try to cobble together a number of sort of leading indicators to give us some sense of what decisions are being made by developers and some of the big tech companies.
Rich Anderson: Yeah, I think it's a good practice. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Angela, could you remind us what you're expecting for property taxes in Seattle and property tax growth rate would be this year and are the favorable reassessments, do you think it's the beginning of a multi-year trend, the fever finally breaking in Seattle?
Angela Kleiman: Well, on the tax piece, we're expecting the full year to come in at the middle ground. Say, in the high 1%, so say, 1.07, 1.08-ish, somewhere around there. In terms of the trend, boy, that's a tough one. I wish I had that crystal ball. It's interesting because in the past three years, our Seattle property tax has gone up between say 15, I think it was 15% for two years and 17% one of those three years. And this year it was a decrease. And so, that -- and we actually didn't budget it, the 15, but I certainly didn't budget a decrease. And so I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen next year. I think we're going to just try to take up best estimate, talk to our consultants and get some advice on that, but if you have a better solution, by all means, please call me.
John Pawlowski: I guess the shorter question is, is there anything lumpy one-time benefits this year that won't persist in Seattle?
Angela Kleiman: Nothing significant. We have a some refunds but there -- those numbers are not big enough to drive year-over-year comp.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And, Mike, on the regulatory front, in Washington, what are your political contacts saying about 2020 legislative session and rent control chatter gaining steam again in Washington?
Michael Schall: I don't have any recent information on that. So I don't -- I haven't heard of any major movement in Washington at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hardik Goel: Hey guys, congrats on the strong quarter on the guidance raise. I just had a couple of questions for you. The first one on a comment, I think, John made, so permits are declining year-over-year across your markets, but the lay environment that persisted, do you think there is risk that even though supply is plateauing now and it's kind of getting smoothed out with consistent delays that there is still this pipeline of supply that has started but not yet completed or may be stuck in pre-development that already has been permanent in past quarters that will continue to dribble out supply even beyond 2020, early 2021 and onwards. And my second one is easier. Sorry, you go ahead. I'll ask it afterwards.
Michael Schall: Yes. Okay, so, again, as we've said, we literally drive all the different sites. We take down from a process perspective, we have multiple vendors providing information as to permits that are obtained, sites that are started etc. And then we have a mobile program where our people drive all the sites and upload information into the cloud as to where they're at, what's going on, and we clean up that data quite a bit and reconcile what we get from the vendors to what we see on the street. So I think we have our hands around what's going on really well probably better than most. And so, that's what's in construction right now. And then the permits, we reconcile the permits to the actual as built and obviously there is typically some leakage going back the other way, things, more things get permitted than actually get built for various reasons. But at the end of the day, I think we have our hands around it pretty good. I think we're at this point in time supply has plateaued. We'll start to see it tick down, and it would take something else like us increasing rents or something to change the picture, but as Mike had said many times, construction costs are growing faster than rents. So at this point it's, it looks like we've hit the peak.
Hardik Goel: Thanks. That's very helpful. From my second one, should be pretty straightforward, I guess. On the Seattle kind of tax savings, how much of that was just the market and will probably benefit others where in who own assets there and how much of that was something that was an Essex push where you have an appeals process or some kind of mechanism where you try to get a favorable appeal or saving?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah, that's a good question. It's mostly market driven. So this is a Seattle millage rate assessment, and so it's assessed across the board. As far as the savings, we go through our refund process every year and there is some benefit there, but that's not at all a key driver.
Hardik Goel: Got it, thanks. That's all from me.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess, good morning out there.
Haendel St. Juste: Welcome, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, Mike, I guess I'll start with an oldie but goodie. What's your current view on the Essex footprint? California is not getting easier, cost, taxes, regulations, keep on increasing, senior peers going to Denver, you been once, been in Portland, the weather is nice and there's -- it seems to be parity in Honolulu, I'm curious, if your view on your footprint here has changed or evolved at all, and if so, how?
Michael Schall: Well, Haendel, it's a good question and it's the -- probably the most essential and important question of all of them and here we go through a process each year of reviewing strategy with our Board and we kind of start with that, that very question and we look at many major metros around the country and try to distill them down into supply and demand and what it means. And so, it's an ongoing question and an ongoing process here at Essex. From where we ended up on this in the last year is we think that the resiliency of the technology world is something that's going to probably be with us for several cycles and that that along with the supply constrained nature of these markets and the difficulty of building here is going to keep a premium on housing and there is this virtuous cycle of high cost of housing drives wages higher which allows rents to go higher, which you see in very few places. And so we concluded and continue to conclude we are well-positioned in the West Coast markets.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you for that. And then, I guess, back to, I guess, the growth, as you very well know, it's very hard to buy in California. Not much trades hands, Prop 13 being a clear headwind. So building is really the only game for the multifamily guys for growth in the Golden State. So I guess I'm curious if there's anything your shadow or future pipeline that's penciling yet or getting close to penciling given the continued rent growth, notwithstanding the rising construction costs you guys had mentioned. And if so, where? And as an add-on to that, maybe you could talk about potential interest in doing mixed-use development as well.
Michael Schall: Yeah, it's a good question. And we do have some land inventory. There is a Phase 4 of Station Park Green and there are a couple of other smaller projects that are behind our current pipeline that we will likely be active on. And as I said earlier, we continue to look for development deals and the challenge there as we stated earlier is that construction costs are growing faster than the rents, which means we have to see a fairly quick period between when we're financially committed to when we start construction because that's the period of greatest exposure. So it's pretty challenging. I would say, again, we continue looking and we have some deals that we are working on remains to be seen whether we move forward with them or not. So -- and again transitioning over to the preferred equity where we don't have that upfront risk because we're not financially committed from when during the entitlement period from when then period starts until when you start construction. We come in at construction and we eliminate that part of the risk and we've been very active in preferred equity and we will continue to do that. As Angela mentioned, we're above the top end of the range this year in terms of commitments there. So it's -- this is kind of a mosaic and we put the pieces together and every deal is unique unto itself, and we try to make decisions that makes sense in the broader scheme of things. And it's hard to bring it down to kind of the larger trends because every deals is a little bit unique. So I would say that more of the same that we will look at development deals whether they have a mixed-use component because obviously there are many deals that have mixed use components. There are other, actually other REITs and other land owners that are interested in having a multifamily component. There are no shortage of discussions out there for sure and we will look at all of the above and try to make good value decisions and make sure that I think the key part is that we're compensated for the risk that we take relative to our other opportunities.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator, and I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We hope that you were having a safe and enjoyable the summer, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the BofA Merrill Lynch Conference in September. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone’s time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and will end with Q&A. Our first quarter results represent a good start to 2019. Core FFO per share grew at 4.5% year-over-year and was $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to solid operations, which John will discuss in a moment. Market rent growth was up 3.1% from the start of the year through March, which was in line with our expectations. As such, we are not making any changes to our full-year rent or revenue assumptions at this time. We are pleased to be raising our 2019 core FFO per share midpoint by $0.05 following our first quarter results as a result of great execution from Essex team. Angela will provide more detail on the guidance increase in a moment. Taking a broader look at several economic indicators, we are feeling pretty good about the setup for Essex in 2019. Job growth, both nationally and in our metros decelerated earlier this year, slightly underperforming our annual expectations on Page S-16 of the supplemental. The most significant underperformance was in Southern California, some of which may be attributable to year-end market volatility, the government shutdown, and cost reductions related to the merger of Disney and 21st Century Fox. Less robust economic conditions both in the U.S. and globally has tempered inflation expectations and reduced the chances that the Fed will raise short-term rates in 2019. In our experience, lower interest rates and steady economic growth generally provide an attractive environment for NOI growth and asset value appreciation. While we are closely monitoring job growth, we are encouraged by other economic indicators in the Essex markets such as office construction, venture capital investment, job listings, and personal income growth, which are all either accelerating or trending at healthy levels. Major developments of large-scale office projects continue especially in our Seattle and Northern California markets. Under construction office projects from San Francisco to Silicon Valley aggregate almost 14 billion square feet, while Seattle is adding approximately 8 million square feet both representing greater than 5% of existing stock. Venture capital investment recently reached a record level in the Bay Area with over $60 billion invested in the region on a trailing 12 month basis supporting continued strength for the Bay Area economy. Several West Coast-based unicorns are expected to complete their IPO in 2019 and much of this liquidity is likely to be reinvested back into the local economy. We continue to track job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest public tech companies which recently reached over 26,000 job postings, representing a 33% increase in the past year and the highest level since we started tracking this information several years ago. Amazon's job openings in Seattle also reached an all-time high with over 11,000 openings. The competitive environment for talent on the West Coast is driving average income higher. For example, growth in per capita personal income in the Essex markets grew over 6% last year, and is expected to remain strong, growing at a similar level in 2019. With income growth outpacing rent growth, affordability has improved in all of our markets, as compared to one year ago. Each of our markets rent to income ratio with the exception of Ventura is now within the upper end of the desired range, and San Francisco now has a rent to income ratio of 26.4%, which is below its long-term average for the first time since 2011. In summary, against the backdrop of low interest rates, several of the most relevant economic indicators in California and Washington suggest healthy demand for rental housing. Fast growing and innovative companies continue to attract top paying talent from across the country, leading to higher average incomes and improved rental affordability. On the supply side, we've seen no noticeable change from the commentary provided on our last quarterly update. We continue to see delays in development deliveries, which are already factored into supply estimates on Page S-16 of the supplemental. We are aware that other data providers have much higher development delivery estimates for the Essex markets and believe that their estimates will be lowered as we proceed through 2019. In addition, perspective yields on new development deals continue to decline as the tight labor markets are causing construction cost increases that exceed rent growth. Overall, our delay adjusted supply forecast for 2019 have not changed. Looking a bit further into the future, we are encouraged by our recent decline in residential permits in our markets as shown on Page S-16.1 of the supplemental. Residential permits which include both multifamily and single-family housing have fallen about 10% from the peak we recorded in the second quarter of 2018. While we can't be certain the permitting activity will not reaccelerate, we suspect that the recent decline is attributable to financing and other consequences of compressing development yields. The decline in permits is a good indication that capital is responding to lower development returns, which should lead to lower multifamily supply beginning after 2020. Turning to the investment markets, we've seen no significant change to cap rates for A or B quality properties. As I've mentioned in prior quarters, cap rates generally do not move quickly and are mostly a function of capital flows. As such, we try to create value for our shareholders by arbitrating the differences between public versus private market pricing. We took advantage of this disconnect in the fourth quarter of 2018 by selling 8th and Hope, a Class A, high-rise property located in Downtown LA at an attractive cap rate and buying back the stock at a discount to NAV. In the first quarter, we saw a nice improvement in our cost of capital and use this opportunity to buy out our partner's interest in One South Market at an accretive yield. One South market is a Class A high-rise property located in the heart of San Jose and can be seen on the cover of this quarter's earnings supplement. With Google in the early stages of developing over 11 million square feet of office space near downtown San Jose, we are happy to increase our exposure to a high-quality asset and a great long-term market. Given our improved cost of capital last quarter, we are actively looking for acquisition opportunities and we continue to have an ample preferred equity pipeline. We will continue to underwrite assets with the same diligence and process that have helped us succeed in the past. Lastly, regarding California regulatory matters, there are many moving parts as a variety of state and local government officials attempt to balance the need for more housing to address chronic shortages with the expanding rental protections. We will continue educating others with respect to the unattended consequences of rent control while helping to create housing at an attractive risk-adjusted return to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart for some more color on the quarter and our markets.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. We started off the year strong achieving year-over-year 3.1% revenue growth for the first quarter which exceeded our expectations due to one-time other income in March. At the Citi Conference, we published our January and February preliminary revenue growth rate of 2.7% and we noted that are scheduled rent for the same period grew approximately 3%. That trend continued into March 2019 where scheduled rent grew 3.1% over the prior year's period. The variations in revenue growth rates relate solely to other income. March 2019, other income was elevated due to a combination of line items including lease break fees, one-time filming income, and early utility collections related to the spike in natural gas cost in January. Occupancy for the same-store portfolio in Q1, 2019 was 96.9% or 20 basis points below the prior year's period as expected. We continue to see opportunities to create more value in other income line items. In the first quarter of 2019, our parking revenue is up 14.2% compared to the prior year's period and we expect that trend to continue. Our expenses came in higher than expected, due in part to one-time costs related to the water and snow damage from the heavy storms in January and February. Additionally, our gas expense spiked due to both an increase in the use and rates caused by the colder than normal West Coast winter weather. Fortunately, some of the utility cost increases were offset by declines in electricity costs related to our green initiatives, including the installation of PV panels at over 50 properties. We continue to make progress towards our digital transformation objectives, completing the implementation of work day, a paperless mobile HR platform that will enable - that will eliminate printing and trips to the office to sign documents reducing labor while playing a foundational role in our steps to success program which is focused on growing employees careers and related compensation at Essex. The rental market was strong as we expect in the first quarter. However, it's slowed down since the quarter end with SoCal being the weakest. It's hard to say what the driver is with such a small sample period although it appears to be mostly supply related as the weakest markets are L.A. and Alameda Counties. Now, I'll provide an update on our markets. Seattle employment growth continues to outpace the U.S. and other major East Coast markets posting year-over-year growth of 2.2% for the first quarter of 2019. Amazon continues to grow their presence in the East side, announcing plans to move the business division from Seattle to Bellevue by 2023 as well as pre-leasing and potentially buying an additional 900,000 square feet office space in Bellevue. In Downtown, Apple and Oracle are vying to sublease one of Amazon's under construction towers. Dropbox executed a pre-lease with the potential of adding 5,400 jobs to the downtown market. The north and south submarkets continue to lead in year-over-year revenues for the first quarter posting 3.3% and 5.3% growth respectively followed by the East side with 2.5%, and Seattle CBD improving with 1.3%. Loss to lease was 1.1% at the end of March. On a trailing fourth quarter basis, Venture capital funding hit a new 20-year high in the Bay Area. So far in 2019, 3 Bay Area tech companies Lyft, Pinterest and Zoom Video have completed their IPOs and others such as Uber and Postmates filed for IPOs with many more IPOs in the process. The liquidity from the IPOs of some of these uniforms will both free up funds for additional investments and provide capital to certain employees who often create their own startups. Office expansion has been robust. YouTube kicked off an environmental study for 2.4 million square feet of mixed use development in San Bruno. Facebook revealed plans for the 1.8 million square feet mixed use development in Menlo Park. LinkedIn and Alibaba increased their combined footprint by a little over half of million square feet in Sunnyvale, and in San Jose Google pre-leased another 700,000 square feet office park currently under development. Our Q1 year-over-year same-store revenue growth was led by our San Mateo and San Jose submarkets with 4.5% and 3.8% growth respectively followed by San Francisco at 3.3%, Fremont at 3%, Oakland at 1.9%, and Contra Costa at 1.7%. Loss to lease at the end of March was 1.9% for the Bay Area. Continuing South, Southern California posted a weak quarter for employment growth averaging only 90 basis points for year-over-year Job growth or half the national average in Q1 and well below our 1.3%, 2019 estimate on the S-16 in the supplemental. In 2018, the BLS showed lower employment growth for San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles and then revised these markets up between 50 and 100 basis points with the March 2019 prior year revision. Los Angeles actually performed below the Southern California average posting 70 basis points growth for the period. One of the employment categories that showed weakness was Motion Pictures, which was down approximately 10% during the first quarter. It is unclear what impact, if any, the Disney 21st Century Fox Studio merger maybe having a local employment. However, they have stated that they expect to achieve $2 billion in cost synergies, which will include staffing reductions. At the same time HBO expanded their headquarters in the market adding just over 110,000 square feet in Culver City. Workspace companies such as WeWork, Knotel and Spaces expanded their combined L.A. footprint by over 300,000 square feet. Year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 was led by West L.A. at 4.6%, Woodland Hills of 3.5% and Tri-Cities at 3.2%. L.A. had a loss to lease of 1.1% in March. Although Los Angeles Q1 revenue growth was very strong, we've seen a reduction in the year-over-year market rent growth rates, which may be related to the combination of lower employment growth, and the aggressive lease-ups in Downtown L.A. with some lease-ups offering concessions that exceeded 8 weeks free rent. In Orange County, jobs in Q1 grew 90 basis points year-over-year, with the largest gains in professional business services. In January, the BLS posted 2018 benchmark revisions which erased all prior year's reported softness in this market. On revenues, the South Orange submarket continues to lead with 2.4% year-over-year growth in Q1 and the North Orange at 1.8% for the same period. We ended March with a loss to lease of 60 basis points. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year, job growth was 1.4% in Q1. Year-over-year revenues in Q1 were led by our Oceanside submarket with 4.8% growth followed by Chula Vista with 4.3% and North City with 2.9%. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.8% occupancy and our availability, 30 days out is at 4.3% with loss to lease of 1.1% for March, 2019. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll briefly comment on our first quarter results and increase to the full-year guidance and provide an update on our investment and capital markets activities. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter core FFO per share grew 4.5% to 3.23% exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 which resulted mostly from one-time revenue items, as John Burkart highlighted earlier. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of our core FFO guidance by $0.05 per share to 13.08. This is primarily driven by a more favorable capital markets conditions as the pricing of our first quarter bond offering was better than originally contemplated in our guidance. Overall, this revised midpoint equates to a 4% growth in core FFO per share for 2019. Moving on to investment activity, during the quarter we originated two new preferred equity investments which comprised of a $24 million investment fully funded at close, and a $36 million investment funding in July and will not before we funded until the end of September. Year-to-date we had early redemption in two preferred equity investments totaling $27 million. The typical term of these investments is three years, but the timing of our pay-off is often tied to the developers, ability to obtain long-term financing or sale of the projects which can result in lumpy repayment and can be difficult to anticipate. Turning to capital markets activity. During the first quarter, - our cost of capital improved as the tenure dropped by over 50 basis points since last November. We took advantage of these favorable conditions by issuing $500 million of unsecured bonds at an average rate of 4%. The proceeds were used to repay secured debt that has matured through April over this year. For the balance of the year, we plan to repay approximately $400 million of debt, which consist of $110 million maturing this year plus $290 million maturing next year, but can be repaid early with no prepayment penalties. The reason for making early repayments is the cash benefit, although the effective rate on this $290 million debt is 3.8%. The cash rate is 5.5%, which will allow us to generate over $3 million of additional cash savings on an annual basis. We have access to a variety of capital sources, and we'll continue to monitor the capital markets to optimize the refinancing. With over $1 billion in availability on our line of credit, 22% leverage and net debt EBITDA of 5.5 times, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: With respect to guidance, you mentioned that the first quarter, you had a one-time benefit. So just curious how we should expect the cadence of same-store revenue growth now through the balance of the year?
Angela Kleiman: Hi there, it's Angela here. The cadence given the first quarter performance on same-store, we had originally anticipated that first half was going to be much lower than the second half and now they're going to be about the same. So we're not changing our same-store guidance and, but because of the first quarter revenue though just end up being more comparable.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then, you guys talked a little bit about some softening trends. Subsequent to quarter and you highlighted Alameda in LA. I was just curious if this is being offset by strength in many other submarkets?
John Burkart: Well, this is John. That's a great question and the answer is yes. We are seeing other parts of the Bay Area that are a little bit stronger and certainly Seattle is a little bit stronger. So there is an overall balance there, the whole portfolio performed a little bit better in Q1 than it started out to perform in April, but again, there is clearly a little bit more strength in some of the tech markets.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with the question.
Nick Joseph: You mentioned improving affordability, there continues to be a broad push for rent control nationally and specific to your markets, Governor Newsom in California appears to be supportive of some additional rent control despite the defeat of Prop. So how do you think about portfolio positioning and capital allocation going forward given the current political backdrop?
Michael Schall: I guess I want to take a step back from that and to talk a little bit about the overall discussion, and that because I think it's much more balanced than it was a year ago. And by that I mean, I think that there is more recognition that if you push too hard on the rent control side that will have a pretty dramatic impact on the housing production within California and Governor Newsom has been part of that discussion and part of his campaign was trying to produce 3.5 million new homes between now and 2025, which would be somewhere around 500,000 to 600,000 per year versus about 80,000 per year that we produce for the last 10 years. And so we also noted that he wanted to protect letter. So striking that balance, I think is what the legislature is grappling with and lot of the things that are happening we are focused on that. I think that what we've done is tried to identify the best long-term growth markets for multifamily property. We think in those markets and it seems like other potential places that we might be interested in investing say Oregon or Colorado or Florida or some of the bigger East Coast cities are having some of the same issue. So I don't think this the California thing, I think it's a broad movement and so I think that we are pretty comfortable with our existing geographic focus.
Nick Joseph: And then just how do you think about underwriting the preferred equity deals versus more our acquisition or development deal? And I recognize there, the risk profile is different, but how from FX at this point you underwrite them?
Michael Schall: We underwrite them much like we underwrite our development deals, our direct development deals. And so, in other words, we look at costs and the spread between what acquisition values are and what the development yields are in order to get comfortable with that and what we are trying to do is we're trying to find the best let's say development oriented strategy for the company. And the reason why it focuses us on preferred equity investments is because we don't take that upfront risk between when we are financially committed to a land purchase. Yes, because we step in those transactions at the point that the deal is closing in construction is beginning, so we've eliminated that front end risk element. So we think it's just a better risk reward equation for the company.
Operator: Our next question is from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Trent Trujillo: Just looking at Seattle. Real quick, I think your midpoint in guidance calls for similar growth in 2019 versus 2018, despite some new supply and we've seen some areas in the Seattle if they get zoned, so how are you thinking about the potential to continue rate growth trends in that market?
Michael Schall: And maybe I'll start. This is Mike and John might want to comment more directly on the market itself. But as to the up zoning, I think it's going to be several years before you really see the impact, the potential impact of that and it's not as quite as simple as hey, there's going to be up zoning and therefore this going to be more units produced because there are affordable unit requirements and construction costs, as you go up in density can increase. So I would say it's not just a slam dunk that we're going to see it significant increase in the amount of developed departments in the Seattle market. So John can I turn it over to you?
John Burkart: Yes, absolutely. As what we're seeing right now in Seattle is overall continued strength, which was consistent with the end of last year. The supply is getting absorbed as I mentioned previously, the job growth is strong and it continues to absorb that supply. So we'll see what may happen is maybe were a little stronger in Seattle and little weaker in LA overall with our guidance but Seattle is certainly performing well the tech markets are performing well. Does that answer your question?
Trent Trujillo: Yes, sure it does. Thank you. And I guess touching on theme from earlier in terms of capital allocation, you've been opportunistic in buying back shares. And since your repurchase the stock has rebounded out 15% and you're now trading above consensus NAV. So, at what point do you consider issuing equity as a source of funds for the acquisition opportunities that you cited in your prepared remarks?
Angela Kleiman: Well, keep in mind that for our investment activities we balance the cost of capital or the spread. And so it's really gone through driven by that. We haven't issued yet so far, because we had proceeds excess proceeds from the sale of 8th & Hope and our preferred equity investments have been funded by the redemptions and so until we have a need for that capital, we'll take a look at that point in time, what are the best opportunities are, whether it's issuing over the market over the broad market or via joint venture or dispositions and that relate to also on the divestment side what yield that we producing to get the best spread possible.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: With affordability improving in all of your market and all these tech IPOs coming out, can you just discuss what that means for the housing market and your ability to push rents, above the 3% market rental growth per cap?
Michael Schall: John, this is Mike. And that is the key question. I think affordability is, has been a key constraint over the last couple of years, plus I'd say peaking development pipelines and when development deliveries occur in essentially several properties being delivered at one time you start seeing these concession levels increase which is, -- our ability to push price to this point. So we see those we see those force is changing somewhat over the next couple of years and not to a huge extent but on the margin, and as a result of that, we think that there will be more pricing power go in a few years down the road.
John Kim: On your acquisition of the joint venture stake at One South Market. Can you just remind us if that was partner led or your decision. It sounds like it was more years and remind us how you to derive purchase price?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, on the One South Market transaction, our partner had a life on their fund that was coming to an end. So the timing was driven by that. We normally wouldn't have choose to say market and asset in the fourth quarter in the midst of on the tailwind of Prop 10 Vote. So it's really driven by them.
John Kim: And the purchase price was it – were there a lot of bidders for that stake?
Angela Kleiman: Yes it was broadly marketed and the we end of purchasing it at, at the growth of $179 million and we ultimately - it makes sense to transact with us on several level because we already own the assets, and it was a certainty of execution as well and the pricing makes sense to us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Two questions for you. Mike, just first one going back on the regulatory front, there have been some articles about certain municipalities are going, putting in rent caps or different sorts of right controls subsequent to the defeat of Prop 10. So can you just provide a little bit more perspective on this? And are you guys seeing any impact in the markets in your markets? Or is this more of a localized bank that doesn't seem to be spreading?
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex. Good question. I would say that we are at the beginning of the process and so it's going to take some time to work through all the different regulations that are out there. Keep in mind that we have concentrations really four cities in California whereas there we operate in about 80 cities. So we're pretty diversified within California as it relates to this rent control issue and there isn't, it isn't like a change in any one municipalities going to have a huge impact on the company. So I think that's important to keep in mind, but there has been increased regulation proposals on the local area, a lot of them had to do with these just cause of evictions and higher cap. So, in the case for example of Glendale capping rents at 7% and again over long periods of time we grow rents at somewhere around 3%, 3% plus or minus, so some of these caps are set at a point it should not have a dramatic impact on our longer-term results. And so, we're cautiously optimistic. We've left the California for responsible housing entity in place so that we can have a coordinated industry response to all these various proposals and, but we're working through and there is, we can speculate about what might happen, but it's so early on that I think it would be may both challenging and in precise to do so. So we're going to avoid, we trying to look into the future, because at the end of the day, we don't know what exactly is going to happen.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then the second question is for Angela on the guidance , and maybe it's continuing on with the legacy of Mike Dance. But if you look at your NOI, your NOI expectations for the year are higher but you left the NOI, same-store NOI range unchanged, your interest expense is now higher. So you know just thinking about it, is it the fact that it's just too early in the year we don't want to be changing your NOI guidance or are there other things that are going to sort of push back on the NOI, because otherwise it - it sounds like both should have moved up commensurately with your performance in the first quarter versus, you know, is there a reason that you're sort of holding back on growing the same-store NOI range?
Angela Kleiman: It's a good question and you're right, it's a fine line to try to block, but in terms of, let's just make sure that Tom that you understand one - on the NOI, it looks like there is a change the midpoint on our guidance page. But that is really because of the One South Market consolidation. It was off balance sheet and so, rolling that that to consolidated NOI and then as you know, and then we have our partial offsets to that. And so at the end of day, it's not a meaningful change to NOI at this point and nor do we see a meaningful change on a trend line basis. So it's it and as you know, we've always make sure that there is of course a level of conservatism. So we don't miss. Having said that, we certainly are seeing anything so compelling right now that it makes sense to try to get ahead of the numbers and move guidance.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hightower: So a lot of my questions have been asked already, but I guess just to follow up on the guidance question and what you're seeing currently. Are you able to tell us where you're sending out renewals over the next 60, 90 days at this point in April? And what you're achieving?
John Burkart: I can answer that. I think that's an important to understand is we really, we send our renewals out like six days in advance. So our Q2 renewals have gone out largely almost all of them at around 4.9%. So very strong, but again, realizing that I also mentioned in the opening that the market little bit weaker at April, so those may get negotiated down a little bit, but they are up from where they were in Q1 was about 4.1 and Q2 that about 4.9 at this point where they were set out.
Rich Hightower: That is helpful and that's in aggregate, I mean can you break that down quickly maybe across the three sort of bigger markets?
John Burkart: Yes, absolutely. So that is an aggregate and so we have at about 4.3% for SoCal overall about 5.4% for Nortel at about 4.9% for Seattle.
Operator: Our next question is from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Question on, your deliveries coming in later this year in San Mateo and Santa Clara. I was hoping you could kind of talk about the specific submarkets in the Bay Area. Obviously supply coming into the Bay Area is very some market specific and markets are kind of all over the place in terms of their performance. But I guess, can you comment specifically on where development through achieving first occupancy in 2Q and 3Q?
Michael Schall: Drew, this is Mike just make a couple of quick comments. First is that they are, we've had a pretty severe winter here. And so they are, from a timing perspective being pushed back somewhat given rain delays and that type of thing, so that's the first comment. The Station Park Green development is about a mile from our corporate office here in San Mateo and it's a very strong sub-market effect I think is that the strongest region. I think John within the portfolio right now.
John Burkart: Yes, that absolutely has the strongest region, rents are up over 6% year-over-year, and haven't seen so seems like we've time that well and then Milo is in Santa Clara and that market has a little more concessionary activity, but it still seems like San Jose and tech markets are doing so well from an employment perspective that we think that those markets are well positioned, both properties well positioned and timing is good.
Drew Babin: And then on downtown LA, would you say that the bulk of the supply that you're expecting there this year has hit or is hitting now as you mentioned the weakness kind of so far in 2Q or is there more to come as we get through later into the year?
Michael Schall: We have about -- our estimate is about almost 12,000 units in 2019 and actually increasing a bit in 2022 to almost 13,000 units in downtown LA or LA, which is the downtown is the primary component of that. And it really doesn't slow down until Q4, 2012, so I think we're going to have continued supply deliveries for the next - at least the next year.
Drew Babin: And then one for Angela, would you say that your preferred investment I guess aggressiveness maybe increases given the redemptions in the first quarter. You may be looking to do more preferred investments as was implied in the original guidance this year, or might the proceeds just be spread among other investment opportunities as well?
Angela Kleiman: Good question. Generally speaking for on the preferred equity investments, we would like to do more than we have always targeted on the pipeline just because the yield is so compelling and as Mike mentioned earlier and the risk adjusted return also makes a lot of sense. So that’s just a general statement, but as far as what we're expecting we had guided, between $50 million to $100 million and we're not at this point ready to go outside of that guidance and because primarily we do have redemptions to offset that. And so, but to the extent that we can ramp up, we were certainly not to do so. But at the end of day, we still have a very disciplined underwriting process. And so even if there are a lot more opportunities, it doesn't mean that work to us adequately to more deals.
Michael Schall: We’re pushing that.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Stevenson: Are you seeing any difference in rent growth between your assets at the high-end price point wise within the specific market versus those that are sort of in the middle or somewhere in between?
Michael Schall: Yes and no. Certainly, if you're talking Downtown LA, where we're competing head on with supply, the high-end is, if we're talking in other parts of the portfolio, it's not necessarily that way. We love the portfolio we have. It's broad in the sense of geography and as well as in the sense of As and Bs. And it performs very well. But there, if you're competing head on with supply again say Downtown Oakland, Downtown San Diego, Downtown LA those areas, the newer assets are finding more challenges with rents for sure.
Rob Stevenson: So no unless competing with supply, there is no sort of drag on A and A+ assets in terms of rental rate growth?
Michael Schall: No, I mean it wouldn't in those submarkets. Yes, definitely but outside the sub-market. Yes, no it depends, it's really a function of the concentrations of lease-ups and especially those that are offering large concessions that's what really impacts price.
Rob Stevenson: And you guys haven't started to do development. I think roughly 18 months or so. Can you talk about where you are in the process with your current land parcels and anything that you might be thinking about doing there and then what's the potential for additional redevelopment projects starting in 2019?
Michael Schall: Yes, Rob. That's another good question. On the direct development side, again the dynamic that we talked about a couple of times over the last year or so where construction costs are growing faster than rents in general are essentially pushing back some of those potential starts. We do have a couple of relatively small direct development deals that we could start, we're trying to find a window that sort of optimizes there, the cost structure on them. And so we've again had a preference for preferred equity investments. As a result of that, we're again, someone else takes those risks and we step in at the last minute before construction begins and earned a very decent yield. So from a variety of perspectives, I'd say direct development is the third most interesting investment opportunity at this point in time, given that that headwind behind preferred equity investments number one and acquisitions either in a joint venture or on balance sheet would be number two. So we're going to continue to be cautious, but we don't have a huge land inventory, as you know. And so we're just going to sit back and wait for their optimal time to start.
Rob Stevenson: That redevelopment starts?
John Burkart: Sure, I'll answer that. We are looking at several assets in the same-store portfolio currently. But I would say there's other assets that we've started redevelopment programs on that are not in the same-store portfolio. So they're not outlined in our financials, the newer acquisitions or joint venture transaction. So we continue to find opportunity in the portfolio, continue to monitor that. We’re also balancing that watching the regulatory environment and making sure that the program is going to work for all constituents.
Rob Stevenson: And then, out of the 17 preferred equity investments, you have currently. Are you expecting to own any of those or you expect to get repaid on all of them at this point?
Michael Schall: Rob, no we don't know. We don't have an option on any of them and we always try and get an option, but we find that our developer is typically more aggressive in terms of what he thinks of values are, than we are, and therefore it's not worth it to us to negotiate an option. Having said that, we always have the seat at the table when it comes time to refinance or sell these properties and there's been a couple of cases where we have actually bought the properties and-or in one case Stadion is a preferred equity provider after stabilization has occurred . So we like the optionality of the preferred equity investments, because both upfront. In some cases, we've chosen to be a part of the ownership group and at the back side, we have potential for buying the property and we're remaining involved in some way like in a preferred equity type of format. So we try to look at that portfolio as part of our opportunity set.
Operator: Our next question is from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hardik Goel: I wanted to ask about the parking fees and maybe other ancillary revenue opportunities that you see and how substantial that could be in the longer term like the runway you see longer term and also whether that was concentrated in a few markets or whether that was broad-based initiatives if you could just talk through some of the details there?
Michael Schall: Yes, I'm glad to. We do see pretty good amount of opportunity in the other income line item, line items and they include some of the initiatives we have right now, which include renting out amenity space to non-residents. The same thing, renting out parking to non-residents also looking at our parking space with current residents in the light of revenue management you might say, recognizing the different values of the different spaces and charging it accordingly. So we do see many opportunities, we're working on some smart unit pilots right now and a variety of other items. There are some offsets as well certainly have cable cutting and some other line items that are offsetting that. As far as for the magnitude of this, we're pretty focused on it. We think there is a good future there, but we're not at a point where we were putting up enough results to then translate that into numbers. I don't think you'll have a material impact on 2019 and we'll see an update as time goes, but we have quite a few things going in the other income line items.
Hardik Goel: And just as a follow-up to that, do you have considered looking at assets that might have excess parking in your view to maybe add Snap-on units, maybe like 100 units snap-on development sort of deal that some of your peers have done, what kind of opportunities exist across your portfolio there and have you considered them?
Michael Schall: Yes, we're looking at the real estate every which way you can to try to drive the most dollars per square foot, we can. So there again we’re not in a position to say this is the, this is the future that we've summed it up, but we are evaluating many, many options and there is some units, there were some parking that's being converted into units at some places, there's all kinds of things that are happening, and we’re evaluating the options across the portfolio. Again, the biggest thing for us though is to be very clear, is we're always focused on good real estate in the right locations, the right markets that's always number one and that is what we have as a great portfolio, but as far as optimizing it, we're working very hard at this point, to optimize our revenue.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: John, just a quick follow-up on the leasing spreads in 1Q, you sent out renewals at 4.1 But what did you actually achieved in the first quarter on renewals and as well as new lease spreads?
John Burkart: Yes, that was fair enough. So we actually achieved 4.1 in Q1 and that number will move around some. But we did achieve 4.1 in Q1 and the new leases in Q1, and again to be clear, this is light kind leases which typically are basically 12 month leases and we provide information this way to be insightful into the marketplace. So the new leases on light kind were about 3.6% year-over-year in Q1.
John Pawlowski: And then Mike, certainly back to the political conversation. I don't want to focus on rent control. I want to focus on regulatory barriers to supply I guess like some comments from your lens, the next 5, 10 years, how will that the backdrop be different, when the Governor is setting higher regional housing in targets. And then you have legislation like Senate Bill 50 gaining traction. I guess what markets could see change in supply and what markets would probably be a non-event under different regulation?
Michael Schall: Yes, John, that it's a good question and I know you guys have written extensively on this topic. Again I go back to what I said before, which is we are at the beginning of this process and trying to understand exactly how these things are going to roll out and what they will mean will be something that we will spend a lot of time on to try to understand and to ultimately benefit from it. SB 50 which is greater densities near public transit is something that California has talked about a lot and it makes imminent sense if they can figure out how to work through some of the logistical issues. Notably, for example Huntington Beach has been sued by the State and is counter sued over who has the right to dictate housing policy and I expect that some of that type of activity will continue as we work on our way through this process. So I think unfortunately, it's a little bit too early to tell what the impacts are in the case of Seattle, for example, I think you guys suggested that maybe it be 1% of stock. I think that's probably a bit aggressive, there could be some impact and candidly, there are markets that really need the housing and Seattle would be one of them, given it's incredible job -- San Francisco would be another one for example the different allowing greater office and residential construction is probably a net positive to have additional housing in that area given the amount of office supply that's coming in, and that's why we spend some time talking about the amount of office that is under construction, because if you have, as we said before, if you have somewhere around 5% under construction on the office side and you're producing about 1% on the residential side, it seems like there is an embedded imbalance in favor of demand oversupply embedded in those numbers. So the short answer is, we don't know, but we are engaged and studying it carefully and we will stay abreast of what's happening.
Operator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: Given that you still have an interest in development and fairly limited land bank. Just curious about interest in doing mixed use development maybe working with a retail REITs or someone under retail side on moderate densification projects, what would get you interested in doing things like that?
Michael Schall: Hi Tayo, this is Mike. We have actually worked with a number of retail organizations trying to determine whether we can provide the housing and I would say those conversations are though interesting and they've to some extent you've gone pretty far. But we haven't been able to actually strike a deal on those transactions. And so over to we're trying and you're right there. There is a natural I guess synergy between the two of us, if we can figure out how to get the economics right. The challenges, the same challenges that we have elsewhere, which is construction costs are too high and to some extent your retail partner looks at it and it goes well, it really cost that much to build that, but when you get through the numbers. That's what, that's what happens. I'd say it isn't necessarily the will isn't there, I'd say it's more a function of cost and yields and essentially the land valuation when you start looking at a spin-off of a part of a property from a retail company. So it's complicated, but it's possible. Our general view, again is we need cost to settle down a little bit here so that we have more certainty, because development cap rates measured today untrended in the high 4s. I just don't think that's enough of a risk premium to justify direct development. Now if we, if we found transactions that were in the low 5s on trended basis again, yes, that would represent maybe 100 basis points of cap rate over acquisition transaction that would be more interesting, but we have not been able to find those transactions.
Omotayo Okusanya: Angela, I just wanted to go back to your comments about the preferred equity program, if rate you end up kind of staying lower for longer. Should the natural outcome for that program be just less origination simply because the yield may not end up not being as attractive anymore and also because you probably end up with more redemptions as you start to refinance?
Michael Schall: Tayo it's Mike, I'm going to take that question from Angela, if you don't mind. I think that it's been interesting because there are, there is more money in the direct development side as it relates to some of the merchant builders out there and in cases, for example, last year where we didn't hit our guidance range on the preferred equity side. What we found was in some of the sponsor is willing to ride an additional check to put more equity into the transaction to get it moving ahead. So, in our experience there are limits to the amount of equity that the merchant builders can put into transactions to make them work when costs go up faster than rents and it compresses the yield. And but it's hard to tell which transactions are going to move forward and which are not. So I would say there probably are some headwinds there, but keep in mind that our pipeline for preferred equity, we have about $400 million outstanding and we probably are 25% of the capital stack. So that you're talking about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of development. It's just not that big. So I think that we given the size of the West Coast, I think that the opportunity is still pretty substantial.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Quick question, it looks like there is some disclosure on lease accounting changes. I was wondering if you just maybe provide us some high level thoughts and how that maybe might have impacted any numbers if at all during the quarter?
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. Actually for us is simple. On the lease accounting changes, on the P&L side, there is no impact because we've already been disclosing our bad debt in our contra-revenue. And so the only new disclosures that you will see is really at the balance sheet, we break out operating leases and liabilities and so it’s just a new disclosure item and thus far -- they end up net each other out essentially. And so once again, no impact on FFO either.
Rich Hill: And then just one quick question, I'm sorry this been asked before, but it looks like expenses were pretty elevated in Seattle. Could you just recap maybe why that's the case?
Angela Kleiman: Happy to. On Seattle, it's really driven by property taxes and it's because in Q1 of last year, we had a disproportionate amount of refunds. Having said that, this is actually the numbers came out as expected, we had expected that Q1 the sale it was going to trend this way. And so that's another reason why we didn't need to revise our operating expense guidance either.
Operator: Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
John Guinee: First, Mike you mentioned severe weather last winter, this past winter in California. Is that a little bit of an oxymoron?
Michael Schall: It is. I know I felt very uncomfortable using that as an excuse.
John Guinee: Okay, yes two questions quickly. You're coming down the home stretch on some of your development deals that you started construction couple of years ago. If you look at something like Station Park, looks like you have cost per home about 715,000 unit they 500 Folsom of about 750,000. What do you think it would cost you to build these products today if you're bidding out the GC work et cetera?
Michael Schall: It's a good question. We do have a Phase for Station Park Green and we have to John Eudy is not here with me today, I know that the costs are up. I don't know what the magnitude is.
John Guinee: So it's higher in both cases?
Michael Schall: But I can't tell you again it goes back into that comment I made earlier which is construction costs going to somewhere between, let's say, high single-digits, which is down from low-double digits over the past couple of years versus rent growth, which is in the three plus-minus percent range. So that's how badly, and that's been the problem on the development side.
John Guinee: No, we understand. Second question, any updated yield on cost for these projects as you get close to initial op leasing and occupancy?
Angela Kleiman: We have mentioned our yields in the past, it's kind of there Tom. The size range upon stabilization, which usually you know is another at least a year out from initial occupancy so that only hasn't changed, the rents are coming in at plan on our development.
John Guinee: And then the last question. This is your redevelopment portfolio and I think somebody asked a few questions about it. But the net-net, is it looks like you haven't put any projects into redevelopment idea $25,000, $30,000-$35000 per unit. Overhaul and a lot of years, at least on the East Coast people who doing that more and more. Anything that you just aren't quoting in your sup that our kitchen and bath renovations are things that others might include in our redevelopment pipeline?
Michael Schall: Yes, again with let me just talk broadly about our redevelopment program. So right now we're typically doing 2500, 3000 units a year which roughly with 5%, it implies a 20 year life, so that's just taking care of the units. And then on the major renovations, we look through the portfolio and look at opportunities. There are several opportunities we are studying right now that are in the same-store portfolio. It's also common for us as we acquire in assets to see opportunities along those lines. And those are not called out specifically in the supplemental. They're not in the same-store portfolio. So they're not pulled out of it or otherwise identified. So there are some other assets that we have, we are renovating right now that are outside of that realm. I suspect over the next year. Again, we will add a couple more assets into that, into that bucket that are coming from the same store. The current same-store portfolio. But again, we are working through the opportunities we had we are near completion and those will be coming out and we'll probably be adding a few more, but there's others that are going on right now. That just start, they just starting the same-store portfolio, so that called out specifically.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.
Q – Rich Anderson: So I don't know if you ever seen this commercial AT&T Wireless commercial when guys going to get surgery and nurse that surgeons just okay or kind of sushi dinner and they said the food is just okay except the Cook went home sick. The reason why bring up that commercial because you started off this conference call by saying things fueled quote pretty good. And I know you're tying that to the job growth discussion decelerating underperforming your expectations, but they're – you also lobbed a lot of other things that sort of paying a relatively good picture for you guys. So I'm just curious, am I over reading your sort of your body language? Or are you really thinking that things could decelerate from here just judging from the way you described it right at the outset.
Michael Schall: Well, that's an interesting feedback. That was, I don't think that is our desired goal to be negative on the call at all. We feel pretty good about things, and again, we're off to a good start this year. Yes, I would say, having said that jobs are the locomotive of rent growth. And so if we see any pickup in on the job front, I think it would be it's appropriate that we bring that up. A lot of those seem like it happened in the first quarter again, there was a huge amount of disruption, stock market, government shutdown, et cetera and so I guess our inclination or hope would be to believe that things will get back to normal as seems like the U.S. economy is doing pretty well and things will be in good shape. So we don't know and we're just trying to make sure we do a good job of essentially shown what we know with you.
Q – Rich Anderson: All okay guys, you always do a great job about – just seeing it - called away states that I meant as a complement really but just wanted to judge or bigger picture view of things. And second is this Q2 not in New York, a good thing for Seattle or the non-event for Seattle?
Michael Schall: I think it's a good thing for Seattle. I mean Amazon –hey, I would say all of these tech companies that have these incredible growth rates, they're going to find ways to grow within the cities that are headquartered in or nearby or else if they can if they can't grow there. So I think all of them have similar perspectives and what are we going to do, how we going to grow, how we're going to pursue our opportunities and they're either going to be successful in working with the local political structure. All they're going to move elsewhere, if that's my view and in this case the political structure elsewhere turned out to be maybe more challenging than the Seattle marketplace and some others. So it led to a different decision.
John Burkart: I would just add that it may turn out to be a lot better for Bellevue as well. We are seeing more and more and getting more indications in the broker channels that there's a lot more interest in the East side, which does make sense. I think they have acknowledged that there have a tremendous supply concentration in downtown Amazon does in the downtown Seattle and they're looking to expand and it seems like the side is the beneficiary part of that.
Operator: Our next question is from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford: There was an article this week in the New York Times about the 2020 presidential candidates courting Renner's. It sounds like a few of them are supporting tax credits on rent. Do you think something like that could be impactful on demand and propensity to rent?
Michael Schall: It's a good question and I think anything that helps with the affordability issue will continue to spill more production housing and increased demand and all those types of things, because I think when you start pushing affordability start having more double absent and other things that destroy demand. So I think it would help incrementally but I think that again the broader political discussion is one that is continuing to evolve. And I think it's a healthier discussion as id said earlier in my comments that it's a more balanced discussion between the need for housing on the one hand and how to have protections and a pretty high level with respect to the residents and the tradeoffs are being I think appreciated by politicians to a greater extent than they have in the past. It's a good thing.
Karin Ford: And then my second question is with all the IPO money coming into Northern California, do you think we might be nearing a tipping point on condo conversion economics?
Michael Schall: It's another good question and it's interesting in the past year, the price of a for-sale home has not really moved a whole heck of a lot. So we've continued on the perfect side to have rents grow which of course gets capped out and home prices really haven't done that much. Having said that a year ago we had incredible, incredibly large increases in for sale prices. So in the past year actually condo conversions became less appealing when you compare the value of the building. As an apartment versus the value of the building as a condo. So no help there.
Operator: Our next question is from Shirley Wu with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Shirley Wu: So Mike, coming back to Amazon and in your further remarks, you mentioned that they have around 11,000 job postings and with news of I'm moving from the operation in terms of that. Now, have you, would you think of, do you think there'll be any changes fundamentals in those, in those markets on supplier demand side, especially in relation to your asset?
Michael Schall: Yes, I'll grab that. Clearly Amazon is a major force in downtown Seattle and we don't see that changing. We think they're continual will have continual demand pressure there, but we do see the benefit of some of these movements to Bellevue. We're seeing more than Amazon there's other companies that are expanding out into Bellevue and recognizing the quality opportunity out there. So we think that will benefit our portfolio, which frankly most of our portfolio is outside of downtown, it's on the east side and a little bit north and south. So yes, we do see the benefit of that in the Belvieu area.
Shirley Wu: And so on job growth, obviously you mentioned in January. That was at 90 basis points and you're maintaining job growth at one, two. So is that due partially to the conservatism originally baked in that number or do you how comfortable you feel with that number? And I guess what could change that would make you change your mind to either provide that up or down?
Michael Schall: Sure. The numbers are pretty volatile to begin with. And last year, as I mentioned in the Orange County, San Diego and LA had benchmark revisions between 50 and 100 basis points, pretty substantial benchmark revision. So, we all focused on what's going on. It's the only number we have and we look at that, but then we look for other checks and balances and that's in part why we look at office space, we look at absorption, rents and other factors and try to triangulate and make sense of it. Our belief was last year that Orange County was it falling apart and then with benchmark revisions came out. It showed it wasn't falling apart. It actually had solid job growth. We expect the same thing for this year and we don't have any particular reason to change the expectations at this point in time. I think it will kind of come together nicely. We do see some weakness and that's why I pointed out to LA, because we're seeing a little bit of weakness in the rental market. And then that does tie to the jobs market and it kind of becomes a confirming item there, if that makes sense.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: There seems to be a little bit more moving parts heading into the peak leasing season. I am just wondering if you can update us on the strategy for the broader portfolio, as I recall, it was to push rate this year. Is that still the case?
Michael Schall: Yes, that absolutely is again our, our position is, again we try to communicate clearly and transparently so, April was a little bit weaker. We don't expect that to be the year, we expect it to be a good year and we are continuing with the strategy we started with and that is to continue to favor rental rates over occupancy, we expect that in 2019, our occupancy will be about 20 basis points below the prior year. And that we are moving forward. As Mike mentioned, it's probably more or less some noise that's going on, but we do want to be transparent in what we see.
Wes Golladay: And then looking at going back to that preferred equity investment portfolio. Do you have a set repayment schedule or do these things have extensions, those -- that you really baked into the guidance?
Michael Schall: I know they have, they have a maturity date. All of them do. And again, as Angela said, potentially can change, it can be moved up or back dependent upon conditions. we received several that have had early repayments given our refinance and completion of construction and some others where we've carried on with a preferred equity investment at a lower outstanding balance for years following the completion just depends. So we’ve - seat at the table is really the key point as it relates to the yield to maturity of the preferred equity investment but on all of them, there is a maturity date.
Wes Golladay: And then I guess maybe I'm not sure if you have it offhand, but should we model like 19, 20, 21 a breakup 50 to 100 million a year repayments, or is any sort of sense you can give us on how we should look at, we know the investment level, we just don't really have the repayment level.
Michael Schall: Yes, I guess you have - the challenge of course from our perspective is to not take something that's inherently a good thing and make it a headwind down the road. So we're trying to size the program, so that our essentially origination will offset the maturities. So to the extent that we do a good job of that that I think that, everything is everything is good. The reason why we don't want to grow the program to a huge level is because we don't want to be in a position that we're rolling it down over time. So we want to keep going, as long as we can. Angela, do you have a comment on what the typical maturity is for that program?
Angela Kleiman: Well, I mean, I think if you want to target. So let me step back, I mean, our program is about $400 million. They tend to have a three-year term. So for modeling purposes, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 is probably reasonable. Having said that, keep in mind that we also guide to every year at the midpoint somewhere else. 75. So there will be an offset and so if you are going to have roll off, you don't want to say a whole 1/3 of them roll off because then you'll have pretty odd numbers.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to your host, Mr. Michael Schall.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today, we are looking forward to many of you to seeing many of you at NAREIT. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. Statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company’s filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone’s time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you and welcome to the ESS fourth quarter earnings call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. Today I will review our 2018 results, summarize our expectations for 2019 and provide an update on the West Coast investment markets. Before beginning, I would like to recognize John Eudy whose retirement was announced last month for his many contributions to the company’s success over the past 30 plus years. Turning to the first topic, 2018 was another solid year for Essex with 5.5% core FFO per share growth and 2.9% same property NOI growth both slightly better than anticipated at the start of the year. To put 2018 results into a broader perspective, ESS has generated a 16% compounded annual total return to shareholders since its IPO 24 years ago ranking us number 1 in total shareholder return for the REIT industry since the IPO. Over that period, we achieved an 8.5% compounded annual growth rate in FFO per share and a dividend that has grown for 24 consecutive years. Next month, our board will consider increasing our dividend for the 25th year, placing us among a select group of company known as Dividend Aristocrats. Achieving these results was as much about discipline as it was about being opportunistic, especially as it relates to capital allocation. We have found that avoiding major mistakes and understanding the local real estate markets has led to winning formula. To use a baseball analogy, our goal is to get many base hits while minimizing unforced errors. Although 2018’s 5.5% FFO growth is below our historical average, it is consistent with later phases of an economic cycle and the challenges in finding investments that add to per share, core FFO and NAV. While we are proud of our nearly 25-year track record as a public company, our team remains focused on continuous improvement of our platform for the next 25 years as it relates to residents, colleagues and shareholders. Setting the stage for 2019, we continue to see strong levels of housing demand relative to the national average across our West Coast footprint. We ended 2018 with trailing 3-month job growth in the Essex metros of 2.1%, which exceeded our initial expectations. The primary drivers of the out-performance were the tech markets of San Jose and Seattle, where we saw a strong increase in high-quality jobs during the quarter compared to 1 year ago. We believe this trend will continue as tech firms continue to expand in our markets. Over the past year, job openings in California and Washington at the top 10 public tech firms all of which are located in Essex markets grew 49% to over 23,000 open positions, the highest level we have seen since we started tracking this data several years ago. While considerable recent attention has focused on the announced expansion of large tech companies in other areas of the country, we would like to note that these very same companies were pursuing nearly twice as much growth in their West Coast markets during the same time period as demonstrated on Page S-16.1 of the supplemental. Turning to 2019, we continue to expect the tight labor markets and low unemployment will continue to push wages upward. In 2018, personal income growth was estimated at 6% in our markets compared to 3.9% for the U.S. We believe this outperformance will continue into 2019. As a result of wages growing faster than rents, we continue to see rent to income ratios decline in nearly all of our markets as compared to a year ago leading to improved rental affordability. Our supply estimates for 2019 have not changed from what we published in our third quarter supplemental. Overall, we expect a similar level of supply deliveries in 2019 as compared to 2018 although there are significant differences by market such as large increases in apartment deliveries in downtown LA and CBD Oakland offset by reduced apartment deliveries in Orange County and San Diego. Last quarter, we discussed the change in methodology for estimating apartment supply by factoring construction delays into our forecast. This resulted in pushing the delivery of 3,000 multifamily units from 2018 to 2019 resulting in a supply delivery estimate of roughly 35,000 units for 2018. Looking back to our original supply estimates at the beginning of 2018, we overestimated multifamily supply by 8% primarily due to construction delays while third-party providers overestimated 2018 supply by as much as 65%. The improved accuracy of our multifamily supply estimates reflect several process improvements implemented by our research team who track and frequently visit apartment communities under development. Although we are monitoring several macro related risks to the economy, steady supply levels and healthy job growth support our expectation that rent growth will be mostly consistent with long-term averages for the Essex markets in 2019. Turning to investment market conditions, a review of transactions on our West Coast markets since the last quarterly call suggests no change to cap rates. The heightened market volatility in December resulted in a few deals being dropped. However, conditions have since stabilized. Generally, cap rates do not move quickly and the first indication of changing conditions is often lower transaction volumes. With plenty of capital still looking to buy apartments and tempered Fed expectations for interest rates, we expect little change to cap rates in the near future. We continue to view the best risk adjusted returns on our investment dollars will be found in the preferred equity market and we expect to close a few more deals in 2019 given our current pipeline. That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. For the full year, we achieved 2.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth exceeding our original guidance. I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and focus on achieving these results. Overall, our markets are stronger today than 1 year ago. In the fourth quarter, market rents were 3.5% higher at the end of 2018 compared to 2017. Consistent with my comments last quarter related to the strengthening of the market and our related operating strategy, we expect to continue emphasizing market rent over higher occupancy in 2019. Our 2019 guidance contemplates a reduction of occupancy of about 20 basis points to 96.6% for the full year. Regarding expenses, we continue to see pressure in 2019 in utilities, taxes and wages with offsets in other categories largely controllables leading to operating expense guidance of 3% year-over-year for 2019 at the midpoint. The operating team continues to do a great job of identifying opportunities to increase efficiencies in the operating platform. In 2018, they had held controllable expenses to 1.6% year-over-year growth and in 2019 they are expected to do about the same. Office leasing activity provides insight into future rental demand. We are encouraged by the robust office leasing environment and continued office construction announcements in the second half of 2018, which we have illustrated for the major public tech companies on Page S-16.1 of the supplemental. I will provide more regional detail on this leasing activity in my market commentary. In terms of supply, the focus of new apartment deliveries continues to be in the downtown locations. Overall in 2019, we expect that supply deliveries as a percentage of stock will be 2.8% in the downtown markets versus 60 basis points in the suburban areas surrounding the CBDs of the largest coastal cities. Essex’s portfolio is not concentrated in the downtown locations and therefore should be less impacted by new supply. Now, I will provide an update on our markets. For the full year of 2018, Seattle had its strongest year since 2000 with 3.4% year-over-year job growth. Although Amazon announced the second and third headquarter location, Amazon’s open positions for Washington have increased over 150% from Q4 2017. In Q4 2018, there were almost 9,000 openings at Amazon and Washington. Other major employers in the Pacific Northwest hit major milestones in their continued plans to expand the Pacific Northwest offices, including Microsoft breaking ground on their 2.5 million square foot expansion in Redmond; Costco receiving city approval for their 1.2 million square foot expansion in Issaquah; and Facebook’s new lease of over 1 million square feet in South Lake Union. Additionally, Amazon and Facebook continue to expand outside of Downtown Seattle pre-leasing 750,000 square feet office in Bellevue, Washington. Moving to Northern California, job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.3% year-over-year in Q4 led by San Jose with 3.2% growth the vast majority of which occurred in high paying industries such as professional and business services and information. Tech companies, Google, Facebook and DoorDash, expanded their downtown San Francisco presence by over 2 million square feet. In the South Bay, Google was active in purchasing over $1 billion worth of land and property while expanding their Sunnyvale and Mountain View footprint by over 400,000 square feet. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the same period was led by our San Mateo and San Jose submarkets with 4.2% and 3.2% growth respectively, followed by Fremont at 2.9%, Oakland at 2.1% and San Francisco with 1.7% growth for the same period. Supply in the San Francisco and San Jose MDs is slightly lower in 2019 compared to 2018. However, we see supply in the Oakland MD increasing to 3,500 units, of which 3,000 units will be delivered in downtown Oakland. Although the total supply in the Bay Area is still relatively low at 70 basis points, it will be impactful in downtown Oakland. Continuing South, Southern California job growth for our markets averaged 1.2% in Q4, which was negatively impacted by Orange County. Los Angeles remained consistent with the region posting 1.4% growth for the period. Netflix continues to solidify their presence in the market pre-leasing an additional 355,000 square feet in Hollywood. Google and Facebook both completed deals to expand a combined 860,000 square feet in West LA. Year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was led by our Woodland Hills and West LA submarkets, with 4.7% and 4.3% growth respectively trailed by Long Beach with 2.8% growth and Tri-Cities with 2.4% growth, while LA CBD remains flat. Regarding supply, I have had similar comment for downtown LA as in Oakland. Although the supply overall in LA County is relatively low at 60 basis points, the concentration in downtown LA is significant. We expect deliveries in downtown LA to increase from about 2,000 units in 2018 to about 4,000 units in 2019. In Orange County, jobs in the fourth quarter grew 30 basis points year-over-year and actually turned negative when looking at December 2018 over the prior year’s period. A similar situation occurred in the numbers last year and it was revised with the annual benchmarking in March, which we will review closely this year. Finally, in San Diego year-over-year job growth was 1.9% for the fourth quarter of 2018. Most of the job growth is attributed to jobs added in high paying industries. In addition to tech giant Apple’s plan for a campus in Austin, the company also announced goals to add over 1,000 employees in San Diego as well as Culver City and Seattle. Military activity will have a moderate impact in the market on the margins with one carrier having departed at the beginning of the year and the potential of two inbound carriers arriving later in the year, each carrier strike group has an estimated 7,500 crew members. Year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4.2% for our North City submarket, 3.9% for Oceanside, and 2.4% in Chula Vista. Currently, our portfolio is at 97% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. Today, I will focus on our 2019 guidance followed by an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. The key assumptions supporting our 2019 forecast starts on Page 4 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. We are guiding to a midpoint of 3% for both same property revenue and expense growth. The revenue growth assumptions is primarily driven by our expectation of a steady market rent growth near the long-term average and for our West Coast markets to continue to outperform the U.S. average. On core FFO guidance, we are expecting a growth rate of 3.7% at the midpoint. You mentioned on the third quarter call that there are two key headwinds impacting this growth rate. First is debt refinancing as the effective rate on the debt coming due is below current rates in the marketplace. Second is the lease up of our development pipeline. When a building first opens, even though it is vacant, we recognize the operating and associated interest expense. This effect creates a temporary drag on cash flow. Since over 85% of our development pipeline will start lease up this year, we anticipate a more meaningful FFO per share drag of between $0.05 to $0.10 in 2019. Once the buildings are stabilized which typically takes 12 to 18 months per phase, we expect the drag to become a tailwind. Turning to capital markets activities, for the year, Essex was a net seller of assets as we arbitrage between private market yields and our cost of capital. During the fourth quarter, we sold 8th & Hope in Downtown Los Angeles for $220 million, which represents a cap rate close to mid 3%. We purchased this property over 3 years ago for $200 million which we funded with common stock when we were trading at a large premium to net asset value. Recently, using the proceeds from the sale of this property, we have repaid debt and repurchased stock, because we have been trading at a discount to net asset value. Since the beginning of 2018, we have repurchased $108 million of stock at an average price of $243.44. Currently, our 2019 guidance does not assume any additional stock repurchase other than what has been completed through January. As always, we remain disciplined capital allocators and are ready to adjust our plan depending on market conditions to maximize shareholder returns. Lastly, on the balance sheet, we plan to repay about $880 million of debt in 2019. This includes pre-paying a $290 million secured loan that matures in 2020 without incurring any prepayment fees. We generally favor refinancing on maturities with long term unsecured debt subject to relative pricing of course. As for the $290 million loan prepayment, we had discussed on our previous call that the average pay rates on this debt is 5.7%, while the effective rate used to calculate GAAP interest expense is 3.8%. So, even though the FFO impact will be negative, we will generate annual cash savings of approximately $3 million. In summary, our balance sheet remains strong, with only 25% leverage, 5.4x debt to EBITDA, and over $1.5 billion of liquidity. We are well-positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise in 2019. That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Wondering if you can talk about the same-store revenue growth throughout 2019 given difficult occupancy comps seen at least in the first quarter and probably for the first half of the year?
John Burkart: Yes, sure. This is John. The first quarter is going to be a little bit tougher and part of it because of some noise that we had from other income, the benefit of other income last year. So the year-over-year comps are a little tougher. For example, in January, our rental revenue on preliminary numbers is 3%, but the actual revenue, overall revenue is 2.6%. So, it will come out looking less than desirable, but the reality is the market is actually stronger this year than it was last year. So overall, we are in a better position, but the first quarter numbers would be lighter and then it will pickup throughout the year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on development, it looks like two of the projects were delayed by a quarter and I recognize that that could be a shift of only a few weeks. So are these projects actually seeing delays or is it more normal quarterly shift?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. The labor issue delayed a couple of our deals. They are actually only pushed out about a 1.5 month, but it pushed it into the next quarter, so that was the reason behind it.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Trent Trujillo: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the commentary on supply in different markets, but it looks like there is a lot of supply that’s scheduled to deliver in the Bay Area. So, how are you thinking about your ability to retain residents, perhaps maintain occupancy and drive rent growth, because I believe one of your peers cited recently that the new assets could have rents that are at 15% to 20% discounts to existing products? So do you think that will be a drawing point or do you see enough demand that it may not be much of an ultimate impact?
Michael Schall: Hi, Trent, this is Mike. Thanks for your question. Yes, we continue to see the Bay Area as the area that has the strongest job growth and the strongest economy. And if you look at overall levels of supply, we think 2019 will be somewhere around 1% of stock on the apartment side and 0.7% of stock on total supply in the Bay Area. So obviously we are growing jobs at 2%. Those numbers do not appear to be concerning. And the other point I would make is there is sort of a trend toward fewer for-sale units being built and a few more apartments being built and the for-sale component is impacted by higher mortgage rates and higher prices. I think California had a median home price increase of somewhere around 5% over the past year. So, the for-sale side is getting more expensive and I think that, that benefits the rental. But when we look basically at supply and demand, we think demand significantly outstrips supply as it relates to all housing and apartments as well.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, great. And then maybe one for John Eudy, this might be one of the last times we can ask about this with your transition, but you took a lead role in the Prop 10 campaign. So maybe can you provide your latest thoughts on affordability measures and maybe let us know about the efforts you have seen and been involved in and what you think could be a potential resolution to the housing shortage and affordability issues in California?
John Eudy: Well, that is a very long-winded question I’ll do my best to answer it first off, as you know, Prop 10 was defeated handsomely 60/40 by 20 points and I think the leadership of the legislature and our new governor understand that repealing Costa-Hawkins was not good for California and California housing so that’s good as far as all the measures that are out there to create more housing, it gets back to the economic drivers and how we’re going to make it work I can’t speak to how some of the affordable housing solutions that have been bantered around at the legislature are actually going to get done, but there is discussion but as you well know, the economics have to work for anything to be built, and it’s been tough the last couple of years to even keep up with the supply demands that we’ve had so I don’t see it blowing up, if you will, meaning unabated amount of construction beginning to occur it is going to be a long struggle in California and a deep hole for housing shortage, if you will, and it’s going to take a long time to get out of it there is a lot of focus on post Prop 10, what can we do if anything and I think that’s being discussed if there are any amendments to or call it reform to Costa-Hawkins, they would be very minor is my expectation.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Shirley Wu: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So going back to your revenue guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, how comfortable are you with that range? And what do you think it will take to get to the upper versus the lower end range in terms of rents and occupancy?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John speaking. We are very comfortable with our range and obviously with our midpoint at this point in time the markets right now are stronger than they were a year ago we mentioned at the last call, we had a better loss to lease position, which puts us in a good spot we shifted our strategy where we’re favoring market rent as opposed to occupancy so all those things lead to a stronger market at the same time though there are some headwinds, because of the occupancy headwinds I mentioned about 20 basis points of occupancy headwind that will work against us what would make things better or worse is really jobs I would say if the jobs we’re watching that Orange County jobs I mentioned that and if that turns out unfavorable that will hurt that market. It’s not a huge market but will hurt that we are seeing some stronger job growth certainly in Seattle and the Bay Area so that would be the upside and the downside would be Orange County jobs does that answer your question?
Shirley Wu: Yes. So actually also on supply, you mentioned that right now you have a good slippage into ’19 but it seems as if slippage is a consistent theme, so have you accounted for slippage from ‘19 into ‘20 into your projection?
John Burkart: Yes, this is John. What we made shift last year because you’re right, it is a fairly consistent theme where we go out and we drive all of the assets and look and make an assessment as to where they’re at, come up with our best judgment as to the timing but even then, there is errors just because of the labor shortage and the slippage so what we adjusted is we continued that process of driving every asset, but then we made a more of a macro adjustment based on our experience that we have over the last several years to modify that so we’re more confident this year than in the past as it relates to our supply expectations, but, yeah, I acknowledge it’s the last couple of years have been tough because of the delays.
Shirley Wu: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi there. Question, when you look at your forecasts for supply versus third-party forecasts for 2019 are there still material differences? And do you think they’ve got a handle on the timing of completions at this point?
Michael Schall: Hi Austin, it’s Mike Schall. As John just alluded to, we spent a lot of time on the supply estimates and that’s largely because there are such a high degree of variation out there in terms of estimates as I noted in my comments that some of the vendors had 65% more supply in 2018 than was actually delivered and typically that just moves into the next year and then the next year appears to be overstated so without making a systematic adjustment, like the one we made, to move 3,000 units from this year to next year and then do the same thing from ‘19 to ‘20, you end up with these huge numbers that are out there that are well beyond reality in our opinion so we think that similar to ‘17 and ‘18, there’ll be around 35,000 units per year that are delivered in our West Coast markets unless something changes in the construction labor market, which candidly we don’t see, it was the point we made last time on last quarter’s call, that I don’t know how you could expect a significant increase in the amount of supply when the labor market hasn’t fundamentally changed and in fact, I would say that there are demographic issues within the construction labor market, because there are more people retiring and going into the trade and you also have, maybe as an anecdote, people, construction workers diverted to some of these fire destroyed areas that are taking people out of the labor markets in some of the metro areas and moving them into the areas that had these fires so without a fundamental change in construction labor, I don’t see how you could possibly produce a tremendous number of more homes makes sense?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, that’s an interesting anecdote. Thanks for that. Do you think once we pass peak construction or peak supply deliveries in a specific quarter and that pipeline begins to slow that there is I don’t know if you call it a greater risk or greater likelihood that projects are completed on time?
Michael Schall: Yes, I think I’d go back to what John Eudy just said, it’s all about the economics so for the past couple of years we’ve had rents growing at somewhere around 3%, 2% to 3%, and construction costs have been growing at the high single digit to low double-digit rate and so the net effect of those two numbers is to compress development yields and this is why I think it’s unlikely that you’re going to have a significant increase in the number of units developed from a from the perspective of just economics in terms of development economics and really this underlies our switch from direct development where we’re buying land and for future start and concern therefore about that construction cost increase between when we commit to land and when we start and rather than that focus on our preferred equity portfolio where we’re financing someone else’s development deal and we are coming in at the point that we know the cost because they have a construction loan, they are signing a contract with the general contractor etcetera. so, we think that’s a low risk, more appropriate way to approach development at this point in time.
Austin Wurschmidt: I appreciate the thoughts, Mike. And then last one for me is, you talked about downtown LA significant concentration of supply doubling in ‘19 versus ’18 can you just speak to the concession trends you’re seeing as well as what your guys’ exposure is in the market now following the sale of 8th and Hope?
Michael Schall: John, do you want to do that? [indiscernible]
John Burkart: Sure, I’ll grab that. Yes, so what we are seeing now as far as concessions in that market is it’s pretty consistent with what we typically see in the fourth quarter because again reminding everybody that it’s the lower point in the season so concessions are up a couple of weeks, they are now roughly 6, 6 to 8 weeks in the downtown LA market, specifically as it relates to lease-ups, not same-store but lease-ups and that’s fairly normal we one might expect with the new supply coming on this year that it might get more aggressive, we’ll watch that carefully as it relates to our exposure in the downtown market for LA, our exposure is pretty small. It’s right now, a couple of percent of the whole portfolio, it’s really not very big at this point after that sale does that answer your question?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, absolutely. That was very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes, good morning out there. So two questions. First, on the operating expense, you guys talked about your ability to really make headway on the controllables to offset the payroll utility and taxes, but it certainly seems Mike to your comments on labor shortage, seems like payroll wages is going to be a continuing pressure point so can you just talk ongoing you said that you could manage it this year do you think that’s sustainable or do you think that expenses are going to rise in the future if you guys are unable to further control the controllables?
John Burkart: Yes, Alex, this is John. I will take a stab at it. I know you said, Mike, but I’ve got the controllables in my bucket here so as it relates to wages, you’re right, there is significant pressure out there let’s not forget that one of our issues is affordability and so as wages go up, it does help the overall picture much, much more so if this was a long-term trend that would actually be very beneficial for affordability and therefore rents but getting back to your specific question, sure, in the end of the day it goes up forever, we will run out of potentially run out of opportunities but we continue to find ways to leverage the asset collections that we have with sharing of personnel to reduce total labor while we are still paying our people significantly more so everybody is winning in that equation we are also finding opportunities to leverage technology to automate various processes and in doing so improving the customer experience, making things much faster as well as our employee experience and again reducing labor or vendor costs so what we see for the foreseeable future is a lot of opportunity, but a tremendous amount of work with change management to try to implement the different things that we’re looking at.
Michael Schall: Does that answer your question there?
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes, yes, it does and I was referencing Mike’s comments on wage with construction labor but actually now I am going to turn to Angela on the guidance page it looks like capitalized interest is expected to be higher, if I’m reading the guidance page correctly, and it so if you could just talk, are you guys anticipating increasing the development pipeline? I mean, it didn’t sound that way, but if you could just walk through why capitalized interest looks to be higher in ‘19 than ‘18?
Angela Kleiman: Oh, sure and I am happy to Alex that’s really just a function of our current development pipeline we still have about $250 million a little over $250 million of spend this year and because of that capitalized interest is going to naturally increase so it’s nothing more than just how those numbers work out.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thanks Angela.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: Good morning. I think Mike in your prepared remarks, you mentioned preferred equity as your most attractive risk-adjusted returns for your dollar spend yet your guidance for this year anticipates only $50 million to $100 million which is less than what you’ve invested last year and on top of that you expect to be a net seller this year. So just wondering if we should read into that that most investment opportunities are getting pricy?
Michael Schall: Yes, John, it’s a good observation. Thanks for that. I think it has to do with the other point I made a minute ago which is construction cost increasing faster than rents and a lot of these deals are being pushed back in fact, most of our pipeline in 2019 represents the deals that we thought were going to close in 2018 and it just essentially has been pushed back so they require typically more equity than some of the sponsors originally thought they would and otherwise need to be reworked so basically it’s taken us a longer period of time to get the preferred equity deals to the closing table and so we remain optimistic in 2019 we actually have a very good pipeline right now and so perhaps just a little bit of upside to the guidance assumption but again, given the inherent uncertainty, we are we want to make sure we had a level that we could for sure close.
John Kim: Okay. And then John mentioned Orange County and the slight loss of jobs that occurred in December, it doesn’t sound like you’re concerned about it too much at this point, but you’re still maintaining your 20,000 jobs forecast for the year I’m just wondering if you had to reduce that job forecast, how sensitive would that be to your market trend forecast?
Michael Schall: Yes, John, this is Mike and John will follow me. Job growth there is 1.2% and job growth in Southern California is about 1.3% so I don’t think that we have been aggressive on jobs I think we’re being thoughtful and realistic so all of these assumptions can vary to some degree and but I think if you look back historically, we have been pretty close on virtually everything and if anything maybe a little bit conservative.
John Burkart: Yes. And I would just add, you remember last year with Orange County, the jobs were pretty flat and then the revisions came through and they revised back a whole bunch of jobs. We’re watching that situation. I’m not sure if that’ll happen again or not, but we’re watching that closely. We’re not seeing signs that the market is having great struggles. I just want to bring it up on the call so people are aware and seeing what we see that there was a negative print in jobs in December.
John Kim: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning.
Michael Schall: Hi, Drew.
Drew Babin: A question – hey, going into next year, obviously, there were quite a few markets where you had a pickup in kind of the second derivative of leasing in 2018. In your guidance, are you assuming that any markets has another second derivative improvement in pricing power for 2019 guidance purposes?
John Burkart: I wouldn’t say it that way. I would look at it and say, we expect the markets to continue to stay strong. We had a – really a shift in the market and it goes all the way back to ‘17 when things were slow in the first half of ‘18 and then they shifted – clearly shifted. We see a continued strength in the market, but not necessarily something really taking off, but we do see continued strength in the market and we look at factors like the Northern California job growth, the Seattle job growth and consistency in the SoCal region again with the exception of Orange County and expect that things will continue pretty good over the next year, again, with supplies generally in check overall in the larger markets.
Drew Babin: Okay, that’s helpful. And I guess kind of converting that over to loss to lease language, it would seem based on your market rent forecast for ‘19, as well as some of the comments on loss to lease, towards the end of ‘18 that revenue growth would maybe be a bit higher than implied by the midpoint of guidance. I know you talked about the 20 basis points of occupancy decline. I guess, can you quantify the piece of that kind of caused by overall deceleration in property fee income growth or kind of what’s the drag being created by that?
John Burkart: Let me kind of walk through big picture the way I look at it. Typically, again, and thank you for referencing loss to lease, to Essex it’s one of the key metrics along with market rent and of course occupancy adjustment, that’s how we look at it. And so, when looking at loss to lease, we typically like to look at it in September. It’s after peak leasing and before things slow down in the normal seasonal slowdown. So, at that point we had about 1.6% for the portfolio loss to lease, and again, on average with 12 month leases, you’re going to figure, you’re going to get all of that over the next year. Then, if you look at our rent in S-16, it’s 3.1% and if you look at that and say we’re going to take a mid-year convention on how that hits the market, that gets you about another 155 basis points. And then if you take the 20 basis points of occupancy and subtract that out, that gets you into about the 2.95% range for revenue and we’re pretty darn close to that at 3%. So that big picture how we kind of look at it and see it the year, so I think we are pretty spot on with our 3% midpoint guidance.
Drew Babin: Okay. The explanation is very helpful. And lastly just in Seattle, it would seem based on some of the data out there and some commentary that supply is beginning to kind of directionally shift from downtown out more towards the East side and also some news about tech firms possibly getting behind the creation of additional kind of lower and middle income housing out on the East side. I guess are you seeing anything in the market at this point in time any kind of disruption and what kind of visibility can you provide about some of those East side submarkets around Seattle?
Michael Schall: Well, yes, I think you’re right, Drew. There is more development on the East side than there have been in West. It was – development was very focused on Downtown Seattle first and then Downtown Bellevue and then now it’s moving more into the suburban areas of Seattle. And – but we see an overall trend of reduced supply in the Seattle area more broadly. So in ‘18, we had 9,750 units in Seattle being delivered 9,019 and then about little over 6,000 in 2020. So, we think actually that the supply side is actually going in the right direction. And then the other side is, obviously the demand side, which continues to be very robust. So – and maybe the other piece, which is affordability, which we were bit concerned about more in the California markets, Seattle is much more affordable. So, we still view Seattle as being an appropriate area to invest. And as you can tell from our 2019 expectation, it’s just a small bit below our expectation for market rent growth compared to Southern Cal and Northern Cal.
Drew Babin: Great. Appreciate the explanation. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Yes, good morning to everyone. Go and look at that 8th and Hope transaction, it was described as an arbitrage, and I’m just wondering – it looks like you bought all the stock in the last week of the quarter. Is it – was it conceivable that you guys could actually sell the asset and buy the stock in a one-week period or were you contemplating that maybe throughout the entire quarter?
Michael Schall: Yes, hey Wes, it’s Mike. Yes, I guess we hope to buy the stock if we could. If we didn’t buy the stock, we thought that debt rates could increase to a point that there was still positive arbitrage just kind of smaller refinance for example. So, it was going to be positive arbitrage no matter what happened in our view. But obviously the opportunity to buy the stock back was the better outcome and we’re pretty excited about it.
Wes Golladay: Yes. Well, congrats on buying the bottom. Big picture though when you’re selling assets at a 3.5% cap rate, which I believe you cited, do you think eventually if there’s more transactions like that developers will start to lower their hurdle and then maybe this whole low interest rate environment could just be maybe negative long-term for overall rent growth?
Michael Schall: Well, it’s pretty challenging on this side to respond to hypothetical type of questions, but because our view is, it’s all a matter of looking at the landscape, a variety of different points of view. So, in that case, I guess what you’re talking about is higher valuations of apartments are going to increase. The next question I would ask you is, hey, does that mean that the stock price is going to increase too and our cost of capital is going to decline, because again, we are constantly looking at what’s better. The real estate portfolio or the value implied in the stock and trying to understand that so we make good capital allocation decisions. So, to ask a question that just focuses on one variable without the other variable is challenging to answer. Does that make sense?
Wes Golladay: No, that’s fair point. And I definitely agree with the way you look at it from the relative value of your stock. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Michael Schall: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on the supply and adjustment there, obviously, you guys have the best view into the market, you guys drive around, you view these assets, I’m just wondering, what’s causing the delay beyond just the labor issues. So, if you look at assets that are maybe high-rise versus something that’s more mid-rise, is the high-rise more likely to be delayed than the mid-rise, are there certain kinds of projects that are more likely to be delayed? What kind of color can you add on the delays, specifically?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. I’ll try to answer that. The more complicated the structure obviously, the higher likelihood that there could be more delays as everything stacks up on itself. The general labor issues that the industry has faced over the last year specifically has been the driver and the out-migration of the older construction folks that are no longer there like they were 10 years ago as part of the answer. So, it’s a little bit of everything, Hardik, but yes, the more complex the construction, the higher likelihood there would be delays in this environment for the next 12 months, say.
Hardik Goel: And is that just on a construction basis or also complexity on the capital structure side that you notice?
John Eudy: Well, I was just referring to construction, but on the capital, obviously, the numbers have to work to want to do a deal, but you’ve already committed once you start it, so it’s in the pipeline. So, I was only referring to the pipeline when I responded.
Hardik Goel: Well, thanks so much, John, and best of luck as you retire.
John Eudy: Well, I’ll never retire, but I’m not going to be working 24/7.
Michael Schall: We’re not going to let John go that easy.
John Eudy: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
John Guinee: Great, thank you. First, John, we’re going to miss you, it’s been a great 30 years, boy.
John Eudy: 34, just to be exact, not that I’m counting.
John Guinee: 34, wow. You have started there when you were 16, wow. Any 1031 Exchange requirements on 8th and Hope? And then other two questions, any promote income identified in 2019 and then refresh our memory and if you already did this and I missed it, I apologize, how you handle the Costa-Hawkins costs that you incurred in 2018?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. Thanks, John. On the 8th and Hope, there is a small piece of 1031 exchange, but it’s not such a meaningful impact on the gains, because we had – we had sold back then. It was the last piece of share gain. So just a small piece. So really doesn’t impact the ultimate gain numbers in a material way and we certainly have the ability to absorb that without impacting a dividend. And as far as the Costa-Hawkins and the G&A impact we pulled that off core and we actually disclosed it separately, and I think it’s on Page 5 or 6 in the press release. But in any event the total cost, which is also public information for Costa-Hawkins is about $5.8 million for the full-year. And we don’t expect, of course, such a significant one-time item to reoccur in 2019, and so we don’t have a forecasted number.
John Guinee: Angela, any promote income expected in 2019?
Angela Kleiman: At this point, not yet, we’re still reevaluating the platform because that involves conversations with the joint venture and market conditions and there’s a lot more conversations that goes into just factoring getting a promote.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you.
Angela Kleiman: So, we certainly have a good embedded pipeline on the promote.
John Guinee: Great, thank you very much. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi, yes, good morning over there on the West Coast. Let me also add my congratulations John on your semi-retirement and Adam also congrats on the promotion. A couple of things from our end. I think we’ve talked about the cap rate on 8th and Hope. Could you just give us a sense of kind of some of the other cap rates of some of the other acquisitions you did during the quarter, as well as disposition?
Michael Schall: Sure, this is Mike. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I don’t think cap rates have changed a whole heck of a lot for A quality property and locations, it’s around a 4% cap rate. Sometimes you have very well located very high quality, let’s say, A plus, A plus plus type property that will go sub-4 cap rates. And then for B quality or let’s say, from A minus to B minus, you have a – you would add probably from 30 basis points to 60 basis points to the A cap rate. So again, very consistent with what we’ve said in the past.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. That’s helpful. And the second question, given the viewpoint on cap rates, is that one of the main reasons why you still forecast being the net seller of assets in 2019 similar to 2018?
Michael Schall: Yes, again it’s what I said earlier, it really is the relationships between the stock price and net asset value of the Company and the different components that go into each of those. Notably, for example, our debt on balance sheet is lower cost and if we go and incur debt tomorrow, which gives our balance sheet a reason to buy it versus just transact in the marketplace. So, we’re looking for the appropriate arbitrage and add value on – from the transactional side. We also need to fund our development pipeline.
Tayo Okusanya: Got it. Okay. That’s it from my end. Congrats. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Let’s say, go back to Orange County a bit and contrast it to I think it was a year ago in the Bay Area where you saw similar scary BLS job growth trajectories and that were restated. So, I understand the concern with restatements. Is it that your on-the-ground trends, which I’m guessing could be better predictors of job growth and BLS. Those on-the-ground trends a year-ago corroborated BLS type numbers, at least as I stated and this time they’re kind of telling you a different answer that on-the-ground trends and Orange County are actually a lot stronger than the BLS numbers?
John Burkart: No, this is John. So last year, it really wasn’t the Bay Area, it was Orange County that was revised up pretty substantially. And last year we saw market rent growth in the context of everything that’s going on in the sense of supply being delivered and everything else, which was pretty good. And so, it was not consistent with BLS and I would go back and say, this year it’s a similar situation. We are seeing Orange County, say, the fourth quarter rents in Orange County were 2.9% year over prior year, yet the BLS has basically flat job growth for that quarter. We also expect lower supply deliveries going forward. So, the BLS is one number that’s out there and we watch it but we look at many numbers and we’re trying to make sense of it. Right now, on-the-ground, we’re not seeing a significant deterioration. And so, we’ll watch the revisions, but we’ll continue to stay more focused on what’s really going on in the rental market.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Could you share that 2.9% growth in 4Q? What it will look like in January and what was that trend? What’s the trajectory of the trend into this year?
John Burkart: Sure. The – that is up from where it was earlier in the year and in January it’s down a little bit from there as is San Diego. Both of those markets are down a little bit, but that’s not unusual at this point in time. That’s why I quoted the fourth quarter number as a whole because one-month there is a movement that can go on within our portfolio and certainly it’s the low demand period. So not really a good reference point. That’s why I use the whole quarter, but we only have January, so January is down a little bit from there.
John Pawlowski: Okay. John Eudy on the Governor Newsom’s recent steps or planned steps to address the regional housing need allocations in certain cities. From your experience if he is successful and he does have bipartisan support, big yes, how quickly could we see starts starting to pick up in some of these cities that are forced to increase their allocation?
John Burkart: Well, as you know John in California, not taking that into consideration that 4 years to 7 years is the cycle from identification of site till you actually have a stabilized asset. And some of the ambitious things that he has said sound good, but the execution in reality by the time you go through the process and sequel even if there is some sequel reform, you’re not really going to accelerate the timing that much and the economics drive the decision anyway. So, I don’t see a near-term over the next 3 years to 5 years massive increase from what we’re expecting to see.
Michael Schall: Hey John, John, it’s Mike. I just have one more thing to add to that. And I don’t know if you saw a strike in the backyard. But I think it’s notable that the City of Huntington Beach is suing the state over some of these new requirements SB-35. So, I think that’s something that we’re going to be keeping our eye on as it relates to these matters.
John Pawlowski: Right. Okay. Thanks, guys.
John Burkart: Nimby attitudes in California are not going to change easily is what I think Mike says.
Michael Schall: That’s the point, yes, exactly.
Operator: We will take our last question from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford: Oh, hey, good morning out there. It doesn’t sound like you’re underwriting a recession in your 2019 outlook, but if we do end up going into one nationwide this year, how do you think the West Coast will fare and what do you think the downside risk could be to your job growth and market rent growth forecasts?
Michael Schall: Hi, Karin, it’s Mike. I am not sure exactly how to respond to that, because obviously it depends on what type of recession, how deep it is what happens to employment, etcetera. So, I have a hard time responding to it exactly. I would expect at the end of the cycle, conditions continue to change, jobs will trail off, the development pipelines will continue to be delivered, because once you turn a stated work, they will be finished and you’ll end up with a supply demand mismatch, but quantifying how that looks and exactly what that means I think it is virtually impossible to do at this point.
Karin Ford: Okay, fair enough. And then my second question is just on the preferred equity pipeline and book, you said in the third quarter press release that you had originated, I think an $18 million or $19 million investment in Burlingame, but the number of investments stayed at $17 million from September to December. Just I was wondering did something get paid off or did that deal just not happen?
Michael Schall: Yes. So, the typical duration of these preferred equity deals are 3 to 4 years. So yes, we are constantly having redemptions or repayments.
Karin Ford: Okay. Can you just give us a sense for what was repaid and what was the rate on it?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, it was a small deal, $6 million and the pay rate, I am just from memory was around 11%. But at this point, if you look at our total preferred equity commitment, it’s still pretty darn close to what we had disclosed last time it’s close to $400 million. So there is some inflows, there is some outflows, but net-net, we are still around that $400 million and we are well under our maximum capacity of $900 million.
Karin Ford: And is there anything – any new investment that you think is imminent in the first phase closing in the first quarter?
Angela Kleiman: That’s really hard to say, because we do as Mike said, have a good pipeline and that we are working through, but the timing of the close is just difficult to predict.
Karin Ford: Okay, thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you, Karen.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for your participation on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Citigroup conference in March. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you, Dana. I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will discuss three topics on the call today: Our third quarter results and preliminary 2019 market outlook; investment market conditions; and an update on the apartment industry’s campaign to oppose California Prop 10. First topic. Our third quarter results were mostly as expected, reflecting a solid economy and severe shortages of housing on the West Coast. We continue to experience strong demand for multifamily housing across the West Coast metros with periodic disruptions to pricing when multiple apartment lease-ups occur within a submarket, often leading to large leasing concessions and often impacting pricing at nearby stabilized communities. Job growth has continued to outperform our initial 2018 expectations across the Essex portfolio. Job growth is slightly lagging in Southern California and strong in the tech market as demonstrated by greater than 3% job growth in both Seattle and San Jose. With tight labor market conditions income growth continues to outpace rent growth, which is improving rental affordability. Per capita personal income growth in Essex metros is expected to average 5.7% in 2018, up almost 1% from year-ago and compared to 4% for the nation. As John Burkart will discuss in a moment, we have experience normal seasonal patterns in 2018, which is significantly different from 2017. Same-store revenue growth for 2018 troughed in the third quarter, mostly due to revenue strategy and year-over-year seasonal variation. Overall, market conditions are much better now as compared to year-ago and our portfolio remains well-positioned. Consistent with the strong job growth reported in the tech markets, job openings for the top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in California and Washington, increased 26% year-over-year to nearly 22,000 open positions as of September. With the dearth of skilled workers, employers continue to face shortages of qualified personnel, pushing wages upward to track employees from other areas. Turning to our market outlook for 2019. Today, we have a much better visibility into the year ahead, compared to last year. And thus, we have included our preliminary outlook for 2019 on page S-16 of the supplemental. We also provide the primary supply and demand drivers that shape our rent growth expectation. S-16 is intended to be a scenario based on the strength of the U.S. economy. We begin with the U.S. GDP and job growth estimate from third-party sources. And based on these key assumptions, we estimate job growth and housing demand in the Essex metros. As to housing supply, we drive each market to gain insight on apartment delivery timing to create quarterly estimates. Using historical relationships between housing supply, demand, and rent growth, we established our 2019 market rent growth expectations. For 2019, the U.S. economy is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Unemployment rate for the Essex markets declined 50 basis points than the past year, to 3.5%. Over the past several years, falling unemployment has contributed to job growth, although this positive impact will likely diminish going forward. We expect the West Coast economies to outperform the nation as to job growth, which we estimate at 1.8% for the Essex metros in 2019. This was about 30 basis points below the September actual job growth of 2.1%, again reflecting the impact of tight labor market conditions. For 2019, we expect 3.1% market rent growth in the Essex markets with California slightly outperforming Washington and the best results in San Jose and San Diego. Oakland is expected to lag due to increasing apartment deliveries. Reflecting the importance of economic growth in our 2019 assumptions, we produced a new graphic on page S-16.1 of the supplemental to demonstrate the outperformance of the Essex metros in terms of cumulative nominal GDP growth. Bottom-line, the Essex metros has outperformed the U.S. average and other major metros in the past five years and are well-positioned for continued leadership going forward. Turning to Supply in 2019. Our preliminary forecast assumes that multifamily supply will be relatively flat in 2019 versus 2018 in the Essex markets with significant variances in some markets. Most notably, we expect a substantial increase in apartment supply in Los Angeles and Oakland, and significant reductions in Orange County, San Diego and San Francisco. Construction labor shortages continued to be a major factor affecting apartment delivery timing, and this issue continues unabated. Thus in 2019, we made a notable change to our supply methodology on page S-16 of the supplemental by factoring delays into the estimated delivery timing of newly constructed apartments. Thus, our multifamily supply, shown on S-16 of the supplemental, has pushed roughly 8% of apartment units or around 3,000 units from 2018 into 2019 and from 2019 into 2020. For the next couple of years, we see little change in the number of apartments being built and the overall construction labor force. And therefore, there's no reason to believe that the delays will abate. With housing demand continuing to exceed supply, we believe the housing shortages on the West Coast will continue. Now, turning to my second topic, investment market conditions. 2019 is likely to be another year where escalating construction costs, driven by labor shortages and entitlement cost increased at a faster pace compared to rental revenue and net operating income. Therefore, developer yields are being compressed, creating a significant headwind to apartment construction starts. This is a challenging scenario for our direct development activities and therefore, we have not materially added to our development pipeline. Instead, we are focused primarily on providing preferred equity to third-party apartment developers in the Essex markets. At the start of 2018, we had a strong preferred equity pipeline and hope to significantly exceed our $100 million target. As it stands now, we will struggle to hit our target in 2018. Angela will comment on guidance in a moment. As it relates to acquisitions, we continue to see plenty of capital looking to buy apartment, leading cap rates relatively flat. Recent increases in interest rates have erased most of the positive leverage tailwind that we have enjoyed since 2007 as long-term apartment financing rates are now comparable to cap rate. A-property and locations continue to trade around 4% to 4.25% cap rate and sometimes sub-4 for exceptional property with B-quality property and locations generally trading 25 to 50 basis points higher. We will continue to monitor the transaction market closely. And now onto my third topic, an update on California Prop 10. As we have highlighted on prior calls, we are part of a broad coalition to close California Prop 10, would seek to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act On November 6. We are joined by other apartment companies, trade organizations, unions, veterans and a variety of pro-business groups. I think it's appropriate to recognize the extraordinary effort of those involved in the No-On-10 campaign, especially its the executive committee and co-chairs, John Eudy, and Barry Altshuler. They have successfully united the industry around a worthy cause. We believe that passing Prop 10 will intensify housing shortages, making a bad problem worse. It will likely lead to the expansion of price controls for all types of housing, which will result in less housing being built. Price controls produce longer tenancies, which in turn reduce the number of available rental units for those seeking housing and those with limited means will be at an increasing disadvantage competing from paying for housing amid greater scarcity. Finally, apartment, condo and single-family owners will have a strong economic incentive to convert rentals subject to price controls to owner-occupied housing, thereby shrinking the rental stock. Important to note that Prop 10 contains no funding for affordable housing and no requirements of additional housing be built. The state of California directs a process called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment to plan for sufficient housing supply. However, many cities don't want to create housing because of the related costs of services, including schools, police, et cetera. Gavin Newsom, a leading gubernatorial candidate, captured this issue on his website with the following comment, quote “cities have a perverse incentive not to build housing because retail generates more lucrative sales tax revenue. The bigger the box, the better, because cities can use the sales tax for core public services". As a better approach, the state has recently passed many laws that support the Regional Housing Needs Assessment which we believe are critical to increase housing production, the only viable solution to the crisis today. We also believe that more funding is needed, targeted to affordable housing. And, thus, we support California Prop 1. That concludes my comments. And I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Q3 was a good quarter. It played out as we expected, following historical seasonal pattern with the rental market peaking in July and our operating team shifting our strategy from the focus of maximizing occupancy to locking in the seasonally higher rental rates. The result was that we allowed the occupancy in our portfolio to move down 30 basis points while we achieved rents on new rentals about 3.5% above the prior year's quarter. For 2018, from a same-store revenue growth perspective, Q3 is the low point for the year due to the lower occupancy and the one-time payment in the third quarter of 2017, related to the delinquency collection from a corporate housing operator, which created an irregular comp. Adjusted for both occupancy and the one-time item, same-store revenue growth would have been 2.6% for the third quarter of 2018 or 40 basis points higher than our reported results. Overall, our concessions in Q3 2018 were down approximately 20% from the prior year for the same-store portfolio. Our renewals in the third quarter grew approximately 4.2% and they’re being sent out at approximately 4.5% for the fourth quarter. In September, our loss to lease was 1.7% versus 20 basis points in September of 2017 due to the stronger rental market we experienced this year, which positions us well for 2019. We expect the same store portfolio revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be approximately 2.9%. Although, we're not providing guidance at this time, we look to 2019 -- as we look to 2019, we see the market slightly stronger than in 2018 and our portfolio is well-positioned with the 1.7% loss to lease in September. From a revenue perspective, we’ll have headwinds related to higher occupancy costs in 2018, and we continue to face wage pressure in our markets, which is consistent with the past several years. Now moving on to an update on our markets. The Seattle market continues to be supported by strong job growth, posting year-over-year job gains of 3.7% for the third quarter of 2018, the highest job growth in the Seattle MD in any quarter for over 17 years. Looking at Amazon, job openings for the company in the market have more than doubled as of the third quarter of 2018 to a little over 7,000 open positions since the end of last year. Tech continues to be a major driver for the market during the period. Amazon, Google and T-Mobile leased over 0.5 million square feet of office space in Bellevue while Facebook has approximately 150 open jobs listed in Redmond for their virtual reality headset division and is rumored to be in the process of signing several expansion leases in the east side. With the light rail expansion into the east side scheduled to begin service in 2023, we will expect to see an increase in office leasing activity in the submarket. Same store concessions increased in the Seattle region from 80,000 in the third quarter of 2017 to 197,000 this quarter. Concessions were spread across many assets in each submarkets and were largely used as closing tools. Revenue growth in our east side and Seattle CBD submarket was relatively flat at 1.6% and 40 basis points, respectively, while the North and South submarkets grew at 2% and 3.5%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018. Our loss to lease at the end of the quarter was 1.2% for the entire market. Moving down to northern California. Job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area in Q3 averaged 2.4% year-over-year with over 76,000 jobs added. San Jose job growth was robust for the period with 3.2% year-over-year job growth while Oakland and San Francisco were both up 1.8% for the period. Notable office leases this quarter include Amazon and PwC’s combined 350,000 square-foot expansion in downtown San Francisco; on the Peninsula Facebook leased 800,000 square feet of under construction project in Burlington; and in the South Bay, Roku added an additional 250,000 square feet for Bay Area footprint while Splunk singed a 300,000 square-foot lease at Santana Row, with plans to hire 2,000 additional employees in the Bay Area. Total office leasing activity is over 11 million square feet for 2018. This is greater than a combined total leasing activity in this market for the past two years. VC funding for San Francisco and Silicon Valley combined for the trailing four quarters through Q3 is at a new peak of $41.6 billion. Same-store concessions decreased over 50% in the third quarter 2018 from the prior year’s period. Concessions were spread across many assets in each submarket and were largely used as closing tool. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the third quarter of 2018 was led by the San Mateo submarket at 3.4%, followed by our Oakland and San Jose submarkets which each grew at 2.4%m and our Fremont submarket at 1.8%, while San Francisco continued to remain flat for the period. Rents in our Bay Area markets were up approximately 3.3% and loss to lease was 1.1% in September. Continuing to Southern California. Job growth in Los Angeles in the third quarter of 2018 averaged 1.3% year-over-year. Netflix continues to solidify the presence in the market, preleasing at an additional 330,000 square feet in Hollywood, likewise co-working companies, SpaceX and WeWork expanded their combined footprint by almost 200,000 square feet during the period. Year-over-year, revenue growth for the third quarter of 2018 was led by our Long Beach and Woodland Hills submarkets with 5.4% and 4% growth respectively, trailed by the West LA submarket with 2.8% growth and the Tri-Cities submarket with 2.4% growth. September loss to lease in LA County was 2.4%. In Orange County, jobs in the third quarter grew 60 basis points for the year-over-year. This situation is similar to 2017 when the BLS showed 30 basis points of job growth in the third quarter which was increased to 2.2% when the revisions were completed. We will continue to monitor job growth in this market. Orange County loss to lease was 1.7% in September. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth remained at 1.7% in the third quarter of 2018. Amazon expanded their San Diego tech hub by 85,000 square feet, with plans to add 300 tech workers. Worthy to note that high-paying industries have accounted for more than 50% of the job growth in San Diego market. Year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2018 was 3.4% for northern San Diego submarkets while Chula Vista grew at 4.1%. Loss to lease in the market was 2.2% in September. Overall, same-store concessions are down with Southern California region about 30% from the prior year's period. 65% of the concessions in the third quarter related to downtown LA and assets impacted by the supply in south Orange County. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.5% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is 5.1%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I’ll start with a brief review of our third quarter results, then discuss the full year guidance, and conclude with an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. In the third quarter, core FFO grew 5.7%, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.03 per share. Details of the reconciliation to our original guidance are included on page four of the earnings release. Our favorable third quarter results enabled us to raise our core FFO per share guidance by $0.03 at the point to $12.56 for the full-year. This represents a 5.4% year-over-year growth, which is 90 basis points higher than our original guidance of 4.5%.  Turning to our third quarter investments and funding plan. We closed $104 million acquisitions in the Wesco V joint venture and originated an $18.6 million preferred equity investment, which brings our total structure finance commitments to approximately $385 million. We plan to fund the new investments with two dispositions that are on track to close at the end of the fourth quarter. As for guidance on investment activities for the full year. On acquisitions, we expect to achieve the low end of our range. On our $100 million preferred equity target, we currently have $45 million closed through October and believe that the majority of the remaining balance could close by early 2019 with funding up to six months thereafter. This is consistent with Mike's earlier comments and the headwinds regarding apartment construction starts. On dispositions, we have several properties in various stages of the sale process in anticipation of funding needs for 2019. Depending on the timing of the sale, some properties will transact by yearend. Therefore, we are increasing the high end of our dispositions range from $300 million to $400 million. Use of proceeds may include potential buyout, joint venture partner interest, development funding, stock buyback and debt repayment, depending on market conditions. As we have done in the past, we will seek to redeploy the proceeds into the most attractive investments in order to maximize the total insurance. Consistent with our original guidance this year, we do not start any new development. As it relates to our existing $940 million development pipeline, our share of unfunded obligation is $384 million, most of which will be funded in 2019, which means over 85% of our development pipeline will be completed and in lease-up by next year. Keep in mind that lease-ups are FFO dilutive until we approach stabilization. Consequently, our preliminary forecast anticipates a potential FFO per share impact of up to $0.10 for the next year. Lastly on capital markets and the balance sheet. Our capital needs for 2018 remain de minimis. We look to 2019 as we’re trying to repay approximately $590 million of secured debt, which was assumed from the BRE transaction and has an effective rate of 3.4%, but the cash rate is 5.6% rate. Therefore, this refinancing will be an economic benefit to the Company, but will create an FFO headwind of between $0.05 to $0.10 per share, depending on timing and market conditions, the current rate on our 10-year unsecured bond offering will be in the mid 4% range. However, we have a good amount of flexibility with access to multiple refinancing alternatives. And our balance sheet remains strong at 25% leverage with 5.5 times debt to EBITDA, and virtually full availability on our $1.2 billion loan of credit. That concludes my comments. And I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow up on the supply data where you mentioned you changed up your methodology. Could you just give us a little bit more details around that? What would the numbers have been, had you not assumed delivery delays, which have been pretty consistent, like you said, ‘18 into ‘19, and ‘19 into ‘20, just to get a sense of comparing that to third party providers?
Michael Schall: Hey, Juan. It’s Mike. Thanks for joining the call. I appreciate it. It’s going to be difficult for me to reconcile these exactly because the supply estimates from the vendors have changed a lot. And I think there are some procedural issues. What we’re trying to do is take a longer look at supply. So, we have gone back to 2017 and projected forward to 2020. And what we found in that analysis is that the total number of units produced in the Essex metros have ranged from 34,000 to 36,000 per year in all of our -- again, all of our metros. And essentially what we conclude from that is that construction labor is the main constraint. And even though construction labor can vary by submarket to submarket, in other words, can be transient. Some construction workers can go from LA to some other metro. What we think is happening is basically there’s a cap on the amount of construction that can get done. And so, we’re seeing pretty consistent total apartment units being delivered in each of those years. And that costs us to essentially take our best estimate at trying to guess or estimate how much was going to leap from one year to the next. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we think it is around 3,000 units from 2018 into 2019, and 2019 into 2020. And again within the context of -- that leads to about 36,000 units, plus or minus, in each of the last four years or four years preceding 2020.
Juan Sanabria: And then, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the expense side. I know this question -- who is best to answer. But, Angela gave some data points on kind of how to think about FFO impacts from occupancy -- sorry, from developments in some of the stuff you’re trying to do. But any color you can give on the expense side, particularly around some of the bigger ticket items, like real estate taxes, as we think about ‘19?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. On the real estate taxes, I think with California, that piece is pretty straight forward. CRO continues to be more of a wildcard. So, for example, we had expected 2018 CRO capital to come in around, say, between 10 to 13%; it came in at 16%. And so, next year, we’re going through that process right now, still working through it. But, it’s probably going to be consistent and that it’ll be high and it’ll be more than 10%, but probably below, say, 16%, if you will. So, that’s our current thing. We expect utility costs to continue to, one, add around that 4% or 5% range. And I think those were some of the largest non-controllable items.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Mike, you talked about cap rates haven’t moved, but you mentioned that positive leverage has started to be eliminated. Historically, you’ve mentioned that it’s being kind of one of the supportive metrics of sustaining low cap rates. So, just curious, when you look back historically, what does your research tell you about the lag between perhaps when cap rates could begin to move higher as a result of the eliminating the positive leverage?
Michael Schall: Sure, Austin. I think in our experience, cap rates are pretty sticky; they don’t change quickly overnight. Buyers and sellers need time to adjust to a new environment. I think that there is enormous amount of money out there looking for investments and looking for yield specifically. And I think that that is a one of the forces that is keeping cap rates at relatively low levels. So, I wouldn't expect any significant change in cap rates in the near term. I think what happens is, you will see buyers and sellers not agreeing and that will essentially cause a freeze in the transaction markets for some period of time, before cap rates would change. So, again, we haven't seen that now because there's so much money in the market, chasing deals. And we will see what happens going forward. I guess, it’s going to take several quarters for this to play out.
Austin Wurschmidt: I appreciate the thoughts there. And then, can you just give us a sense how 2019 supply delivery stack up, is it more heavily weighted in the first half of the year or back half of the year?
Michael Schall: Sure. Overall, we think 2019 is, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, roughly the same as 2018. There are some regional variances. Supply for example, pretty significantly let’s say, in LA and Oakland and then down in some other places that are essentially offsetting those numbers. In terms of quarter to quarter, I think it’s been so challenging to get the timing right going into the outlook of the details probably too far into weeds. What we have right now for 2019 is the third and fourth quarters are a little bit higher -- actually, you know what, they are pretty consistent throughout. The third and fourth quarters are heavier in northern California but lighter in Seattle and Southern California. So, we have pretty even supply quarter to quarter throughout 2019.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: How do you think about capital allocation nonorganic growth, given the current stock price? You’ve been active in the past, either issuing equity through the ATM to fund growth or repurchasing shares when you’re trading large discount. But right now, you’re somewhat in between those two scenarios. So, how do you think about adding value to this environment?
Michael Schall: This is Mike, and that’s a very good question, and we think it's pretty darn difficult to do that, to add value in this market. So, obviously, we have tried to focus on preferred equity investment, and I think that will continue to be something that we focus on going forward. We also, at this point in time, in prior cycles, have leaned more toward joint venture or co-investment type transactions. However, with interest rates up, they’re becoming more challenging to make work as well. And then, finally, on the development side, Mr. Eudy is here, he can comment on this, or follow-up on my comments. We’re just seeing a lot of low to mid-4 cap rate measure today untrended, so measured on rents in place today, throughout our portfolio. And we just don't think that’s enough cap rate to get us excited about development. John, do you have anything to add to that?
John Eudy: Only that we’re keeping our power drive for when the time comes and that will change.
Michael Schall: Yes, it will be interesting. And so, I will conclude by saying, I’ve learned in this business that don't try to make some work that just fundamentally doesn't work. And so, essentially focusing on the balance sheet, making sure it’s in pristine shape and being ready for opportunities when they arise, we don't know when or where they are going to be, but when that happens, we want to be ready. So, I think that's our focus now.
Nick Joseph: And then, you mentioned the headwind too, and compression in market development yields. Do you think that will have an impact on rent concessions during lease-ups due the product that is underway now?
Michael Schall: I think that we're expecting pretty consistent concessionary activity going forward. John, do you want to handle that one, concessions going forward, given development?
John Burkart: Yes, absolutely. In Q4, we see a little bit more supply coming at us for the year. And so, there would be the normal Q4 softer market. I'm sure, we're going to have some more concessions. But overall, our expectations are concessions are in check across each of the market. Again, as Mike has mentioned, LA, downtown LA is going to have more products. And so, there will be isolated cases with more concessions. But overall, as a company, our concessions are down in same-store portfolio, and we see things generally in pretty good order, 4 to 6 weeks, limited situations with 8 weeks, and often times concessions are going back, even back down to three weeks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: On Proposition 10, some of the polls are going to be working in your favor as far as it not passing. I'm just wondering, how confident do you feel about this vote going in your favor versus a few months ago? And is there a particular poll that you pay attention to more than the others? 
John Eudy: I’ll try -- this is John Eudy. We are cautiously optimistic that we are in a pretty good start and where we thought we were going to be at this point in time. But you never know. Polls have been wrong in the past. The messaging, I think you are referring to the PPIC public poll that came out a week ago that has it at 60% no, 25% yes, and the balance undecided. We see that in our internal polling as well. But the last eight days can change. But right now, we believe that we're in a pretty good spot to win or to push back under the deal.
Michael Schall: I'm going to add one thing to that, and that is Mr. Eudy does not give up and he is very focused on really pushing hard right through election day to make sure that the campaign is very focused on the ultimate result. And again, we have watched John do this for the last couple of months. And he's been incredibly focused and incredibly effective. 
John Kim: Best of luck. On your repairs and maintenance, the costs were down 1% year-over-year. And I'm wondering how much of this is due to low turnover versus capitalizing more or maybe some other factors.
John Eudy: It's not really capitalizing more, it is -- the turnover is a factor for sure. There is also some timing issues there as well. I think it will kick up in Q4 but all according to the original plan for the year. So, we are finding opportunities to create efficiencies and lower our cost to offset some of the wage pressures that we face and are coming in again with another good year as it relates to controllables.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
John Guinee: Angela, I was noticing in your guidance, and this maybe old news but just clarify it for me. Insurance reimbursement, legal settlements et cetera, you've recognized the negative $2 million year-to-date but you've got a budget or you have 6.2 for the year negative. Is there a one-time charge you are expecting to get in the fourth quarter?
Angela Kleiman: Yes. That’s all related to our Pop 10 campaign efforts. And so, that is a onetime charge. And it will occur in the fourth quarter.
John Guinee: Okay. So, $4.2 million get to FFO in the fourth quarter, and that’s in your guidance or not?
Angela Kleiman: It is in our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Quick question on occupancy. I was hoping you could clarify how -- I think it was mentioned before just where occupancy was at the end of the third quarter, where it is today, and should we necessarily expect that things to get back on PAR year-over-year during the fourth quarter as you move into a less favorable season with maybe some more supply coming in at some unfavorable times? Just curious how to model that.
John Burkart: Sure. Our occupancy at this point is 96.5, and last year we were a little bit higher, we were about 30 basis points higher at this point in time exactly. I think this year, we will again be -- we continue to be a little bit under last year. If you’re going back to the year, we started well above than occupancy; and then, as the market shifted, we shifted our strategy to favor achieving market rent over occupancy. So, we do have that headwind that we are facing Q3, as I mentioned Q4 will continue, will actually continue into the first half of ‘19. So, my expectation is our occupancy is a little tough to tell. We are obviously finding that in the marketplace, and as I mentioned, with more supply, that’s going to hit Q4 during the low demand period. But, I expect we will probably stay close to where we are right now, maybe up 10 basis points or something like that.
Drew Babin: And then, quickly, on Seattle, kind of the characteristics for supply for next year. It looks like you are expecting less multifamily supply growth in Seattle next year versus this year. Is that construction delay impact noticeable there? And I guess, as you go on the next year, is the supply just this kind of downtown concentrated or this year, is it a little more spread out?
Michael Schall: Hey Drew, it’s Mike. We think it will decline a little bit, maybe around 10%, Seattle will still have a plenty of supply in 2019 relative to 2018. But yes, to your second question, which is it will be more spread out; and the more spread out it is, the less we see that phenomena of multiple lease-ups competing against one another and offering very large concessions. So, the fact that it’s spreading out should help us in 2019 relative to 2018.
Drew Babin: And then, one more for Angela, you mentioned the nickel to about a dime dilution potentially from paying down debt maturities next year. Does that include just 2019 secured maturities or is there some component of 2020 maturities that might be prepaid as well on the contributes to that number you provided?
Angela Kleiman: That’s a very good question. And so, yes, it does include a component. So that $590 million of the debt assumed from the BRE acquisition, 300 is to this year -- I mean I'm sorry in 2019, and 290 is due in 2020, because we can't prepay it without any penalty; that’s the right economic thing to do and that’s why. So, in total, we actually can and are planning to pay about $900 million of debt of which 290 is optional.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo from Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Trent Trujillo: I appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks about this, but what are your latest thoughts on voter support for Prop 10 and how it is or how has been impacting the transaction market? You mentioned cap rates are broadly unchanged. There’s still healthy liquidity and capital chasing multi-family product, but what kind of depths in buyer pools have you seen? We’ve heard that there’s been less in institutional interest in California multi-family recently.
Michael Schall: It’s another good question. I'm not sure I have the perfect answer for it. I think that the greatest sensitivities are the transactions are hitting the market in some of the cities with the most extreme forms of rent control. I know that there was transaction for example, in Berkeley that had very extreme forms rent control. And I think that the market is reacting to those by pushing the bids for them past November 6th. And so, you’ll know the answer before people commit to it. So, I think there’s been somewhat of a showing the fact in the marketplace as people wait for Prop 10’s ultimate outcome. But I don’t get the sense that it’s had overall impact; in other words, some parts of the market areas that have less severe forms of rent control. I think it has a smaller impact on the market.
Trent Trujillo: And you alluded to having a handful of assets on the market as a source of fund. Can you perhaps speak to the type of product you’re looking to recycle, and if these are perhaps in those submarkets that are being subject to the most extreme versions of rent control potentially?
Michael Schall: No, not necessarily. Again, this is Mike. We follow the same basic methodology with respect to both sides of our portfolio. We try to rank our submarkets by longer-term job growth -- I am sorry longer-term rent growth and as a function of job growth and supply growth, and then we try to identify the areas that will -- are the weakest level of that, and try to call the portfolio as a result of that. The domain disposition earlier this year is a good example of that. Also, it seems like we’re getting more unsolicited offers. And when we get unsolicited offers, we will take them on a case-by-case basis and sometimes we will act on them if we get the right value. So, I’d say, those are the two driving forces of our dispo program.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hightower: So, most of my questions have been answered already. But, quickly, with respect to fourth quarter expenses, I think the guidance implies maybe high 3s, upwards 4% of same store growth in the fourth quarter. Is that driven by the uptick in repairs and maintenance? I think John to this. Is there something else going on there that we should be aware of?
Angela Kleiman: No. I think it’s what you’re anticipating. And so, on the expense side, we’re expecting to land for full year at 2.6% and it’s not atypical for us to run high in expenses in the fourth quarter. And so, there’s definitely timing element with that in conjunction with what John Burkart said earlier as it relates to repair and maintenance.
Rich Hightower: And then, just backing up to the occupancy headwind, third quarter, fourth quarter and the next year. Can you help us understand, I guess the word for it would be cadence of the headwind, as we kind of progress through 2019. Is the impact is more impactful than the first half of the year and then kind of getting to a normal seasonal occupancy in the third quarter and fourth quarter next year, just so we kind of understand the quarterly sequential element there, as we model it?
John Burkart: Yes. You hit it exactly. The greatest impact is in Q1 and Q2 where we were running at significantly higher occupancy. Our Q1, we were looking at the numbers, January 97.1, 97.2, 97.2, very high occupancy Q1. And I don’t expect to match that. As we move forward into through Q3, it’s less, and then we get into -- I’m sorry, Q2, it’s less. As we get into Q3, we’re probably right on point, and our Q4 will probably be right on point. So, the headwind is really, largely related to Q1 and Q2 occupancy. And that’s it at this point. We’re still in our budget planning process, but giving you a big picture. To the extent we see greater opportunities or reason to be more aggressive, we certainly will be. But at this point, those are most obvious headwinds.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Stevenson: How significant is your current redevelopment opportunity across the portfolio, and how comfortable are you that you can achieve targeted returns for new projects at this point in cycle, given market and supply condition?
Michael Schall: Sure. So, big picture, we are renovating somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500 units a year, and that implies a lifecycle of over 20 years, considering the size of our portfolio. So, we are pretty comfortable that process can continue. It moves around a little bit, depending upon of course the rental market strength. And we constantly are looking and making sure we are achieving our expectations. But, there is no reason to believe that our unit turn program would slow down in the coming years. As it relates to larger projects, we have several going that are listed that are doing well. And again, there is probably -- what, four properties that are specifically outlined, and that pipeline should continue as well. The asset’s age, we look for opportunities to do more robust upgrades to the asset systems, et cetera., and increase value. So, I don't see our renovation program changing materially over the next couple years.
Rob Stevenson: And then, what’s the current expected stabilized yield on the six properties in your development pipeline?
John Burkart: In the mid-five range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Two questions here. First, Angela, if we think about the comments you guys spoke about on the outlook for next year, there is $0.10 of lease-up drag potentially from the deliveries; there is other $0.05 to $0.10 of drag from refinancing. But, you guys are always pretty good on growing earnings. But, in total, it sounds like there is upwards of $0.20 of drag for next year. Is that the correct way to think about it or am I not looking at that -- did I not hear correctly?
Angela Kleiman: I think you are thinking of it correctly. What you are thinking of it is the same way I’m thinking of it. And so, although, to the team’s common, operating fundamentals are coming in as we expect, there are other sectors impacting FFO. And financing and dilution as it relates to timing of development and lease-up are two important factors. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Mike, on the supplemental page where you provide 2019 outlook, I don’t if that's markets in general or you are specifically providing Essex revenue or rent projections. But, suffice it to say, you are looking at 3 -- call it 3% rent growth for next year on that age. And this year, rents are up 2.3%, revenues up 2.8%. It sounds like the environment for next year isn’t going to be too dissimilar revenue-wide for this year, given that occupancy sounds like on the whole will be flat. Is that a fair way to think about it that revenue next year is really that 3% level or could we see occupancy improved that you might exceed that 3% level?
Michael Schall: Alex, this is Mike, and we're not going to morph into a guidance conversation here. But let me just clarify what we mean and our market forecast. So, S-16, our economic rent growth represents in these submarkets, not for Essex but for the broader submarket what we think market rents will do in each of these areas. So, our portfolio can vary from that by some amount. And depending upon where it is, depending upon its competitive within the marketplace et cetera, and so our actual revenue results can be different. And again, this is for the entire year. So, how it breaks down the rent growth curve, it's not a flat line straight up during the year. It tends to be strong in the earlier part of the year, and weaker in the end of the year. And so, there could be variations in these numbers. And I'll leave it at that. And I will be giving guidance at some point in time in late January, early February, and we’ll talk about it in much more detail at that time.
John Burkart: And I would just add, Alex, I think you said that occupancy would be flat. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying occupancy will be a headwind. So, the greatest headwind will be Q1 and Q2 with Q3 and Q4 basically flat. But for the year, it will be a headwind overall. Does that make sense?
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes. Thank you, John and Mike. Thank you for clarifying S-16. That’s helpful on your comments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Just a quick for me. Recognizing that you want to stay away from giving guidance. But if you could think about -- if you could consider the impacts of higher anticipated supply or slower than anticipated job growth as maybe the biggest risks your market forecast for economic rent growth, which one is that, both maybe to the upside and the downside?
Michael Schall: I think we have the supply pretty well locked down. We could be wrong from quarter-to-quarter, like everyone. And I know everyone has been frustrated with the supply forecast over those past couple of years. But, I think that now we're looking at over broader period of time and it seems to make a reasonable sense to us. So, I would say the greater risk is on the job side. And I would say again, this is -- our forecast on S-16 is a scenario. It begins with what's going in the U.S. and then we have a lot of history with respect to the U.S., the 2.5% GDP and 1.3% job growth. This is what will typically happen in the Essex markets. So, we try to make the jump from what the U.S. does and to what our markets do. But, as you know, given all the geopolitical issues and interest rates rising and other things, the U.S. assumptions can change pretty significantly over time, and they can change at any time really. So, it tended to be a scenario that begins with the strength of U.S. economy and it rolls down into what that means for the Essex metros. Does that make sense?
Rich Hill: IT does. That's helpful. And are there any markets where you think you might have greater variability than other, either to the upside or the downside?
Michael Schall: Well, I think that Seattle has always been challenging. I think that we have beat up Seattle historically over the last several years much greater, outperformed with what our expectations have been. But, it is more challenging just because if you look at the amount of supply that it produces, 1.8% versus about 1% in northern California and 0.7% in Southern California, there is a greater degree of variability there. So, we could be wrong. The higher of the supply number typically, the more wrong you could be. So, I would point to Seattle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hardik Goel: In your supply outlook, you guys noted that you are adjusting for delays this time. Could you give us some insight into your process, just bottoms up, what it was before and how it's changed, and how you are actually accounting for those delays in supply?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. So, on a process from process perspective, we drive every single site and we have been short where it's at, what we think is going to happen, and we do this on a regular basis. And we are obviously looking at all the other information that's out there. So, we feel we have a great database of the various sites and where they are at. What’s been a challenge is really trying to understand where they are at, when they are going to actually finish, when they are going to come to completion. And part of that issue relates to the fact that if you look in the building from the outside, you can't tell exactly where things are, how far along the building is. And so, we are relying to some extent on conversations we have with developers or other people to try to gather information to really focusing on that side. What we’ve done in the sense of our adjustments is we looked at how often we were right and where the -- how long the delays actually have been on an asset by asset basis and came up with the track record. And if that track record that we then applied to all these deals and so we look and said, if on average we are missing it by several months, which is really the case, we made those adjustments. So, that’s what's going -- based on our track record, as we drive all the sites and are looking back and seeing how accurate have we been on the timing, what's the normal delay been, and we applied it equally across the board. Does that make sense?
Hardik Goel: That makes a lot of sense.
Michael Schall: Let me add one more thing to that. I think that what has typically happened, we’ve seen out there and some of the data providers is when some doesn’t get delivered in Q1, it gets pushed to Q2 and Q2 to Q3 and you end up with lump of supply that is going to ultimately get done in Q4. And then, of course, if that doesn’t happen, it gets pushed to the next year. So, that's been sort of the process that started what John just talked about. You end up -- it ends up being very confusing because you have a very large number in Q4 which doesn’t get delivered, which then makes to next year, start out with a very large number, and it confuses the entire picture. So, we are trying to cut through all that and create something that is hopefully more sustainable and more accurate.
Hardik Goel: That’s really helpful. We can certainly appreciate the challenges. Just one follow-up to that. What is your radius like? I hope, John, you’re not having to drive around all of Southern California and Northern California. How do you decide this asset is within our comparability set?
John Burkart: So, although I do a lot of driving, there’s a whole team of people in the research department that do the specifics, and they have actually a mobile database that they log into, check things out. So, what they’re doing is they’re actually driving the entire MD. So, they’re looking at everything out in that area to understand exactly what’s going on. Again, we don’t look at it and say, here’s an asset that we’re going to go within 3 miles, and different people have different ways of doing it. We look at the whole supply-demand picture, and we make an assessment according to that. So, we’re looking at all assets that are 50 units and up, driving those assets in the MD, seeing where they’re at and factoring that in. Obviously from an operational perspective, we have individual operational asset reports that research department creates and enables us to better understand what supply is going to impact what assets and therefore adjust pricing strategies. But from a big picture from the economic perspective, we’re looking at the whole MD, each of the MDs, seeing there’s a lot of work in this area.
Hardik Goel: Got it. That sounds really good. That actually tells about data. That’s all from me.
John Burkart: We talked about it. You’re looking at it right now for free on S-16.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Anderson: Hey, Mike, have you given any thoughts or plan B, say, Costa-Hawkins gets repealed, or are you not even going there right now? In another words, what do you do?
Michael Schall: We always have a plan B. But keep in mind that we operate in 70 different cities in California. So, we’re more diversified than you might think. And as you know, probably the greatest risks are in the more urban type location. And we are a mix of urban and suburban, I think somewhere around 10% of our properties actually are in the urban core. So, we think that there’s just an inherent sort of safety in the portfolio. And I commented previously about concentrations. There’s only 4 cities where we have more than 2,000 units. And so, again, we’re pretty diverse. And so, we’re not hugely impacted under any scenario, although we do look at -- we do have a contingency plan that might target a few cities that we’re most concerned about. So, I wouldn't say we wouldn’t do anything, but I would say that our feeling is we’re pretty well positioned overall.
Rich Anderson: No home properties in your future, I am gathering, use that as an example?
Michael Schall: Probably not. I mean, we did track other metros because we want to make sure that the West Coast is competitive with some of the eastern metros for sure. And like job growth in certain of the eastern metros or pretty appealing of late, but it's really trying to confirm whether our existing property profile is appropriate given the broader U.S. landscape. So, it’s sort of confirmatory. And based on that, looking at supply and demand dynamics, we feel good about the West Coast.
Rich Anderson: And then, just related, what percentage of your portfolio is condo maps, just as a reminder? And is it concentrated in some of those urban areas where perhaps should Costa-Hawkins gets repealed that certain municipalities would be inclined to follow the rent control sort of mentality. Can you comment on how and where they are at?
Michael Schall: I can. Roughly 8,600 units in California are condo and then condo mapping in Seattle is easier than it is in California. In California, if you don't have condo map coming out of the gate, you’re unlikely to get one unless -- may take you many years in order to get one. So, 8,600 of our California portfolio would be the condo map, 15% to 16%. And they tend to be in more of the urban core.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: I was looking for an update in San Jose, more in particular that large lease at Santa Clara Square. Has that impacted the market and how do you model that delivery and job the next few years?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. We open that right after the first of the year, as you’re probably aware. And it’s a pretty deep market, a lot of Sunnyvale product burned off on the inventory this year. And we think it's well-positioned to have a pretty good start, come late Q1. 
Wes Golladay: And then, going back to the condo mapping question, would you look to convert the condos as more of a defense for a potential repeal of Prop 10?
John Eudy: We have maps on, like Mike said, roughly 8,600 units, most of which are urban core units we have been developing last 15 years. And we’re always looking at the metrics between NAV value, condo conversion versus as an apartment. So, that optionality is there. We’ll make the right decision at the right time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Pawlowski: Mike, I understand your comments about the transaction market, only seeing a slowdown in volume, no impact on pricing and high-risk cities of rent control. There is a very real chance, this comes on Costa-Hawkins on a 2020 ballot as well. So, any conversations you and John are having that suggest that the transaction market slowdown cloud be more multiyear in nature and not exactly everything continues on after November 6?
Michael Schall: John, it’s Mike. It’s a good question. And honestly, we don't know the answer. As you guys actually pointed out, there is a lot of money in private hands looking for yield. And it’s there, it’s not going away probably anytime soon. So, how much we will transact given the amount of money, searching for quality apartment deals, obviously remains to be seen. I guess, I’m -- I wouldn't be as maybe dire as you’re suggesting as it relates to the transaction market. I mean, conditions can go on a lot longer than we might think before pricing or you see that for you. It would be a guess and I would be speculating. So, I think I will probably just leave it at that. I think that there is no reason to believe that things will change overnight. They generally take significant amount of time to change. And I would guess that it would be at the very earliest, sometime a year from now or something like that. 
John Pawlowski: Okay. On Seattle, and I know this market rent forecast. The acceleration you're calling for in terms of economic rent growth from 2% to 2.9%, are you seeing any leading indicators within your portfolio in Seattle that suggest market rent growth is stabilizing because the pace of deceleration we’re seeing in Seattle you and your peers reports have been pretty persistent deceleration. So, wondering what really causes the conviction and the 100 bps acceleration in market rent growth next year?
John Burkart: What we're seeing to start with on the supply side is, we see the fourth quarter is being pretty heavy with, so that'll be a tough fourth quarter for us now. And then Q1 and Q2, also significant, little bit less and then lightening up quite a bit in Q3 and Q4 in Seattle. We also, when we're looking at where we were for, we're talking to acceleration we have in rent growth this year in S-16, just projecting into ‘19. We're seeing right now on job growth that as I mentioned earlier is that 3.7%, very high job growth this year for the third quarter compared that to last year, last year was a low point. Last year we were down by about 50 basis points -- sorry ‘17, we were down about 50 basis points in job growth and that impacted our ‘18 number. This point being up in job growth in ‘18 and doing -- being very strong, that will actually benefit the ‘19 rental market. There is a little bit of delay between job growth and the rental market. So, it's really that combination of better employment this year with declining supply that will get us to our rent growth numbers. It will be a little tough in the middle though. The fourth quarter is going to be challenge. I’m sure it’ll be noteworthy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Schall: We may have lost Tayo.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Karin Ford from MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: I know we focused a lot on the occupancy comps for next year but I just want to make sure I understand the rent growth that's earned in from the past leasing season. You said new leases were up 3.5 and renewals were up 4.2 I think in the third quarter. Is that correct? And so, we’re looking at high 3 I guess kind of level of earned in rent growth from the peak leasing season, heading into ‘19, is that correct?
Michael Schall: Well, Q3 was strong and that’s what I was trying to articulate that, and part of that relates to the curve changing a bit. 2018 was a normal seasonal pattern and comparing that to 2017 gave us kind of a big pop in Q3. As we go to Q4, we will face more pressure. And loss to lease will largely dry up. And so when you look at ‘18 -- ‘19, we're not giving guidance but we're not in those -- in the high numbers that you talked about. We’ll have the headwinds from the occupancy with the solid rental market, and we'll give guidance later on.
Karin Ford: And could you just remind us what percentage of your lease you signed in 3Q?
Michael Schall: Yes. I think we had roughly 14% turnover if my memory is right, 6,500 leases and something like that overall. It’s the bigger percentage, it’s meaningful but it’s not -- we still signed quite a few in Q1 and Q4.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you, Dana. Thank you for your participation on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you next week in San Francisco at the NAREIT Convention. Have a good day. Thanks for joining the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company’s filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. Today, I will discuss three topics: second quarter results and revisions to our 2018 market outlook, investment market conditions and an update on regulatory matters. On to the first topic. We’re pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflect a mostly normal leasing season when compared to the early peak in market rents that we experienced in 2017. The deceleration in revenue growth in Q2 versus Q1 2018 is attributable to the occupancy gain difference in the two quarters of 30 basis points increase in Q2 as compared to a 60 basis point benefit in Q1 2018. While the market rent growth comps become easier in the second half of this year, it is our expectation that revenue growth will slow modestly as we push rents at slightly lower levels of occupancy, which will mostly benefit 2019. Overall, fundamentals for apartments remain favorable, and demand for rental housing continues to be strong. We are seeing strength in our Northern and Southern California portfolios, particularly in San Jose and San Diego, and supply-related weakness in Seattle. As expected, favorable macroeconomic trends support a positive outlook for the U.S. and West Coast economies, indicated by a re-acceleration in job growth across much of the country. During the quarter, hiring continued at a healthy pace in the Essex West Coast metros with 2.1% job growth for the trailing three months ending in June. Outperforming – this outperformed our initial forecast for the year of 1.6%. The tech markets of Seattle and San Jose continued to lead the way with more than 3% job growth during the period, driven by increases in the information sector. Given this strength, we are increasing our full year job growth forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental for San Jose and Seattle by 130 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. This resulted in an increase in our full year job growth forecast for the Essex markets by 40 basis points to 2%. Throughout the U.S., a stronger economy and tight labor market conditions are drawing more people back into the workforce. In the past year, the labor force is up 1.9 million people or 1.2%, which is double the average growth rate seen over the current cycle. The higher labor participation rate can lead to incremental demand from people still living at home with parents or those currently doubling up. Strong jobs data has resulted in a weighted average unemployment rate in the Essex markets of 3.5%, well below the U.S. average. Shortages of skilled workers are pushing wages, which are growing faster than rents. Personal incomes are expected to grow 5.6% for the Essex portfolio in 2018 compared to market rent growth of 3%. As a result, we are seeing an improvement in rental affordability in all of our markets compared to one year ago. On S-16.1 of the supplemental, we published a chart on cost to own a home versus rent in our West Coast market. Due to severe for-sale housing shortages and recent tax reform, the premium to own a home versus renting an apartment has risen to 77% as compared to the historical average of 49%. Large increases in median home prices, which are up 13% year-over-year, along with tax law changes are driving the substantial increase. As a result, we expect this to favorably impact demand for rental housing and apartment fundamentals. Turning to supply. During the quarter, we completed a full scrub of our supply analysis, including on-the-ground surveys of under-construction projects, to assess recent progress and expected delivery timing. Overall, supply remains relatively unchanged in our markets from our prior projections with the exception of Los Angeles, where delays pushed back deliveries to later in 2018 and into 2019, and Seattle where supply is up slightly. Our analysis indicates that Orange County, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle will be past their peak supply by the end of 2018. Overall, across our markets, we expect 2019 apartment deliveries to be relatively flat compared to 2018. Multifamily deliveries continue to be heavily concentrated in the downtown and CBD markets. As noted previously, when several nearby properties are delivered at the same time, lease-up concessions will often increase, temporarily disrupting pricing at stabilized communities. Specifically, in Seattle and downtown L.A, the concentration and timing of deliveries has resulted in four to six weeks of leasing concession at new communities, impacting price and resulting in periodic concessions at nearby stabilized communities. These concessions begin to abate once the pace of apartment deliveries subsides. Going forward, we believe construction starts will slowly decline in our markets given rising construction cost, shortages of skilled labor and a more conservative lending environment. As it relates to revisions to our 2018 market rent growth forecast on S-16, there is no change to the Essex portfolio rent growth of 3%. However, there are changes with end markets, namely: we now expect San Jose rent growth to be 4%, which is 100 basis points stronger than our initial expectations due to better job growth; conversely, Seattle is expected to be weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 given higher apartment deliveries in Q3 and Q4, and the greater seasonal drop-off in demand that usually occurs in Seattle in the back half of the year. My second topic, updates on investment markets. During the quarter, we closed on one disposition in San Diego at a low 4% cap rate and have one acquisition in a co-investment entity in contract for approximately $100 million. We reviewed recent institutional apartment transactions in the Essex markets and concluded that there has not been any significant change to cap rates. Therefore, we continue to see A-quality property in locations trading around a 4% to 4.25% cap rate, with B-quality property and locations generally trading 25 to 50 basis points higher. As noted, the past two quarters, and even with healthy levels of multifamily permits, we continue to see a slowdown in the volume of preferred equity opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Development yields are compressing given that construction cost increase generally exceed property NOI growth rates, representing a significant headwind to new development. So far this year, we have closed one preferred equity investment for $26.5 million, bringing our total outstanding commitments to $398 million as of the second quarter. Angela will discuss revisions to our full year investment guidance momentarily. Third topic, regulatory matters. During the last few months, there has been a great deal of investor concern and reaction to Proposition 10 in California seeking to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. As a reminder, costa-Hawkins is a state law that seeks to promote housing production to meet demand by establishing guidelines for rent control policies that can be enacted by cities. In summary, Costa-Hawkins became state law in 1995 to counter the unintended negative effects of severe rent control laws adopted by certain cities, which resulted in a dramatic suppression of housing development and property improvement. Prior to Costa-Hawkins, there were 12 local rent control ordinances enacted. A few cities, including Berkeley, San Francisco and Santa Monica, passed ordinances containing severe provisions, such as rent control of vacant apartments, which had draconian impacts, including no meaningful production of rental housing for the following 20-year period. As a result, these cities remain chronically undersupplied with respect to housing. The state legislature passed Costa-Hawkins in 1995 to increase housing production and quality, requiring vacancy decontrol in all California jurisdictions and exempting any new construction built after February 1, 1995, from rent control. Following the enactment of Costa-Hawkins, new housing development experienced a significant rebound. Essex has been part of a broad coalition to oppose the repeal of Costa-Hawkins, joined by other apartment companies, trade organizations, unions, veterans, the NAACP and a variety of pro-business groups. We believe that rent control is bad policy. Given California’s severe housing shortage, vibrant economy and an estimated 180,000 new jobs in coastal California in 2018, it remains unclear where many of the people filling the new jobs will live. We continue to vigorously oppose any expansion of rent control at both the state and local levels. Strategically, the outlook for changing rent control is now a critical consideration in all portfolio allocation decisions. Property in cities that tighten rent control will be less attractive, leading to greater housing shortages over time, while nearby cities without rent control become more attractive for investment. We operate in about 70 cities in California, and information about what cities might do if Costa-Hawkins is repealed is often incomplete or not available. Keep in mind, in the past two years, 10 cities pursued rent control for pre-1995 properties, with 80% of the proposals rejected. We will continue to periodically update you as needed. That concludes my comments, and I’ll now turn the call over to John.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Q2 was another solid quarter for Essex with year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.8% and NOI growth of 3%. Southern California led the portfolio in the second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 3.3% in part due to its 60 basis point gain in occupancy over the prior year’s period. This leasing season is playing out as anticipated. Our rents are following the historically normal rental rate curve, which peaks in July as opposed to last year when rental rates peaked early. The impact of the 2018 seasonal pattern is evident in our loss to lease numbers, which grew to 3.6% in July of 2018 compared to last year when loss to lease in July was 2%. In order to maximize revenue over the next 12 months, our operating strategy is favoring market rents instead of favoring occupancy. Therefore, we expect that our occupancy during the third quarter of 2018 will be about 30 basis points below the prior year’s period or approximately 96.4%, which will create a significant headwind in – for revenue this period. In July 2018, our same-store financial occupancy was 96.1%. Q3 2018 will be our low point for year-over-year revenue growth due to the occupancy headwind and timing of other income. Now we’ll provide an update on our markets. The Seattle market continues to be supported by strong job growth, posting year-over-year job gains of 3.1% in the second quarter of 2018, the second highest in the Essex portfolio. WeWork and Zillow continue to expand their downtown Seattle footprint by leasing the combined additional 200,000 square feet of office space. The city – the Seattle MD has roughly 5.2 million square feet of office space currently under construction, 45% of which is already preleased. Revenue in our East side and Seattle CBD submarkets grew 2.8% and 2.1%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018 over the prior year’s period. After years of outperformance, market rents are relatively flat compared to last year. Moving on to Northern California. Job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area in Q2 averaged 2.5% year-over-year with over 76,000 jobs added. San Jose led the way with 3.3% job growth, while Oakland and San Francisco were up 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Facebook’s expansion was robust this quarter, signing the largest San Francisco office lease in the history for 756,000 square feet, taking all of Park Tower building as well as adding an additional 750,000 square feet across the bay in Fremont. Demand for prime office space continues to intensify as major tech companies compete for office space. An under-construction project in Mountain View changed hands from LinkedIn to WeWork and finally to Facebook, which ended up leasing both buildings totaling 450,000 square feet. Other office leasing activity remains healthy in the market. In San Francisco, a self-driving car maker and two biotech companies expanded their footprint by a combined 675,000 square feet. And in the South Bay, Amazon grew the Bay Area footprint by adding 385,000 square feet – by adding a 385,000 square foot lease in Sunnyvale. San Francisco quarterly office absorption was the highest amongst the Essex markets at 1.9% of total stock. Between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, there was about 7.5 million square feet of office space under construction, of which 68% is preleased. In July, we completed the lease-up of Station Park Green Phase 1 and estimate that pre-leasing for phases 2 and 3 will start sometime in mid-2019. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the second quarter of 2018 continues to be led by Oakland and Fremont submarkets with 3% and 2.6% revenue growth. San Mateo and San Jose grew at 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively, for the same period, while San Francisco was last for the period. Heading down to Southern California. Job growth in Los Angeles in Q2 2018 averaged 1.4% year-over-year, 50 basis points above the pace of growth a year ago. Notable leases for the quarter includes Spotify’s 110,000 square foot expansion into the Arts District in downtown L.A. and WeWork’s 75,000 square foot lease, its 17th in the L.A. area. Revenue growth for the second quarter of 2018 was led by Woodland Hills with 5.1% and West L.A. with 3.9%, trailed by the Tri-Cities with 2% and Long Beach with 2%. Orange County jobs in the second quarter grew 1.3% year-over-year. While this pace was weaker than our other markets, it’s worth noting that reported growth was similarly soft at this time last year and then it was revised materially higher in the BLS’s annual benchmark revisions. Office activity continues to be healthy with 1 million square feet under construction, 40% of which is pre-leased. That is up from 20% pre-leased in Q1 of this year. Essex’s South and North submarkets grew year-over-year at 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively, for the period. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth remained at 1.9% in the second quarter of 2018. Revenue growth in the second quarter of 2018 was between 4% in the North side submarkets to 6.3% in Chula Vista over the prior year’s period. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.5% occupancy, and our availability 30 days out is at 5%. Our renewals are being sent out, consistent with the loss to lease. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I’ll start with a review of our second quarter results, provide additional color on our full year guidance revisions and conclude with a balance sheet update. In the second quarter, core FFO grew 5.7%, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.09 per share. As noted in our press release, $0.03 of the favorable variance relates to timing of operating expenses, which are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. The remaining $0.06 of outperformance is comprised of the following: $0.02 from property revenues, $0.02 from property tax adjustments in the non-same-store pool and $0.02 from a combination of various miscellaneous items. As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year guidance for same-property revenue and NOI growth by 15 basis points to 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. Year-to-date, we have raised the midpoint of our same-property revenue and NOI growth guidance by 30 and 35 basis points, respectively. But the strong second quarter results have also enabled us to raise our full year core FFO per-share guidance by $0.07 at the midpoint to $12.53. This represents a 5.2% year-over-year growth, which is a 70 basis points higher than our original guidance of 4.5% core FFO growth per share. Turning to our full year investment guidance. Our initial guidance assumed between $400 million to $525 million of acquisitions, which would be funded with joint ventures or disposition proceeds. Therefore, our initial disposition guidance of $550 million to $750 million was dependent upon achieving our investment targets. Year-to-date, we have not acquired any properties as the assets in our markets remain highly desirable in the current competitive landscape, resulting in a continued tight cap rate environment, as Mike discussed earlier. Given this dynamic, we have chosen to stay consistent to our disciplined underwriting and capital allocation strategy. Accordingly, we are modifying our 2018 investment guidance to assume $100 million to $300 million of acquisitions and $200 million to $300 million of dispositions for the full year. The revised guidance range includes transaction in the current pipeline. Note that our dispositions guidance excludes funding for our $250 million stock buyback program. Therefore, the amount of dispositions could increase from our guidance range, subject to the stock buyback volume, which we would execute on a leverage-neutral basis. Lastly, a brief update on capital markets and the balance sheet. As we look to the second half of the year, our capital needs remain de minimis. The sale of Domain in the second quarter provided for all of our development funding needs. And we only have $120 million of secured debt maturing in the second half of the year, which was already contemplated in our $300 million unsecured bond issuance in the first quarter. With net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5x and over $1.6 billion of liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong. That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I just want to start on guidance. You mentioned that 3Q would be the low point for same-store revenue growth. So what are you assuming for 3Q and 4Q?
Angela Kleiman: For the guidance range, we assume Q3 same-store revenue in the low 2s and Q4 in high 2s.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on Prop 10. Hypothetically, if it does pass, some municipalities move to rent control, what do you think the timing would be in terms of how long it would take to actually implement?
Michael Schall: Hey, Nick it’s Mike Schall. It’s a good question. There are many conversations that are going on at the local level with respect to rent control. And they are debating at the local level what exactly is going to happen if Prop. 10 passes. And – but at this point in time, either because they haven’t decided or because the deliberations are not open to the public, it’s pretty tough to tell exactly what they’re going to do or when they’re going to do it. There have been various cities that have tried to pursue new rent control proposals, including three that were defeated: Long Beach, Pasadena and Inglewood. There are some that are on the local ballot. Santa Cruz and Santa Ana are examples of that. And of course, there was the failed attempt to repeal the Washington state law that would have banned – that bans rent control currently. So there’s a lot of activity in this area, and none of it is complete. For example, it’s difficult to distinguish what types of rent control these different cities are going to have. Some forms, as noted in my comments, are extreme, those that involve controlling vacant units, for example. But many of them are not nearly that extreme. And therefore, there’s a lot of – a lot to be learned, and we still need a lot more information before we can make a good decision about what the impacts are going to be.
John Eudy: Yes. This is John Eudy. I’d like to add one comment. With the – all the cities that we deal with on the entitlement side, I can tell you the vast majority do recognize the fact that if rent control were to be initiated in a city, it would have a very large impact on their ability to produce housing. Most cities are behind on the housing element, and we believe that’s another governing factor. On – part of your question, you asked how long it would take. We don’t think most cities are waiting at the altar to initiate rent control, assuming Prop. 10 were to pass. We think they’re going to be thoughtful and methodical how they approach it. And it’s too speculative to say, like Mike said, exactly where it lands, but we believe that it will be done in a balanced way. In a few cities that do, it will probably be much less draconian as the 1970 version of rent control is our general belief.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just curious if the job growth outlook in your revised revenue guidance assume that the pace of job growth moderates in the back half of the year. It sounded like some of the 2Q data points on job growth were above some of the full year assumptions you provided.
John Burkart: Sure. Job growth – this is John. Job growth, obviously, moves around quite a bit, and we follow it on a monthly basis. But in the end, we’re expecting the economy is doing – well, we see the economy doing very well right now. We raised our numbers a little bit to reflect that reality. We’re not expecting a big slowdown, but the numbers are somewhat volatile. So we just see a solid second half as it relates to job growth and just with some limited movement up and down.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks. And then I thought your comments around households doubling up and an improving affordability was interesting, and I was just curious if you’ve seen this phenomenon in the past and if you have any sense of what the benefit this could provide from a demand or – perspective or an impact on market rents.
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. yes, we, for a long time, have believed that as long as we’re in the band of 90% to 110% of long-term average rent-to-median income ratio, that, that tends to be a good spot in terms of rental pricing. If it’s below 90%, it probably indicates that there’s something wrong with the market. And if it’s above 110%, then you get into these affordability issues. And that ratio improved in each market, as noted in my script. And interestingly, in Northern California, we are under the 110% threshold in all three major metros. So that’s good news. And we’re pretty close to 110% in most of Southern California. So we’ve actually really come a long way with respect to affordability in the last several quarters.
Austin Wurschmidt: And where has that ratio been historically?
Michael Schall: Again, it’s – we’re comparing the – this is the band of 90% to 110% of the long-term, 25-year, 1990 to 2017 average. So it depends by market. Typically, Southern California is in the 22% range typically, and Northern California is in the 22% range except San Francisco is more like 27%. And Seattle is about 19%. That’s the long-term historical average.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I just want to go back to, Mike, your opening comments and clarify your comments on occupancy for 2019. It sounds like we’re saying second half will decline a bit well. And are you [indiscernible] on rent – on trying to push rent? Are you saying that you feel in 2019 that based on demand, occupancy should pick back up again?
Michael Schall: Yes, let me actually kick that to John because I think you’re referring to his outlook for the rest of this year. So John, you want to handle that?
John Burkart: Yes, absolutely. So what I’m seeing is in Q1, we had a benefit of 60 basis points occupancy year-over-year. Q2, that shifted to 30 basis points. And in Q3, it’ll actually be a headwind of 30 basis points, and that clearly impacts the year-over-year numbers that Angela was referencing, the reason being as we’ve shifted to the strategy that the market has improved and the seasonality of the curve is consistent with the past, with last year or with historical standards. Last year, it fell off early. So we shifted strategies to favor achieving market rent as opposed to maximizing occupancy. So it’s that adjustment, which is also in line with increased turnover, increased units turning. Each unit that turns, there’s a certain occupancy related to it. So as we turn more units in the summer and as we focus on achieving market rent instead of occupancy, there’s a natural adjustment. It’s not because the market’s weak, it’s because actually the market’s stronger, and we’ve adjusted our management strategy to maximize revenue over the next 12 months. So Q3 is the one that’s most impacted negatively, as I mentioned. And then Q4 will bring our occupancy back up as we enter the weaker part of the rental season. Does that answer your question?
Jeff Spector: Yes. Thanks. And I thought Mike in his opening talked about the expected benefit in 2019. But that’s helpful.
John Burkart: Sure, yes. I’ll...
Michael Schall: Let me...
John Burkart: Sure, sure.
Michael Schall: Answer that. So yes, exactly. So if we’re going to create a occupancy headwind in Q3, then by pushing rents – obviously, the rent growth – we only have four months left of 2018, and so the benefit from the higher rent growth is going to mainly start us out on a positive foot into 2019. Keep in mind that loss to lease at the end of July was 3.5% this year versus 2% last year. So that increment, you could expect to help us in 2019.
Jeff Spector: Okay. Thanks. Then just one follow-up on the rent control conversation. I mean, is it too early to talk about – if a town does implement rent control, what would Essex do with their – in that town or a municipality?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. Yes, we’ve given a lot of thought to this, and we’ve done a lot of research on what the discussions are in these various cities. And it’s pretty difficult to glean any conclusions, obvious conclusions from those discussions because so many things are in flux right now. Because all rent control is not the same. There are, as we’ve said, relatively few cities that have extreme forms of rent control, and then there are other cities that have moderate forms of rent control. As we think of the world given – and John said this a few minutes ago, but I’ll just reiterate part of it from my perspective – there seems to be a real split in how to deal with California’s incredible housing shortage. A lot of the politicians and legislature have chosen to do things that are going to promote more housing development, consistent with California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which effectively seeks to put housing and office next to one another and get people out of their cars. There were 15 bills signed by Governor Brown last year, for example, that had the objective of increasing housing development, raising money for affordable housing, penalizing cities that didn’t produce their housing element, et cetera. So you have that on the one hand, and then you have this whole other political movement to try to use rent control as a solution to a problem. Well, rent control obviously doesn’t produce more units. In fact, it produces less units because cities with extreme forms of rent control are going to produce less housing like they did last time around. So we know that. They also – there’s also a fiscal impact in that the estimated cost to the state and local governments is in the hundreds of millions of dollar range, which is, I would think, problematic as far as that goes. And then finally, the third problem with rent control is there’s conversions, for example, condos from rental housing into other forms of housing. So it actually depletes the housing stock. So what we’re talking about here is, there are people in the short term that will benefit from rent control, i.e., those that get a rent control unit. And then further down the road, there’s going to be greater shortages, and the people that will be most vulnerable in that scenario will again be the people of limited means because there’s going to be fewer houses – fewer housing units available in that scenario, and they’re likely to be more expensive and more difficult to obtain.
Jeff Spector: Okay. Thank you. That helps.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning out there. Mike, just appreciate your comments on the nuance of the conversations over rent control with the different cities. But I guess from – on the point of vacancy decontrol because that seems to be one of the most key elements of Costa-Hawkins and whether or not cities did draconian or not, is there any sense, as you guys speak to the different municipalities, that they understand the impact that removing vacancy decontrol would have? Or is it all part of a nebulous thing and they’re not even bringing that element up?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy, Alex. There’s no question that cities understand that. And if we were to lose vacancy decontrol by virtue of a city passing that, it also brings in the element of a fair rider return. And it’s pretty clear that if you don’t have the ability to turn units at market, you wouldn’t be able to achieve that. So there’s a legal argument there that also keeps the cities in line to understand that metric. So we believe the vast majority of cities get it. There will be a few exceptions that we’ll have to work with if it comes to that.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, you guys – Mike, you spoke earlier in the year about the – obviously the impact of pricing versus last year’s early peak and then with the wild fires, and you spoke 30 basis points – or Angela, you spoke about 30 basis points lower occupancy hitting third quarter. But still, you guys definitely crushed on the quarter. Classic Essex. So how much do we take your comments with a bit of grain of salt when you’re saying that hey, third quarter is going to be the low point of the year versus things are going better? And I guess the point is, has the economy improved a lot more than you guys thought when you had your outlook and discussions at NAREIT earlier this year? Or is it the standard Essex conservatism?
John Burkart: Hey, Alex thank you for the compliment, I guess, and this is John. And where we’re at as it relates to the numbers, I – in my script, I mentioned that July, we were at 96.1% occupancy very specifically to show that occupancy really has drifted down pretty significantly. And I, of course, ended the script with the fact that we’re at 96.5% current fiscal. So we’ve pushed it back up some. But that 30 basis point changed from last year for the third quarter, which the third quarter last year we were at 96.7%, and so we’re expecting to average in on the third quarter this year at 96.4%, still a good number, it’s real. There’s a real headwind, and it really is a difference from Q2 when we had a 30 basis point benefit. That’s a 60 basis point swing. So the real numbers, it relates to the strategy change, and then that actually tied back to yes, the market is performing as expected and it’s performing well. And the curve has – market peaked, as expected, in July as opposed to early, and so we were adjusting to that. So no, we’re not seeing – baking it in a big way, but thank you for the compliments.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. But were you saying, John, that the market hasn’t improved more than you thought it? The market has been consistent with the way you guys originally thought earlier this year?
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s Mike. Think of this as a big lagging machine. And what happens today, it doesn’t show up in the numbers until some future day because again, we have to turn leases in the new reality. So what we’ve done last year is we were given a choice between how much rent can we get in the third quarter. I’m talking about 2017. How much rent can we get? Or are we better off trying to push occupancy? We made an occupancy-based decision to push occupancy given that scenario. Now we’re looking at this year, 2018, and we come to a different conclusion. And the way it shows up in the numbers, it looks like it’s getting weaker, but - it’s not getting weaker, it’s getting better. It’s just going to take several months or couple quarters for you to really see the benefit of that. 2018, because of, again, the shape of the market rent curve, 2018, for the first half of the year, we have really tough comps because we gave up so much rent growth in the second half of 2017. That won’t happen this year. Again, I go back to this loss to lease being the critical piece of it, At the end of – July 2017, it was 2% and going down. And in 2018, it’s 3.5%, much more normal and much stronger. So again, it’s going to take a few months and some quarters for this to become apparent, but we’re looking down the road in terms of our pricing decisions and trying to maximize revenue down the road somewhere.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you. Actually, following that last question. So when you look at the decision of a year ago and push occupancy versus today to be more focused on the rent side, when you think about the change in the market, how much of that better outlook that you have today is due to stronger demand versus less supply? Or what’s the right way to think about the balance of those two things shifting over the last year?
John Burkart: I’ll – this is John. I’ll start and Mike want to – Mike might want to follow on. But really – certainly, we have strong demand out in the marketplace, and it’s showing in the curve. As well as, supply was a little bit light in the first half of the year, which we benefited from. So it’s really a combination, and that’s probably what brought the curve back to what you might say is the normalized seasonal pattern. And the result of that is better year-over-year comps as it relates to market rents and then, therefore, the shift in operations strategy.
Dennis McGill: Okay, just to clarify. When you say less supply in the front half of this year, was that a push out of supply into the second half of 2019?
John Burkart: So you know what? It seems like that’s just the ongoing theme for the last two years, is supply keeps getting pushed out. And certainly, in some markets like in L.A, we saw supply getting pushed out, and it continues to be pushed out. So yes, it’s not the supply somehow kind of evaporated, it’s just more of a – it continues to be delayed, and we’re benefiting from that. It’s – when the supply all comes at the same time in a concentrated area, that’s problematic. In context, the amount of supply that’s in the marketplaces, in MSAs, versus the demand, we’re clearly upside down there. We obviously have a housing crisis. We do not have enough supply. But it impacts pricing when it all gets delivered at the same time, same place. And so at this point in time, it’s – this last half of he year has been a little slower.
Michael Schall: Dennis I would add maybe one thing to that. And that is, it’s very difficult to determine when the supply is going to actually be completed because of these labor shortages and other things that tend to delay. So the way we have it now, for example, is we had much more supply in L.A. in the first half. But now, according to our projections, it looks like it’s mostly second half focused. However, we don’t know how much of that is actually going to get pushed into 2019. It’s just impossible for us to get down to that level of detail and to understand the labor markets in enough detail that we can make that comment. And Seattle is the other piece of it, which is, again, second – heavy second half supply in 2018. Some of that very easily could get pushed into 2019. So – but again, when we look at price and look at pricing and expectations, we use the best information we have, recognizing that some of these things are very difficult, if not impossible, to predict.
Dennis McGill: Yes. In understanding that volatility, I guess what I was trying to get at to make sure I understand your comments correctly is if you’ll be more offensive today on a go-forward basis than you were at this time a year ago, that more offensive strategies sounds like it’s being driven from the demand side, and it sounds like the supply side has a relatively similar outlook. Is that fair?
Michael Schall: That’s a – yes, okay, I get more of what you’re saying. Yes, the – we think supply and demand, critical housing shortage, we think there’s no way that demand catches up – or supply catches up with demand under any scenario. The issue is that when you get into some of these markets, the apartment deliveries are much more concentrated in the Downtown L.A. or Downtown Seattle, for example, South Lake Union in Seattle even more specifically than the downtown. And the more you get that concentration, the greater chance you have that several buildings are going to compete with one another and are going to start getting to six to eight weeks of concession, which effectively stops rental growth in your stabilized communities. So that phenomena is what I’m talking about. And this is periodic disruption. This has nothing to do with overall supply and demand. It just has to do with how aggressive owners become on lease-ups of multiple properties competing with one another in order to each absorb somewhere around 30 units a month. How far do they have to push rents or concessions in order to make that happen. I think that’s the key issue, and it’s very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As noted in the comments on the call, Seattle tends to also be more seasonal with respect to job growth and demand. And so that’s why we have pushed back on Seattle or pushed those estimates down in terms of market rent growth for the year.
Dennis McGill: Okay. One other question of Costa-Hawkins. If – have you done any work – when we look at your mix of assets pre and post-1995, any sense on where the market would be as to whether that change would be a relative benefit to you or headwind to you versus the broader market?
Michael Schall: It’s Mike. I’m not sure I understand exactly where you’re coming from. Let me just try and make a couple of broad comments. And Dennis, you can chime in here and – if I’m off base. We have – we’re operating in seven cities, as I noted in – on the call, in California. Four of them, we have more than 2,000 units in. And so the rest of them were, again, properties scattered throughout many cities in California, and there’s no greater concentration. So what we have done, and this is not a perfect science, what we’ve done is try to evaluate our portfolio in those four areas that we have the greatest concentration. Two of them have a less onerous but longstanding rent control ordinance. That’s L.A. and San Jose. And two of them do not have rent control at all. And so we’re, again, trying to monitor, make good portfolio allocation decisions, recognizing that our – we’re very diversified. And as John Eudy said, this conundrum of more – of rent control movement throughout California, while you have an enormous housing shortage and a bunch of law, again including the Global Warming Solutions Act, the 15 bills signed by Governor Brown last year, the conundrum embedded or the contradiction embedded in that discussion leads us to believe that there has to be a compromise somewhere in the middle, which will be to the benefit of less severe forms of rent control. But we don’t know, and it’s impossible to know at this point in time.
Dennis McGill: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you, guys.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: Hey, guys thanks for your time. Why don’t we just come back to the supply question a little bit? Is there anything – I know supply can be somewhat volatile and somewhat hard to completely forecast. But is there anything that would give you upside to expect that maybe supply would be lower than what you’re projecting? I know you mentioned development yields, and that makes a lot of sense to me. But we’re could upside be where this sort of supply crest happen sooner than we’re expecting?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike, and maybe some others want to chime in here. There’s a lot of things happening that affect development. It’s one of the most sensitive parts of our business. I’ve made the comments with respect to our preferred equity program where we’re seeing less opportunities. We started the year with a very robust pipeline, and little by little, it’s been pared down. And our belief is we were somewhere around $100 million this year, but we thought we were going to be well in excess of that. And when you look at the factors that are constraining that production, it goes back to those things that I said. But you have some new things. We have tariffs, which include Canadian lumber, for example, and steel. And you have direct – the rent control discussions are not pro-development or pro-business for that matters. And so you have a number of issues that you didn’t have before. And even though the state is trying to produce more housing, the environment seems to be pushing against that, leading to that contradiction that I was talking about earlier.
Rich Hill: Got it. And so is there any – are there any specific markets where you think supply might surprise to the downside versus the upside? Or is that getting a little bit too detailed?
Michael Schall: Well, we think Northern California mostly has peaked. And I mentioned the markets that we’re very confident that had peaked. The areas that we remain concerned about are L.A. and, I guess, Seattle would be the two because I – we don’t think that they have peaked at this point in time or there’s very significant permitting. I would guess that when you get down to the starts, that’s where you’re going to start seeing problems on those deals because – and John Eudy – John has two jobs. He’s the co-chair of our coalition, which is a full-time job – actually more than a full-time job; and he’s also Head of Development. And he looks at a lot of deals. John, why don’t you chime in and talk about what you’re seeing out there?
John Eudy: Well, I can say that in our dealings with cities on a couple of entitlements that were in the process, most cities’ impact on their stack is far less than it was a year and two years ago. There are far fewer deals being processed now than there were in the peak, if you will, of the development pipeline buildup between 2014 and 2015. So I think that the outlook two years from now is going to be very much aligned lower than it is in the worst-case exception that it’s growing because it’s not. And then the headwinds between construction costs and the concern right now in the short run with the Costa-Hawkins repeal is muting it even further. So supply is going down.
Rich Hill: Got it. And then just maybe one more question on Costa-Hawkins and Prop. 10. Your comments are very well taken on the market not having enough supply of affordable housing. But given all the noise associated with it, if Prop. 10 was to occur, would it lead you to think about maybe entering into some markets that you’re not currently participating in? Or are you just very confident with your markets over the medium to long term?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. It’s interesting, again back to the scenario. So if there’s a few cities – let’s go back to the pre-Costa-Hawkins world, which we did just fine, by the way. In that world, as John and I have talked about, there were a few cities that had very extreme forms of rent control and basically we built no housing in those cities. So obviously, the demand is the demand for housing. And therefore, it has to go somewhere else. So if you have cities with extreme forms of rent control, you would be more likely to invest in the cities that are nearby those cities, the places where those – the people that are working in San Francisco, for example, or Berkeley, for example, might live. And we got – have a pretty good idea of how that will work. Because presumably, if you’re going to lock down housing in some cities, the cities that are the likely beneficiaries will be the cities nearby. And rents will – because again, you’re talking about a net reduction of rental housing in that scenario, rents will probably go higher, not less high. So they will benefit from the greater demand or the lack of supply, let’s say, that is caused by the rent control cities.
Rich Hill: Understood. Thank you, everyone. I appreciate the color.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Hello, are you able to hear me now?
Michael Schall: Yes, we hear you.
Operator: Okay, you can hear. We’re going to join Karin Ford for her question.
Michael Schall: Great. Thank you.
Karin Ford: Sorry about that. Glad to hear we’re back. I wanted to just ask one more about Prop. 10. I know you said that cap rates haven’t moved in your markets, but are you seeing more product starting to come to market from landlords ahead of potential repeal?
Michael Schall: Karen, it’s Mike and thank you for sticking with us. Anecdotally, we’ve heard that there are some more listings out there. But as I said in my comments, we really scrubbed all the deals that have been completed year-to-date just to make sure that we weren’t missing something. So we went through them one by one, the deals that were in our – in the markets that we care hear about. And so there was no indication that cap rates have changed in those transactions. But again, so there are some anecdotes that maybe there’ll be a little bit more transaction activity as we get to the back half of the year, although that’s not unusual because all the sellers now that rents peak in June and July, and, therefore, they typically wait until June or July to get the best underwriting of their deals. So I wouldn’t say that’s at all unusual.
Karin Ford: Great. Thanks. And my second question is I was interested in your comments about single-family affordability in your markets and the lack thereof in – given the current tax regime. We started to see some weakness in the housing markets here in the Northeast, and we obviously don’t have the same job growth that you guys have out there. Do you think that single-family headwinds could be a real demand driver for you guys in 2019 as people start to recognize the tax impact of the tax law change?
Michael Schall: Karin, it’s Mike again. We’ve seen – when you look at production of housing in California, we’ve seen very, very low levels of production for single-family homes largely because of California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which seeks to put housing – high-density housing near the jobs, lower carbon pollution, fix the traffic problems that we have, increase in spending for public transit, et cetera. So that agenda is sort of operating in the background, and that is not a pro-single-family home type of agenda. So we see more densification of housing in the urban markets. And so I don’t think that’s going to happen. I think that if anything, there’ll be more condos being developed, and I think that’s a big possibility. And more on that discussion as well as it relates to a number of our properties. So I think it’s more likely to be in the high-density area than it is in the single-family home.
Karin Ford: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed.
John Guinee: Oh, great. Thank you. John Guinee here. Quick question for you. If you’re looking at land at today’s prices, and the current hard costs and, as you know, land prices are sticky and really haven’t come down, on an untrended basis, what does your underwriting show is the return on cost for development if you have to pay today’s prices?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy, John. It depends on the specifics, obviously, but far less than it would motivate you to do a deal. If you take it on today’s numbers, probably average somewhere in the high – and that’s buying land at today’s number and entitlements out a year. So the high 3%, low 4%, 4.25% at the high.
John Guinee: Do you see institutional money essentially willing to continue at that kind of – those kind of returns? Or are they finally backing off?
John Eudy: From my perspective, it appears like they’re backing off. And we see it through the pref equity program as well the pipeline going down. Mike, what do you think?
Michael Schall: Yes, I totally agree with John. And I would say maybe one caveat because there are deals that have a significant amount of money that are already invested in them, and those are the ones that tend to move forward. When you get beyond those transactions because, let’s say, a 4% yield is better than having $10 million invested in a deal that’s not going forward. So you end up with that conundrum. But aside from that, I totally agree with John.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Mike, I’d like to get your thoughts just on the broader political risk in California. I mean, Costa-Hawkins is one aspect, and you have some other legislation about initiatives moving against commercial landlords like Prop. 13, Prop. C. So the odds of legislators or voters reaching for the economics of landlords seem to be increasing. It’s becoming increasingly less leaning to date. I guess my question is, how do you approach political risk in comparing any type of risk-adjusted return framework to California markets versus non-California markets? And have you started factoring that into investment decisions outside of this Costa-Hawkins, very city level-specific considerations?
Michael Schall: Yes, John, this is Mike. It’s – that’s a – it’s a good question. And we – you – pretty much everything through the lens of supply and demand for housing. And so if the regulatory environment gets so extreme that you start seeing job growth slow, which drives the demand side, then that would cause us to make a different decision potentially. But we are always going to be the same. We’re going to look through the lens of supply and demand for housing, and we’re going to seek areas that have the best dynamic – the best supply-demand dynamic. And right now we believe that’s in California, in the various markets that we’re in. If that dynamic changes because of the political risk, then we would come to a different conclusion. So it’s – and I think it’s far from certain what California is going to do because we have seen, certainly on the office side and in a variety of ways, the local governments very willing to accommodate the growth of California, wanting to accommodate the Apples and Googles, et cetera, of the world. And you’re right, more recently, you’ve seen these head tax proposals and a variety of things that seem very focused on those entities. Notably, in Washington, Amazon, the head tax was repealed after being passed. But I think to give you some idea, there is some give-and-take here, and where the politicians come out on this is going to be really critical. I think, again, there’s a dichotomy here. You have Gavin Newsom that is supportive of our position with respect to Prop. 10. He’s not favor of the repeal, but the democrat party is in favor of repeal. You have a variety of issues going back and forth. I think we just need to let it play out. I mean, our hope is that reason prevails at the end of the day. And the – there’s a study by UC Berkeley’s Terner Center that starts a conversation about what should happen that I think is notable, and it’s available online. And so I think it’s too early to tell. And we will see – we will know in the next year or two which way this is going to go.
John Pawlowski: Okay, that’s super helpful. Today – back to the rent control risk. Today’s prepare – portfolio allocation decisions, are you redlining any cities right now from an investment standpoint?
Michael Schall: I wouldn’t say redline because, again, an investment decision – rent control is only one factor within the investment decision. And in fact, you would say that if, for example, Santa Cruz decides to establish a pretty extreme form of rent control, would there be a cap rate that would also bend? It’s not the current cap rate environment, obviously, but, again, there’s a number of considerations that really prevent you from absolutely redlining things. Again, assuming that the cap rates and yields are not – don’t change very significantly to compensate you for that risk and for the lower return.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Peter Abramowitz: Hi. This is Peter Abramowitz on from Tayo. I just wanted to touch on the tax expense growth in the same-store pool in the first half just given that it has particularly kind of climbed down in the second quarter but also below the peers’ in the first half. So I was just wondering what sort of trends you’re seeing that’s keeping that pretty low. And how sustainable is that going forward? Or what are you seeing for the back half?
Angela Kleiman: On the tax front, first half was lower, but it’s primarily because we had essentially property tax adjustments. And so we had expected – in the non-same-store pool. So as far as the same-store pool, it’s coming in pretty much as expected. Seattle is always a little bit of a wildcard, and it’d be coming a little bit higher. And so we do expect second half property tax to be even higher than in the first half. Does that answer your question?
Peter Abramowitz: Yes, sure. Thank you.
Angela Kleiman: Great. Thanks.
Operator: There are no more questions at this time. We will return the conference back over to Mike for closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you. Hey, we’re so sorry for our technical problems during the call. Apologize for that. And I want to thank you for your participation today. Hope to see many of you at the BofA Merrill Lynch conference next month. Good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company’s filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will comment on three topics: our first quarter results and outlook for 2018, regulatory matters and investment markets. Our first quarter results were stronger than expected, with significant improvement from a challenging second half of 2017. As note at the Citigroup conference in March, these results were better than our 2018 plan because of higher occupancy and other income, which John will discuss in a moment. Market rents for our portfolio grew 3.8% from year-end to the end of the first quarter versus 3.1% in the same period last year and are mostly consistent with our market rent growth expectations for the year. Job growth was relatively stronger in the first quarter, with Essex markets achieving 2.2% job growth on a trailing 3-month basis versus the U.S. average of 1.5%, with most of the outperformance emanating from the tech markets. This growth is notable considering the tight labor market conditions, which are demonstrated by ultralow unemployment rates, averaging 3.4% in the Essex markets and 4.1% for the U.S. We are encouraged by the strong start to the year and we’ll reevaluate our MSA forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental next quarter. The positive job growth has been achieved in part from migration from other areas, indicating the ability of local employers to source and retain skilled workers. The Bay Area continues to be a net attractor of talent, especially from high-cost East Coast metros. This trend is highlighted in the monthly workforce report published by LinkedIn, which details migration patterns of workers within LinkedIn’s network of more than 130 million users in the U.S. On Page 16 S-16.1 of the supplemental, we have reproduced a visual from the report that illustrates migration in and out of the Bay Area over the past 12 months. This supports our view that the number of educated workers moving into the Bay Area continues to outweigh the number departing. The Bay Area and Seattle remain among the most innovative and dynamic economies in the world, which compete successfully for high skilled workers. Wage growth continues to improve as the skilled labor shortage intensifies. Estimated personal income growth for 2018 for our West Coast metros ranges from 4.6% to 6.5% compared to 4.1% for the nation. Affordability pressures are relieved when wage growth exceeds rent growth as it has recently. This has led to a reduction in rent-to-income ratios year-over-year in all of the Essex metros. As cited in the Wall Street Journal, a recent study by Up for Growth National Coalition analyzed America’s housing shortage and proposed potential solutions. The study acknowledged the widespread nature of housing shortages for the U.S. in the 15-year period ending in 2015 affecting 23 states. In total, the study indicates the nation has produced roughly 7 million fewer housing units than needed to keep up with economic growth over that period. California, in particular, has the largest shortfall, consisting of nearly half of the total under produced housing or roughly 3.4 million housing units. The chronic shortage of housing in California and related problems of traffic congestion and long commutes remain key issues on the West Coast. Turning to supply. Our multi-family supply projections for the Essex markets remain unchanged on S-16 of the supplemental, and the impact of deliveries across submarkets vary widely. As a result, we continue to expect periodic disruption to pricing power and stabilized communities when the -- when multiple lease-ups in a submarket offer concessions exceeding 6 weeks of rent. At this point, we expect supply to be mostly flat in 2019 versus 2018 with an increasing share concentrated in downtown submarkets. Factoring in shortages of labor, strict land-use regulations, construction costs rising faster than rents and more conservative construction lending, residential construction appears to be slowing even though permits have continued at a strong pace. We are seeing many examples of residential developments being put on hold as the economics don’t pencil. This supports our belief that the construction pipeline has peaked in our markets and supply will slowly taper off over the next several years. On to my second topic, regulatory matters. I wanted to provide an update on California’s proposed referendum that seeks to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act that will likely appear on the November 2018 ballot. As you may recall, Costa-Hawkins, in part, restricts local jurisdictions from enacting rent control on any apartments completed after February 1995 and mandates that vacated apartments be priced at market rates. When the law was created in 1995, a primary consideration was that cities with extreme forms of rent control, including San Francisco, Berkeley and Santa Monica, produced minimal housing -- minimal rental housing after enacting rent control ordinances in the 1970. In passing Costa-Hawkins, California’s legislature thought to increase the production of rental housing to counter shortages and affordability issues, especially in cities that failed to contribute to the housing needs of the state. The California legislature recently considered Assembly Bill 1506, which like the proposed ballot measure would have repealed Costa-Hawkins. AB 1506 did not get passed the committee level in 2017 and again earlier this year. We believe that the legislature clearly understands that abolishing Costa-Hawkins could result in even greater shortages of housing in California, which could be a major headwind to business expansion, and thus, economic growth. The significant issues and unintended consequences of rent control have been researched and documented in great detail by the academic community and California’s government. This includes a 2017 study of San Francisco rent control by the faculty of Stanford University and a 2016 report by the Legislative Analyst’s Office. These studies conclude that rent control is a contributing factor to housing affordability issues, mostly due to shortages of housing. Rather than elaborate here, we refer you to links to both studies on the Internet at savecostahawkins.org. We will continue to provide periodic updates on regulatory issues in the future. And my third topic, investment markets. The demand for apartment property remains healthy. And as a result, we have seen no change to cap rates in our markets despite higher interest rates. For example, we are currently in contract on a disposition that is likely to close in the second quarter at a low 4% cap rate. This transaction and other recent sales support our belief that cap rates have not changed. A quality property and locations continue to transact around the 4% to 4.25% cap rate used in the Essex methodology. B quality assets and locations are generally 25 to 50 basis points higher, though often contemplate upside from redevelopment and/or value-add activities. As noted last quarter, we continue to see a slowdown in the preferred equity pipeline. This is consistent with my earlier comments that cost increases represent a headwind to new development. We continue to believe that we will be close to our target for preferred equity commitments this year. As of quarter end, our total commitments for preferred equity and subordinated debt investments aggregated 395 million. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today, and I will turn the call over to John.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. We’re off to a good start in 2018 with year-over-year NOI growth of 3.6% and revenue growth of 3.3% for the first quarter. Our strong revenue growth was favorably impacted by an additional 60 basis points of occupancy over the prior year’s period and higher-than-expected utility reimbursements due to timing and increases in the underlying utility expenses. Strategic adjustments made by the operations team led to increased occupancy through the promotion of short-term lease extensions, which led to fewer move-outs and an increase in month-to-month leases. Turnover in our portfolio dropped to 40% on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46% in the prior year. Part of the reduced turnover relates to the Executive Order signed by Governor Brown as a result of the devastating California wildfires, which effectively limited rent increases on all California housing to 10% above the price in place when the order was signed in October of 2017. It has been extended for selected counties directly impacted by the wildfires through the end of the year. We are working to ensure that we comply with the law where applicable, and we expect that it will impact operations in selected markets. Our operations strategy will continue to change with the market conditions. As we enter peak leasing season, we expect occupancy to decrease while turnover increases, as is typical for this time of year. Preliminary April 2018 results already show that our strategy is playing out as our year-over-year financial occupancy is only 30 basis points over the prior year’s period versus 60 basis point increase we achieved in Q1. In April, scheduled rent grew at approximately 2.3% and gross revenues grew at approximately 2.7%. April results indicate a sequential decline in revenues, a significant but expected slowdown from the first quarter. Overall, the Essex markets are performing as expected with Seattle a little weaker and SoCal a little stronger versus our expectations. Moving forward, we expect to see more typical seasonal pattern in rent growth, which is assumed as part of our 2018 forecast. Now I’ll provide an update on our markets. In Seattle, job growth continued to be the strongest in the Essex portfolio, posting year-over-year growth of 3.2% for the first quarter of 2018. This is the highest growth the region has seen since the third quarter of 2016. However, the impact to supply is evident in the rental market. Rents in March 2018 are slightly below where they were in the prior year’s period, and there was a gain to lease of 1.1% as compared to a 3.1% loss to lease at the same time last year. In Downtown Seattle, WeWork signed leases totaling 250,000 square feet. On the east side, Microsoft continued to expand their footprint in Downtown Redmond. Seattle MD has roughly 4.8 million square feet or 5% of the space currently under construction, nearly half of which is already preleased. Seattle median home prices continued to gain momentum, increasing almost 17% year-over-year for the month of March, making it the second fastest-growing region in the Essex portfolio, only surpassed by Bay Area markets. Our year-over-year same-store revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were 4.8% in the CBD, 4.2% in the east side submarkets while the north and south submarkets grew by 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively. Moving on to Northern California. In the first quarter of 2018, job growth in San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.4% year-over-year with roughly 75,000 jobs added. San Jose led the way with 2.9% job growth while Oakland and San Francisco were up 2% and 1.7%, respectively. Market rents in the Bay Area were up 2.5% in March over the prior year’s period leading to a loss to lease of 2.2%. In San Francisco, WeWork continued their growth trend, signing the largest year-to-date lease in the city for 250,000 square feet in the downtown area. Moving down to the South Bay. Facebook preleased 1 million square feet of planned office space in Sunnyvale. Google continued to acquire land near the Diridon Station, purchasing a site approved to build 1 million square feet of office space. In total, the company has invested roughly $300 million in that central San Jose submarket. Additionally, Google continues to expand in the Silicon Valley submarkets, having purchased 3 industrial buildings in North San Jose and 2 additional properties in San Jose and Mountain View. Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets have approximately 9 million square feet of office space or 6% of the total office stock under construction. Roughly two thirds of which is preleased. Median home prices in the Bay Area continued to soar, led by San Francisco and San Jose gaining approximately 20% and 33%, respectively, in March 2018 over the prior year’s period. The San Francisco and San Jose median home prices are now over 30% higher than their prior peaks in 2007. During the quarter, we started a lease-up of Station Park Green Phase 1, located in San Mateo with six-week concessions on selected units. As of April 26, we are 40% leased. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the first quarter of 2018 was led by our Fremont and Oakland submarkets with 4.8% and 4.0%, respectively. Heading down to Southern California. Job growth in Los Angeles County in the first quarter of 2018 averaged 1.5% year-over-year, which was in line with the U.S. Market rents increased 2.3% in March over the prior year’s period and loss to lease was 1.6%. Leasing activity by tech and entertainment companies remained strong in West LA with several leases from high-profile tenants, including another lease by Amazon Studios, expanding their Culver City presence for content production. As discussed last quarter, the downtown CBD submarket continues to be challenged with elevated levels of supply, causing our same-store LA CBD revenues to decline 1.1% in the first quarter of 2018. However, other Essex submarkets less impacted by the downtown supply performed much better in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year’s quarter with revenue growth ranging from 2.7% in Long Beach to 5.1% in Woodland Hills.  In Orange County, job growth improved in the first quarter to 1.9% year-over-year, a 20 basis point increase from Q4. The impact on supply on market rent is evident with market rents only increasing 70 basis points in March over the prior year’s period and loss to lease was 40 basis points.  Finally, the San Diego MSA continued to perform well, recording year-over-year job growth of 1.9% in the first quarter of 2018. Market rents increased 2.1% in March over the prior year’s period and loss to lease was 1.4%. Revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018 was between 3.6% in Chula Vista to 5% in the Oceanside submarkets on a year-over-year basis. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.8% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4.5%. Our renewals are being sent out at about 4% for the second quarter overall. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and increase to the full year guidance, followed by recent investment and capital markets activities and conclude with a balance sheet update. For the quarter, core FFO exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 per share. This is outlined on Page 4 of our press release. $0.02 of the outperformance is related to timing of operating and G&A expenses and is not expected to reoccur. The remaining $0.03 resulted from revenue growth realized during the quarter primarily due to our occupancy strategy, as John commented earlier. With this backdrop to our first quarter performance, we now expect the first half of 2018 property -- same-property revenue growth to be higher than the second half of the year. Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.86 per share, which is a 6.3% year-over-year increase. This represents 24 consecutive years of dividend growth and keeps us on track to become a dividend aristocrat in 2019. Moving on to the 2018 guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of same-property revenue growth guidance for the year by 15 basis points, thereby increasing the NOI growth by 20 basis points to 2.7% at the midpoint. This increase is primarily driven by first quarter performance, which also enable us to raise core FFO guidance by $0.02 per share to $12.46 at the midpoint. For the second quarter, we are forecasting core FFO per share of $3.05 at the midpoint, which is $0.04 lower than the first quarter. This is largely caused by two factors. First, interest expense will be higher in the second quarter due to the $300 million bond issuance closed in March, which had little impact to the first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating lower NOI growth in the second quarter as we shift strategy to favoring rent growth over occupancy coupled with higher operating expenses as we enter the peak leasing season. Note that both items are timing related and are consistent with our plans for the full year. Turning to investments and capital market activities. During the quarter, we continue to enhance shareholder returns through our joint venture platform with the amendment of BEXAEW entity by realizing a $20.5 million promote income. Last year, we stated our plan to monetize the embedded value within our private equity platform. Since then, I’m pleased to report that we have monetized nearly $60 million of promote income. This is consistent with our track record of structuring unique transactions to maximize value while maintaining a disciplined and thoughtful approach to capital allocation. Lastly, onto the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $300 million of 30-year unsecured bonds at a 4.5% coupon. The proceeds from the bond offering were used to repay secured debt maturities in 2018. With this offering, we have completed the most significant refinancing needs for the year.  As Mike mentioned earlier, we are under contract to sell one property. The proceeds from that sale will substantially provide for our 2018 development projects. Therefore, our need for additional capital in 2018 is de minimis, subject to new investment opportunities. With $1.2 billion of availability on our line of credit and 26% leverage and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet continues to be strong and well positioned. That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: I want to go back to one of the comments that you mentioned at the very beginning about population migrations. It’s one of the first times that I’ve heard you or your peers talk about this, and I’m sorry if I missed you talking about it previously. But I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit more. We’ve heard some comments that San Francisco just doesn’t have enough people moving there, and so I’m curious how sustainable do you think those population migration trends are. And obviously, it’s probably a little bit of a zero-sum game. So are they moving from one market to another market? How are you thinking about this?
Michael Schall: Rich, thanks for the question. I think it was invigorating. And I’m playing off of some of the other comments that were made on some other calls. But no, what we’re trying to demonstrate is whether the West Coast metros are competitive with the East Coast metros, and that may be countering some of the facts that you see out there with respect to U-Haul rates in and out of California and similar type things. What we think is happening is that we are attracting more than our fair share of the more skilled, highly skilled and highly compensated worker and perhaps losing some of the lower skilled and lower compensated workers, and we think that’s a normal process, normal evolution. And we’re obviously very concerned about whether our metros are competitive with other metros around the U.S. because employers have choices about where they’re going to locate. And so the competitiveness of the U.S% of the California markets are really important. And so we look for evidence that supports that basic thesis, and the LinkedIn information seemed to make a lot of sense. And if you go into the report we’ve published on S-16.1, the San Francisco metro movement in and out, but they go beyond that and they look at some other metros as well. So you can go, on to that report. But it really comes back to are these metros, the West Coast metros, competitive, are people willing to come here. And obviously, housing costs matter, but also compensation and opportunity matter as well. And making sure that we’re competitive with respect to that is something that we think is really important.
Rich Hill: And just one quick follow-up question. I think it’s an important distinction, but are you guys seeing these population migrations because of jobs? Or is there job growth because of population migrations?
Michael Schall: Well, I think it’s a bunch of different things. I think competitiveness of the industry is where the best opportunities are being created, and that’s why we think that the West Coast metros and specifically the tech markets, when you look at the job growth that was created, the outperformance of jobs relative to what our expectations were this year, it’s clear that the tech metros are attracting a lot of talent and bringing people here, confirmed by the commercial construction in the San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle metro areas, the office construction being a pretty good proxy for what’s going to happen a year or two down the road. So again, we’re looking for things that confirm whether the West Coast metros are attractive. And obviously, migration patterns, job growth, all these things put together to determine whether these metros are being successful and competing for talent.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Maybe just following up on that. Looking at out-migration from San Francisco, do the trends make you consider expansion in the Portland, Denver, Austin? And then what would you need to see to decide to expand?
Michael Schall: Clearly, Denver has -- is, I think, attractive. There have been a number of other multi-family companies that have made movements into that market. We have been invested in Portland, and we are looking at that once again. It’s a relatively small market. And the cost of for-sale housing is less expensive, and therefore, the transition from a renter to a homeowner can be a little bit of a headwind, and actually, I’d say both Denver and in the Portland market. I mean, our basic mandate is go to areas that have the don’t produce enough housing and where the housing choices, for-sale housing versus rental, that the for-sale side makes it a challenge to transition from a renter to a homeowner. So that has been -- served us well over a long period of time. Those are the markets we primarily look for. And so there are a couple of markets that are interesting. But I think that they would be a step-down relative to what we have in the markets where we’re currently invested in.
Nick Joseph: And then if Costa-Hawkins were to be repealed and I recognize that rent control is not immediately enacted, how do you think about your current portfolio positioning in terms of cities more prone to enacting rent control? And then is there anything you can do to proactively mitigate any impact?
Michael Schall: John Eudy is here. I’ll make a couple of comments. And if John wants to add to it, that would be great. It’s obviously virtually impossible to determine the financial impact of Costa-Hawkins. Obviously, Costa-Hawkins would enable local jurisdictions to adopt rent control measures. And we don’t know which cities might do that nor do we know the severity of their rent control ordinance. So without those 2, it would be very difficult to determine the impact. I think that as the old saying goes, as California goes, so goes the nation. And we may be the leader with respect to some of these rent control issues, but I don’t think that we’re the end of that. There was a proposal in Washington as well to repeal the statewide ban on rent control. We’ve seen that in a number of other states. So I think this is part of a broader trend. And so we’re -- it’s not something that is going to immediately cause us to change direction with respect to our portfolio allocations.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America.
Jeff Spector: My first question is on supply. I feel like your comments on ‘19, I think you said basically equal to ‘18, is that new? I thought previously you were saying down, maybe even last quarter you said down 25%. Has that changed?
Michael Schall: We worked down 25% last quarter. And so it was a smaller number but we did think it was declining next year relative to 2018. I think what happens is you get to the end of the year and we moved about almost 4,000 units from 2017 to 2018. And we have not yet moved units from 2019 to 2020 assuming that these delays continue, which is probably likely. And so again, we talked on the last call and have talked more recently about the difficulty in pinpointing exactly when the deliveries happen and how they play out. So we are -- so there could be a small decrease in 2019. We’re just not sure. The numbers are really hard to pin down. And therefore, our best guess is that over the next couple of years -- we’re looking at permits as well. Over the next couple of years that there will be a reduction, a slowdown, but it will be relatively small. We don’t see any major drop-offs, although there are pretty significant increases and decreases if you look at each metro. And for example, the Bay Area will be down in ‘18 and it will grow a little bit in ‘19. And so those types of variations will happen. So we think the trend is still down. We think that a lot of the permits are likely to get pushed back given the comments we made earlier about the relationship between rents growing somewhere around 3% and construction costs growing in the high single, low double-digit range. That obviously is not a good thing for residential construction. And so we think the trend is down but probably not by huge amounts.
Jeff Spector: Okay. And then my follow-up is just trying to get a feel for 2Q and peak leasing season given the strength that you saw in 1Q. And I know you’ve said in the past that 1Q typically sets up 2Q, 3Q. Would it be fair to say at this point are you driving rents in your markets as we enter April -- as we finish April and enter May? Can you say any general comments?
John Burkart: Yes. This is John speaking. So as I mentioned earlier, we gave out some information on April, and things are playing out as we expected. We are following the market. Now the market overall, big picture for the portfolio was up a little bit less than 2% year-over-year, so April ‘18 over April ‘17. And we’re making the best of our situation there as we follow the market. It’s working out according to plan. We reduced our vacancy as we’re looking to optimize our position. The markets are solid. We’re expecting that this year, we have a standard seasonal pattern whereas, last year, we had a -- the markets peaked a little bit early. So this year, we expect the seasonal pattern to be normal. We were benefiting a little bit by going into the peak leasing with higher occupancy, which was ultimately part of our plan to do what we could do to position our portfolio well to maximize our returns this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: With respect to kind of the expectation for the standard seasonal pattern in the back half of the year and you referenced significant improvement early in the year versus the second half of last year, how should we think about the deceleration throughout the year? And when would you anticipate stabilization in sort of the second derivative of revenue growth in the second half this year?
John Burkart: Sure. Let me try to address that. This is John again. So the big move that you’re going to see is really related to our occupancy. We largely did very well in Q1 because we had higher occupancy, as I mentioned, 60 basis points over the prior year’s quarter. We expect that to go down. Our plan is that our occupancy will be materially consistent with last year at about 96.6%, and so that will be the big change. Our expectations for rents really haven’t changed in our S-16, which is 2% to 3%. And right now, we’re at about 2%. The difference between last year and this year is we do expect the curve or the peak leasing to continue through the midsummer or late summer period as it historically had. And so we’ll start to benefit, we expect, by locking in higher rents, but that really will benefit ‘19, not ‘18. Did that answer your question?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. No, I think that covers the gist. And then as far as LA, you mentioned it being a little bit stronger with weakness mostly in the CBD, which probably doesn’t come as a huge surprise. When would you expect some of that supply to leak into West LA? Or would you?
John Burkart: You mean the impact of the supply to leak into West LA?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, correct.
John Burkart: Yes. It’s been interesting to watch -- I watch the different submarkets. Obviously, downtown LA has tremendous demand. There’s an awful lot of jobs there and more than there is supply. So the supply -- ultimately, everything will balance itself out. The quality of life in downtown LA continues to improve, and people like that. But there is a lot of supply going in that location right now. Small for the overall county, you’re less than, what, 0.5% overall supply in LA, but nonetheless, a lot of downtown. So they are pulling from different markets. And we’ve watched the impact in different submarkets. It’s interesting that sometimes it will be Pasadena, Glendale area; other times, Torrance area; other times, out in Woodland Hills. It seems to move around. I can’t explain that movement. This quarter, it happens that our Tri-Valley area and Woodland Hills are stronger and the Long Beach area is a little bigger. But it does seem to move around. So we’re actually seeing the impact of that over the last 1.5 years or so kind of rotating in the different markets. But in the end, again, the demand is significantly in excess of supply for the overall market. So it’s just a matter of people making adjustments in their lives and moving downtown, which is a very desirable place and getting better and better each day.
Austin Wurschmidt: So I think you referenced last quarter 77% of the new supply is West LA and downtown. How does your portfolio break out into kind of those two submarkets, I guess, and then versus the supply broken out between those two submarkets?
John Burkart: I don’t have the numbers exactly in front of me, but it’s -- a big portion of our portfolio is impacted by the downtown as well as the West LA. No doubt about it, and that’s why I had brought that up last time. So yes, we are impacted. You see that in our numbers, no doubt about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: First question, just want to go back to the comments on the same-store revenue growth. Last quarter, you had said that the first half of the year would be weaker than the second half of the year, and then that flipped today. But it sounds like the approach you took on occupancy is exactly what you expected going into the quarter. So can you maybe just bridge what drove the difference in the cadence for the year?
Michael Schall: Sure. So our expectations for market rents, we’re just trailing a little bit in where we expect the market rents to be. Our expectations on scheduled rent, the rent roll, are really spot on. The real big change was in occupancy, and that all really came together at the end of the year as a combination of factors from concession strategy that we launched as well as working to ensure that we do whatever we can from a community perspective as it relates to the fires, related to the Executive Order that was signed and, of course, comply with the laws. So all that together meant that we ended up lowering our prices on a month-to-month and increasing our month-to-month about 1.3% across the portfolio as well as we restricted renewal. And again, I mentioned on my comments that our turnover went from 46% down to 40%. So all of that kind of came together from the end of the year and then into the first quarter and gave us a benefit of the occupancy. But the market overall is really operating consistent with our expectations and our scheduled rent is. At this point in time, we’re watching as we expect our occupancy decline. And so it’s really not a change in our expectations for the year. It’s just we ended up with some extra occupancy Q1 and adjusted our guidance accordingly.
Dennis McGill: And then bigger-picture question just on the supply dynamic. You noted the new supply not penciling or new opportunities not penciling, but at the same time, I think you purposely talked to some of those academic studies or I think just what we all realize is the shortage of housing in general. So those two things don’t necessarily seem to go well together. If we have a shortage of housing and I’m on the side of high cost in one form or another, it doesn’t seem like I’m going to lower my cost anytime soon. So what would be the breakage, what causes costs to go down in that environment? Or if I’m a developer, said another way, why wouldn’t I look past those short-term issues if I feel there’s a shortage in front of me?
Michael Schall: We happen to have a developer in the room in Mr. Eudy, so he can answer that. But I would say, John, how many times in the 30 years you and I have worked together have we seen cost overall go down for new development? I mean, I don’t think ever, right?
John Eudy: Well, in the recession, it went down dramatically [indiscernible] the growth in recession...
Michael Schall: Okay. So that’s perhaps the only significant and that was driven mainly by the construction. The general contractors have very little to do and they want to get something started, so they’re willing to do it at very low profit margins. I guess, I contrast that with what see now, which is commercial construction booming, various types of residential booming, dramatic undersupply housing. And that’s driving construction costs again at around this 10% increase, which, again, there’s an imbalance here. And it doesn’t appear that the mend of that issue is anytime or is close to being at hand. So we would agree with you.
Dennis McGill: If you could look at that, those prior cycles, have elevated costs ever been the catalyst to slow supply?
Michael Schall: Of course. Of course. I mean, many times. Many times it’s been -- it’s caused supply issues. And in fact, it usually does when, again, we all realize the development is more risky than just buying buildings and putting a loan on them. And therefore, we require a premium because things don’t always go as we planned them to go in a development deal. And so the question is and I think you’re starting to see that now. When you start having some of these issues, rents don’t grow as fast as you hope or as fast as your pro forma expected and costs are going up, then your margins are being squeezed. Some landowners decide to go ahead at what would be considered to be a subnormal risk premium on those deals that has put more equity into the deal and they make those transactions move forward; as opposed to the other option, which is essentially putting them on hold and hoping that things get better down the road. And so that’s typically what happens. And we’re seeing a number of deals that really from the market-clearing threshold don’t hit the margins -- risk premiums that are typical in the industry, but they’re moving ahead, anyway. I’d say that in general, that is a limited -- that happens on a limited basis and pretty soon people run out of additional equity to throw into their deals to make them work. So I think we’re in that middle ground where the market is trying to deal with these forces, again, construction costs going up faster than rents and NOIs. And so we see deal flowing. That’s the primary reason that we’re looking at preferred equity deals and we’re looking at other development deals. It’s pretty challenging to make a transaction work.
John Eudy: A couple of other comments. At this stage of the cycle, too, exactions and city requirements and takes on -- additional fees tend to go up. So you have that coupled with hard costs and items that Mike mentioned that make it more and more challenging to economic and make a deal make sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Baird.
Alex Kubicek: This is Alex Kubicek on for Drew this morning. My question is a little bit of a follow-up to what we were just talking about with the general transaction market as a whole. It sounds like it’s tough to make things taper and attractive for you. But where do you guys see the incremental opportunities that you guys can take advantage of to hit your 2018 targets for the rest of the year?
Michael Schall: Well, this is Mike, and that’s a great question. It’s a little bit unclear. In the first quarter, obviously, the stock traded off pretty considerably and we thought that the better transaction or the better capital allocation was to buy some shares back. Now that the stock has recovered somewhat, somewhere around NAV, let’s say, ordinarily, we would look more to our co-investment platform in that scenario to make deals work. There were 20 deals in the first quarter that were in our marketplace that would generally have satisfied our overall transaction parameters. So there are deals out there. Again, when we have stock trading at a discount to NAV, we’re going to pursue that as opposed to buying deals at market. And so I guess, where we are now is probably relying on the JV platform to make deals. And if there’s significant changes in either direction, in the stock price, then our expectations can change pretty dramatically and pretty quickly.
Alex Kubicek: Kind of just as a follow-up, do you foresee this Costa-Hawkins uncertainty overhang causing any general shift in the next, call it, nine, 12 months in underwriting expectations on both the acquisition and the disposition side?
Michael Schall: It’s hard to anticipate exactly what’s going to happen there because you have interest rates that are thrown into the equation as well. And interest rates right now, let’s say, where we’ve gone from an environment we had, very strong, significant positive leverage on acquisition transactions to maybe a smidgen of positive leverage. So I don’t think that’s a negative factor, but it’s not a positive factor. I don’t think -- again, 20 transactions, most of them in California that closed in the first quarter, doesn’t seem to indicate that Costa-Hawkins is impacting or concern about Costa-Hawkins is impacting the transaction market. As we get closer to November, perhaps a little bit. But again, it’s still -- Costa-Hawkins does not mean rent control is going to automatically happen. And even if it does happen, the severity of rent control and which cities continues to be notable questions and important questions in the overall dynamics. So I think it’s still a little bit early to tell. And again, I’d just step back from it and look at -- California has huge housing shortage. You have the legislature in this AB 1506 that I talked about on the call that is pretty clearly not -- or concerned about the overall housing shortages in California, and it decided not to push forward with the repeal of Costa-Hawkins. And it seems like there are some forces out there that it’s too early to conclude that it’s going to have pervasive effects. But again, I don’t know at this point in time, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O’Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Mike, maybe just following up on the rent control. Just one, is it your understanding that single-family rentals would be -- are part of the rent control proposal or they would be separate? And also, from what you guys have -- in your speaking with folks out there in California, what’s your sense if you had to handicap -- is your sense that enough people understand how rent control will actually be a negative as far as curtailing development and raising and increasing un-affordability? Or is your sense from how the polling is going that the sentiment is building to pass an overthrow of Costa-Hawkins?
Michael Schall: Yes. John Eudy is here and he spends a tremendous amount of time and has really led the industry in this discussion. So John, do you want to take that one?
John Eudy: Sure, Mike. First on your first question on single-family, the repeal measure that is going to the ballot, it appears, does include removing the exemption of single-family. So yes, if passed, single-family would be exposed to having rent control applied to it, which is a big -- one of the big proponents for us because it means the majority of the rental units, as you well know, in California are mom-and-pop owned and smaller local-owned entities and they have a lot to lose. And that brings the attention to the ballot measure in a wide way to be in our favor to oppose it. Generally speaking, we’ve been working on this pre-campaign for about 9 months before it officially got put into play in January. And they just recently collected enough signatures to technically qualify this to the Attorney General right now office to get to the final legs by the end of June.  But we believe from a policy perspective, clearly, the legislature gets it. That’s why it never made it out of committee at AB 1506. And we also know that every academic study that’s ever really been done on rent control understands the unintended consequences that it actually hurts those that it supposedly is intended to help. So we’re pretty encouraged that -- with our initial polling and how we’re going to be managing the campaign. We’re actually going to push this back, and at the same time, come up with, at the tail end, ways to bridge the gap on affordability issues at the lower and middle end of the range because that’s really where the problem is. Rent control per se, the reason Costa-Hawkins was enacted in 1995 was because it stopped housing and the last thing you want to do in housing production. So we’re fairly confident that we’re going to get there and message it through. And if it does go to the ballot, which it appears it will, that we will prevail.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, you guys mentioned -- John, I think you mentioned that some of the emergency rent -- things are still -- in some -- in effect through the end of the year in some submarkets. But you also mentioned that your policy in the second quarter is going to focus more on boosting rent versus occupancy. So can you just sort of give a color for how much of your portfolio is still impacted by the 10% limit versus how we think about you guys boosting rents and having occupancy drop off in the second quarter?
John Burkart: Sure. Let me give a little bit of a broader answer to that, Alex. First off, the number one county that is impacted that we operate in is in Ventura. So it’s less than 5% of the company that would be directly impacted. However, we’re -- anywhere where we think there would be an impact, we would want to work with the community. It’s what we do. Essex has always been interested in the work with the communities. So if there were assets -- we just haven’t found situations where there’s people that have been impacted by the fire that are moving in or around or near our assets. As it relates to the change, I wouldn’t call it policy, but it’s more of a -- how we operate seasonally. Seasonally, the rents in our market in the portfolio grow from January a low or December a low, up about 5% to 6% and then down -- back down. And so we modify our operational strategy based on the season. And so it’s best to emphasize occupancy during the, you might say, slower season and emphasize meeting the market on rents at the higher season. But again, we’re in a situation where our rents are moving overall, as I mentioned, year-over-year about 2%. We expect them move about 2% or 3% this year. So it’s a minor adjustment, but it will impact our occupancy in Q2. Does that answer your question?
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes. So it’s just Ventura County? That is the only one that is affecting you guys?
John Burkart: It’s the main county. I mean, there’s a few other bits and pieces here and there, but it’s the main thing. Big picture, it’s about under 5%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess, Mike, in Seattle, there’s this head tax that is potentially coming through the legislature, and it seems like Amazon has put the brakes on some development and maybe that’s just posturing on their part. But I’m just curious how you sort of think about that and how you maybe think about some of the risks in Seattle over the next six to 12 months?
Michael Schall: Yes. Steve, that’s a good question. And it seems that Amazon is pushing back pretty hard, has threatened to slow down construction of some office space in Seattle. We have the whole HQ2 thing. I think there was an announcement that they had moved 1,000 jobs to Boston and 3,000 Vancouver or BC. So there’s been a lot of things happening with respect to Amazon. However, at the same time, we try to track the top 10 tech companies and what they’re doing and how many open positions they’ve had. And they’ve actually added a lot of positions. So Amazon at the end of last quarter had about 4,700 open positions, and that has grown to 6,700. These are in California and Washington only. So we still see a pretty good impact from Amazon. I guess, I’d go back to the Boeing example and say that Boeing and Seattle had a give-and-take relationship, let’s say. And I think that it’s important for any major employer to have options and just so you can make sure that you keep the pressure on the local governmental agencies. I think they’re doing exactly what any major employer would do. Does that help?
Steve Sakwa: Yes. So it doesn’t sound like you’re overly worried about this head tax, I guess, getting passed that’s slowing job growth. It just sounds like a lot of posturing but ultimately doesn’t maybe create any major headwind to the city?
Michael Schall: Well, I think it’s part of again, just part of a negotiation, right? And so I think when you look at what they actually did, they actually added a couple of thousand jobs, there’s a couple thousand more job openings now this quarter versus a quarter ago. So I’d say that’s generally a positive thing, looking at Amazon specifically.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. And then just to maybe circle back, I know there’s a lot going on in the development side. And just to make sure I understand your views, so you still think supply will kind of be even in ‘19, but that by 2020, you kind of get a bigger falloff just given this rise in construction costs and more limited rent growth? Is that kind of the way you think about it?
Michael Schall: I’d put it maybe a little bit differently. We think that permits can disconnect pretty significantly from what is actually started and delivered. And so we tend to -- because you can stretch out even if you pull a permit and the question is are you pulling a grading permit, are you pulling a zoning permit or a building permit. And we’ve had examples our Hollywood deal, for example, that was picked up as a permitted transaction two years before we got a building permit. So the time lines are much longer on the West Coast. And so what we have learned is we look at permits and try to monitor starts, but we really get involved when something is under construction because we send our econ team out on a job-by-job basis and try to get a good handle for what’s being delivered. So it’s difficult for me to talk about 2020 at this point in time. Again, I think what I said earlier remains our best estimate that the trend is to go down slowly for supply to come down slowly. But again, it’s a little bit murky and it’s hard to specifically address what’s going to happen unless you’re within that two year window where it’s actually under construction and we can monitor its progress. Again, at the end of last year, we moved almost, what, 4,000 units across our footprint from 2017 to 2018. When you have that much movement, it’s hard to say exactly what’s going to happen when you have less clarity going a year or 2 out. Does that make sense?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay: I want to go back to that LinkedIn study, just kind of curious what drove it. Were you more concerned about how the Bay Area with all those job openings, with all the office under construction impact labor market? Or you’ve actually seen within your properties an outward migration?
Michael Schall: Wes, it’s Mike, and anyone else can pitch in, too. Again, it was more -- it isn’t anything that we have seen in our properties that’s prompted that. Again, this is a research effort trying to understand the competitiveness of our metros versus other metros in the U.S., recognizing that over the long periods, companies have choices, people have choices, et cetera. And so it really comes back to trying keeping a handle on the competitiveness of our metros relative to other major metros around the U.S. And again -- so we found the LinkedIn study, you have job growth, you have a variety of other indicators that seem to lead us to believe that our metros are pretty competitive and are doing a good job of attracting talented workers, which is our mandate and which is what has allowed us to outperform over a long period of time.
Wes Golladay: And then, I guess, maybe what stood out the most? And it sounds like you feel a little bit better post-study. And I guess, one thing that stood out to me was that it looks like Los Angeles is losing people to the Bay Area. I actually thought it would -- might have done a little bit better concerning all the tech jobs that were going to the Southern California area.
Michael Schall: Yes. On the LinkedIn study, we reproduced what was there. So there’s no -- we haven’t added anything to that. We may have presented it a little bit differently. I guess, as we look at things -- just look at the level of job growth that we have, and again, back to the trailing 3-month numbers where we just did so well in Northern California and Seattle. We did a little bit better in Southern California. We’re 0.2% better on job growth than what our S-16 estimate was, but we’re 0.8% in Northern California and 1.1% better in Seattle. I mean, it just shows that the strength of those markets on the jobs front is pretty exceptional and a lot better than what we expected. And that’s where these companies are adding people and they’re producing the number of products. And it’s a very vibrant situation and I think unlikely to -- that trend is unlikely to change over the next couple of years. It seems like that is where wealth is being created and where companies are really doing well.
Wes Golladay: And I just had one question on development, more so for the private developer. Can you give me an estimate, how much equity they have in the development? And are you starting to see them get squeezed at all with the delays, cost overruns, rising interest rates and probably a little bit below expectations on the underwriting for market rent growth? And if they are getting squeezed, have you changed your criteria for your preferred equity investments?
John Eudy: I’ll answer the first part of that. Yes, the smaller developers are getting squeezed. The equity requirements are close to 50% with construction loans in the 50% to 55% range. And if they went into a deal, assuming cost was going to be X without having it bought out, they’re going to have an equity squeezed n the backside because costs have gone up over the last 18, 20 months, 24 months, as Mike mentioned, in the double-digit range. As far as the preferred equity deals, we’re seeing less opportunities, as Mike mentioned, because of the economics more than anything else, not necessarily anything beyond that. If expectations are development deal needs to be in the 5, 5.25-plus range and they’re really 4 to 4.25, a lot less people transact unless they’re in a position where they need to go. And that’s preferred equity deals that we’ve been focusing on because they are bought in and already funded. They’re just a little bit short on the equity capitalization. We’ll let them put us ahead of them and subordinate their interest and make it so it’s a safer deal from our perspective and still a good transaction although skinnier return on their side.
Michael Schall: Well, I would just add that, keep in mind, these are in our markets. We use our underwriting, so we’re not relying upon the developer’s underwriting. We have obviously a direct development effort, and so we do our own underwriting. This program is enabled because construction lending, again, in the 55% loan, the cost area used to be -- most of our career are somewhere in the 75% plus or minus loan to cost. So that’s what has enabled that program. And so we really haven’t changed how we look at it. But I just want to make it clear that it’s not like we’re taking someone else’s underwriting and then making the investment. We underwrite it based on how we look at the world and consistent with all the other activities around here. So I think we have a big advantage when it comes to deal selection.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: You mentioned that housing prices continue to soar in many of your submarkets. Has there been any more positive momentum on the condo conversion side for rental?
Michael Schall: Karin, it’s Mike. Yes, we are incrementally more excited about it. And as that differential between apartment values and for-sale values diverges, it becomes more and more interesting. And we are working on transactions pretty diligently. And so the answer to the question is yes, definitely.
Karin Ford: And do you think we could see something potentially transact before the end of the year?
Michael Schall: I don’t think so. I think early 2019 is probably the earliest it could happen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: I wanted to head back to Nick’s question around how you’d approach your portfolio. Under repeal of Costa-Hawkins, not exactly exploring new markets right now, but within your current footprint, would on the margin perhaps shift allocations to Southern California where the political pressures may not be as high as the Bay Area?
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s Mike. There is actually a significant number of cities in Southern California that have discussions about rent control. And so I don’t think that, that necessarily offers us a great deal of relief. And I would also say that our expectation for rent growth and the greater shortages of housing are in the north. And so I think that there’s some -- a couple of considerations. And then you have the cost of transacting and -- which is -- can be pretty substantial as well. So again, until we have greater clarity about where this is going to go, we are assuming that this will be part of maybe an effort over the next decade to reexamine the effect of rent control in the United States, not just California. And I think that we’ll come back to the same conclusions that are in all these studies, including, again, the Legislative Analyst’s report for -- which is California -- bipartisan committee in California and other areas. So I think that’s where we’re going. And again, I think that we are pretty good at transacting when we know a little bit more information. Now we’re just -- we’re guessing about what might happen. As we get closer to it, I think one of the nice things about the company is we are careful and selective and pretty opportunistic about using our capital on a thoughtful way. And I’m pretty sure that there will be opportunities that present themselves.
John Pawlowski: Makes sense. And then I wanted to go back to the permitting discussion and zoning on Oakland, East Bay metro, in particular. I understand the permitting data is far from perfect, but the trend there has been consistent acceleration in permitting growth as a percent of stock. So John Eudy, just curious if there’s been any on-the-ground inflection points in terms of zoning policies or pro-development or if it’s just drafting off of the Bay Area and nobody can put the shovel in the ground in the Bay Area or across the Bay so they go to Oakland to get deals done.
John Eudy: There are a couple of things. You all heard about SB 827, the Wiener bill that was attempting to change at the state level how things get zoned around transit-oriented locations. Came out of the chute fairly optimistic and with a lot of political-backed support and then died about a month ago in the committee level because of local control and then, again, stopping what seemed to make sense on the surface. So it’s not any easier anywhere to get developments today than it ever has been in spite of the 15 bills that were passed last year. On the margin, it -- the momentum is shifting in the direction to make it easier, but we haven’t seen any real play on that. On the East Bay you were referring to, I assume its Oakland, Alameda County. It -- they have been more open to development, which makes sense because of the cost of housing in San Francisco. And we do think that will continue to be the direction that Oakland goes in the near term as long as the economics make it work. The problem again is the details of how the transaction economically is penciled, if you will, which is the biggest challenge we have in production across the Northern California market.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne: I’ll try to be brief. I just wanted to go back to the occupancy strategy during the quarter maybe relative to what you’re seeing in terms of job growth and supply. Just I can’t quite circle the -- why exactly you boosted occupancy so high and did things like limiting the renewal pricing in front of peak leasing, if job growth was coming in better and if you believe that supply is going to be down on a year-over-year basis. Can you just help me circle that narrative?
John Burkart: Sure. We look at it and say if you’re sitting on a vacant unit, you’re not collecting any income. And so if we can create a scenario where our residents are benefited and we’re benefited because we keep that unit occupied during a slow season, we think that’s a good thing. And I think we were able to accomplish that objective very well. We had, again, our turnover go from 46% down to 40%, which really means the majority of the boost in the occupancy was fewer move-outs, which is a great thing. In doing that, it enables us to be positioned well to meet the market as the peak season leasing comes upon us. And so we’re not looking with buildings that have occupancy issues and struggling with our market rents. We’re able to try to meet the market wherever the market is. And again, our expectations are that the market will move up in the 2% to 3% year-over-year range, but we’ll be able to meet the higher end of the, meet the market where it’s at. So the strategy makes sense from our perspective. Otherwise, we would have just ended up in the same spot but with lower occupancy for Q1 and, in essence, less income.
Buck Horne: Okay. Yes, I hear you. But it kind of reduced your available inventory going into an ability to price higher with the seasonality, I thought. But.. 
John Burkart: I see what you mean. Our turnover increases. Our natural expiration of leases increases pretty significantly. And so that will open up potential supply of units. And again, remember, some of these situations where we have people on renewals and we allow them to stay at a lower premium month-to-month for a short period of time, they will move out. I mean, they have the option of doing a 12-month lease if they so choose, but they chose to go for a month-to-month. It’s just extended their stay a little bit, but they’ll move out most likely during the peak leasing season. That is our expectations.
Buck Horne: Ann just quickly, did I hear you, correctly, I apologize if I missed the quoting here. But I thought you might have mentioned something about April revenue indicating a slight sequential decline from the 1Q levels. And that was driven mainly by...
John Burkart: Yes, yes, no, no. Yes -- no, you didn’t, not because of Seattle but because of occupancy decline. Yes -- no, that’s exactly what we said. And I mentioned that scheduled rent was coming in at 2.3% and that our -- in April year-over-year and that our occupancy April year-over-year gain was 30 basis points. And I did that because I wanted people to understand that we’re going from Q1 where we had a 60 basis point year-over-year increase rolling into Q2 and now we’re at 30% and will ultimately -- our expectation is our occupancy will match last year. So again, the year is now playing out as planned and we’re positioned well. But yes, there’s no doubt, so that it’s not that the market is not good. The market is performing as planned. The difference is really in occupancy and how our portfolio is positioned, kind of getting to your point, taking advantage of the peak leasing season.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator, and thank everyone for your participation on the call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference in June. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. The statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause these actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. Through the question-and-answer portion, management does ask that you please be respectful of everyone’s time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. Today, I will discuss three topics: our fourth quarter results and expectations for 2018, recent regulatory activities and update on investment markets. On to the first topic. 2017 was another successful year for Essex with core FFO per share growth of 7.9%, exceeding the high end of our initial guidance range and mostly driven by the same property portfolio, accretive investments and opportunistic capital market activities. As always, we have focused on driving growth to the bottom-line which allows us to have one of the best track records in the industry for dividend growth. To that end, later this month, we expect our Board of Directors to approve our 24th consecutive annual increase in the common dividend positioning us nicely to become a dividend aristocrat a year from now. Since the IPO in 1994, we have paid about $85 in dividends, 4 times the IPO price. On the Q3 conference call, we expressed concerns about slowing job growth for both the nation and on the West Coast, noting that unadjusted total non-farm employment declined sequentially in most of the Essex markets in Q3 2017. In Q4, job growth improved in the Essex markets with the three month trailing average job growth at 1.6% better than the 1.4% estimate reflected on last quarter’s Essex gain. This significant volatility of job growth in the Essex markets and the improvement in Q4 is graphed on page S-16.1 of the supplemental along with historical information to provide contents. Turning to our outlook for 2018, we published our key economic assumptions for the year on S-16 of the supplemental. In 2017 the U.S. economy experienced significant improvement in GDP relative to previous years and we believe the recently enacted Tax Reform bill will further stimulate economic growth into 2018. Thus, we have increased our GDP growth expectations in 2018 to 2.7%. Turning to job growth, we expect U.S. job growth to remain relatively flat in 2018 at 1.4% primarily due to the tight labor markets and low unemployment rates both nationally and on the West Coast. Job growth in the Essex markets is expected to be 1.6% consistent with 2017 which should create about 201,000 jobs across our footprint. This should be sufficient to drive housing demand above the 67,000 total housing units expected for delivery, both rental and for sale, thus continuing Coastal California’s chronic housing shortage. Office construction which often perceives job growth continues at a robust pace in the tech market representing around 6% of stock in the Bay area and 5% in Seattle. For several years, virtually all of the apartment supply has been focused on the luxury segment creating shortages at lower price points and stretching rental affordability. When wages grow faster than rent as is expected in 2018, the affordability issue for apartments abates. Thus while wage inflation may negatively impact interest rates, it improves affordability and often rent growth. In 2017 personal income growth has been estimated at 4.5% in the Essex markets compared to 2.8% for the nation. In 2018 both U.S. average and Essex markets are expected to accelerate to 4.3% for the U.S. and 5.3% in the Essex markets. As you might expect rent-to-income ratio is still or remain unchanged in six of the eight metros in which we operate including those in Northern California. Improving economic conditions overall lower supply levels and better affordability underlie our expectation for better market rent growth in 2018 versus 2017. Now onto my second topic regulatory matters. I have commented on prior conference calls about California bill 1506 proposing to repeal the Costa-Hawkins rental housing act which limits the scope of rent control enacted by local governments. As in 2017, AB 1506 recently failed to obtain the required support to move out of committee make it unlikely will be inactive at least in 2018. The bill analysis available online references a 2016 study by the legislative analyst office states that “expanding rent control protections would not increase the supply of housing and likely would discourage new construction flow.” While we concur with this view it misses other important issues. Our recent study of San Francisco's rent control by faculty at Stanford Business School found that longer tenant fees and reduced supply growth citywide rents upward as apartment hunters had to compete for fewer available units. As noted last quarter there is also referendum to repeal Costa-Hawkins which is currently in the qualification process for the November 2018 balance. In response to this effort a coalition named California's For Responsible Hosing was organized to oppose the effort. The coalition has strong support from owners, industry association and other impacted groups. We will provide an update on future calls as wanted. Similar to AB 15016 California, there is a bill in the Washington state legislator to repeal the state’s ban and rent control and it seems like the other states will follow California's lead. we are monitoring the situation and we will provide an update on future calls. Turning to the Federal Tax bill that passed late last year. while there is been a lot of attention on deduction limits related to state and local taxes, it’s important to distinguish between renters and homeowners. For renters who don't deduct property taxes of mortgage interest the lower tax rates are a clear bids to after-tax income. These new limits also reduced the tax incentive to buy a home likely resulting in greater demand for rental housing. The tech market in Northern California and Seattle should also benefit from the repatriation of cash held overseas by large tech burns amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars. Apple has already announced plans to repatriate cash and expand domestically. Overall, there has been a lot of negative press related to the tax law changes and it’s a fact on California, which generally appear to be overstated certainly from the prospective of apartment ownership. Finally my third topic investment. Regarding asset values recent transaction activity indicates that cap rates remain stable. A quality property and locations continue to transact around a 4% to 4.25% cap rates using the FX methodology. These quality assets and locations are generally 25 to 50 basis points higher although often contemplate up side from reevaluate and/or value activity. With the recent most other sideline due to the cost to capital and a meaningful increase in apartment mortgage rates, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. Recent increases in interest rates have caused some noise and negotiation, but ultimately cap rates have not changed at this point. In December, one of our co-investment entities completed the sale of two properties each about 28 years old at about a 4.1% cap rate which represents a lower rate and higher valuation relative to my previous comments about cap rates. During the quarter, we started one development in Hollywood which is the legacy project where we have the very little land basis. As previously noted, it has become very difficult to make new deals pencil given double-digit increase of construction costs coupled with slower rent growth in the recent past. Therefore, we have not assumed enemy starts as part of our 2018 guidance. Overall, we are seeing a general pullback in development stars in our market, which we believe will lead to lower levels of new supply in most of our markets over the next several years. Finally, we originated three preferred equity investments during the quarter for $65 million as outlined in the press release bringing our total commitment at year-end to $394 million. We expect to bifurcate the program into two parts going forward; the first part will be for under construction apartment properties, which will be capped at $400 million. The second part will represent investments involving completed apartment properties, which will generally have a lower preferred return and will be subject to an aggregate cap of $500 million. We are currently seen a slowdown in our pipeline of opportunity to originate preferred equity deals confirming our belief that apartment development starts are moderating. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Essex finished the year with another good quarter. Our fourth quarter year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth was 3% and 3.4% respectively. Our same-store results were slightly better than our expectations due to higher occupancy and greater growth in other income and [indiscernible]. These results are evidence of another strong year for the Company and I want to thank the Essex team for the continued dedication to our success. As we mentioned on our third quarter conference call, market net growth peaked earlier than normal due to elevated supply and slower than expected job growth. The negative impact of the early market net peak will continue as a headwind for revenue growth in 2018 due to the volume of leases that we signed during this summer leasing month with little to no increase over the expiring leases. Concessions in the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately 700,000 consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, however geographically the allocation was very different. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 70% of the concessions were related to Southern California asset compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with 90% of the concessions were related to Northern California asset. As the concentration of new highly competitive lease ups has decreased in Northern California, the concessions are declining for the new lease up and disappearing in the stabilized communities as expected. Moving forward, we expect to see a more typical seasonal pattern in rent growth, which is assumed as part of our 2018 forecast. Therefore, we expect our loss-to-lease to rebound quickly as we enter the peak leasing season. Regarding the executive order signed by Governor Brown as a result of the devastating California wildfires, which effectively limits rent increases on all housing to 10% above the price in place when the order was signed in October of 2017. It has been extended for all of California until mid April 2018 and for selected counties in Southern California through June 2018. Although the market rents are now increasing at that rate, the application of the law leads to selected challenges such as pricing short-term premium, selected renovation, et cetera. We do not expect that the temporary law that’s currently applied to materially impact our earnings in 2018, however we are watching the situation closely. Our full year expenses came in below our original guidance at 2.7% over the prior year as a result of the various cost saving initiatives that we have been working on. We were able to hold our controllable expenses to about 50 basis points year over prior year which helped offset the impact of the 7.3% increase in utility. Now, I will provide an update on our markets. In Seattle, job growth remains strongest in the Essex portfolio posting year-over-year growth of 2.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Amazon continued to expand their Seattle footprint in Q4 adding over 300,000 square feet of space and bringing the total expansion for all of 2017 to just under two million square feet. Additionally Microsoft announced a multi-billion dollar campus renovation and expansion in Redmond that will occur over the five to seven years and add up to 1.3 million square feet of new space. Office absorption in Seattle continues to be robust. In 2017 net absorption totaled 4.2% of existing stock, the highest percentage of any metro in the U.S. Seattle’s medium home prices grew at 14.6% year-over-year for the month of December making it the third fastest growing market in the Essex portfolio only surpassed by San Francisco and San Jose. Our year-over-year same-store revenues for the fourth of 2017 were led by the CBD and north submarkets at 4.8% to 4.9% respectively while the east side and south submarkets grew by 3.6% and 4.2% respectively. Turning to Northern California. For the fourth quarter, job growth in the Bay area averaged 1.7% year-over-year. In San Francisco [indiscernible] and Airbnb signed new leases which added over 300,000 square feet to the downtown tech footprint. In San Mateo an extraordinary development, Station Park Green, Guidewire Software fully leased an under construction office project that is scheduled to be completed in the first half of this year. Moving south, Facebook extended footprint across the Bay in Fremont the market where Essex owns just over 3,000 units with the new 190,000 square foot lease. Tesla also announced that they were expanding their Fremont office to accommodate 1,500 employees in addition to the 10,000 employees already in the market. And in the South Bay WeWork [Agnostis] (Ph) signed leases totaling over 8,000 square feet. Over 13 million square feet of office is under construction in the Bay area with San Francisco accounting for nearly half the pipeline and more than 70% of which is pre-leased. Home prices in the Bay area continue to soar, as tenants lease their portfolio of 24% year-over-year growth in December with medium home prices at $1 million, over four times the national average. Essex continues to perform well in the Bay area during the fourth quarter of 2017 with year-over-year same-store revenue growth led by a Fremont submarket at 5.4%. Moving down to Southern California, in Los Angeles, job growth lagged the U.S. with 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. LA’s tech footprint continued to expand during the quarter as evidenced by several noteworthy leases throughout the region. Tesla, Facebook and Apple all signed new leases in LA during the quarter totaling 425,000 square feet from West LA to Culver City, co-working companies we work and states these leased in additional 150,000 square feet of office space in downtown and West LA. Our LA year-over-year same store revenues for the fourth quarter grew at 4.6% in Long Beach, 3.7% in Tri-City, 3.3% in Woodland Hills and 1.7% in West LA. We saw a decline of 2.2% in the LA CBD due to elevated levels of new supply, which is leading to highly concessionary market. Looking forward roughly 77% of the projected LA market 2018 supply is concentrated in the West LA as downtown submarkets, where two thirds of FX of LA portfolio is located. In the Orange County, year-over-year job growth improved in the fourth quarter to 1%, a 70 basis point increase from Q3. Almost half of the 550,000 square feet of office absorption for the full year occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, which is consistent with a pickup in job growth noted above. In the fourth quarter, our north and south submarkets grew at 5% and 3.3% year-over-year. Finally, San Diego posted 1.3% year-over-year job growth for the fourth quarter, similar to Orange County almost half of the total full year’s office absorption occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017. All those supplies expected to increase in San Diego in 2018 over 50% of the supply is coming from the downturn submarket, where we only have one asset. San Diego's supply outside of the downtown is actually projected to be lower in 2018 compared to 2017. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.7% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4.7%. Our renewals are being sent out at about 3.3% for the first quarter overall. Thank you and I will now turn the call over to our CFO Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. Today, I will focus on our 2018 guidance followed by capital market and balance sheet activity. Starting with our 2018 market outlook, page S16 of the supplemental provides an overview of the key healthy supply and demand assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations. In our West Coast markets overall, we expect similar total multifamily supply deliveries this year versus last year. Although our differences within each major region are more pronoun; for example, we expect Southern California supply to increase by 11% due to LA and San Diego. In contrast, Northern California supply is expected to decrease by 28%, primarily attributed to San Francisco and San Jose. We noted that our key vendor, Axiometrics has significantly higher supply in our west and north in 2018. In addition, their 2017 supply was also higher than ours and higher than what was actually delivered. From reconciling with them, we learned that Axio moved all of the delayed 2017 supply into 2018, but they have not yet made any adjustment for the expected delays in 2018. Just a quick review of our process. We approach our supplier research with both a top-down and bottoms-up due diligence, which includes driving individual sides to verify the construction progress and we also state the delivery is consistent with how we would approach delivering our own projects. Turning to demand. Historically, job growth in our markets outperformed the U.S. as Mike commented earlier. We expect that front to continue in 2018 with the forecast of 126% for our market compared to 1.4% nationally. Given this economic backdrop, we expect market rent growth of 3%, which is in line with a long-term average with multifamily fundamentals remain steady. We expect revenue growth to lag market rent growth, which led to our 2018 guidance for same property revenue and NOI growth of 2.5% at the midpoint. Our forecast assumes lower revenue growth in the first half compared to the second half of the year as we rebuild more cities. There is one reporting change to highlight. Starting in 2018, we are moving property management expenses out of same property operating expenses to be consistent with the peer group reporting. Going forward, property management expense will be reported on a separate line item on our income statement. This change has no impact to FFO or same property expense growth as the prior period will be restated to conform to the new reporting method. Moving on to core FFO guidance. I’m pleased to report that we planned to continue on our long track record of driving operating results to the bottom line. We expect core FFO to grow a 4.5% at the midpoint, which is 200 basis points higher than our expected same property NOI growth. Other key assumptions supporting our 2018 guidance starts on page four of the press release. Turning to investment activity. In 2017, we last funded our external activities using a combination of this position proceed, joint venture capital and common equity accessing the most attractive capital force at the time. As for 2018, our only required funding needs are 200 million of debt maturities and 250 million of unfunded development commitment, which is only about 1% of our total market cap. So far this year, we have repurchased approximately $3.8 million of common stock under our $250 million stock buyback program. We continue to be mindful of current market conditions in order to thoughtfully approach capital allocation and we planned to continue manage funding our investment activities with most attractive cost of capital and on our leverage mutual basis. On to capital market and the balance sheet. Last month, we amended an increase our line of credit by $200 million to $1.2 billion, which is expendable to 2023. The upsize is primarily a function of the Company’s growth as it’s been over four years since we last increased the line. We have also improved our unsecured debt from 58% last year to 65% today. Our balance sheet remained strong to 26% leverage and 5.6 times debt EBITDA with the life debt maturities and horizon and ample liquidity. We are starting the new year in a solid financial position. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning. Mike, the midpoint of your same-store revenue guidance assumes a deceleration versus what you achieved in the fourth quarter and Angela mentioned that you expect revenue growth to be lower in the first half of the year, which would imply pretty significant deceleration I guess early in the year versus the fourth quarter figure. What is driving that sizable decel given the fact that you expect the market rent growth in 2018 will be similar to 2017?
Michael Schall: Yes, Austin. I will make a couple of comments and then may be John Burkart would want to follow-up. It goes back to what happened in Q3 of 2017, in that, we had a period of very weak job growth, which led to a low demand period significant supply coming in. We signed leases at little or no increase and we carried those leases obviously for typically about a year. And so we are going to carry those leases into the New Year and it’s going to compress our growth a little bit. And then that changes as we get into 2018, we expect a more normal peak leasing season in 2018. But again, jobs can change pretty abruptly anywhere in the United States, and therefore subject to how the demand curve looks versus how many units of supply come on throughout the year. John, do you have anything else to add?
John Burkart: Yes, I will just add that. Again, we feel good. We feel optimistic about this year going forward. But a part of it is a starting point issue as Mike said, and to put some numbers around that, in December 2016, our gain to lease was 50 basis points; in December 2017, our gain to lease was 200 basis points. So, we are in a sense, starting in a little bit more of a whole, but the outlook is very positive going forward.
Austin Wurschmidt: And so what does that assume in terms of What is earned then I guess going into 2018 from a revenue growth perspective?
John Burkart: Well the gain to lease means that our rents in place are 2% below the market – I’m sorry, it is 2% below, where our rents in place are. So it means we are upside down. But again, there is a seasonality to it, so I’m quoting you as a low demand point, but I’m just trying to give you compare of 2016 versus 2017. But in reality to answer to your question, yes, rents in place at December were lower. As you go forward into January, that 200 basis points gain to lease moves to 130 basis points gain to lease, so it improves and that’s what will happen, seasonally rents will move up. We expect them to peak in this summer and they have a solid year. But my point is that the reason why we can have stronger revenue growth overall expected for 2018 over 2017 when we are looking at this really related to our starting point. Does that make sense?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, I know, that’s helpful. I appreciate the commentary there. And then just secondly, as focused I guess specifically on Seattle, which was a market last year that surprised at the upside. It has the most or biggest magnitude of deceleration assumed in your 2018 guidance. And I guess I was just hoping you could provide some detail on the range of outcomes there and What is really driving the magnitude of that deceleration as well?
John Burkart: We’ve mentioned for some time that Seattle has in a certain sense, there is a highest risk associated to it related to the supply that’s out there and then job, and clearly jobs had slowed down some. What we saw at the end of last year was that in a low demand period. Seattle is the most seasonal market that we have. It can move up as much as 10 plus percent at the peak and then back down. So, Seattle at the low point moved down to a gain to lease situation, where was at 490 almost 5% and then we are pulling out of that. So Seattle market has slowed down in part because of the supply or the demand slowed down, but we are seeing a pickup in demand as we had mentioned and expect Seattle to have a strong year, but it doesn’t have the same tailwind that we’ve had in the past.
Austin Wurschmidt: All right. Thanks for the time.
John Burkart: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the regulatory overview. Just in terms of the referendum movement on Costa-Hawkins. What's the process you did in that on the ballet? And then theoretically if it does make the ballet and taxes, is Costa-Hawkins immediately repealed or are there additional specs up to that?
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s Mike here and John Eudy is also here and he is spending a fair amount of time on this issue for Essex. There is a qualification process, which includes signature gathering, which is currently occurring and we’ll go on for another month or two. And at that point in time, we will know whether it would be qualified or not. The industry is assuming that it will be qualified and so we have amounted pretty strong support opposing the effort, but I want to make sure everyone understands that the repeal of Costa-Hawkins does not immediately mean rent control, it is enacted that requires cities or local governments to pass different rent control ordinances. And I think on the last ballot some around half of them passed on and several passed out.
John Eudy: Less than a quarter.
Michael Schall: I know San Mateo, [indiscernible] were defeated and then one or two passed. So, there is a process here, this is not an immediate thing, but there is a process here and we feel pretty good about the effort to oppose the proposal.
Nick Joseph: But if it is on the ballot, State [indiscernible] the municipalities, if it does pass that, is it repealed from a state perspective or their additional steps at the legislature or anything outside tax that recurred before it actually is repealed?
Michael Schall: Yes. They would effectively repeal, it’s a referendum, so that would effectively repeal it. Keep in mind in my comments I talked about 1506, which was a legislative proposal to repeal of Costa-Hawkins, which did not get out of committee either in 2017 or 2018. And previously on the Q3 call, I talked about these 15 bills that were passed in California related to housing created more affordable housing developers, requiring developers to produce more affordable housing and process reforms involving cities and that type of things. So, none of those things involved Costa-Hawkins and except for 1506, which didn’t get out of committee in either year. So, I mean we feel pretty good with the legislators not fully behind this idea of repealing of Costa-Hawkins, because obviously, they would have taken actions if they did support it, but the value proposition is a completely different thing.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then what was the average price of the $4 million of share buybacks?
Angela Kleiman: Well, we bought some heading into the blackout, but the pricing has been in kind of low 220-ish range, I read and I gave out specific numbers, as you probably can understand why.
Nick Joseph: And then just if you were to continue to execute on a larger scale, how do you think about the timing of buybacks versus asset sales?
Angela Kleiman: I think ultimately, our plan is to have the buyback on a leverage neutral basis. And so it’s a little bit harder to exactly match the timing of the stock buyback and the asset sales, but we do have asset sales planned and so it’s going to be match fund as any of our other investment activities and I think you guys put in that piece about overtrading close to that 5% by cap rate, it makes the buyback very attractive that should be when we were selling assets at close to a low 4% cap rate.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Are you comfortable buying back shares before and taking on the execution risk of selling assets later or do you need to sell the assets before executing?
Angela Kleiman: No, no. We don’t need to sell the assets for executing. We are comfortable reaching it with our line. We have ample amount of capacity there.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: It sounds like you’re accounting for a lot of 2018 deliveries to be the late 2019, but can you provide some colors where you see 2019 supply versus 2018 in the market?
Michael Schall: Yes, John. It’s Mike and again, others made pitching here. I have to say the visibility about supply is problematic. So, we compare our information with Axio and some of the other sources. It would be pretty confusing. So we sympathize with all of you out there. As Angela noted on her comments, we go on drive the properties, we have a little bit different methodology than Axio. And so we make them to a little bit different conclusion, but the marks that we are most concerned about is downtown LA or LA let’s say. When we started 2017, we had around 10,700 units expected to be delivered in LA, it’s now by the end of 2017, it was 8700, so there is not 2000 units that were moved. I think Axio had a much larger number moved. I think they went from 18,000 units, 19,000 units in 2018, which is a huge number, but they moved a lot more units and this is pretty confusing, because trying to track what's moved and what's not moved and the different assumptions that we understand is very confusing to everyone. So having said all that, our view is that 2018 supply will ultimately be somewhere around 3% to 4% reduction from 17% and there are some variations by geography there, but a little bit left supply, the regional differences will be pretty significant. LA primarily because of the move to cut units from the 2,000 units from 2017 to 2018, we will have an increased supply will go from about 8700 units to about 11,000 units, and that’s the most significant increase I think across the portfolio. But again, we understand it’s a challenge to bigger front around these numbers.
John Kim: So, is 2018 to peak in Southern California?
Michael Schall: Well, and again I think what will happen it depends for example on how many units get move from 2018 into 2019 assuming these construction delays continue, because I don’t think Axio for example, certainly have not moved any of beginners from the end of 2018 into 2019 and so this is what is causing I think the confusion because these construction delays are more significant than anyone expected, and therefore it’s moving these numbers in significant amounts and it is obscuring the picture. I know in our case we think 2019 will be a little bit less than 2018 but not substantial. I think we’ve kind of hit the peak of - let’s say we are leveling out is in Northern California so it looks like the peak is in the path there, Southern California depends a little bit by market but and it appears that LA will continue to have significant supply going into 2019. And Seattle will slowdown over the next couple of years as well. But again I think there will be some challenges in Southern California but Northern California, Seattle probably get better over the next couple of years.
John Kim: And then as part of your guidance you are mentioning that you are not going to have any development starts this year. Why not deliver into 2020, 2021 year, is this related to Costa-Hawkins or?
Michael Schall: No it relates more to you having risk premium for development yield and it goes back to what is the multi-year effect of the things we’ve been talking about mainly that construction costs are going up somewhere around 10% and rents are not going up anywhere near that. So your cap rates are compressing and lot of cap rates out there that are in the 4.5 plus or minus range measured today and so you just don’t get there. I mean all things being equal we would rather acquire and not take the development risk unless there is a risk premium for development. So John Eudy is here, he underwrites a lot of development deals. What is interesting is, even deals that appear to have attractive land basis and have decent agreements with the city as to affordable units which we obviously lose money on every affordable unit and therefore increase of the cost relative to the recurrence of these assets. And as a result, we are just not seeing the yields that we need to make significant investment and development.
John Kim: Thanks for the color.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Mike you talked about cap rates not having moved higher yet, but interests up sharply. Do you think it’s reasonable cap rates increase this year? And I guess going back to the development question, is that also shaping your decision making and not starting more development projects this year?
Michael Schall: Not really, I mean interest rates are going up a little bit and I think as long as on the longer term obviously a lot of on the short end of the curve. But as long as there is positive leverage, I think it’s a good thing for real estate. And so we are still seeing five to seven year mortgage somewhere in the 4% range. So there is still a little bit of a positive leverage. And I remember back to periods of time when we had significant negative leverage and real estate did pretty well then as well. So I don’t think it’s necessarily interest rates it is causing the problem here. You want to follow up to that?
Nick Yulico: Yes, just one another question here. When you give on S-16 where you give the market forecast for economic rent growth. can you just remind me does that number that’s not just new lease growth like for example if you look at the recent actual data on Seattle its shown new lease growth for the whole market in 1% to 2% range and your number here is higher than that. So just trying to make sure I understand that. and then also if you could explain how you are thinking about new lease pricing in Seattle? Where is that right now? And whether it improves or gets worse as the year goes on?
Michael Schall: Yes, I will have john to handle the second part of that. the first part S-16 that is meant to be a broad measure of the marketplace really based on a scenario the scenario is how many jobs did we produce, how many units have supplied those for sale and rental, did we produce during that period of time and what does that mean for rents. So as you saw last year these numbers can be wrong they represent a scenario what we think is going to happen and then we midcourse correct throughout the year. So based on 201,000 jobs being produced 1.6% we cover the supply about three to one on jobs the long-term relationship is typically two to one. And as a result of that we feel pretty good about supply and demand, we feel good that California is going to continue to have a pretty significant housing shortage. And therefore we think the economic rent growth will improve in 2018. And that is what is reflected here. So it's not meant to be us, it’s meant to be the broad measure of the marketplace based on how we see supply and demand for the market. And what we do may vary a little by that but that goes back into the budget. And john do you want to kind of reconcile from the market forecast to what we budgeted.
John Eudy: Sure let me just step back for a second and the comment on the activity data that you are seeing. The information we see right now is relatively consistent, in Seattle our year-over-year I think it was probably close to 70 basis points year-over-year in December, but realize that that market is the most seasonal market. So as I said before, it will move up over 10% at the peak and then back down again. So we really are sampling it at the wrong time, because what happens with supply deliveries, property management operating companies tend to a pretty focused on the absorption amount the number of units they want and when you deliver units into the slow demand period you end up having to push pricing down. So that’s largely what is occurred there and our expectations are as we move through the season things we will improve pretty dramatically. But going on to what we see housing for Essex in Seattle going forward again we're starting in a whole as mentioned 4.9 or 490 basis points gained to lease right now. So even though we have an optimistic outlook our expectations are more in line well they are exactly in line with our guidance that we laid out for Seattle on revenue. So those won't be as strong as it has been in the past but still another good year.
Nick Yulico: So if I could just sum it up and it sounds like what you are saying is that overall you think Seattle is the market that’s going to put up little over 3% rent growth this year and don’t worry about the leasing numbers from January, December which are more seasonal that are showing new lease growth below that?
John Eudy: Absolutely, correct. If the demand fixed up you will see the rent starts to move pretty dramatically. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter was, the supply have an exceptional impact on pricing, but as demand picks, things will come closer to equilibrium and the rents will move pretty dramatically.
Angela Kleiman: Again, as they always do. I mean I think last year, we were up in Seattle from the beginning of the year about 12%.
Michael Schall: 12% in the peak and then same thing in 16.
Angela Kleiman: These numbers move significantly. And when we talk about seasonality, what we're really saying is, jobs are not irritable throughout the year. They are very seasonal. You get into the fourth quarter and the colder markets are -- Seattle worse for this reason, jobs put to a trickle, and if you end up with bunch of apartments delivering during that period, you have a period of zero demand delivering apartments. So you’re trying as a landlord to pull people out of the stabilized communities, which is where concessions pick up both on the lease ups and in the stabilized portfolio. So, this is the way that the rental markets work, and so pricing to move around pretty significantly, certainly more with as job got slows and amount of apartment deliveries increases. When those don’t connect timing wise, you end up pretty significant swings in rent as you would imagine, and then as soon as the apartment deliver or stabilize, the lease up to stabilize then you go back to a period of no concession. So this is what's driving this market, that was causing the volatility of pricing that’s what limits our visibility or anyone’s visibility in the marketplace, we don’t know exactly how many units are coming and exactly when they are coming. And so, there is a certain amount of just trying to understand market the best we can, and then reacting appropriately when things occur. So, this is a forecast, big picture forecast, and when you get into the market that will -- it will depend on exactly who is delivering and what type of concessions they are offering and how we react to that.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping you could talk to where you see the best potential usage of capital, including a buyback with all the different options you have preferred redevelopment et cetera, acquisitions, kind of highlighted the feelings on potential preferred investments kind of above where you are today. So hope you could kind of outline where you see the best opportunities?
Michael Schall: Hi Juan, it’s Mike. It’s a good question and the scenario has changed pretty rapidly over the last quarter in terms of stock price. So, obviously we -- as Angela said, we completed some stock buyback, so we've done that attractive relative to acquisitions that we’re seeing and we also liked the preferred equity program and that becomes how do you fund that, obviously issuing common stock at current prices doesn’t make sense to us and rather beyond the other side of that equation. And so, I think the disposition process is one that's kind of in full swing here, and I think that’s the way that yours going to play out. It’s interesting we had almost exact same comments about cap rates, interest rates a year ago. We had a plan that was much the same conference call that was much the same and it changed throughout the year because the stock recovered I think was started the year in somewhere around the 225 level and went back to 270. And so, these things are fluid discussions again reacting to changing conditions in a thoughtful way, and I think there’s a good chance that 2018 will be one of those years.
Juan Sanabria: And just on the preferred breaking out now two kind of separate buckets. What’s the strategy behind that? What drove that new line of thinking?
Michael Schall: Yes, the strategy is that you’re trying to really separate the preferred because there’s a different risk element with respect to an under construction project in, which you get a higher return for that. But we also think that let’s say that you are in the 8% to 9% range for a stabilized community. Yes, we think that that is an attractive programs and in fact we had at least one deal last year that converted from a under construction to a stabilized community at a lower preferred returns. We’ve had acknowledged that that’s an attractive business too, again relative to the opportunities that we are seeing on in the marketplace and we have wanted to create a bucket for the lower risk and a bit lower preferred return of properties that are in that area. We also depending upon what happens with rent growth, some of the refinances of the development deals may be a little bit short and that creates a bucket to continue to be involved in those transactions.
Juan Sanabria: And then you kind of talked about Seattle a bit in terms of your spot off the leased. Would you mind kind of hitting on the other two major markets?
John Burkart: Sure, this is John. In December '17, SoCal, we had a gain to lease of 90 basis points and that obviously improved in January, so now a 30 basis point. The NorCal, it was 190 basis points gain to lease and now it’s also improved to a 130 basis point. I mentioned Seattle which was 490 basis points in December and it’s improved to 420 now. So, overall the Company went from about 200 basis points gain to lease to a 130 basis points gain to lease in January. Again, right at signs, things are improving, the December numbers are the low point but things are going in the right direction as we’ve planned.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Just following up on a couple of comments that you made previously, I just want to make sure I understand. Why are seeing this construction blaze at this point? You mentioned rising construction costs, there’s also a lack of available skilled labor. Why are these projects getting pushed out at this point in time? Or the delivery shut site, sorry about that.
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. You hit it on the head. Lack of skilled labor is the main reason and short of that in order to answer.
Rich Hill: Okay, great. It would enough answer then. And then just another follow-up question, you guys seemed to have a really good handle on job growth, so two parts here. Remind us about what happened in 2016, when job growth may be slowed more than what the market was expecting? What gives you confidence that that’s not going to happen this time? And then secondly, I've heard a lot of discussions about job growth, but not a lot of discussions about income growth. And I am wondering as income growth starts to pick up. Is that more of a tailwind than it’s been previously the rent inflation particularly, if household formations start to increase as people don’t double up any more, people move out of the parents houses. How are you thinking about income growth going forward? And is it more or less important than it's been in the past?
Michael Schall: Great questions. So having a good handle on job growth, I don't think anyone in the room processes to have a good handle on job out here. It bounces around like crazy. We attached schedule 16.1 to demonstrate the volatility of job growth. And the problem that we talked about on last quarter call, which I think surprised everyone. But jobs are going to do what they are going to do, we don't have any particular insight into the jobs are going to whether going to go up or down. And so, I'll have to distance myself from that one. We are just going to be a cog in the wheel. We do look at some of the broader indicators. I mentioned for example having 5% to 6% office construction or 5% to 6% of the office stock under construction for delivery in the future I mean presumably those landlords are not building the buildings and much are going to be occupied by workers that therefore we think that that's an interesting forward indicator. And it's interesting to look at 5% to 6% of the office buildings under construction versus the 1.4% growth job growth and 0.8% overall supply growth. So again we try to determine whether we have a supply or demand in balance which we think is in favor of California ultimately however it can be messy in terms of how all that plays out. So that’s kind of a job growth picture. We are going to have to wait and see what -- again F-16 is our planning mechanism. So, we are trying to understand the world in which we live and because some of these decisions that we have to make about asset sales which markets to select et cetera they require some template of what you think is going to happen. So that’s what F-16 really is useful for us to. It will change and we expect it to change but again for -- to have a good planning process you need to have a pretty good starting point. And as to the second point income growth, we totally grew with it. We think that is the key metric. And in my comments I mentioned that wage inflation is ultimately a very good thing for apartments. And we think that is a pretty significant potential tailwind for us again subject to supply and demand. And these personal income numbers and the slow amending of the rent to income ratios are positive signs for us and those are really the things that we are planning to give us confidence that we are going to hit these economic rent growth numbers in 2018.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Mike, just a quick question on the peak leasing season. Last year, you guys mentioned that it peaked earlier because of supply and jobs. What are some other things that you would look for this year? It sounds like you think this year should be more of normal one, but what would give you pause that this year could end up being similar to last especially, if supply is being pushed into this year, and so far employers are having a tough time finding people to fill the spots?
Michael Schall: Alex, welcome to the call. It’s a good question. Again, I think it’s all about jobs and we have pretty good idea what's happening on the supply front. We send our people out to walk the buildings and try to understand as well as anyone what's happening. We keep track of each year’s production of housing how many units that delivered in each year. And so, the good thing is, we don't have any confusion about what is going on the supply side. Here you know again, we look at where we started last year where we ended and that type of things. The real issue comes back to jobs and as we said on last quarter’s call which affecting the shape of the curve this year and how our rents grow and why we will decelerate into Q2 and then turn the corner this year, I mean all that is related to what happened last year in the third quarter which to remind everyone it was basically a job drive. We ended up with fewer non firm jobs at the end of the third quarter than we had at the end of the second quarter. I think it was incredibly unusual and not something that we could anticipate, there was nothing in the numbers. If you look at open provision that various tech companies had or whatever data that we might have there was nothing that really indicated that that was going to happen. And so again we don’t have any great inside into the jobs during the quarter and so like everyone else waiting for those specifics. So I can’t help you more than that how lot our process what is mean to us and again we’ll adjust to the world that we experience it.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, on the rent control just a few things here; one, it almost sounds like the governor or whoever the governor end up being next election could almost [indiscernible] invoke sort of a rent control by capping price increase. But if they do repeal Costa-Hawkins, is there any sense that they would impose income limits on who can have rent control? And would they could see decontrol be eliminated as well, so you’d be sort of locked in, you couldn’t bring that unit to market, you’d be capped and how much you did increase the price of a vacant unit?
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex, I mean you are way down the road ahead us on that. I mean I think that we are following up with respect to what's happening now. John, do you have something?
John Burkart: Just one follow-on, Alex. If the Costa-Hawkins did get repeal it just enables local peer rent control. And yes, it would not protect, if you will the vacancy control issue. But one important aspect in rent control orders that are in place, it does have a provision that requires a fair return to the owner, which basically if you took away they can see decontrol you just took their rate return away. So, even if individual city decided to an act that control there would be other measures we could look to keep vacancy decontrol that’s speculative in the future right now. We think we have a good choppy industry is organized at foot pushing back assuming that development does go forward in November. So we’ll monitor closely and we’ll report while a better update for you.
Operator: Our next question is from Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Two questions on east day, which we haven’t talked about a whole lot. Looking there was a big sequential kind of pick up both Alameda and Contra Costa counties. In the fourth quarter, I was curious what specifically is happening there, if anything in those markets?
Michael Schall: That’s a combination of a few things. As I mentioned in the comments on the call, there is clearly a pick up as it related to jobs, we noted Facebook and Tesla and others that are out there which is clearly a positive thing for that portfolio. There’s also a year-over-year benefit in the sense that -- which makes the comp easier in the Alameda area due to last year’s movement in pricing, we ended up with more vacancy a year ago. So we had a benefit from a year-over-year, but it’s really both of those combined, the positive jobs that we’re seeing out there, high gain jobs out there as well as the benefit from the easier comp.
Drew Babin: Okay. And then on the -- I guess taking the other end of the wage growth equation, as it pertains to end portfolio. I guess what’s in there because it seems to extend the guidance for '18 in terms of payroll at the property level and it’s becoming harder and harder to retain quality, recent pushing on this environment?
Michael Schall: Yes, it is overall. We struggle and we are working hard to pay all of our team fairly and we had increased wages, the wage rate goes up somewhat significantly. But we have been able to find offsets in other areas by operating more efficient way. One of the areas we mentioned previously was our asset collections. And so we’ve found opportunities to reduce labor and vendor cost by bidding out the collected assets as groups and what not. And so that’s enabled us to keep the expenses under control while we continue to push our wages and meet the market there. I think last year our wages were probably up 5% for our staff on the sites. But again it is a struggle, not doubt.
Drew Babin: That’s helpful. And one last one just on kind of bread and butter acquisition whether they're current JVs or wholly owned. It seems from some of the commentary that I guess with potential. Acquisition cap rates could potentially exceed kind of the average disposition cap rate. Should they be in the low 4s kind of in some of the recent transactions have illustrated? I guess, can you talk about what’s being assumed in guidance as far as acquisition and disposition cap rates more specifically?
Michael Schall: We are assuming that we will be in the 4% to 4.5% range on acquisitions. Dispositions, it depends on how we execute dispositions. You may recall a year ago that we did a -- we took several assets and contributed them into a joint venture entity and put some loans on it and took some capital out that way. That would be one of the things we’re thinking about. But we are working on it and I don’t want to give any more specific guidance because we have a variety of strategies that we’ll work on and pick the best one. And we just don’t have -- we are not at the level -- we are not ready to give that type of guidance and that level of detail.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: First question, just Mike your tone I would say sounds much more positive today than it did three months ago and you walks through kind of job, shift and the uptick in the government data there. But then, you also acknowledged that data can bounce around and at time it can be pretty volatile and sometimes follow over the things of the market though. So, is it fair to call you more optimistic today, and if so, is there anything else you would point to besides the job data that leaves you there?
Michael Schall: Dennis, that’s good question. Today, 16.1 of supplement really outlines why we are so much more optimistic and it really is all about jobs. So, we feel like we have a good handle on supply. And we have a good handle on affordability. And we need these jobs I mean that really comes down to that. When we saw Q3 essentially not produce any job which is very unusual, and started thinking about well is this a trend or is this a data point? That was a distressing discussion, and obviously we didn’t know. And so when Q4 came back and came back pretty darn strong when you look at the December over December numbers it gives us a lot of confidence.
Dennis McGill: And then, earlier timing as well about the shift in or the difference in first half versus second half for rent growth, how much variation is there around that 2.5% midpoint?
Angela Kleiman: Not a whole lot, I mean we are talking about somewhere in the low twos in the first half versus similar to higher high twos in the second half, so between say 25 to 50 basis points for the range.
Dennis McGill: And then just one last technical question. When you guys do your supply work on year end, do you draw a line as far as how big development needs to be before you considered it to be competitive?
Michael Schall: 50 units, is our -- yes that was the -- we tried to conform because there were so many different assumptions out there that we are trying to simplify the data, and we are trying to conform to action. We have that comment on a conference call in the past year at some point and time. So again, we tried to take out senior student et cetera and then focused on 50 and above. And I think that the other difference that different people have is the denominator. We are using I think everything I think it’s a entire stock especially California has so must older housing that if you eliminate the smaller units out of the denominator in this calculation, you get some pretty whacko. So, anyway that’s how we do it and that was conforming to active. And again, the acting numbers have moved so substantially that we are still trying to reconcile what Angela said, our number to their numbers.
Operator: Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: I just wanted to go back to the question on same-store OpEx and again with everyone really talking about big increases in payroll and taxes. Trying to understand what assumptions you are making about other payroll expenses just to kind of get to this 2% to 3% same store OpEx for '18?
Michael Schall: We do expect our payroll for a site level people to continue to move and I don’t have that -- I'm not going to give up the details with the numbers, but it will move. It's an aggressive area. We are meeting the market as it relates the compensation there, but what we are finding again is offset and opportunities. So our controllable expenses we expect next year to also be down. We did a very good job this year. The team did an outstanding job as a matter of fact along the lines of controllable. And we expect that same thing to happen in the next year. So at the end of the day even though we're increasing our competition for the site level people at market and market is moving rather aggressively, we are finding opportunities, we have done various things from restructure our call center to making adjustments in market even and elsewhere to offset cost. So, we expect control that the areas that cost are moving more that harder to control relate to utilities. There is a lot of work that’s being done in California certainly on utilities that relates to infrastructure it relates to accomplishing the objectives for the green requirement which require the utilities to buy certain amounts of energy from solar and other renewable sources which is increasing cost and we’ve also done work there in the sense of installing TV panels and other things, but that utilities as a higher growth area on expenses.
Omotayo Okusanya: So what are the things that can come down? Is it like more of the office expenses, advertising? I’m just kind of curious like what those offsets can be after as to look how much kind of control that last year?
Michael Schall: Well, I don’t want to net to give away all of our playbook to our peer. But again, we are doing what we can to leverage technology. I've mentioned the call center, we recent restructures there in the last five, six months. And we continue to find opportunities to make win-win environment. I mean interestingly on the asset collections, it was really a win-win. It's not a grinding down vendors, it’s a matter of us providing a package that reduces their communities from asset to asset and ultimately saves their labor costs and then that was driven through that came back to us. So, again, I don’t want to go into extreme amounts of details, but we do expect to maintain a strong hold of controllable and keeping down to about 1% year-over-year.
Omotayo Okusanya: And then, I don’t know if you answered this before and I may have missed it, but the big increase in things of OpEx for I think was Seattle for the quarter and then the big decline in Northern California. We do kind of talk a little bit about what kind of happened in the quarter?
Michael Schall: Well, actually, I allow Angela to go ahead with that.
Angela Kleiman: Yes, in Seattle, it’s really property tax driven, no surprise there. And it’s consistent with what we had expected and budgeted. So we ended up coming in, the year coming in line with that 2.7 as planned.
Omotayo Okusanya: And then Northern California to decrease?
Michael Schall: Just timing issues, I mean with expenses, they don’t follow rents. We look at them closely of course monthly daily. Expenses are better looked that over the course of the year their ends up being timing issues there. So, the numbers move around a little bit, but nothing that indicates the change in the future.
Angela Kleiman: Yes and keep in mind there, something like repairs and maintenance, we have controlled as far as when those get implemented. But we don’t specifically say, they are going to be done in second quarter or third quarter, we planned that we’re going to do it over the year and it’s really depend on what the focus for the operation team is at the time. And so when we focus under leasing that these were not going to distract by saying driven also have to get the repair and maintenance done.
Operator: Our next question is from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Great. John Guinee here. I guess Mike or maybe John, your Station Park Green, Phase III and then Hollywood looks like your 721,000 units and 500,000 units. Can you talk about I guess three things. One is what exactly you’re building for 721 and 500,000 unit what kind of property type? Two, what that cost would be, if it was fair market land? And then three, what sort of yield are you expecting on these developments as your basis and then also at a fair market land basis?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy, I will try to answer all those questions. But just to start off with Station Park Green is core peninsula top of San Francisco and the building type, it’s a tight high density type 3, if that means anything to you meaning expensive to build. Our land basis is just over 100 a door. It has a 10% affordable requirement. We just opened up our leasing ops about 10 days ago. And I can tell you we’re having a very good reaction and there’s a lot of construction around it obviously days two and three right next door. The difference between that 720,000 versus Hollywood is rent driven. Rents in Northern California are in the high $3 square foot and Southern California, it’s obviously less and in Southern California we have a much lower land basis as Mike mentioned. The legacy land basis of Hollywood is about 68,000 a door versus over a 100,000 in Northern California, and much higher up here as well. If we mark them to market on what the land would get sold for, in both cases it would be about 50,000 to 70,000 a door more in both San Mateo and Hollywood. Cap rates, we expect both to be right at about 5% and if we mark it to market that would under 4.5%. Those are the round numbers for it.
John Guinee: Okay, perfect. So what you are saying Mike is that the reason you are not developing is that has market rate land, the yield of development is 4.5%?
John Eudy: Okay. You asked a question on -- this is John Eudy again, on parking or land market, what’s happened on both cases is the cost of production has gone up. So there’s another quarter or two half way if we rebuilt those with the mark to market on the land and today’s construction costs.
Operator: The next question is from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Conor Wagner: May be Angela or John, could you give us some insight on the other income in the fourth quarter? It seem like it grew around 6% versus 2% and 2.8% for the rental revenue?
Angela Kleiman: It’s a combination of once performing better than expected, we had anticipated kind of in that high twos range and it came in the threes and on the right on the scheduled rent piece of it. And other income also performed better than expected. So, it would be…
Conor Wagner: What was the other income though? Is there anything -- so is any one-items there and may be as you segway and so what your expectation for other income is in the ‘18 guidance?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, it is mostly driven by rev and as you can see our utility costs have gone up so correspondingly the revs income has also increased. And so, we expect similar relationship in 2018.
Conor Wagner: Okay. And then you had I think bad debt payback in 1Q ‘17, is there anything like that in terms of the headwinds on the other income side? Or just again anything we should, that we done necessarily have visibility on outside of just the organic demand?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, to your point that was a one-time item and we don’t see that recurring in 2018.
Conor Wagner: And then Mike on the regulatory front, it seems like things are moving more and more towards greater housing production or some sort of reaction to the chronic housing started what you spoke about the call. Could you give us some comments on first John maybe the impact of SP35, I think they released that. Most cities in California can now be subject to a streamline process on any development that has 10% affordable? And then if you could give us your thoughts on SPA27 the one that would allow reduce cities ability to enact zoning ordinances around mass transit development?
Michael Schall: It's Mike, Connor. Our experience and over many years and the recent activity and you may want to add Vision [indiscernible] County through that. All of these things that require prevailing wage or affordable unit mandates or density bonuses in San Francisco has once density bonus for more 30% affordable units. All these things have the affect generally of increasing cost, and when you increase cost, again you know what's happening with rents. When you're increasing cost to a greater extent, it just puts more pressure on the cap rate. And the number of deals that penciled are fewer, which is I think part of these measures had been -- had the effect of actually having less housing being produced, which is why we are confident that when you look at starts that they are trending down, not that they are going to zero, we are not saying that. And as you look at northern California which has gone from somewhere around 10,500 units in '17 and it will be probably 7,500 in '18 and about the same in '19. That’s a pace that I think probably level off that lets say. And one of the factors here, again the construction cost increases these additional mandates from the cities to produce more housing, some of which as you point out come back to the developer, and what that means for the overall economics of the deal. I think it just continues to pressure the deals. Again, we all know there is a housing shortage here and California was first and we want there to be affordable housing. Unfortunately, most of these laws and rules and proposition have an unintended consequence of driving cost up and reducing our deals, which makes development difficult to pencil, hence my comments.
Conor Wagner: And do you see A27 is likely to get to the assembly?
Michael Schall: I think it will, but it doesn’t really -- it does, you are talking about TOD high density residential state control.
Conor Wagner: Yes.
Michael Schall: Yes, it clearly I think it will. That doesn’t change the economics again getting to Mikes comment on and I don't believe that there are that many barriers to those transactions going residential to be honest with you at a practical level when you get to TOD station to TOD station. There has been encouragement to develop residential. So, that’s one more step to help make it easier, but it doesn't make it happen.
John Burkart: Yes, I mean they all do the same thing ultimately. And again, so I don’t think you should focus on any one per se because truly the collection of all of them and that’s what given us part of our confidence with respect to supply not going crazy in California. The one can bury that we have the most concern is really L.A. and really downtown L.A., which we also think is probably the long-term beneficiary of it as well because that basically transforms the downtown into it more and more of the 24 hour city. And right now, I recently took my wife down there for a romantic evening of visiting Essex Apartment communities at night and it’s amazing, the amount of construction and just general activity there basically the downtown is not really arrived yet, but it’s going to be I think a pretty special place setting down the years from now.
Conor Wagner: I hope you think you have better plans for next Wednesday?
Michael Schall: Yes.
Conor Wagner: Just again property that maybe just kind of follow up again knowing that this builds specifically aren't going to do much, but it seems like the overall direction in California is towards try to address this housing crisis and it seems to have major gap right now is the funding. What is your concern about the state enacting some changes to get the funding either through increased tax on landlords or again there is a proposal for the ballot to repeal Prop 13 on non-residential commercial building. What you guys are concerned maybe over multiyear period that the state is going to come after you in some way for more money?
Michael Schall: Yes, that's a good question and yes, as you point out is. There is a ballot proposition underway to create a split role. And but fortunately, it’s clear in that case that multifamily is on the side of residential therefore we'd maintain the same rules. And in that deal, it was pretty filed pretty late in terms of the process. And so, we’re not sure exactly where it’s going to go, but we’re keeping an eye on it and we’ll continue to watch it as time goes on. You do have, on this development side, you do have other things that come into play John mentioned whatever earlier which is we have the right to a fair return on our property and so there is a limitation, and there are also core cases that restrict cities ability to change the rules and require densely and let they give something. So in other words if you require a zoning change or more density or any number of things from the city that triggers a variety of requirements, which could include prevailing wage, could include other items that will affect your cost. So, it probably is simple as the governments can and act whatever they want and we’re just going to have to live with it. There are some boundaries out there that I think are important here and we’ll prevent it from getting completely out of whack. And I guess it maybe the final comment I’ve made which I commented on earlier is, the 15 bills were passed in California in September that I commented on the Q3 call. Again, they were trying to come up with process reforms panelizing cities that didn’t produce housing, four cities to produce more housing and funding more affordable housing programs with the bond issue and other. So that, those were pretty constructive from our perspective and we think those were the right direction with respect to trying to address the affordable housing issue and the chronic shortage we have here in California as to affordable housing. So, I think that good progress has been made and we just hope for kind of more of the same thing.
Conor Wagner: Yes, but those bills you know that the funding isn't there to do it and the bond issue into the -- a drop in the bucket compared to what's needed right, I mean that issues in last state forest land to re-price, most of the things don't cancel due to the affordability requirements or union wages. So it seems like the first step is getting these cities to rezone, to you know streamline projects, but the economics still aren't there. And so I guess my concern would just be, when the state takes the next step to tackle the economics, they're either going to have can they mandate land prices or they're going to try and find the funding to build the house, this housing through some other means.
Michael Schall: You know, Conor we're spending our effort on what is right in front of us. So we have -- the repeal of Costa- Hawkins, we have a number of issues that are here or we're pretty focused on, remaining targeting our efforts towards opposing those proposals. And we'll see what happens down the road. Again almost all of these things have unintended consequences which are put the burden back on the developer, which is going to compress their yield and actually are going to make the problem worse. So I don't know what's going to happen, I've seen a lot of proposals come and go and you know at the end of the day you have to believe that there will be reason and/or something will get passed and then they will realize -- they will realize the unintended consequence and then they will have to change it. So we have to assume that reason will prevail end of the day.
Operator: My next question is from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: Hi, sorry to drag this out. Just a couple of quick questions. First, on your 2018 disposition plans to, do you expect to sell any properties to condo convertors this year?
Michael Schall: Hi, Karin, it's Mike. I don’t know, I mean that is out there is part of you know the opportunities that I've commented on this before that we're -- we've looked at several properties. And when you look at the for sale price activity in California there were some very large numbers there. California in total was up 9.5% and there were some Bay Area cities or areas that were up in the 15 to 20% median price home increased year-over-year. And that would be positive for the spread between condo values and apartment values. However, as I mentioned on the call, we also have the new tax law which is probably part of the reason for pushing up prices in the fourth quarter, as people were trying to lock in the deductibility of their mortgage. So we may see that turnaround because actually we think that it'll be a headwind to home ownership going into 2018 given the new tax law.
Karin Ford: Great, thanks. And my second question is just on the preferred equity program. If memory serves, I think you talked on the last call that you might want to reduce the programs that was hitting sort of $400 million level. And now it appears you're pushing your cap up to that 900 million. Can you just talk about your decision to give on? Is it just because you are taking the risk level down on the program a little bit?
Michael Schall: We took further program and looked at it and we realized it really does have two very different components. And so, we would like to return on it. The question is what is the risk relative to that return and how does that compared to the other options that we have to invest money. And we decided in the current environment that both pieces of that business are important and attractive to us. Both the under construction piece, but then we should be separating is really separate piece be the financing on apartment buildings that are completed where essentially the risk is mostly out of the equation. So, we found them both attractive and we wanted to have that ability, and so we went to the board, and they improved the program as submitted. In terms of can we get to the 500 million on the completed apartments, I'm not sure we are able to get there, certainly not going to get there any time soon. So I think practically speaking, we are going to -- the program will be probably in the 500 million plus or minus range, although we will see what happens because we wanted to have the ability to increase it from there if we saw the opportunity.
Operator: And we will take our last question from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America Merrill. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Sorry just a quick modeling question. Can you guys give us a sense of the new and renewal spreads you guys got in the fourth quarter in January as well as what's embedded in guidance?
Michael Schall: Let me give you this kind of summary here. So in the going forward Q3, I'm sorry, Q1 we are setting our renewals at about 3.3. If we go back to Q4, our renewals were at about 3.4. So they are down a little bit, our new leases in Q4 average at about 1.4%, so below the renewal.
Juan Sanabria: And do you guys expect any occupancy gains or declines or steady in '18 as part of guidance?
Michael Schall: Steady in '18 as part of guidance and you know we are major focused on how we can optimize revenue. So, the plan is steady and our occupancy is relatively high for the market, but as we see opportunities we will make adjustments, strategic adjustments to optimize the returns on the market by market basis.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Schall for any closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone, really appreciate your participation on the call. Sorry for its length. And we look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi Conference in March. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will discuss three topics: our third quarter results and preliminary thoughts about 2018, recent regulatory activities and an update on investment markets. We are pleased with the Company's performance during the third quarter, carrying forward the momentum from the solid first half of 2017. Occupancy gains, other income growth and non-same-store properties contributed to the core FFO beat versus guidance. As noted last quarter, market rents peaked in June, two months early compared to normal seasonal patterns, and then declined throughout the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, same property market rents were up 3.5% from January through September, significantly lower as compared to the 6.3% market rent growth from January to June. The decline in year-to-date market rents during the quarter significantly reduced loss to lease, which was less than 1% at September 30 compared to 3.4% at June 30, 2017. Two primary factors contributed to these market rent reductions. First, new apartment deliveries with substantial moving concessions continued at a robust pace during the quarter. Second, unadjusted total non-farm employment declined across most of our markets in Q3, reducing demand and mirroring the broader U.S. after outpacing the country for over five straight years. As a result, given an ongoing apartment supply deliveries and lagging job growth, concession levels remained high and leasing incentives increased during the quarter, both undermining pricing power. Essex remains focused on understanding supply and demand dynamics across each of our West Coast markets, with demand driven principally by job growth. We now forecast 2017 job growth to be about 1.4%, about equal to the United States but materially less than the 2.2% growth expected at the beginning of the year. Thus, job growth remains our primary concern as we head into 2018. Fortunately, the economy, tech earnings growth and absence of significant layoffs suggest the slowdown in jobs is mostly related to a shortage of qualified workers, as tech firms continue to have large numbers of unfilled positions. We are also seeing significant infrastructure and new office construction across our footprint, with close to 11 million square feet or about 7% of existing stock under construction or renovation in San Francisco and San Jose and another 6 million square feet or 6% of existing stock in Seattle, both with substantial progress on pre-leasing. When considering that the metros representing the Essex portfolio struggle to increase total housing stock by 1% per year, the employment growth to fill the new office buildings indicates that housing will remain in short supply. Additionally, since the end of the Great Recession, we have added nearly 2.1 million jobs across our footprint while adding only 451,000 new housing units. Accordingly, should job growth not reaccelerate, we believe that there is significant pent-up demand to support rent growth. Switching to supply. We've had our research team recently drive all the major development sites in each market. We continue to face headwinds in certain submarkets, most notably downtown and West L.A., Sunnyvale and downtown Bellevue. We expect deliveries to peak in our markets over the next several months, with overall moderation of 5% to 10% in 2018. The geographic mix of apartment supply will also change with deliveries in Northern California expected to decline over 25% and Seattle down about 5%. Finally, deliveries in Southern California should increase around 5% in 2018, with deliveries concentrated in downtown and West L.A. and downtown San Diego. However, we expect a 30% decline in supply in Orange County, which leads us to our initial thoughts about rent growth in 2018. With the deceleration in job growth and choppiness of deliveries, concession visibility is more limited than at any point during the current cycle. Thus, we will continue to evaluate market conditions, especially job growth expectations, for the remainder of 2017 before providing guidance in early 2018. At this point, we expect market rent growth to be mostly in line with long-term averages of around 3% for the Essex markets. In addition, market rent growth becomes revenue only when a lease is turned, and therefore, it will initially rebuild loss to lease, resulting in reported revenue for 2018 likely lagging market rent growth. On to the second topic concerning new housing regulations in California. A package of 15 housing-related bills were passed at the end of September. These bills fall into several general categories, including: number two, more money for housing, which consists of a proposed $4 billion bond issuance and a real estate transaction fee; number two, building permit processing reforms to reduce time; number three, requiring developers to build more affordable housing; number four, forcing cities to plan for more housing; and number five, penalizing cities that do not provide enough housing. These bills are summarized in a recent L.A. Times article published on September 29. Notably, none of these bills affect existing laws dealing with rent control, focusing instead on housing supply, process improvements and financing. Collectively, these measures represent a start of a process to address the severe housing shortage in California, although they are unlikely to make a meaningful change in housing supply in the next several years. In addition, last week, a group containing labor unions and tenant rights groups filed a proposed 2018 ballot proposition that would repeal the California law referred to as Costa-Hawkins, which limits the types of rent control that can be enacted by local governments. While this could pave the way for more restrictive rent control laws, the Costa-Hawkins repeal movement is still a long ways away. Thus, we will continue to monitor the proposal and provide updates on future calls. It is important to note that California's housing shortage and related issues of affordability and gridlock emanate from a variety of older laws which complicate any proposed solution. For example, the objective of California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 is to refocus housing construction on high density projects in urban areas and primary transit nodes, causing housing supply to be more concentrated and costly. The point is that solutions to the housing shortage will take time and significant investment to overcome at a level well beyond the scope of the regulations being discussed. Finally, on to the topic of investment. We recently outlined transactions in the press release, and Angela will describe activity related to our co-investment program in a moment. Overall, we expect to be toward the high end of our $400 million to $600 million guidance range with respect to acquisitions. With regard to property dispositions, we should be close to our revised target of $300 million to $350 million, with $216 million closed year-to-date and two properties in contract that could close by year-end. Regarding asset values overall, cap rates remain stable, A-quality property and locations continue to transact around a 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, while we continue to see more aggressive buyers willing to pay sub-4% cap rates for select assets. B-quality assets and locations are generally 25 to 50 basis points higher, though often contemplate upside for redevelopment and/or value-add activities. Looking forward, we don't see cap rates changing materially, given positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and seven-year, fixed-rate debt is approximately 3.6%. On the development front, we commenced the third phase of Station Park Green during the third quarter. We also entered into a joint venture to develop a 269-unit apartment community located near Downtown San Jose, as outlined in the press release. In the fourth quarter, we expect to commence construction on a third project, which will meet our target for 2017. Even with these starts, our unfunded development commitment remains well under 5% of enterprise value, with minimal predevelopment exposure. Finally, we remained active in originating preferred equity investments during and after the quarter, as outlined in the press release. As we approach $400 million in outstanding commitments, we will reevaluate the further expansion of the program, as well as possibly diversifying our funding sources. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Essex had a solid third quarter year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 3.1%. Our quarterly year-over-year revenue growth rate continues to decline as expected, due to both market conditions as well as difficult comps from last year when we adjusted our strategy to emphasize higher occupancy. While Mike outlined year-to-date changes in market rent growth, I'm going to talk about year-over-year market rent growth rates. As we mentioned in the second quarter conference call, the seasonal peak in market rents was one to two months early. The result, of course, was that the year-over-year market rent growth deteriorated from about 3.5% in May for the portfolio overall down to below 1% in July 2017 compared to the prior year's period. Since the low in July, market rents for the portfolio have steadily increased to about 1.5% in September compared to the prior year's period. The negative impact of the early market peak will continue as a headwind for revenue growth into 2018, due to the volume of leases that we signed during the peak leasing months with little to no increase over the expiring leases. Additionally, our loss to lease for our portfolio has declined from 1.9% in September 2016, down to 0.2% in September of 2017, with several markets having a gain to lease, such as San Diego, San Jose and Seattle. Our operations team worked to increase occupancy by 30 basis points in the quarter to position our portfolio for the fourth quarter of this year. We increased the use of our concessions in the third quarter by about $725,000 over the second quarter of 2017. Our portfolio is now positioned well for the fourth quarter and our use of concessions will be reduced. Finally, as a result of the devastating California wildfires, Governor Brown has signed an executive order which instituted emergency price controls for rental housing, amongst other things, throughout the state of California through April 2018. Although we are currently working through the details, at this point, we do not expect the executive order to materially impact our earnings. Moving on to an update of our markets. In Seattle, job growth continues to slow relative to prior quarters but remains one of the strongest job markets within the Essex portfolio, generating year-over-year growth of 2.4% for the third quarter of 2017. While Amazon searches for a potential location for the second headquarters, the company continues to expand in Seattle in the third quarter, moving forward with construction on a fourth tower at the company's new South Lake Union campus and leasing an additional 1.3 million square feet of office space in Downtown Seattle. In addition to Amazon, other tech companies such as Oracle, WeWork and Indeed expanded their combined office footprint by almost 500,000 square feet in Seattle CBD. In total, the Seattle MD has roughly 6 million square feet of office space that is currently under construction, of which 55% is pre-leased. Median home prices continue to rise in the Seattle MD, with 14.1% year-over-year growth in the month of September over the prior year. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the third quarter of 2017 was 5.7% for the CBD, 4.4% for the Eastside and 6.1% and 5.9%, respectively, for the North and South submarkets. In Northern California, job growth for the Bay Area for the third quarter of 2017 averaged 1.4% year-over-year. San Francisco continues to be the Bay Area jobs leader, posting a year-over-year job growth of 1.8%, while Oakland and San Jose were up 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. In San Francisco, Dropbox, Facebook, Airbnb and WeWork added over 1.5 million square feet of office space to their footprint, while in Silicon Valley, Google continued to expand, completing a multi-year 52-property acquisition in Sunnyvale; Lyft announced a new office lease in Palo Alto; Microsoft announced plans to develop a light industrial center in North San Jose; and Future Mobility, an electric car company, leased R&D space in Santa Clara. During the quarter, we completed our lease-up of Galloway in Pleasanton. And in October, we completed our lease-up of Century Towers in San Jose as well. Moving down to Southern California. In Los Angeles, job growth in the county averaged 1.1% year-over-year for the third quarter of 2017, which is below the U.S. at 1.4%. The entertainment industry continues to invest in the West L.A. submarket, as movie network Starz leased 60,000 square feet of creative office space in Santa Monica and tech startup Snap partnered with NBCUniversal to create a new digital content studio based in Santa Monica to produce original programming, primarily for Snapchat. Essex continues to perform well in this market, led by Woodland Hills at 4%, Tri-City in the CBD at 3.2%, Long Beach at 3.1% and West L.A. at 2.4% year-over-year growth for the third quarter of 2017. Orange County job growth continues to slow down, with 0.2% year-over-year job growth in the third quarter of 2017. Office leasing activity, however, remained solid in Orange County, as year-to-date net absorption totaled 300,000 square feet, up 100,000 square feet from the prior quarter. We continue to achieve solid rental results in Orange County market despite weak job growth and elevated supply, which we are still closely monitoring. Our South Orange and North Orange submarkets grew at 4.3% and 4.1% year-over-year, respectively, in the third quarter of 2017. Finally, in San Diego, job growth in the third quarter of 2017 averaged 1.3% year-over-year and it continues to outpace both L.A. and Orange County. In the military pipeline, which may impact the large military sector in San Diego, HR 2810 was passed in both the House and Senate. This bill, which calls for more ships, aircraft and soldiers, authorizes an additional $696 billion in defense spending for 2018. Office activity picked up, with Amazon leasing just over 100,000 square feet of office space in Universal City, with local job openings for game development, software engineering and data science. Our Oceanside submarket achieved 4.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter, while both North City and Chula Vista submarkets achieved 3.3% for the same period. In closing, we are sending out renewals for the fourth quarter at an average of 3.4% for the portfolio. However, the renewal rates may be negotiated down as rents have peaked for the portfolio and our loss to lease is 0.2%. Currently, our portfolio is 96.8% occupied and our availability 30 days out is 4.6%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll briefly review the full year outlook, then provide an update on our co-investment activities and conclude with comments on the balance sheet. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our same-property guidance of 3.6% revenue growth and 4% NOI growth at the midpoint. We are increasing core FFO by $0.06 per share to $11.89 at the midpoint. We are now projecting a 7.7% year-over-year growth in core FFO per share, which is now expected to be 370 basis points above the same-property NOI growth rate, as we continue to drive operating results to the bottom line. Moving on to our co-investment activity. We formed a new venture, which acquired 8th & Republican in Seattle and 360 Residences in San Jose. We sold Madrid, a joint venture asset located in a non-core submarkets, at a low 4% cap rate, achieving a 12.3% IRR on an asset that is 35% leveraged. We have previously discussed our plan to monetize the embedded promote within our private equity platform, and we have begun to do so subsequent to the quarter. We amended the Wesco I joint venture, where we negotiated a buy-sell and earned a $38 million promote. This promote is currently excluded from total FFO and net income forecast for the year, since we will plan to finalize accounting treatment in the fourth quarter. We have reinvested the promote into the joint venture, thereby increasing our ownership to approximately 58%, which results in an additional FFO of over $1 million annually. This execution is a good example of our ability to source and structure unique opportunities in response to changing market dynamics and creating shareholder value. Overall, the private equity platform has performed well, and we will continue to look for ways to optimize return. Turning on to the balance sheet. The balance sheet remained strong. Our BBB+ rating and stable outlook was recently reaffirmed by S&P, and our credit metrics continue to trend favorably. At quarter end, net debt-to-EBITDA improved from last quarter, now at 5.5 times, and our total debt-to-market cap remains low at 24.5%. With over $1 billion of liquidity on our line of credit and cash on hand, along with a light maturity schedule in the near term, we are well-positioned as we move forward to 2018. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mike, as I listen to you go through all these regulatory, which are pretty complicated, and all the onerous things that are going on in California, with local rent controls and you have the Costa-Hawkins and you think about Amazon HQ in Seattle, I guess, do you sit back and think about whether Essex needs market diversification, additional market diversification, away from those traditional West Coast markets? And like I know going way back, there was the whole Town and Country thing that you were going to do in a joint venture and I know we've had some topics over time, it just seems a little bit more direct today. We certainly saw Avalon announce going into Denver and South Florida. So, I just want to take your temperature a little bit about where your head's at in terms of market exposure and maybe mitigating some of the risk, and I recognize there is a lot of opportunity in your West Coast markets, but how are you sort of underwriting that today?
Michael Schall: Michael, it's a great question. And the answer is we think about it a lot. We reviewed it in our strategic session with our board recently, and there are other markets that we compare and contrast ourselves against, and some of them, actually, almost all of them are on the East Coast, because of our basic formula, which is where is housing most supply-constrained and where are single-family homes or the housing alternatives, more affordable? We want to avoid those areas. In other words, we want to be in markets where other types of housing is very unaffordable, making the transition from a renter to a homeowner a very expensive one. So those are the core elements of our strategy, along with, of course, job growth, which our view is job growth is the driver of pretty much everything. And we all like to talk about demographics and other things, but I think that, that's a sideshow relative to the job growth forecast. So, as we evaluate the world, we are constantly looking, and I'd say we're compelled to go to other markets to the extent that we think that they will outperform over time the West Coast and the conditions on the West Coast. And at this point, we've concluded that we're going to remain here on the West Coast for a variety of reasons, and you have seen part of this. I mean, when tech is strong, it is incredibly strong. The Town and Country scenario is not analogous, in our view, to today. Remember, back in the early 2000, you had the Internet boom-bust cycle. In connection with that, rents in the Bay Area went up something like 40% in two years. And so, we thought rents were way out of reach relative to the common consumer to a much greater extent than they are today, and therefore, we sought diversification. What we see now is we see yes, rents are somewhat unaffordable, but not nearly as unaffordable as they were then. The job growth, the dominance of tech, we were also concerned about the tech markets back then, because as you all know, a bunch of companies went public, they had a few hundred million dollars in the bank, but they had no product, they had no income. They had no growth and so that was obviously very troubling to us. We now are in the markets with the top 10 tech companies that are headquartered here. And yes, they are having trouble. We've reported this over time. They're having trouble finding qualified people, but there is demand for people out there and job growth and these companies have enormous wealth. I think we did the 10-year comparison and I don't know, don't remember exactly the statistics, but it's something like if you go back to 2005, the tech companies had a market cap, the top 10 public tech companies, had a market cap of about 50% of the top 10 non-tech, excluding the banks. And if you fast-forward 12 years, we, the tech companies grew 4.5 times, whereas the non-techs grew something like 40%. Tech is not going away. And if anything, the integration of tech into every component in society. You have this number of how many devices will have a IP address, for example, going from somewhere around 25 billion to 75 billion in the next five or 10 years. It's a pretty extraordinary thing. So, we think betting against tech is probably a bad thing. We recognize that things don't follow a straight line. I've said this many times, there are bumps in the road. Things happen that are unanticipated, and we will endure that for a higher CAGR of rent growth over periods of time. And so, I actually have a chart in front of me that we prepared for our board that talks about what the CAGRs of rent growth are for the various different markets, and we still think that those are pretty compelling, and we still think tech is pretty well-positioned.
Michael Bilerman: Tech is not only on the West Coast, either, right? You think about where, how tech evolves, right, and it may not only be constrained to West Coast markets.
Michael Schall: No, for sure. We think people are smart. We think companies are smart. If they can't find their people on the West Coast, they will look at other places. We believe all of that is true. We believe that if the United States is not competitive, then the tech companies will find and set up operations overseas. We totally agree with that. But I don't think it's going away. I don't think the concentrations are going away on the West Coast, and there will be other beneficiaries. I mean, I looked at a list of Alphabet companies the other day. If you look down the list, there's like 100 companies that fold in under Google and Alphabet. I mean, they're pursuing a lot of things. They're disrupting all sorts of things from the way we - taxis and travel and communication, and retail, obviously, and even governmental elections. I mean, it's a pretty extraordinary time and I don't think it's done. And so, we are not necessarily - we're not obviously a tech company, but we certainly are attached to them, attached to the tech train and it still seems like it's the right place to be.
Michael Bilerman: Just on Costa-Hawkins. Is this the most momentum you've seen towards a repeal? And then what's the expected timing of the bill or how do you expect this to play out?
Michael Schall: It's not a bill, Michael. It's a ballot proposition, so it's proposed to be on the 2018 ballot, and John Eudy is here. He spends a lot of time on the political side. And maybe I will defer to him, but I'll say that it still has a long way to go. It was just filed as a proposal last week, so we don't want to make such a big deal about it at this point in time. Let's see, in the process of getting it qualified and gathering signatures, see how much effort is behind it. I think the key part, the point I was trying to make in the prepared remarks, is that the bills that were passed, the 15 bills related to housing, did not affect rent control. And I think that there is a, at least a recognition at the state level, that rent control has some very significant unintended consequences. The biggest, from my view, is that it reduces turnover. In other words, rather than people being forced out to cheaper housing outside the core areas, they are now allowed to stay in San Jose or San Francisco, but that significantly reduces turnover. Reducing turnover, of course, creates greater scarcity for people moving into the area. It actually exacerbates and pushes rents up on those units. So, I think there's general recognition of this. Again, as I said in my prepared remarks, the proposal is being pushed by the labor unions and some tenant advocacy groups and therefore, it's really separated from the political process in Sacramento at this point. John, do you want to add anything?
John Eudy: The only thing I can add is, again, Costa-Hawkins repeal measure is before the Attorney General, it's got about 45 to 60 days to get qualified before they can start gathering signatures. And if you recall, this same measure went before the state legislature earlier in the spring and it didn't make it out of the committee, because the long and short is everyone recognizes that rent control does not solve the affordable housing issue at the lower end of the spectrum. And most of these housing bills, if you look at them, that have gone through are trying to address that segment. And we believe, first off, that the repeal measure will likely be recognized for what it is. And we think that if it does make it to the ballot, we can beat it. And if it does get passed, in that event, it is not rent control. All it is, is it repeals a protection post-'95 product from possibility of rent control at the local jurisdiction. And if you look across the state, since 1995, very, very few examples of rent control being voted on by local jurisdictions were done for pre-'95 product, even though they could have been. From our radar, what we see is most cities, when you get down to it they recognize that it doesn't help solve the problem.
Michael Bilerman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Mehta: I joined the call and I'm sorry if you already talked about it. But for the new JV that was formed, can you talk about how much can the JV grow? And I guess, how to decide between what's being acquired by the JV versus what you guys acquire for your own?
Angela Kleiman: Sure thing. In terms of how we think about the JV business itself, it's really a function of how do we optimize our cost of capital. And so, we don't have a specific requirement to contribute an asset to a joint venture or to put it on the balance sheet. These are not, if you will, a platform acquisition vehicle. And so, we do have that optionality to arbitrage between where our stock price is and the cost on the joint venture side, which also benefits from leverage. So, they're slightly higher levered, and so we can really optimize the cost of capital when it makes sense to do so. So as far as that piece, we try to - the self-imposed goal is to keep that business somewhere around less than, say, 20% of our total enterprise and right now, it's still well under that, as far as the component of our business. And so, it's truly just a way to arbitrage the cost of capital from that perspective. The promote embedded in this platform itself, at this point, I think last, the end of last year, I had mentioned the preliminary estimate was somewhere between $35 million to $50 million. And then so fast-forward to this year, with the current run rate and more robust update, now that we were able to monetize one joint venture, we believe that there's another, somewhere between $40 million to $50 million of embedded promote available to us.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And I guess second question, could you talk about what you are seeing in the private equity market?
John Burkart: Can you repeat the question, please?
Gaurav Mehta: Can you talk about what you're seeing in the private equity market? Are you seeing more demand or less demand?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. I can comment on that. Well, the fact that we completed these transactions in the joint venture world at a price that we thought, as Angela said, was advantageous to the on-balance sheet cost of capital, means that, that business is alive and well. I think that institutions are struggling to find opportunities at a reasonable yield. And I think 4% to 4.5% cap rates with some growth is being considered pretty attractive by the institutions, and that's what enables this type of transaction. So maybe there aren't as many institutions out there, but I would say that the ones that are out there are still very focused on the market and there still is a very active buyer pool within the institutions.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. Thank you. That's all I have.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, maybe just a first question for Angela. You talked about the other income kind of driving some of the same-store revenues. Was hoping you can just expand on that, kind of quantify the impact in the third quarter and maybe year-to-date and what's driving that?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. On the outperformance in the third quarter, which is - if you're thinking about the, on the same-store perspective, we had last quarter guided to 2.8%, and we ended up at about 3.1%, so about 30 basis points higher on a same-store. But if you translate that to the actual FFO impact, out of the $0.05 beat, $0.02 is timing, so let's take that off the table. As of $0.03, only $0.01 of that is really attributed to same-store and $0.02, other pennies, is non-same-store. And the components of the $0.03 beat are occupancy and the other income. And the other income component, that includes your typical other income, like parking garage income, some [indiscernible], so those are the key drivers. But it's mostly on the non-same-store and that's one of the reasons why we did not make any adjustments to our fourth quarter outlook.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then I was just hoping you guys could go through the new and renewals for the third quarter, and any data points you have on October. I think you spoke to maybe the renewal offers out, but if you can go through that again, that would be great?
John Burkart: Certainly, this is John. So, what I had mentioned is we had sent our renewals out for the fourth quarter and or are sending them, in the process of doing that in the 3% to 4% range. But it's important to understand that, as we mentioned earlier, our loss to lease right now is about 20 basis points. That means that the market is pretty near where our actual rents are. And so, where exactly that ends up, some will get negotiated down, most likely, and we'll go from there, ultimately case-by-case. But from the market perspective, as I mentioned, the market, on a year-over-year basis, hit a low in August, but it's subsequently come back up, and so at this point in time, we're about 1.5% above where we were last year from a low that was below 1%. So, from my perspective, the view is optimistic. We know last year we had a tough fourth quarter, so the comps get a little bit easier and so overall, we're doing good. Moving forward, it's not the extreme job growth era that we had a few years ago, but things are pretty solid out there.
Juan Sanabria: Do you mind going over the new and renewals by the major buckets…?
John Burkart: Sure. So, SoCal, we have renewals going out at about 3.7%, and the year-over-year SoCal rents are around, just up around 1%. In Northern California, we have renewals going out also at about 3.7%. And in Northern California, year-over-year rents are up about 2.3%. And then in Seattle, we have renewals going out at about 4.1% and the new rents year-over-year are up about 1.3%.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And what was the third quarter renewal number, though?
John Burkart: Third quarter renewals?
Juan Sanabria: Yes.
John Burkart: Third quarter renewals came in somewhere around 4% overall.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Hi, just to close out that last question, so in the third quarter, new versus the renewals at forward new was what?
John Burkart: In the third quarter, new rents for the quarter were up about 2.5%. So, they've - yes, new rents in the third quarter were up - actually, let me rephrase that, sorry. New rents for SoCal in the third quarter were up about 2.5%. NorCal was about 20 basis points up and Seattle, about 2.7%. It went down. They peaked up and then came back down.
Dennis McGill: Okay, thank you. And then with respect to concessions, you talked about them being elevated today. How would the concession activity today compare to what you would have anticipated, call it, three, four months ago?
John Burkart: The concession activity in the third quarter was significantly greater in both the second quarter and the third quarter of last year. It really was across all markets, but the biggest area of impact was Southern California. So, to put it in context, last year, we had three assets that constituted 90% of our concessions in the same-store portfolio, and that was really focused around Downtown LA and West LA. This year, that broadened, so 10 assets constituted 80%, and that was also Downtown LA., West LA and then some into the Tri-City, Glendale, Pasadena. So, we saw much greater use of concessions in the SoCal area. As we look in Northern California, the concessions were much more spread out. Its 21 assets constitute only 40%, the top 21 assets were only 40%. Basically, in Northern California, concessions were used as a look-and-lease, a tool to close, whereas in Southern California, in several cases, certainly around the downtown area, they were used just as part of the market. In essence, a month free on some existing assets competing with all the new supply out there. When we go to Pacific Northwest, again, the spread was pretty significant. It was 13 assets at 75% of the total concessions, and that was really largely in the Eastside and North area, not in the downtown area. The downtown area has remained pretty strong as far as demand goes.
Michael Schall: Hey, John, let me just add one other thing. And Dennis, I think just connecting the dots back to the comments in the script, the third quarter this year we had actually net negative employment growth. And so, what happened, I think, is you have the same lumpiness of supply hitting the marketplace. And when you have net negative job growth, in other words, unadjusted total employment actually went down from June 30 to September 30, there is no demand being naturally created during the quarter. And so, the concessions start pushing through the lease-ups and into the stabilized portfolio, which are the numbers John just mentioned. So, you still have the lease-ups with pretty robust concessions, that always happens. They're trying to hit 25 to 30 units a month in absorption targets. If they can't get it from job growth, then they start trying to steal from, or they take from the stabilized communities, which is what is happening. But I think that this is, the difference between the quarters is that the stabilized communities were affected to a greater extent than in prior quarters.
Dennis McGill: That's very helpful, and I think you kind of answered my next question with that. But when you think about the comment of visibility on concessions maybe being more limited today than they've ever been, and yet at the same time, deliveries are expected to be down next year in the majority of your markets, as you walked through, so you would think that developers would be pushing less aggressively versus more as they get closer to the end. But you're actually seeing the opposite, but you'd put that more on the unemployment side than on the supply side?
Michael Schall: Yes, I mean again, that's a good question. I think developers have a different economic objective than the stabilized owners. The developers want to fill up the development and minimize free rent over the lease-up period, whereas - and as soon as they become stabilized owners, they're like us, they want to minimize concessions. So, there are very different motivations and that is why this is so challenging to figure out. But our econ really study - our economic research group, and the way we view this stuff after doing this a few years is that job growth really matters. And we need job growth in order to create that demand. And if you get a quarter where job growth actually turns negative, and we know what the lease-ups are going to do, they're going to continue to push to hit their absorption targets. When those two intersect, bad things happen. So, it seems like this time of year, many times in the past, you start seeing the deceleration theme that's happening out there. And I would caution everyone on that a bit. And the reason why we didn't publish a full-blown 2018 S-16 is because looking at this time of year, weird things happen with rents because of the drop-off in demand. This is a normal thing. The extent of the drop-off this year is out of the norm, which is, leads us to believe well, is this an aberration or is this the start of a new trend. And that really is the issue and really is the key to this. And so rather than sit here during what we know is the seasonally most weak period of time, and try to determine what that means for next year, we would, candidly, rather wait and see what happens and then we'll have a better view of the world after the next couple of months go by. And we'll get a feel of what happens after the New Year as we go into our Q4 call in early February. So that was the logic behind it. I mean, we could have easily put some numbers down on a piece of paper, but we want to have conviction with what we think, and more importantly, we want to make sure the team is - stands behind and feels responsible for delivering what we put out there. So again, this year's a little bit different, I think, than normal. And so, we just adjusted our overall program to consider the fact that it's different and we're - it's a little bit more challenging to figure out what's going to happen next year, and we have limited visibility. So hopefully, that makes sense.
Dennis McGill: Certainly, it does. Appreciate the comments. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: With regard to the slowing job growth and demand commentary you've had, what are you seeing specifically in terms of traffic at your properties or on your websites versus prior periods? And has it coincided, I guess, with the moderation in market rent growth that you've seen or is that more a function of the concessions?
John Burkart: No. So the answer to your question, what we've seen is traffic is actually up. It's probably up about 5% across the board from last year same period and good overall. But traffic is always a tough, tough metric to look at and try to get insight into the market, because is it that we're doing a better job with our marketing, is it that people are looking more - for more options, or is it that demand's up? It's hard to understand sometimes exactly driving it. And I think it's tough to understand what the root cause is, but traffic is definitely up for us.
Austin Wurschmidt: Interesting and then, I guess, just thinking about supply growth and decreasing in 2018, perhaps some of the heavy concessions starting to burn off. What level of job growth do you think you need to see market rent growth reaccelerate into the peak leasing season next year?
Michael Schall: This is Mike, and that is the million-dollar question, so you get an award, which is a piece of Halloween candy. It's a great question. I think next year is going to start pretty strong again. I think, again, when we look at the number of open positions at the tech companies, it still seems like there is very significant demand. It seems like the business plans for these companies are being developed now and we hit the New Year and those business plans get implemented, and they all involve hiring good people. And so, I honestly don't - I think we're going to have a strong recovery into Q1. And the question will be whether we peak early again next year. And so, I think the first part of the year will be - will continue to be good. But you bring up another key issue, which is we do track how many of the lease-ups are starting to get into their final phases, and there's a pretty significant number of them. For example, in Northern California, about one-third of the 7,600 units that are in lease-ups, are 90% or higher leased, so that should help quite a bit. LA., which has really been disappointing on the job side, and has pretty heavy supply, I don't see a whole lot of relief there. San Diego, which has been - which has really led Southern California portfolio, will actually accelerate in terms of lease-ups in the downtown. So, it's a mixed bag, but I think we'll start pretty strong next year, and we'll have to wait and see how that trend goes into the summer. This year, it was interesting, we peaked early, but our year-to-date rents were actually higher when we peaked than the year before. So, every year is a little bit different, but I'm thinking that we're going to have a strong start to next year.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then one quick follow-up to your comment on leasing, lease-ups in their final phases, do you typically see concessions pick up as potentially looking to stabilize ahead of coming out of the peak leasing season, any thoughts there?
Michael Schall: Yes, I think, again, I think that the philosophy of the lease-ups is pretty consistent, and they're not done until they're done. In this quarter, again, we saw something that we haven't seen, which is we see some of the lease-ups hitting stabilization and dropping concessions, but continuing concessions. We saw that in Seattle. We saw it in Downtown LA So in other words, the thing that I think is different is the use of concessions post-stabilization, again, I think exacerbated by the fact that you had no demand growth, is something that was new in the quarter that we haven't seen, and obviously, we hope that goes away very quickly.
Austin Wurschmidt: Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: It may be a little early to digest fully, but the House Republican announced tax bill includes a reduced cap in the mortgage interest deductions for new homes. Big picture, do you think this significantly impacts housing developments? But specifically, to Essex, do you track the percentage of departures that move into new home?
Michael Schall: We do. And I don't - John, do you have those numbers?
John Burkart: Yes, well, we have move-outs to buy a home, not specifically to new homes, and when we were looking to see where people were moving. In the third quarter, we were about 11% of people moved out to buy a home, which is in the long term - long-term average is about 11% as well. So that's not changing much, but we don't separate between a brand-new home versus [re-built] home.
Michael Schall: No, exactly. But the other number that is very substantial is the median home price increases on the West Coast, which are striking. California averages about 8.4% increase year-over-year in the median price home. Seattle was 14%. So, San Jose was 13%; Oakland, 12%. These are very striking numbers, which again, it goes back to our view of condos versus apartments. As you know, we have about 8,600 apartments that are condo convertible. We have over the last several years spent significant amount of efforts to maintain the ability to convert to condos, and we've just taken one of our Senior Vice Presidents and basically said, "Okay, this is your new job, to work on the condo side of the business." So, the - we think that all these things fit together in some level. And where the bad news is that rents aren't growing as fast as we want them to, the good news is that there is something else that perhaps can compensate for that and allow us to add value to the portfolio.
John Kim: Okay. And then John discussed this in his prepared remarks, but a lot of the new office developments in Northern California have been filling up in recent months. I realize that's not all expansions necessarily, but it seems like office tenants are optimistic. And I'm just trying to align that disconnect or the seeming disconnect between that optimism versus your expectations for slowing job growth.
Michael Schall: Well, yes, but again, job growth - we're talking like this is a horrible thing. We're still at the U.S. average. There are a lot of places that - the fact is that we had fantastic job growth and we've reverted back to the mean or the average. It's not that job growth has completely gone away. And so, we're maybe beating ourselves up a little bit too hard for that issue. And again, we still expect job growth. We track, for example, the number of new positions, and one interesting change is Amazon's been between 8,000 and 10,000 new positions over the last couple of years and now it's down to 7,000 open positions. I don't know if that has something to do with HQ2 or not. We'll have to wait and see. But again, there's still a lot of those positions that remain open and I presume that a lot of these things are going to be absorbed into the space that's being built currently. Again, we struggle to produce 1% of housing supply overall, and there has been and continues to be a lot of office construction that would imply that the demand for people is going to continue.
John Kim: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Okay, thank you. Two questions, so if I'm a tenant in one of your properties and I just got my renewal notice, which was an up 3.4, but I heard that the loss to lease was about 20 basis points, I should try to negotiate you down about 3.2%? Is that the best way to look at it?
Michael Schall: Wow, I hope you don't live in one of our buildings, John.
John Burkart: In the big picture modeling world which is why I refer to it that way for sure. On the practical side, it's obviously a case-by-case situation and the tenants are looking at the same things we are, which are what's going on with the comp and the quality of life that we provide them. So, in the end, I know that a lot of people on the call here are trying to figure out how to model and that's why I'm trying to help give some perspective there. But on a practical basis, obviously, no matter what, people are always looking to try to come in and negotiate the rent. It's part of the American consumer culture. But how it really works out is people are looking at what's going on in the comparable marketplace and the services that we provide, which I think are very great. I think our team works very hard, so we find, more than you may expect, more often than you may expect, perhaps from my comments, people will say this is a great value and that we appreciate it and we want to stay.
John Guinee: All right. And then my real question is if I listen to, I think what you said, Mike, about all these bills, which clearly, my eyes glazed over, at the end of the day, I think it means development oriented towards transportation-centric locations and much more density and much more urban locations, but correct me if I'm wrong. What does this mean to how much it's going to cost to build multifamily in the future? And do you expect these bills to generate more or less supply?
Michael Schall: Well, that is a great question and Mr. Eudy is here and he's got lots of thoughts on this, I know. But I will answer the first part of the question, which is California has been a sprawl type of world, where you build the next road 10 miles further out, you build 10,000 more homes, and that's how we're going to grow. Sometime over the last 10 or 15 years, California said that's the wrong idea and it's really driven by the global warming concerns, et cetera, where California wants to be a leader on that. So, it passed in 2006 its Global Warming Solutions Act, which tries to mandate housing on, in the urban areas and on the transit nodes, and it is trying to execute on that plan. Unfortunately, the transit nodes are not nearly plentiful enough. We need a lot more transit in order to make this transition work and the properties that will be built on the transit nodes and in the urban areas are almost by definition incredibly expensive. And cost of construction is going up pretty significantly. So, I'll leave it to John to fill in the next part of that question, but John, how difficult is it to find development deals now?
John Eudy: We've talked about this the last several quarters. Financial feasibility, at the end of the day, is what drives the bus on how much gets built. And while these bills are an attempt to try to help spur at least certain portions of the housing that could be created, but the reality is if you impose other restrictions, for example, the Wiener bill, SB 35, has an attempt to expedite the process to make it more ministerial, if you're zoned, to go quicker in the process, but then it has a prevailing wage requirement, which kills every deal, just about, outside of San Francisco, which he represents. So, form over substance sometimes gets in the way of what this really is going to produce. And we try, with our cost of capital, to be as aggressive as we can, and you've seen our portfolio of development transactions go down a lot over the last couple of years. Not because we want it to, but because of the financial feasibility. And that is going to be the natural backstop from things going hog wild, all of a sudden, you'll see an oversupply created. We see going in the opposite direction, see the tailing off of the supply deliveries that we're predicting are going to happen over the next two years significantly less than what they were in the last two years.
John Guinee: Great, thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you, John.
Operator: Our next question is from Wesley Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wesley Golladay: Good morning everyone. When you're looking at the supply forecast to go down next year, are you looking at that on a nominal basis or just from a weighted average - from a timing perspective? So, would late 2017 deliveries be impacting the 2018 number at all?
Michael Schall: Wes, it's Mike. Yes, they changed from last quarter. And again, we sent our people out, our econ research team out to drive pretty much everything in the marketplace to get a better idea of what's going to be delivered when. It's always very difficult to pinpoint it, because again, with high density buildings, you end up with the exterior done and the life safety done, but you don't know how much of the interior is done nor do you have access to the building in general. So, it's going to continue to be something that we cannot do with great position and so we're not going to really be able to refine this until we know exactly what happens from quarter-to-quarter. But the analysis that we do is, again, driving all the significant buildings in the area and trying to get a sense for what happened. And so, from last quarter, having driven the sites, we thought that there would be net total about 5,000 units reduced. Now, we're sitting - next year 2018 over 2017, now we're at 2,800. So, some of the units that we forecasted previously into Q4 have driven into Q1 of 2018, so - but still significant reductions overall. So Southern California, a little bit of an increase overall, about 5% increase overall, really dominated by San Diego and LA as well. But reductions, significant reductions, in Northern California and a smaller reduction in Southern California - I'm sorry, Seattle.
Wesley Golladay: Okay, but from a timing perspective, as far as are these, some of these are 2017 deliveries, are they coming in later this year and should we expect supply pressure to remain somewhat elevated in the front half of this year and then really get the big benefit next year in the second half?
Michael Schall: Okay, again caveat with what I just said, it's not perfect. In Southern California, Q4, around 6,500 units, Q4 2017 going to 5,000 units in Q1 and then up a little bit in Q2 and Q4 is at 3,700 units. In Northern California, Q4 2017 is about 2,200 units and Q1 2018, 2,200 units, about the same and then it drops off each quarter thereafter, such that Q4 is about 1,500 units. Seattle, 2,800 units in Q4 2017, dropping to 2,000 and then picking up in Q2, Q3 and then dropping in Q4. So, it's going to be a mix. And again, we feel much better with the supply hitting when the jobs are hitting. I can't overemphasize this issue. When we're in the peak leasing season, in our peak leasing season, jobs are going, that's when most of the jobs are being created, and when the supply hits, there is natural demand being created to absorb some of that supply and so concessions don't go completely crazy. When you get later on in the year, Q3 and Q4, depending upon when the peak occurs, that's when we start being concerned about more supply, because that has an outsized impact. You have zero, let's say, somewhere around zero demand growth, and you end up with supply and that is what softens the markets very quickly, again concessions 1.5 months, two months concessions being the key driver there.
Wesley Golladay: Okay, and then looking at the building blocks for the market to get normal trend, 3% growth. Would concessions be the biggest driver of that easy comp for next year? And at what point does the strong wage growth start to offset some of the weaker job growth?
Michael Schall: Again, we didn't talk about wage growth, but it continues to be strong and it continues to be better than rent growth. So, I think it's a slow improvement to the market. Rent-to-income ratios continue to go down. And interestingly, in our numbers, we now have a couple of Southern California markets that are higher rent-to-income than the Bay Area. So, it's interesting, it's changing, and the Bay Area's strong income growth is definitely helping.
Wesley Golladay: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our last question today comes from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Conor Wagner: On the preferred equity program, what's the type of demand you're seeing from developers and what is your - what's the spread on these deals?
Michael Schall: Conor, how are you? We're still seeing reasonable demand. It's not as strong. We expected it to drop off toward the end of this year, but we're still seeing reasonable deal flow. And in terms of pricing, there's been some competition coming into the marketplace. And as we start - as we approach high $300 million to $400 million in commitment, we may scale back our appetite a little bit or look for another funding source or a number of different things. So, but I think right now, as we look at that business, we still see pretty good demand and we're also seeing cap rates move down, as we talked about. Obviously, rents are growing more slowly or NOI is growing more slowly than construction costs. That continues to be the case, which means these deals need more equity and which we're willing to provide as long as we're in a pretty safe position in the capital stack. So, I don't think that business is going to go away this next year, but I think it will slow down somewhat overall.
Conor Wagner: Okay, thank you. And then on the comments on the housing bills, given your assessment that they won't do much in terms of alleviating the housing shortage in California, but that we do see a new willingness on the part of the legislature to act, what are your thoughts going forward on what the next steps could to be or if they could - if a repeal of Prop 13 could be on the table to help fund some of this affordable housing or longer term, what do you think California will be doing, since you've acknowledged these bills really won't do much in the short term?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. I'll take a stab at it, a difficult one to answer completely accurately, but the attempt right now is to fill the gap on the affordable side of the equation, because that's where most of the squawking is. And as you know, that California used to have a redevelopment agency in all cities up until 2011, that was disbanded by the governor, and that went away. It took away a primary driver to help the affordable folks produce housing. I think that's where it's going to go. It's going to go in a direction to help, create an incentive, whether it's through this bond measure that's being proposed for the ballot next fall, or a combination of that and other incentives, to basically help create the housing that's needed. And if it's attempted to take it out of the very thin pie that is available on the development side, that is making it difficult to make development deals pencil, it's not going to happen. It's got to be a form of public-private partnership, if you will, and yet to be seen what's going to exactly happen. But I'm sure you will hear a lot of chatter here in the next legislative session, because it is top of the radar for everybody.
Michael Schall: I think the LA Times article that I referred to in my comments said the $4 billion bond issuance could support about 14,000 homes and - but again, it has to be approved.
John Eudy: Right.
Michael Schall: It's going to be on the ballot, it has to be approved and then those homes have to be built. So, we're in favor of what the government has done. We acknowledge that there is an enormous shortage of housing here. We see it every day. There used to be, most of the traffic in the morning was on the freeways, now it's cutting through the neighborhoods and everything else because the freeways are so jam-packed. And I know down in your area, that happens as well, Conor. So, these are real problems. And John Eudy and I talk about the effect of CEQA, which none of these laws - really, they touch CEQA, but they don't really directly address it. CEQA is the law, California Environmental Quality Act that allows people to object to and fight a proposed development, based on environmental matters, which includes traffic, noise, et cetera and the CEQA challenges, they're real. The traffic is real and it's disruptive and everyone talks about the NIMBYs need to just go away. But it's not going to happen, because these are real issues. Even neighborhoods are jam-packed with cars now and it needs a resolution and I think back to Michael Bilerman's initial comment, why are staying in California, that resolution is many years away. We don't see anything in the short term that is going to make a dramatic impact on this. All of these issues require multi-pronged, multi-year approaches, with a whole lot of money, a lot more than what we're talking about.
Conor Wagner: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you. Well, in closing, we appreciate your participation on the call, and we look forward to continuing the conversation at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. This morning, I will comment on our quarterly results, market conditions, changes to our market outlook and investment activity. On to the first topic. We are pleased with our second quarter results which benefited from outperformance in Seattle along with continued improvement in Northern California. Results in Southern California were mixed, impacted to varying degrees by supply-related disruption and slowing job growth. John Burkart will comment on each Essex market in a moment. Overall, the West Coast continues to outpace the slow-growth national economy, although the level of outperformance has narrowed. As noted previously, pricing power is disrupted when large rental concessions are introduced to the market, usually occurring when several lease-up communities compete directly with aggressive absorption target. In our experience six to eight weeks of free rent, equivalent to 12%, 16% of annual rents, provides sufficient incentive to draw residents out of stabilized communities. Fortunately, these large concessions generally represent only a short-term disruption and pricing power. While long-term fundamentals remain intact and California's persistent housing shortage continues. This year’s strong recovery in Northern California confirms that the pricing destruction we experienced in 2016 was directly attributable to levels of rental concession. As soon as these concessions abated in early 2017, market rents recovered and pricing firmed. Accordingly, we have experienced recent concession-related pricing power erosion at certain of our properties in Downtown Los Angeles, West L.A. and the Tri-Cities. We expect pricing power to rebound when concessions abate. I would like to recognize the operations team for reacting quickly and thoughtfully to changing market conditions. Noted on our last call, an important part of our expectations are that tight labor markets in California push incomes higher, high net workers from other parts of the U.S. and world. The Essex markets, 2017 personal incomes are expected to grow 4.9% led by San Francisco at 5.9% and compared to the U.S. average of 3.2%. Further, over the past year the ratio of rental income has declined in both San Francisco and San Jose two areas most affected by affordability constraints. Median home prices are also growing faster than rent, Seattle leading the way 14.8% year-over-year, and California up 7.2% both outpacing rent growth over the past year. This is important for two reasons; first, higher home prices make the transition from a renter to a homeowner more difficult; and second, a significant part of the Essex portfolio is convertible into condos. On to our revised 2017 outlook. We made a number of changes to our MSA level forecast on Page S-16 supplement. First, we've reduced our job growth forecast for several metros including Orange County, San Jose and San Diego. Across the Essex portfolio, job growth peaked in 2015 and has slowed since. Tech markets continue to report strong yet decelerating job growth that has consistently outperformed the U.S. average. Southern California, however, is a more diversified economy and therefore performing more in line with the broader U.S. average. Additionally, several factors have impacted our forecast as follows; first, and most notably is the shortage of skilled workers and low unemployment rate, which are more acute on the West Coast. Unemployment rates in the Essex markets are now at or below the U.S. average of 4.5% with San Francisco, the lowest at 2.6%. Overall, the unemployment rate in the Essex portfolio has declined 50 basis points over the past year with nearly 20,000 open positions at the large companies in California and Washington. Second, demographic factors are also contributing to slower job growth. According to one study, there are now 8,000 baby boomers turning 65 each day and that rate will continue to accelerate. At the same time, the number of millennials entering the workforce is now declining. Growth should continue to slow number of baby boomers reaching retirement age is expected to exceed number of millennials entering the workforce. Fortunately, longer life spans and healthier senior workers will slow this impact because they often remain in the workforce past the age. Third, is the housing or location preference of retirees. It is estimated that more than 70% of retirees want to “age in place” referring to the fact that they strongly prefer to remain in the same house and/or community, friends and family. Given longer life spans and the preference to age in place many look to consume homes without requiring a job, thus creating housing demand, it is not appropriately represented in the normal relationship where two jobs are needed to create one household. Finally, the limited supply of skilled construction labor also appears to be an influence. The demanding physical requirements of construction result in earlier retirement compared to other industries and studies indicate that many more construction workers are at the end of their career or to those new workers entering the trade. This leads us to believe the construction labor were remain in short supply, which will help keep construction costs near current levels for that significant increases in housing buy. These forces should remain in place as we head into 2018, tight labor and market conditions, pushing incomes higher and hopefully attracting people from other areas. While higher wages will impact operating expenses also make apartments more affordable and are necessary to push rents higher. Summing this up, as long as the economy continues to expand, we see apartment rents growing at near their long-term averages for the foreseeable future. Turning to investment activities, we modified our investment strategy during the quarter driven by lower capital costs for both long-term debt and equity as well as improved expectations from rent growth in some areas. Previously, our 2017 plan rely primarily on dispositions to fund new investment. We now anticipate fewer dispositions reliant instead on stock issuance and long-term debt. As to dispositions our strategy will focus on portfolio culling activities whereas previously we targeted partial sales of wholly-owned properties to institutional co-investment entity. Thus, we are now targeting a range of $300 million to $350 million per property sales in 2017, down from a range of $400 million to $700 million previously of which one $132 million has been completed year-to-date. With respect to acquisitions investment conditions remain highly competitive with strong investor demand relative to a limited number of quality properties hitting the market. Thus prices are being driven above our expectations and we are often out bid. We have closed $270 million year-to-date, currently we have two properties in contract getting approximately $230 million. If these transactions close cumulative 2017 acquisitions should be approximately $500 million, which is within our targeted $400 million to $600 million range. Please note that the foregoing comments about acquisitions and dispositions should refer to total property values as many of these transactions will involve institutional co-investment. Angela, will discuss the net impact on Essex's balance sheet in a moment. Additionally, given the strong investor interest in apartments especially for value-added opportunities and high quality properties in the best locations, we have lowered our internal cap rate assumption for the Essex portfolio by 10 basis points. Across our market A quality property in the best locations are trading around 4% cap rate using the Essex methodology and sometimes more aggressive buyers will pay sub 4% cap rates. Cap rates for B quality property and location are generally 40 basis points to 60 basis points higher than A quality property with upgrade costs and related rents assumed for value-add opportunities. Switching over to our preferred equity and subordinated debt program, we've made good progress during the quarter. Significant transactions were detailed in the press release and at quarters end we had a total outstanding of approximately $276 million, up about $26 million from last quarter. Through Q2, we have funded approximately $34 million in new deals in 2017 against our guidance for the year of $100 million. On the repayment side, we received $13 million in repayments during the quarter and converted one preferred equity investment into common ownership position earlier this year. We have also approved five additional preferred equity deals involving around $100 million most of which are expected to close by year-end. Going forward, we remain on track to equal or exceed our original guidance. Finally, on the development front, we remain on schedule to commence construction on two new projects and the next phase of our Station Park Green project in 2017. In general, we continue to see headwinds to new development deals and we believe that the overall trend for apartment supply is downward in 2018. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I’ll now turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Q2 was another solid quarter for Essex with year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 3.9% and NOI growth of 4.7%. Overall, the market performed at or slightly above our expectation. However, the market was stronger in April and May and a little weaker in June. Typically in L.A. and Orange County, net effective rent were flat and/or declined in June. L.A. is negatively impacted by very competitive lease up environment and Orange County is impacted by the combination of lower employment growth and increased supply. The Bay Area in Seattle, market rents grew significantly during the quarter. However, occupancy declined in those markets. Specialty and occupancy in the Bay Area in Seattle was mostly due to higher turnover, which is consistent with seasonal norms. However, in Seattle we also saw slight slowdown in the market in June. We adjusted rental rates to meet the market in July and we picked up 20 basis points of physical occupancy during the month of July, bringing occupancy this week to 96.4% and decreasing availability 30 days out from 5.3% at the end of June to 4.9% this week. Lower rents appears to have peaked in June, a month earlier than historical seasonal pattern with strong leasing activity that we experienced in July gives us confidence that the markets are healthy. It is our expectations the markets will follow a normal seasonal pattern in the second half of the year. Our loss to lease for the portfolio in June 2017 declined to 3.4% compared to 3.8% in May, 2017. In our market rent for the portfolio increased in June over May. Scheduled rent increased more 57 basis points, which is a good thing due to leases being renewed or units being released their rents and therefore loss to lease is declining. We are spinning out renewals for the third quarter at an average of 4.8% for the portfolio. However, renewals rates maybe negotiated down as rents appear to have peaked for the portfolio. In the third quarter, we expect that our occupancy will be roughly the same as the prior year’s quarter or about 96.5%. And therefore, we will not receive the benefit of increased year-over-year revenue growth related to the increased occupancy that we have had in each of the last four quarters. It is our continued expectation that the third quarter will be the low point for the year-over-year revenue growth between 2.5% and 3% over the prior year’s quarter in part due to a tougher occupancy comp from last year. Turning to expenses, we continue to face strong headwinds both from utilities and wage pressures that I have noted on prior calls. However, we have been successful in partially offsetting the increases by strategically bidding out asset collections to service vendors. For example, our pool and landscape contract expenses are down 1% in the prior year’s period despite the 10% increase in minimum wage, which directly impacts both services. Moving on to update our market. In Seattle, job growth has slowed relative to prior quarters, but remain the strongest job market within the Essex portfolio with year-over-year growth of 2.6% for the second quarter. Amazon continues to expand with their purchased of Austin-based Whole Foods for $13.7 billion currently in the State of Washington Amazon has 8,600 openings. Microsoft announced a reorganization earlier this month that will result in thousands of worldwide company job cuts. However, only 400 to 500 layoffs are expected in the Seattle region. Multi-family supply remains high at the MD and concessions are generally one-month free for properties and lease-up. Interestingly some of the lease-ups in the Seattle CBD have little to no concession. We have seen move outs buy a home remain elevated in the Seattle market at approximately 20% compared to historical average of around 14% to 16% for this market. In office activity Seattle as recorded the strongest year-to-date office absorption of any major metro in the U.S. at 2.9% of existing stock. Additionally, CMD has nearly 6 million square feet of office under construction almost half of which is pre-leased by Amazon, Facebook and Google. On the east side, [Vulcan] was developed a substantial amount of office space for Amazon in Downtown Seattle purchased two development site in Downtown Bellevue both of which are zoned for 450 foot tall towers. Our same-store revenues in the Seattle MD grew by 6.6% year-over-year for this quarter, with the CBD at 6.7%, the east and submarket achieving – around 6.3% and [indiscernible] submarket achieving 7.8%. In Northern California, job growth in the Bay Area averaged 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2017 was roughly 63,000 jobs added over the prior year’s quarter. San Francisco continued to lead the way, posting year-over-year job growth of 2.3% of Oakland and San Jose were up 1.9% and $1.5 respectively. There was almost 19 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area roughly 44% of which is pre-leased. In San Francisco, Salesforce and Amazon expanded their combined footprint by an additional 330,000 square feet. Across the Bay we were plans to open its first office of 75,000 square feet in the open CBD by the end of the year and in Pleasanton construction has began workday’s 400,000 square foot office building. Finally, in Downtown San Jose, Adobe is in contract to purchase the site adjacent to their headquarters where they're planning on expansion that could house an additional 3,000 employee. Additionally, Google has started negotiations with the city of San Jose on the formation of a new campus in Downtown which could ultimately house up to 20,000 employee. During the quarter we continued our lease-up of Century Towers in Downtown San Jose and Galloway located at Pleasanton using four to six weeks of concessions of selected units for both lease-up we've averaged over 30 leases per month at each 5. Shifting to Southern California, in Los Angeles County, job growth is average 1.4% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2017 and is generally in line with the U.S. at 1.5%. Essex continues to perform well in this market led by Long Beach and Tri-Cities submarket was 6.9% and 6.2% year-over-year growth respectively in the second quarter, trailed by Woodland Hills submarket 3.9% and the West L.A. and L.A. CBD submarket at 2% and 0.4% respectively. The revenue in our L.A. region was negatively impacted in the second quarter by a dispute with a corporate tenet which was resolved after the close of the quarter. Concessions are still high in Downtown L.A. often two months free at new assets and lease-up encourage prospects to break their existing leases and move into the new building. Commonly in California leases allowed tenets to move out prior to the end of the term by paying a one-month lease break fee. As a result of their aggressive Downtown lease-ups we are now starting to see some stabilize assets offering $500 to one-month free on new lease which is similar to our experience last year in the Bay Area. Additionally, the new lease-ups in Glendale and Hollywood are now commonly offering two months free. Looking at office activity in the market, television and entertainment industry continues to drive office demand in the West L.A. submarket, Amazon Studios, HBO and Netflix expanded their footprints with the combined total of over 170,000 square feet of new leases. In Orange County, job growth continues to show signs of weakness with 0.7% year-over-year growth for the second quarter of 2017. We achieved sold rents – solid results in this market despite the weak job growth and supply. South and North Orange submarket grew at 5.2% and 4.6% year-over-year respectively in the second quarter of 2017. We are watching Orange County closely as market rents are being negatively impacted by the supply demand imbalance at this time. Finally in San Diego, job growth was 1.6% year-over-year as a quarter. Our North City and Oceanside submarkets achieved 4.5% and 4.1% year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2017 while our Chula Vista submarket achieved 2.5% over the same period. Despite the lower job growth, the rental market in San Diego has remained strong. Currently, our entire same-store portfolio is 96.4% occupied and our availability 30 days out is 4.9%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I will start with a review of our second quarter results, followed by the full-year guidance revision and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. In the second quarter, core FFO grew 8.4% and exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $0.10, of which $0.03 is related to timing of expenses and expected to occur in the second half of the year. The remaining $0.07 outperformance were driven by the following. $0.02 from revenue exceeding expectation, $0.02 from operating expense savings and $0.03 from lower property taxes as we received final bills from several legacy BRE properties, which primarily relates to prior year period. Therefore this is a non-same store item. As a result of the second quarter performance, we have tightened the range of our same property revenue growth, thereby raising the midpoint to 3.6%. Year-to-date, we have raised this midpoint by a total of 35 basis points, compared to our original guidance of 3.25%. Moving on to expenses, we are pleased to be able to decrease the midpoint of our same property expense growth guidance by 30 basis points to 2.7%. This reduction is due to a combination of property tax refund and savings realized from various initiatives implemented in operation, as described earlier by John Burkart. The resulting impact to same-property NOI growth is a 30 basis points increase to 4% at the midpoint. And year-to-date, the midpoint of our same property NOI growth has been increased by a total of 62 basis points, as our original guidance was 3.38%. On to FFO guidance, we’ve raised our full-year core FFO per share by $0.07 to $11.83 at the midpoint, which reflects a 7.2 year-over-year increase. We continue to drive our operating results to bottom line as our core FFO per share growth is 315 basis points above the same property NOI growth rate at the midpoint. As for the third quarter, we are projecting core FFO per share of $2.93 at the midpoint. The $0.04 sequential decline is primarily due to the one-time property tax benefit mentioned earlier. Lastly on the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA improved to 5.6 times from 5.7 times since the last quarter. This is consistent with our expectations for this ratio to decrease from growth and EBITDA. The continued downward trend in this metric over the past several years has enabled us to reduce the low end of our target range from 6 times, down to 5.5 times. During the second quarter, we issued $81 million of common stock through our ATM program, which substantially meets our equity needs to match fund our investment activities. Since much of our acquisitions and the dispositions will involve the co-investment program. The net effect is de minimus on our funding plan as it relates future equity issuance. We remain disciplined and well positioned to be opportunistic relative to our cost of capital in order to optimize opportunity in the marketplace. With full availability on our $1 billion line of credit, a variety of capital forces and zero debt maturities for the remainder of the year balance sheet remains flexible and strong. That concludes my comment and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: I was just hopping you could speak to the new and renewal trends achieved in the second quarter by the major markets if you would imagine?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. So new in SoCal was about 3.1%, renewals were about 4.6%, in NorCal new was about 1.8% in the second quarter and renewals were about 2.7%, and then in Seattle new was about 8.7% and renewals were about 5.9%, so overall for the portfolio new coming in about 3.6% and renewals at about 4.1%. And to be clear, the way we're looking at that that is versus comparable term, so roughly 12-month lease compared to a 12-month lease because as soon as you start changing the terms because of revenue management pricing it'll change the – move the numbers around a little.
Juan Sanabria: And then I was just hoping you could talk to Southern California and you kind of mentioned some supply pressures kind of how you see that playing out in the second half of the year, and if supply is skewed to the second half of the year in Southern California, and thoughts into 2018. And how should we think about the duration of this supply pressure, maybe comparing it to what we saw in Northern California last year. And have you seen any improvement in the jobs or kind of should we expect the same level to continue?
Michael Schall: Hey Juan, it’s Mike. Going to try and attack that question and maybe John will want to add on to that. We see supply continuing in L.A. actually increasing a little bit in 2018 relative to 2017. Orange County however seems to drop off pretty significantly in 2018 relative to 2017, but we’ll remain pretty consistent for the rest of the year. And we have actually a pretty large increase expected in San Diego for 2018 over 2017, so that's how that plays out and that compares to reductions, pretty big reductions in Northern California in 2018 around 40% and around 10% in the Seattle marketplace. So that is one factor. And then as you noted the other factor is what's going on with jobs and so we brought those numbers down pretty substantially from last quarter to this quarter in terms of the Southern California job growth, but do a couple of months make the year or the quarter really fundamentally change? I’m not sure we can answer that question. We try to highlight some of the factors that are influencing or we think reducing job growth which includes this issue of the shortage of skilled workers and overall low unemployment rate, so the availability of workers is not there and I think that's probably the key factor that is limiting job growth. The answer to that would probably be that wages go up and people in other parts of the country relocate to the West Coast and take those open jobs. I'm not sure how we track that, but I think that is the key and those forces which will put pressure on wages and hopefully push them up and make it more attractive to make a move from the East Coast or the Midwest to the West Coast. We think that's ultimately the answer.
John Burkart: I’m going to add just a couple of comments, as Mike said. For jobs overall, our April and May, really reflected the nation as far as a level of weakness and then June it came back stronger, so just like the U.S., so it’s a little bit of a mixed messages there. Then just a little bit more commentary on the marketplace. In NorCal, I referenced earlier the – what we're seeing in L.A. with the concessions and now some of the stabilized assets giving concessions because of the eight weeks free or two months free at the lease-ups. That is The one difference is in NorCal and Seattle the markets are more seasonal towards the second half of the year they just seasonally drop pretty significantly. Whereas in Southern Cal, that tends to not happen it comes down a little bit but not very much. So how this thing plays out? I suspect it plays out a little bit stronger than NorCal did last year.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you very much. It’s very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. In terms of the preferred equity and nice debt opportunities, it sort of competition are you seeing in the market today?
Michael Schall: This is Mike, I’ll take that one again Nick. We're seeing more competition generally speaking and at the same time I think that we're seeing somewhat of a lower deal flow. So we're seeing both of those occurring and that's pretty consistent with what we see on the development side and John Eudy’s here may want to add to this, but overall we think fewer development deals are penciling primarily because costs are growing faster construction costs are growing faster of that NOI which is pretty pressure on development deals and so I think generally speaking the number of deals that make sense and that pencil are fewer than they were a year-ago let's say and so that obviously cuts into be preferred equity and debt program as well.
Nick Joseph: Thanks and just in terms of rent control initiatives. Do you have any update on those recognizing the market has been in a stop in and started in terms of rent growth, but any update there would be great.
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s Mike again. There are 100 plus bills that are in the state legislature right now and many of them deal with housing and actually I was going note that there's a really good summary of a lot of the activity in the L.A. Times article dated June 1st of this year. I guess the big question is what if anything hits the ballot in 2018 there have been discussions about Costa-Hawkins which is state wide rank control measure that basically limits the extent to which local governments can enact rent control that is the big discussion here. But there's a lot of activity out there I don't think at this point in time and the reason why I didn't include it in my script. I don't think at this point time we can conclude much from all the activity give you some of the maybe the areas that some of these bills are dealing with certainly affordable housing production is one of the key areas. One for example allowing smaller units, slows the small 150 units - 150 square feet per unit more housing of all types a bill for example that will expand the area around a BART station that can be developed of housing from half mile radius to a mile radius. Raising money for housing of all different types from bonds and other types of things transaction fees on real estate, eliminating the mortgage interest reduction on second homes and doubling the tax credit for low and mid income renters. So there's lots of activity. That's at the state level, the local level there is activity as well. So there's a lot of things happening in California and a lot of discussion, but it's probably not the right time to conclude anything from all of this.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Mehta: Yes, hi, thank. Earlier in the call you talked about median home prices going up in Seattle and Northern California and you also mention that significant [indiscernible] portfolio and convertible into condos. Provide a little more color on that is that something on your radar?
Michael Schall: Yes, it's my this is definitely on our radar and we have somewhere around 8,000 or 9,000 apartments that can be converted into condominiums some require some additional work in order to perfect that that process. Virtually everything we build we have some kind of condo map happens in some stage. And so including a couple of the deals that we have recently started or can start in the near future and so I know John Eudy is spend a fair amount of time looking at that. But just to remind you what our overall metric is there. We need to see a substantial premium of condo values or the value of our property as a condo considering all the costs involved relative to its value as an apartment building. And so obviously apartment values have done really well over the last several years and so we are starting to see some of those premiums for sale housing relative to apartments. But I think we have a ways to go. It certainly helps for example in San Francisco, we had 9.2% increase in the median home price and we didn't see anywhere near 9.2% rent growth in the last year. Therefore that is starting to build this premium, but I’d say the general statement is not quite there. But we're definitely monitoring it, focusing on it.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay, great. And as a follow-up, I think you talked about how difficult it's getting to develop more assets because of higher cost. I was wondering when you think about your pipeline over the next few years, should we expect you to do any more development outside of the starts that you mentioned earlier in the call?
Michael Schall: Yes, John do you want to give that?
John Eudy: Yes, this is John Eudy. I think we've mentioned in our previous call, we’ve got up to three deals that we anticipated starting between now and year-end. All three have legacy over land costs and don't have some of the exactions that are being asked for and approvals are being granted today. So you could expect those three to occur late Q3 to early Q4. Beyond that the pipeline is very, very skinny. We are looking at a couple of other opportunities in front of the opportunist were we can, but clearly a year from now if you look at our pipeline in process, it will be significantly less than it is now.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay, thank you. That's all from me.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Trent Trujillo: This is Trent Trujillo on with Nick and thanks for all the color and taking a question. Just wanted to follow-up on in detail on your guidance range, you tightened an increase the same-store revenue guide for the year. So can you maybe talk about your forecasted second half San Francisco rent growth expectations? And along similar lines earlier in the year, you provided some additional detail on the same-store rev expectations by region. Do you happen to have an update on those underlying ranges and if you amended the aggregate range?
Angela Kleiman: I would point you to as far as the region-by-region basis. I would point you to our region I would point you to our F-16 that has outline for – our expectation is for the year specifically. And before the year, for the portfolio total, the second half of the year, our range would imply the low end. Second half at about 2% and on the high end, we achieved the high end, its closer to say 4% to get us to the average of the 3.6% average.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, that’s helpful. And just maybe to get into the same-store expense side, you provided some – a lot of color in your prepared comments. Just wanted to go back to something that you had mentioned earlier in the year about second quarter expenses projecting to about 4.5% and they ended up well below those expectations. So just a little bit more color on what you did to improve expenses and if there is anything that we can expect going forward as additional expense saving.
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy to – as far as our first quarter call, we announce the 4.5% expense growth, and at that point we had now contemplated the property tax benefit. But also we had expected that in Q1 due to the storm activities in Q1. We had expected to incur the normal painting, tree trimming, et cetera. Those activities occurred in second quarter, but it may sense to not do that during peak leasing season and so that’s $0.03 that still we will occur in the second half of the year. And then of course the combination of the various operation initiative that John Burkart mentioned earlier that led us to make our confidence to lower the overall expense guidance. So we're not expecting more than what we had talked about earlier?
Trent Trujillo: Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one, you talked about you lowered your internal cap rate about 10 basis points. And I was just curious if you could talk about what you're seeing in the transaction market in terms of volume as well as the number of bidders and who the bidders are?
Michael Schall: Yes. Austin, it’s Mike. Thanks for the call. Yes, we lowered our portfolio NAV as noted by about 10 basis points and really that was the culmination of looking at all the transactions that we've done over the last let's say six months or so and realizing that we basically outperformed what we expected per NAV model. And so we lowered it. I think that was probably done back in June – May, June timeframe, something like that. So it was just simply outperforming what our NAV model said, and so we need to tighten it. In terms of the things the properties that are most attractive in the types of bidders, generally the REITs are not in the market. Obviously, you saw the Monogram take private transaction and a name co-JV buyout and that type of thing, but for the most part, we're not seeing a big rebid, but we are seeing many institutions that like apartments and want to invest in apartments, and so I’d say the institutional side has been very, very strong. And they are most focused on one or two things, very well located and high quality properties, generally within – not necessarily just CBD, but I’ll say that top areas high quality properties and then the value-add component with a partner that can execute that. So those two specific types of things are seeing multiple bidders. They're seeing few rounds of best in finals and that type of thing that are normally go along with those and prices that are generally once again exceeding our expectation, hence my comment in my prepared remarks that we are off on our bid.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the detail there. And then just curious when you think about same-store revenue growth expected to bottom in the third quarter and occupancy again be flattish in the back half of the year, should we expect that blended lease rates for the portfolio to turn positive on a year-over-year basis sometime in the back half the year? Or is any of that change given some of the supply dynamic getting pushed out?
John Burkart: Yes. So you're saying blended new lease rates, we do expect that our rates right now are above the year ago and we expect that to continue. Last year we had quite a falloff in the second half. Our expectations are more this year to be more consistent with the normal year and so that will ultimately create a greater spread. So at the end of the year, if you look at year-over-year lease rates, the December over prior year's December, that would mean closer to 4% year-over-year rate that we would end on is what we're looking at. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. And then just last one for me, just with all the moving pieces within the Northern California portfolio in terms of jobs being out in San Jose, you talked about Adobe and Google. Any plans or thoughts on changing any sub market exposure within the Northern California region?
Michael Schall: Hi, this is Mike. I think that within the Northern California region, we still like San Jose a lot and it has we think some of the better parts – the rent-to-income ratio makes more sense. And it seems like if the area that’s receiving the most activity. It's also the jobs and locating apartments near the jobs it seems like that is a logical place to be. So we're certainly interested there, but I would say that we would consider properties in other parts of that Bay Area, part of this is a function of cap rate and a function of what it is and what kind of value we can add. So I'd say we're not going to rule out different parts of the Bay Area, but San Jose would be one of the areas that we would like a lot.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for taking the questions.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the phone call. Your discussed this in various different parts throughout the call and maybe I want to just take a step back and think about guidance in terms of supply versus demand. So obviously, you're taking guidance up at midpoint. From a high-level standpoint, maybe you’ve been drilling down to some of the individual MSAs, what's driving that higher guidance at midpoint? Is it supply getting pushed out in some of your markets or is it maybe stronger demand than you would have thought? How you are thinking about the supply versus the demand balance?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. Honestly we don't know exactly what it is. I mean the enemy here is six weeks to two months free of land which draws people out of the stabilized community and softens pricing power throughout the portfolio wherever it occurs. And so I think the essence of what you're asking is where are we going to see six weeks to two months of concessions within the markets up and down from Seattle to San Diego because that will be the place the pricing is impacted to the greatest extent. Because typically in California, we offer a lease break fee given the way the laws work out here. That’s equal to one-month free, so if you get two months free basically lease-up is going to pay the lease break free and they're going to pocket, the residence going to pocket at the other month. And so that's a lot of incentive really to move out of the building. So I guess anecdotally when we say some of the supplies being pushed out what we mean is when we start seeing that six to eight weeks that means that there's two or three or more lease-ups competing directly against one another in a local marketplace and that is causing the pricing disruption within that location. Generally that will always clear the market at some point in time and when that clears we will start seeing much greater pricing power. And again, it’s exactly what happened in Northern California and we suspect it will happen in other parts. But there isn't like we go out and count every quarter the number of lease-ups that are coming into the market because candidly we can't because you can't see within a building contains 200 units we can go within that 200 units and figure out exactly how many units are going to come to market they’re going to be completed. So you have to use the anecdotal process of what or lease concessions in the market and how is that affecting price within the local market. So that is the way we do it we look to overall supply and demand for a pretty good indication of where we think the biggest risks of that are and you know anywhere that has very significant supplies. So Seattle we're concerned about Downtown L.A. concerned about supply goes up a little bit projected in Downtown L.A. Downtown San Diego supply goes up, but pretty much everywhere else supply is expected to go down. And actually let me correct Seattle, Seattle actually is expected to go down in 2018 by a little bit, but still remain it a pretty high level.
Richard Hill: Got it. And then just I want to ask quickly about San Francisco only because we I think heard some different data points asked whether or not supply getting pushed out or it’s quite not I know you’re not explicitly focused on that. What do you see in San Francisco is it supply going down near-term how do you thinking about that?
Michael Schall: Yes, San Francisco is interesting, we have San Francisco at five weeks free right now, but that's down from six weeks free recently. So again back to my anecdotal evidence we say that - it's concerning but it's bouncing along at that acceptable range generally at you know four to five weeks for a not enough incentive to drop people out of these pay for example into San Francisco. You get up to eight weeks free guess what people that are living in [indiscernible] are going to now live in San Francisco. And so the other point I guess I'd make as a relates to the Bay Area in general is that there were 25 active lease-up in the Bay Area and some of them in San Francisco and 10 of those 25 are in the at the final lease-up phase. So and that involves a couple thousand units and when they're gone I think it will continue to be tighter. So again we see the projection for the Bay Area to become a tighter market with left at lease-up philosophy which should help us with price.
Richard Hill: Got it. And then just I am sorry for being redundant here. The way you look at it difficult are you don't want state whether that’s demand or supply what you do know it’s the better market for you?
Michael Schall: Well, San Francisco is again to mention the unemployment rate which 2.6% a pretty good indicator that demand is very strong there and that’s - I don't think that's the issue I think on the pricing issue I think plenty of people want to live in San Francisco the reason why they don't is because of price that is just been true of San Francisco for a long period of time. So yes, I mean it's kind of again let's take Manhattan as the ultimate example. If Manhattan prices go down, you're going to have a flood of people that move into Manhattan. Well, San Francisco is the same way out here. So demand is generally not the problem. It's a matter of price, and that's why I focus on the concession that's been the critical key element of this.
Richard Hill:
T:
Michael Schall: That’s okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thanks, good morning. It sounds like in Seattle despite the increase in vacancy this quarter for you, the characteristics are overwhelmingly positive. I'm wondering where you think we are in the cycle in Seattle, and if that changed at all in the last few months?
Michael Schall: Yes, it’s Mike. John, it looks like he was dying to take that question, so a chance to chime in. Again Seattle's a little bit of you have a little bit of an enigma for us. We expect it to be a little more muted over the last couple of years and we've been wrong it's turned out to lead the portfolio, and the thing that obviously concerns us is the supply. Although you have got a point to Amazon here and look what they've done in Seattle and hate to focus on any single entity that has such a dramatic impact, but certainly that one does. And so we view Seattle given the amount of supply produces as a little bit riskier market, which means we would seek a little bit higher cap rate if we were investing there and we don't want to continue to add to the portfolio in Northern and Southern California, not sort of keep that pro-rata share up. So we will look at acquisitions in Seattle, but we would like to be pretty careful about buying in that market. Going forward I guess we're more or less jumping on board with the Seattle train and saying and it looks pretty darn good and it looks like it's not going to end anytime soon, so I think that as we go into 2018, we're going to do it as one of our best markets. John?
John Burkart: Yes I would just add, I remember these calls years ago when people would ask us about Boeing and you look at the changes that have gone on in Seattle really fundamental changes and they continue to this day, yet Seattle still has a rent to median income of 25% compared to many of our markets in the mid 20's and so there's still room to go. So it's a market that's under change, undergoing change, very positive change, and I think it still has legs.
John Kim: But as far as waiting for your company, it's still going to remain around 18% or so?
Michael Schall: We target 20%, but that can ebb and flow again, cap rates and deal flow, and opportunity becomes part of that equation. We’re not developing in Seattle right now, because we don't want to be the one that is half completed when the cycle ends. And so again we like Seattle, we're believer and more optimistic about it, today than we were a year-ago, but an area to be cautioned everywhere.
John Kim: Okay. And then on your balance sheet, marketable securities went up $30 million this quarter $152 million. Can you just remind us what this is mostly comprised of and if you own any shares in any public company?
Angela Kleiman: Let's see. Marketable securities that is primarily our insurance captive activities, and so there is not a meaningful change investment activities there. And so we don’t have any meaningful ownership of any of our peers.
John Kim: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hi, good day out there. Just two questions here. The first one is on Downtown L.A., just that market has been transforming for over a decade and there's always a lot of supply there. Do you have a concern that that market just because it seems like a lot of – there is a lot of push to have development there that that will remain a market of imbalance where developers will never pullback just because of the political pushing to do development there or do you think that it really will hold back and finally allow, now the landlords gets pricing power there?
Michael Schall: Alex, it’s Mike. It’s a good question. And obviously, we don't have a perfect answer to this one. We entered Downtown L.A. in the late 90s and we had a kind of two scenarios; one was it continues to be the place that everyone leaves at six o'clock at night, no one's there for dinner or no one lives there. And the other one was that changes to be more like a 24-hour city. And I think that we now know where that's going. And I think the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 helped it where California is trying to get people out of the suburban sprawl type of program and into high density residential in urban areas. And if there is a shining example of that occurring is probably Downtown Los Angeles. The amount of transit dollars that are going into that area and the amount of just development in general is really I think transforming Downtown LA. And I think that our thought is that it will be choppy over a period of time, but remember there is a constraint – financial constraint on new development and so if rents disconnect too much from construction costs and construction costs, there's no evidence are going up at a different rate in L.A. than they are in Northern California maybe it's a little bit of an advantage down there, but I think the rate is still the same. And therefore, there's an economic reason why you can't have unfettered development forever in Downtown LA. So to sum this up, I would say we’re believer in Downtown LA. We're not going to all in. However, we think it's a market that can take some period of time to get to what it's ultimately going to be. Remember all the jobs are already there. It has a huge downtown. So what we're really saying is at what point in time will people choose Downtown L.A. over a commute from, let's say, Pasadena, Glendale, Burbank, Westside L.A., et cetera.  The other phenomenon in what really drive California, again emanating from Global Warming Solutions Act is the investment in cars and highways is very small relative to the demand. So I say traffic getting worse. I think that that puts pressure on these commutes that gets people out of their cars and again, I think Downtown L.A. is a winner in that scenario.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is just going to John. John you mentioned that there is, I think, some softness in June versus earlier in the year. And then you sort of talked about the occupancy in the back of the year. Was that a comment portfolio wide or that was more in talking about like Orange County and LA?
John Burkart: Sure. I mean over the whole portfolio, our occupancy dipped a little bit in June and if we go back to [indiscernible], as I was saying, we had a really strong January through May and we were not going to miss the market. So we pushed pretty hard on rent. And I think we found basically the top, but that's why I went into a little bit more depth in the comment to say that in July we then turned around and gained occupancy by just making a few adjustments with rent. So I don't see there's a market problem, but it really was across the whole market with most pronounced really in Seattle. And part of Seattle relates to turn and as I mentioned and part of it relates to us really hitting the peak of the market as well as Orange County and LA.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks John.
John Burkart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wesley Golladay: Hi, everyone. Looking at the supply next year in Seattle, are you more concerned about the CBD where you don’t have exposure or more of the submarkets such as Bellevue which is going to have an uptick?
Michael Schall: Hi Wes, it’s Mike. Well, I have a chart somewhere that has the breakdown. But I think that we still see more supply in the Downtown. And obviously, our portfolio is largely on the East side and so we think we have a little bit of protection relative to that. Does anyone have that other chart? Because I don’t have the exact breakdown of the supply in Seattle. Yes, so it looks like next year's – the breakdown this year versus next year there is a slight increase in supply in the Downtown that's roughly let say 4,500 units. The East side very similar to this year at somewhere around 2,700 units and to the North and the South, about 1,500 units. So Downtown gets a little bit more and east side and the north and south get a little bit last and overall supply is down a little bit in Seattle.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then looking at your cap rate and that you cited the 4% for the A’s. Is that a nominal or economic?
Michael Schall: Well, that's why I say that it's using Essex definition because I think our definition is a little bit different than the way the market looks at it and let me just summarize because I can't translate it immediately in my head. Our definition of a cap rate is using market rents today in the marketplace today with a market management fee or management cost and marking property taxes to market and assuming a 95% occupancy - financial occupancy rate.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot. 
Michael Schall: Free capital. No CapEx in that number.
Operator: Our next question is from Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hey, good afternoon. Just on the macro comments Mike you made in the prepared remarks about less millennials entering in the workforce, Well, that might be the case are you seeing more millennials kind of fitting or any range maybe closer to where your average tenant is? I seen your average tenants not 22, 23 years old? Any comments on that.
Michael Schall: Well, I think the markets we're talking about the market in general and so we will not necessarily reflect the market because A product versus B product you know you have say you know the millennials are more likely to rent the Bs. However, puts pressure on the pool have moved people around within the pools. So I'm not sure that our actual performance is going to be reflective of exactly this. I think what we're saying but respect to that just to put this into make sense out of it. We're starting to look at demographics as part of the overall supply and demand relationship and I look back and think that I had a relatively easy time over the last 30 years because this business came down to a few factors supply demand the affordability between apartments and for sale housing. And maybe commute patterns and now we have to deal with rent income demographics and maybe regulatory issues. So it's a little bit more complicated, but I'll go back to John. John within our portfolio do we see any notable changes and who our renters are?
John Burkart: No and we - I think it was a surprise people I think people tend to think that that our portfolio is going to be full of millenniums or something that age and we really have the diverse group of people across our portfolio. Some people tend to be renters for the long-term and they're phenomenal people and others kind of come and go and that’s more or less the millennial group.
Drew Babin: Okay. That’s helpful. And John one last question, could you provide loss to lease by region?
John Burkart: Sure. So as we go to SoCal our last release for June was 2.3%, in NorCal 2.8%, in Seattle 7.2% and then as I said in the opening that that brings the average to 3.4%.
Drew Babin: All right. Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Kodesch from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Michael Kodesch: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Actually just a follow-up on Drew’s question there for Seattle. What was that trending at on the loss to lease. What’s that trending that for the past few quarters that elevated from some point to?
Michael Schall: Sure. So if we go back a year-ago, its probably the easiest. If you go back to June 16, it was 9.5% and then if we go to December 16, this is the wild ride so December 16 it goes do it gain to lease of 1.6. So a very big reversal the market is very seasonal and then we come back to May 17 it was 7.4% and now in June 17 as I said it’s 7.2%. So Seattle has a huge level of seasonality in the market it’s our most seasonal market in the Bay Area loss and then SoCal much less.
Michael Kodesch: Great. That’s really helpful. And then most of my questions have been answered, but just kind of one more general one. In terms of move outs are you guys hearing at all any more move out due to moving to single family rentals by any change? And how do you guys kind of factored that into your supply outlook? Do you guys include the single-family rental market in there at all?
Michael Schall: Yes, actually – this is Mike. We do, but indirectly. We do supply and demand as a – look at all housing. So if someone goes from – if someone moves out of their house and rents it out, we track that per se because what we try to – look at the entire housing stock. What’s the net change in the housing stock? What’s that net change in demand represented by job growth and maybe now demographic factors? And how do those two relate to the markets, and so market becoming – is there an excess of demand over supply or not as to the market. In terms of what people actually choose to do, it's a function of again price point affordability et cetera. But again we try to look at supplying demand very much for the whole organization. Actually one of the interesting – I’m going to segue to something else interesting numbers is someone may ask or be concerned about the level of multifamily permits, which remain pretty high in our markets. And so we looked at that recently and we would agree that if you look at trailing 12-month multifamily permit, say they hung in there pretty well. However, if you look at total permits, so part of this is that the single family permitting is way down and therefore if you look at total permits for housing, it's either near or well below all of our markets, near are well below the long-term average and again the long-term after is not a huge number. So the fact that permitting is somewhere near the long-term average and we continue to do a little bit better on the job growth side, should mean that we will continue to have a little bit of a wind to our back as a release of supply and demand. By the way, there are very few single family rentals in the City of Palo Alto, because their cap rate would be like 3% or something like that. So the single family rentals tend to be on the periphery of the Bay Area and where you know the cost for housing is much lower and so that's why we love this place.
Michael Kodesch: Yes, maybe just a little bit more anecdotally, I mean are you hearing about any more – with the single family rental, pool becoming a little bit more institutionalized. So are you hearing more move out as a result of that or heading towards that? Are you see a trend that way?
John Burkart: No, not at all. Again is Mike said that the single families as it related to the institutional ownership, those are really outside our market. They may have literally one house in our Bay Area market type thing in positive. They just don't have penetration in our market there outside and they're going to be Fairfield, there are other market that are considered to be area, but when you map it out, it's not reflective of our locations in our tenant base.
Michael Kodesch: Too probable, that’s all from me. Thanks guys.
John Burkart: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys. How are you?
John Burkart: Doing well.
Michael Schall: Thanks for joining.
Unidentified Analyst: Always on – just wondering about Seattle here, if I look at your June deck, right, you guys were doing 7% in Seattle in April and May, and then you’ve reported 6.6% for the quarter, which kind of tells me that June with a lot weaker around the 5.86% range. Is there something specific that happened in Seattle in June? I know you guys mentioned seasonal, but what's pricing like there today versus earlier in the quarter?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. So yes, June for – Seattle was a 5.5% and that is really again a combination of as I mentioned are occupancy declining. So the occupancy in Seattle declined 90 basis points from where it was at the start of the month. And that is a function of the number of units turned, again Seattle being highly seasonal. So a lot of units turned, and that's a big part of it as well as just pushing rents very hard. But I wouldn't say it's reflective of the market having trouble and as we've said all along, we expect the trajectory of our year-over-year to continue to decline and the third quarter to be our low point. So it was not a surprise to us that the year-over-years continue to decline like this. This is as expected though as we said from the end of last year. But we've since picked up some occupancy in Seattle again as expected as we've planned management and we'll finish up the quarter with solid occupancy looking into the fourth quarter. So that's kind of our management plan there, but that helps?
Unidentified Analyst: Sure. Perfect. That’s all for me.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Conor Wagner: Good afternoon.
Michael Schall: Hey Conor.
Conor Wagner: John, what was new lease growth for July, thus far into July?
John Burkart: Yes. So new lease growth for July is – I don't actually have it directly in front of me, but it’s less year-over-year, it's going to be about say 2.5% versus the 3.6% in June, because we pulled rents down and gained occupancy. I mean overall, we moved rents down in July about 1% and then to 40 basis points or decreased availability by 40 basis points which is huge, so we're sitting now at 95.1%. So where I'm going with that is, we've pulled it down a little bit more than. It's not really reflective of the market. It's more strategic in management. We pulled it down a little bit more and filled up the portfolio and now pushing the numbers back up. So does that help?
Conor Wagner: Okay. Yes, just to be clear. You said 96.1% or is it 96.5% for the quarter you are expecting?
John Burkart: Right now, where we sit, occupancy is 96.4% and our availability is actually 4.9%.
Conor Wagner: Okay, great. Thank you. And then what's the opportunity on the BRE portfolio and continued redevelopment there even just not full scale, but even just kind of lighter CapEx and upgrade and getting that up to speed with the rest of the portfolio. How has that played out this year? And is there any further opportunity there next year?
John Burkart: We don't even separate out the assets like that anymore. I would say across the board in our portfolio, it's like all of us in this room here, every year we get a year older. And so we're on a pretty steady path right now, so if you look at renovation and say if we renovate 5% of our unit that would imply a 20-year life for the, say, kitchen and bath. That’s kind of where we tend to be at and I think that will continue that way and the BRE portfolio is largely getting rolled in or it has been rolled in as it relates to most of those things. But what I mentioned of the call also earlier was we are now taking a little bit more advantage of some of the strategic location and finding some opportunities on expenses in other areas there that are out or opportunities at this point in time.
Conor Wagner: Great. Thank you. The last one, so San Francisco showed a slight acceleration versus last year. I mean it's obviously very small for you guys, but it's big in terms of how it impacts the East Bay. When do you expect – I mean, you said – I think Mike earlier you said that people aren't being drawn back into the city from the East Bay yet, but at what point do you think San Francisco starts to begin to push people back out into Alameda?
Michael Schall: It’s Mike. I think it's happening. This has been an ebb and flow and interesting ebb and flow. When San Francisco has six to eight weeks of concessions, again people start flowing from the East Bay into San Francisco. And then when those concessions abate, it actually goes the other way because people are very price sensitive and let's face it, somewhere between 12% and 16% of annual rents, it's a big incentive. And I think that’s the key to what we're trying to communicate. And so that flow will I think directly relate to the amount of concessions and the overall relationship between Oakland rents and San Francisco rents. So Oakland underperformed last year. It’s doing a little bit better this year. And I would expect that back and forth activity to continue depending upon the concessionary environment.
Conor Wagner: But just again with the direction of San Francisco that as the concession stay low, that should begin to reflect more in your Oakland portfolio in the second half of the year or early next year?
Michael Schall: But that's what I think is happening. Yes, I think people now can afford San Francisco and so they are staying in the East Bay.
Conor Wagner: Thank you very much.
Michael Schall: Thank you. End of Q&A

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. This morning, I will comment on first quarter results, market conditions, regulatory matters and investment activity. Our results for the first quarter were better than expected, as a recovery from a challenging fourth quarter occurred more quickly than we expected, contributing to core FFO growth that was $0.09 per share, above the midpoint of the guidance range. While our sequential revenue growth was modest at 40 basis points, market rents grew 3.1% from year end to the end of the first quarter 2017. While this sounds great, it needs to be evaluated against the challenges we had in Q4 ‘16 where market rents dropped 2% from the end of Q3 to the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Looking at market rent growth from September 2016 to March 2017, Northern California was the strongest part of our portfolio, followed by Seattle. The results for the quarter do not significantly change our expectations for the remainder of the year and are consistent with our thesis that rental growth rates will approximate long term averages in the West Coast metro areas. Angela will discuss the projections in a moment. Our operations team did a good job of identifying opportunities to make incremental improvements in a variety of areas, saving money and generating additional income, which added a few cents of the core FFO even with wage pressures, weather related challenges and significant utility cost increases in California. I greatly appreciate the skill and effort of our operations team and thank them for their effort. An important part of our expectations are that tight labor markets in California will push incomes higher, providing some relief to affordability issues. For the Essex markets, 2017 personal incomes are expected to grow an average of 5%, led by San Francisco at 6.2% and compared to the US average of 3.9%. Further, over the past year, the ratio of rent to income declined in both San Francisco and San Jose, two areas most affected by the affordability issue. Median home prices are generally growing faster than rents, averaging 7.2% for California versus 5.2% for the nation over the past year and four of the seven Essex markets outperformed California median increase in home prices. My next topic, an update on regulatory matters. State and local governments in California have proposed legislation that potentially impacts apartment owners, which I'll briefly summarize.  First, the State of California recently dropped a bill that would have repealed the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which generally limits the scope of rent control ordinances enacted by cities. Even though rent growth in Northern California has decelerated, tenant rights groups that are well organized and well-funded continue to advocate for rent control and related issues in cities and at the state level, demonstrated recently by a new rent control ordinance in the Northern California City of Pacifica.  As noted in previous calls, rent control has a variety of unintended consequences, which include prolonging and intensifying the shortage of housing by reducing turnover and thus availability of the purpose for those seeking rental housing. Bottom line, we expect rent control advocacy to continue in California, while industry organizations highlight the unintended consequences of rent control in an effort to defeat or soften any proposed legislation. A second bill in California would require apartment owners to use licensed inspectors to certify the structural integrity of balconies and decks more than six feet above ground level every five years. While the requirements for these inspections as outlined in the bill may still change, it would add operating cost pressures for apartment owners. At the federal level, we're watching two topics closely. The first is the impact of tax reform on REITs. Unfortunately, the path ahead is unknowable and therefore any comments would be speculative, given the lack of details and therefore, we will wait for greater clarity. Second, we're tracking the ongoing discussion about reforming the H1B Visa Program. This is an important issue for Essex, because the top ten tech companies have close to 22,000 open positions in California and Washington and these open positions have steadily increased in the past year. In addition, the national unemployment rate for college graduates hovers around 2.5%, which suggests a critical shortage of skilled labor, both generally and within the technology industries.  Earlier this year, there was widespread concern that the new administration was going to dramatically change or eliminate the H1B program. More recently, the focus of the discussion has been to address specific issues and alleged abuses in regards to the program. A recent executive order directs various agencies to recommend changes to the program. One discussed change would be to replace existing lottery system with a process that prioritizes higher income jobs like those typically provided by tech companies.  As to H1B extension applications, we have heard anecdotal stories about delays or shortened renewal period, although we could not find data to support this. Bottom line, some of the proposals being discussed should help the high tech sector and reduce the reliance on intermediaries that arranged H1B visas and so we're optimistic about the changes being discussed. The next topic is investments. As noted in the press release, we've been active in the transaction markets, as we continue with a self-funding model that does not rely on stock issuance or increase indebtedness. These transactions support our view that multi-family cap rates have not changed significantly. We completed a second preferred equity conversion transaction in which we acquired a common ownership position in Sage apartments. We will continue to look for opportunities to convert preferred equity investments into common ownership positions, while also pursuing the buyout of co-investment entities with promoted interests.  In our preferred equity program, which also includes a few subordinated loans, our outstanding investments declined about 10 million in the quarter, related to the conversion of the investment in Sage apartments and stood at nearly 240 million at March 31. Generally, we're seeing more demand for this capital, as banks continue with conservative lending standards for construction loans and with construction costs increasing faster than property net operating income.  These forces create the need for more equity, which we are willing to provide if our standards are met. At this point, I believe that we will achieve our $100 million target for preferred equity and subordinated debt in 2017. It's important to note that many apartment development deals don't have sufficiently high yields to support an expensive preferred equity component and therefore apartment development projects are often being delayed. As noted last quarter, we continue to see headwinds to do development deals and believe that the trend for apartment supply is downward in 2018. Cap rates remained stable during the quarter with A quality property and locations trading around a 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology and from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay subs for cap rates. B quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A quality property. With the REITs mostly on the sideline, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. Now, I’ll turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. I also want to thank the E team for another great quarter. Their hard work and persistent focus on our corporate objective has helped us produce year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 5% and NOI growth of 5.6%. Although our quarterly revenue growth was 5% over the prior year’s quarter, our scheduled rent growth was 4.3% in January over the prior year’s month and decreased to 3.9% in March over the prior year’s month as we expected.  The difference was due to 50 basis points of increased occupancy over the prior year’s quarter as well as increases in other income and utility reimbursements. Some of the income was related to one-time items such as increased cancellation fees and collection of delinquent utility reimbursement and the rest was related to sustainable increases in various categories, as we continue to focus on the nickels and dimes of the business. We expect the year-over-year earnings comparison to continue to decline through the third quarter due to tougher comps as well as the supply entering the marketplace, moderating the seasonal increase in rents.  Although we plan to continue to emphasize occupancy based on the current market conditions, the impact from occupancy on year-over-year revenue growth will be zero in the third quarter since it was the third quarter of 2016 that we had modified our strategy and achieved higher occupancy. The gain to lease of 50 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter, meaning that market rents were below the average rent in the portfolio at that time, led to the relatively low sequential growth of 40 basis points for the portfolio in the first quarter.  The good news is that although the market was weaker than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016, it came back stronger than expected in the first quarter of 2017. Currently, we have a loss to lease of 1.8%, a 230 basis point increase from the 50 basis points gain to lease in December of 2016. We are cautiously optimistic about the market and our performance in 2017. Turning to expenses, we continue to see wage pressure, driven by both the increases in minimum wage in both California and Washington and the tight labor market on the West Coast. The minimum wage will increase at an average rate of between 7% and 9% for the next few years. Our administrative and maintenance staff costs were up about 5% year-over-year. Additionally, utilities were up 7% over the prior year’s quarter as we had anticipated. The increase in utilities is driven by increases in gas, water and trash collection.  Many of our utility companies have pushed through significant increases. For example, PG&E, our Northern California gas and electric provider increased gas rate over 15% to create funds aimed at improving infrastructure as well as the need to meet certain global warming regulations by buying renewable energy at higher rates than other options. We have several workflows related to reducing administrative, maintenance and utility expenses and we expect to continue to make incremental progress in controlling expenses. Finally, our unit renovations slowed down significantly in the first quarter from 917 in the prior year’s quarter down to 594 in the first quarter of 2017, because of both rental market conditions and labor shortages. Now, I’ll provide an update on our markets. The Seattle MD’s expansion continues, as job growth remains healthy at 3.1% for the first quarter of 2017 over the prior year’s quarter. This marks the eighth quarter in a row of 3% job growth or higher and has helped keep the unemployment rate at a low at an estimated 3.2%.  Boeing plans to reduce its Puget Sound area manufacturing workforce by more than 1800 people in 2017, however that is not expected to have a material impact, considering the strength of the economy. There were roughly 9600 Amazon job openings in Washington as of the first quarter of 2017, a 28% increase compared to the same period last year.  The high quality of life and sustained economic growth has managed to bolster net migration by adding roughly 50,000 people in 2016, while elevated supply continues to be a constant threat throughout the MD, 48% is focused in the CBD. Fortunately, approximately 83% of the Essex portfolio is located outside the Seattle CBD market in the east, north and south markets. Office absorption was 2% with 5.7 million square feet under construction, 47% of which is pre-leased. Our same-store Seattle revenues grew 7.9% year-over-year with the CBD at 7.5% and the remaining east, north and south submarkets achieving between 7.7% and 9.7% revenue growth. In Northern California, the Bay Area averaged 2.3% year-over-year job growth in the first quarter, outpaced in the US by 70 basis points with roughly 77000 jobs added over the prior year’s quarter. San Francisco led the way, posting year-over-year job growth of 2.6%, while San Jose and Oakland were up 2.1% and 2.5% respectively. The Bay Area’s VC funding in the first quarter totaled 4.1 billion, up nearly 1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016 and about equal to the first quarter of 2016. Office absorption in the Bay Area was relatively flat in the first quarter, however the market has absorbed over 3 million square feet or 1.4% of total office space over the last 12 months. In San Francisco, Google leased another 166,000 square feet, expanding their footprint in the city to nearly 900,000 square feet. Across the Bay and Fremont, ramp up for the new model three continues with Tesla expected to increase employment at its plant by 50%.  Finally, in Silicon Valley, Amazon continues its expansion, announcing leases for more than 560,000 square feet at two newly constructed locations. During the quarter, the under construction pipeline grew more than 1.2 million square feet, totaling 16 million square feet of active construction projects, of which 43% is pre-leased. In March, Google received approval for their new 600,000 square foot Charleston east campus in Mountain View, which should break ground later this year. Moving down to Southern California, in Los Angeles, the first quarter job growth was 1.7% year-over-year, in line with the US at 1.6%. Even with the slower job growth, the MSA achieved 3.6% revenue growth year-over-year in the quarter with the tri cities at the top growing 5.4%, the LA CBD performing consistent with the MSA, growth revenues at 3.6% and the west LA sub market at the bottom with 3% revenue growth over the prior year’s quarter.  The growth of online television in recent years has spurred the wave of large real estate deals in recent quarters from tech companies, such as Netflix and Amazon. In fact, the entertainment energy now occupies roughly 25.5 million square feet in Los Angeles County, up nearly 3 million square feet from five years ago. Netflix, which will produce around 6 billion worth of original content this year recently committed to increasing its production infrastructure in California, rather than chasing filming tax credit in other states.  Orange County’s job growth came in below our expectation at 1.2% year-over-year for the first quarter compared to our estimate of 2.3% for the year. We will be monitoring this market closely, especially considering the level of supply anticipated in 2017. Our north and South Orange submarkets achieved 6% and 4.8% revenue growth year-over-year respectively.  Last but not least, in San Diego, job growth was strong at 2% for the first quarter over the comparable quarter. The north city submarket where we have over 70% of our San Diego portfolio achieved revenue growth of 5.8% over the prior year's quarter. San Diego is about to roll out the largest city based Internet of Things platform in the world.  The city is partnering with GE to upgrade 1400 traffic lights to LED and integrate the traffic light system into a connected digital network. Deployment of 3200 smart sensors will enable the network to optimize parking and traffic, enhance public safety and track air quality. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.6% occupied and our availability 30 days out is at 4.5%. With a loss to lease of 1.8%, we are positioned well for the leasing season. Thank you and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I’ll start with a review of our first quarter results, then discuss guidance revision and conclude with an update on capital markets activity and the balance sheet. For the quarter, our core FFO exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09 per share. The components of the outperformance are outlined in our press release on page 4. Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.75 per share, which is a 9.4% year-over-year increase and represents 23 years of consecutive dividend growth. Moving on to the full year guidance, we are raising same property revenue growth guidance by 25 basis point to 3.5% at the midpoint. The increase is attributed to favorable first quarter results and an increase in projected other income for the rest of the year.  While we are raising our growth outlook for the year, we still expect our revenue growth to decelerate from 5% reported in the first quarter to around 2% by the third quarter. As previously noted, we expected a more difficult second half of the year, largely due to a tough year-over-year occupancy comp and a lower level of [indiscernible]. In conjunction with the same property growth increase, we're raising core FFO guidance by $0.08 per share to $11.76 at the midpoint. This guidance increase primarily reflects the revised revenue growth outlook, partially offset by the timing of expenses. Overall, we are now projecting core FFO to grow at 6.5% for the full year, which is 70 basis points increase compared to our initial guidance. As for the second quarter, we are forecasting core FFO to be $2.87 at the midpoint, which is $0.07 lower than the first quarter results. There are three key factors, contributing to this outcome. First, we benefit from a one-time commercial lease termination fee in the first quarter. This is a $0.02 impact. Second, we expect higher interest expense in the second quarter due to capital markets activities. This is a $0.03 impact. As you may recall, in March, we repaid a $300 million bond with a cash rate of 5.5% and an effective rate of 1.8%. In April, we issued a $350 million bond at a rate of 3.625. This bond offering was consistent with our original guidance provided last quarter and do not impact our full year core FFO projection. Third is the timing of expenses.  Our guidance assumes expense growth will be around 4.5% in the second quarter. Nonetheless, for the full year, we still expect our operating expenses to be consistent with our original guidance range of 3% at the midpoint. With the April bond offering, we have substantially completed our debt refinancing for the year. Our remaining maturities in 2017 total [indiscernible].  Our remaining maturities in 2017 totals only about 100 million, which has been mostly funded by April bond offering. At the end of the quarter, our net debt to EBITDA was 5.7 times, which is a reduction from 5.9 times at year end and consistent with our expectations that this ratio would trend down from growth in EBITDA. With full availability on our billion dollar line of credit and a like maturity schedule, our balance sheet remains strong. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just want to start on the preferred equity deal. So what’s the opportunity to grow that book today and how large could that book eventually be?
Michael Schall: Hi, Nick. It’s Mike Schall here. I think it could be a lot larger than we want it to be and so we're seeing a lot of demand for that product and again, for the reason that I cited in our script. So I think that our limitation is sort of a self-imposed limitation. We're trying to pick the best deals out of the group and the ones that both underwrite the best and are most consistent in terms of higher quality locations and properties. And so the main reason for that is because, the term of these deals is somewhere in the three to four year range and they have a high coupon somewhere between 10% and 12% typically on them.  And so when that reverses, if we can't replace them, then we have an FFO decline issue. And so we're trying to be very thoughtful about how we execute that business. We think it's a great opportunity in the marketplace today and we want to take advantage of it. We just want to do it within boundaries. So I think a long time ago, we talked about somewhere around a 5% cap relative to the total market capitalization of the company and we're well under that and we expect to remain well under that.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then appreciate the uncertainty around immigration in H1B visas, but just curious if you've seen any change in traffic of non-US residents in any of your properties or across the portfolio?
John Burkart: Yeah. Nick, this is John. The answer is no. I can't say that we've perfectly tracked that, but we really haven't had any anecdotal or other information indicating any changes in traffic. I mean, frankly traffic overall is about the same as it was last year and specific traffic as it relates to any particular person.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just want to touch on guidance really quickly. You still talked about there being heavy supply in the first half of the year and we've seen job growth moderate a bit across some of your markets. So I guess just what gave you the confidence to raise the same store this early in the season or before entering the peak leasing season or with the higher earn in I guess, do you have some conservatism baked in now through the rest of the year?
Michael Schall: Hi, Austin. It’s Mike Schall. Let me start with this and then maybe Angela will want to follow up. I think as we entered this year, we realized that there was a greater range of outcomes that were potential this year, really driven by the lack of loss to lease. At December 31, we had a negative loss to lease, meaning that market rents were below scheduled rent in our portfolio -- scheduled rent is 90 something percent of our revenue. And so because of that, we had some uncertainty there. We also had uncertainty with respect to how the lease ups, the timing of the lease ups and how aggressive the owners of the lease up properties within the marketplace were going to be with respect to concessions.  So those two factors gave us less certainty about this year in terms of projection just in general. And then rolling that out, we noted on the last quarter call that because of a negative loss to lease, we would be building loss to lease this year and obviously, if you're building a loss to lease, you're not going through, the reported results are going into the loss to lease for the portfolio, which has increased pretty substantially as noted on the call. So those were the dynamics behind what was happening with respect to projections. In terms of how the numbers roll out, Angela, do you want to address that?
Angela Kleiman: Sure. Thanks. And so the way the numbers were allowed is that the rent growth midpoint of 25 basis points raised essentially reflects the first quarter achieved results and we added to that other income that we are expecting, which John Burkart alluded to earlier about focusing on the nickels and dimes of our business. So it's primarily driven by those two components and that flows through FFO. And then the additional couple of pennies on the FFO side relates to our preferred business and other small items. So that’s why we're comfortable with our guidance range.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the detail there. And then just the one follow-up, that is, I guess what would you need to see or what would get you more comfortable with increasing the unit renovation.
John Burkart: Yeah. This is John. I’ll take that. As I mentioned, there is really kind of two things that were slowing us down a little bit there. One related to the market and the other related to labor shortages. We're seeing some challenges getting the contractors there and that’s had an issue, so that would have to get resolved and that’s not as easy as it sounds. And then of course, the markets are getting stronger, the markets -- I’ll speak by the markets for a moment, they’re really functionally now consistent with our seasonal expectations.  At the same time, the first quarter is just the beginning. We’re yet to really get into the second quarter until you really see how they’re moving, but what we're seeing with the marketplace is as is what we expected, it’s generally good and we are planning to increase renovations as much as we can, but again we still have some levels of limitations due to some labor shortages.
Austin Wurschmidt: In the increases above what you would have anticipated I guess on the fourth quarter call?
John Burkart: No. We're in line with our overall plan. We were a little bit behind in the first quarter from what we had anticipated and will be in line overall for the year or just slightly below that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Gaurav Mehta: Great. Thanks. So in your press release you mentioned that Northern California saw lower apartment supply deliveries and I think on the last call, you mentioned that bulk of supply in Northern California is expected in first half of 2017. So I was wondering when you say lower apartment deliveries, is that compared to your expectations going into the year or compared with last year?
Michael Schall: This is Mike and maybe John will want to follow up with this. In general, we said that supply is declining in Northern California and we think that that's going to continue into and through 2018. In fact, from ’17 to ’18, we're forecasting about a 36% reduction in supply, ’18 over ’17. And within ’17, it drops off quarter-to-quarter. The first half remains pretty strong and then the supply should drop off in the second half of the year, although I think there's been some leakage in terms of pushing back some of our expected first and second quarter deliveries in Northern California maybe into the third quarter and beyond.  So those are the dynamics there. So again, as I mentioned earlier, the ability to figure out exactly what's going to deliver and how those owners are going to price concessions, we've seen some increase in concessions in Q2. It's one of the variables, one of the difficulties in trying to estimate what's going to happen. But the statement that you made, we agree with basically that Northern California supply is being reduced, we expect in ’18, it will be relatively flat in Southern California and declined about 13% in Seattle.
John Burkart: And this is John. I would just add. We get out into the field and we look at where things are at and we do full scale about twice a year. And then, we spot check and when we went out and spot checked earlier this -- in the first quarter, we found that several of the assets that we thought were going to get delivered were not and I'm guessing they're facing the same issues we're facing on the rental side is shortage of labor for finishing skills employees. And so I think really the whole industry is feeling that pressure.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And as a follow-up, I think in your remarks, you mentioned opportunity to convert from preferred equity investments to the owning those assets. I was wondering when you are evaluating the preferred equity investments, are you underwriting them the same way as you would for your wholly-owned acquisition platform.
John Burkart: In general, yes. I mean, this would be a supplemental source of potential acquisitions and investments. It would not be something that we're trying to give a preference to one of the -- owners of one of these preferred equity deals. So, no, it’s strictly an acquisition strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Good morning. Just hoping to follow up on Gaurav’s supply question. Could you be a little bit more specific in terms of the individual markets within Northern California that are contributing to that 30 plus percent year over-year-decline, ’18 versus ’17 that you’re expecting?
Michael Schall: Sure. This is Mike once again, Juan. About 50% in San Francisco, which goes down the peninsula in San Bernardino County. About 25% in Oakland and 26% in San Jose. So we have roughly -- so this year in San Jose, these are obviously multifamily supplies. 3200 units goes to 2400 units approximately in San Jose. So again, we see widespread decline in Northern California, less so in Southern California and a little bit in Seattle next year 2018.
Juan Sanabria: And are you concerned at all because I mean you obviously are talking about some slippage due to labor that that massive decline year-over-year won't materialize in kind of may cause 2017 to play out more differently than you’d expected in your fiscal year guidance?
Michael Schall: Well, generically, Juan, I’d say, we’re obviously concerned. So this is a business where you're constantly humble, because what you think is going to happen doesn't always happen, but this is a discipline of trying to understand the market and understand what's happening, what the dynamics are, what the forces are, so that we can get the capital allocation of the portfolio right.  So I suspect that we won't be 100% right about these, about the projection for 2018, but I also will suggest it will be more right than wrong and this is the information that gives us a little bit better knowledge and strategic advantage in terms of making good investment decisions and capital allocation.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And just one quick follow-up on the lease term fee at commercial, could you just give us a little bit more color on a quantum dollar wise and where that was booked?
Michael Schall: Well, I'll go back to what it was and I’ll let Angela walk through where it was booked and that, but this relates to an asset we bought and had a space that was -- had a paying tenant, yes, the space was actually vacant and so we worked to negotiate a closure to that situation so we can renovate that center and we're rather excited about that.  As far as where it was booked in the financials, I’ll let Angela.
Angela Kleiman: Oh, sure. Yeah. And so in terms of the dollar amount, it was about 1.2 million and it’s booked in other income on same-store.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Malkin: Hey, all. Thanks for taking my questions. As far as I noticed on the development page, looks like land ticked up about $30 million. Am I reading that correctly and if so, can you tell me what that's related to?
Michael Schall: Mr. Eudy is here. I hope he’s had his outline.
John Eudy: Sure. It's the Hollywood deal that I think you may be aware of that we put into pre-development if you will, all these things were achieved in the end of the fourth quarter and we will be starting, we get the demo, move the tenant out, and break it in December and we’ll be starting construction we expect late Q2, early Q3.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Great. And then just circling back to the preferred, can you give us a sense of, I know you have a good amount of those, but one of those going to be maturing, for example, five more are going to be maturing this year and compared to maybe last year or in ’18 and then are you seeing or do you anticipate most of those converting into common, because your partner has way less liquidity than you do, so they’re probably unable to pay you back on that.
Michael Schall: Hi. This is Mike. We have no contractual right to convert anything. So just to make that clear, however, we have exceeded the table with respect to the outcome on some of the preferred equity deals and therefore it's just good. It gives us another bite of the apple let’s say. And so from that perspective, I think it works well in terms of the maturity schedule I think what as we've ramped up the business we don't have that many maturities we did we had one other conversion earlier this year and then I think we also had we have another we've actually had several maturities that have come through so what you're seeing and building from I think it was about 100 million last year to 100 to 150 million last year to 250 million, you see in a net booking of transactions relative to repayments, I think the repayments will start hitting a little bit more substantially a year or two from now but I don't think it's going to affect the next year in any material way.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: A quick question for Angela on the debt maturity, I have a little over 300 million of secured debt maturing in ’18 with weighted average rate of 53. I was hoping you could comment on what’s the effective rate on that is and whether there's an arbitrage opportunity to potentially prepay that at point this year.
Angela Kleiman: The effective rate was shown here, it’s 53.
Drew Babin: So there is a possible average rate?
Angela Kleiman: Yeah there should be right at this point. And as far as the general planning it that we would prefer to refinance our secured debt with unsecured debt. In our ten year maturity and continue with laddering our maturity.
Drew Babin: So point the season’s costs become economical?
Angela Kleiman: With secured debt, the prepayment penalty is pretty severe and so you know unless it's built into the agreement itself. And some tends to be more prepay, pay six months in advance but there are quite difference but we won’t incur those kind of cost because it just doesn't make enough economic sense at this point.
Drew Babin: So it sounds like there is no impact from anything dealing those maturities in this year’s guidance.
Angela Kleiman: We're not planning for that. And then a question on your operation front, you mentioned rents, I believe it was San Francisco but correct me if I’m wrong, rebounded 3.1% during the first quarter after being down in the fourth quarter. So that you could break that down, was that San Francisco specific and what do those kind of swings in rent growth look like in some of the other sub markets around the bay area. Is kind of the stabilization that happening from inside out, does San Francisco kind of snapping back but other markets maybe not rebounding or how to quantify that.
John Burkart: Yeah this is John, if you want to me to give, let me kind of a broad answer here. So what we're seeing is generally good action in the Bay Area consistent actually the whole portfolio is consistent with historical seasonality. We're seeing a little bit more strength in areas like San Jose, San Francisco that were hit hardest and in a couple of areas like for example in the East Bay where people had moved from the higher priced zones of the San Francisco and San Jose they moved into those areas and probably due to affordability we're seeing a reversal of that which would make sense.  So the East Bay is struggling a little bit related to people moving back to San Francisco, San Jose is what the belief is. As it relates to Seattle, we're seeing again strength there. And in LA, a little bit less. LA is a little bit flatter but still five, LA being all so [indiscernible] LA itself is a little flatter, San Diego stronger but Orange County is fine and that’s kind of overview. Does that answer your question?
Michael Schall: Hey Drew, just one comment. The 3.1% was the portfolio average so northern California looking at economic rent growth for the quarter for December 31 of March 31 was 3.8%.
Drew Babin: Okay I appreciate the clarification. Just one more on the Bay Area, you talked about some supply potentially getting delayed away from the first half of the year this year into the second half. Anyway to quantify kind of what percentage of your overall deliveries you expect in ’17 that’s already delivered versus what's become [indiscernible].
Michael Schall: Yeah. This is Mike, we do have it by quarter. And again these change from quarter to quarter because we go out and drive the properties John said and try to gauge when and when they're going to deliver. So in Northern California we have Q1 deliveries for ’17 at 35% dropping to 29% in Q2, 20% Q3 and 16% Q4. And the biggest deliveries were in Santa Jose so far this year according to the schedule.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Pehl from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Pehl: Just sticking with the Bay Area on concessions you mentioned earlier in the call you taught an uptick in Q2, just wondering if you can give a little more color on that which sub markets you're seeing the uptick in?
Michael Schall: Sure this is Mike. Concessions, I say in general are up maybe two weeks from Q1 to Q2 so far, San Francisco actually the typical confession is still 4 to 8 weeks that applies to San Francisco downtown San Jose. There are some areas that are closer to two months free, Dublin Pleasanton for example and Sunnyvale which has just a bunch of active lease-ups underway right now.  So, and the [indiscernible] is a little bit less than that so the San Francisco peninsula has got better, it's about one month free. But again this is a fluid process and they can decline or increase over time almost and they’re constantly changing and we do the same thing on our lease ups as well. We're pricing the smaller units different from the bigger units based on supply and demand for each unit type. And so the concession numbers are a fluid process and they will continue to change throughout the year.
Jeffrey Pehl: And then just on the portfolio generally, I was just wondering if you can give an update on move outs to purchase a home?
Michael Schall: Sure. Yes, move outs to purchase the home roughly because this is a long term average about 10% right now. But materially the same as it's been for a long time, no surprises there.
John Burkart: And actually I'll make one other comment and that is partially because supply of for sale housing is still muted in the West Coast. So we're not building a lot of for sale homes and therefore the ability to transition from an apartment to a home is more challenging out here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Dennis McGill: Firstly just on LA. You toched on the market a little bit throughout but looking at the revision you made just to the market wide stats hoping you could maybe elaborate a little bit on whether that was heavier supply or demand component contract in that down a little bit.
Michael Schall: This is Mike, maybe John will want to throw in a comment here. I think part of it is the concessionary nature of different parts of Southern California obviously Southern California is a big place. But we saw a pretty big ramp up in supply in Orange County for example this year and the continuation of supply in downtown LA. So six to eight weeks typically downtown LA, so you know I think it's more of the same but dealing with supply relative to the amount of job growth obviously the southern California area doesn't produce the same amount of jobs that northern California and Seattle have and I think that that is probably the key difference between the two at this point in time because stronger job growth more demand in the tech markets relative to Southern California.
Dennis McGill: And then sorry to add on to the regulatory theme from earlier too, but one thing you didn't mention was AB 199, and I'm not sure if it necessarily impacts you but something we’ve monitored from the homebuilder side, but it sounds like it's more just related to redevelopment now and I'm sure if that has any impact on your redevelopment business out there..
Michael Schall: Yeah actually, I had AB 199 in my script yesterday afternoon. So we decided to drop it, John Eudy is here, he does a lot of this political stuff for us. And our belief is that AB 199 is not likely to survive. This would impose a prevailing wage requirement for any new construction that has agreement with the city and would probably end up further restricting the amount of supply that gets built both for sale and rental. So that is that proposal or that law so we didn't mention it because we thought that was likely not to survive.
Dennis McGill: And the chance it does, is there any impact on the redevelopment side or as you understand strictly new construction?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy, I’ll further add on to what Mike said. Basically we believe it's going to affect only those developers to get public funds and/or come through the successor agencies and redevelopment agencies, the way it's been modified. So in both cases it would not affect us.
Michael Schall: And that would be, that’s the system we’re with now, right. So that’s effectively no change. I believe the way it’s going to be if it gets passed as it will clarify what already is the case.
Dennis McGill: And if I could just squeeze a quick question on property taxes the 1% or so rate in the first quarter, how are you, what’s embedded in the guidance for the full-year for property tax increases.
Angela Kleiman: We are guiding around 4% for the year. In Q1 we had some refunds which benefited Q1. However we still have not gotten property tax on Seattle and that tends to be the wildcard.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: So just two questions here. First Mike, you've mentioned that you guys were seeing a lot of opportunity on the mezz finance side. But just curious, as far as it relates to investing and development, my understanding is with the new tighter bank regulation, the developer has to come up with that 35% percent of equity being all equity they can't use prefer or anything of that sort of debt yielding. So are you guys not doing development or are the banks not as strict as of course what the regulators have laid out.
Michael Schall: Well, Mr. Eudy is here and he loves to talk about development work. We're active but we're not as active as we could be primarily because we don't see a lot of development deals that generate the types of yields we need to achieve to take the risk of that business. So that is been a choice. But having said that we will always be active in development and we have enough deals over the next couple of years that are you know the next phase of several transactions that are underway now. The Hollywood deal et cetera that we're not going to be completely out of the development world at all.  Having said that, as we look at new deals and again keep in mind what's happened here, you have construction costs growing much faster than property NOIs and obviously that causes cap rates to compress measured today. So if you have compressing cap rates. We haven't changed our objectives or goals with respect to development. We're still in the 5% to 5.5% unleveraged yields or cap rates measured today not with trended rents measured today, because we're competing against an acquisition measured today. And we're just not seeing a lot of those deals that that cross that threshold. So I think Mr. Eudy job is…
Alexander Goldfarb: Mike, I was actually talking when you guys are doing the mezz like investing in another’s people deals, not your own accounts but when you’re doing like preferred equity investments.
Michael Schall: I’m getting to that Alex. The mezz deals, we have relationships with some lenders, and so I don’t think that‘s entirely right with the respect to the mezz deals and the yield on the preferred although the yield on preferred is generally doesn't apply to the construction period anyway. So I think that’s probably the key there. It's accrued.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay that's helpful and I'm sorry about that. The second in question is, on the guidance you guys did five sticks of NOI in the first quarter but the range is 28 to 46. So is it more year-over-year comp related than the back half adjusted customer or is that that as you're cautious just given you know you want to see how the summer goes and if the supply continues to pull back and the concessions hopefully start to maybe lessen over the year that you're just not sure how the summer is going to go and therefore that's why the range is where it is versus how you got did the first quarter.
Michael Schall: Alex, this is Mike. Again, it goes back to that theme that we're talking about before which is we have to build -- we're building loss-to-lease, at San Francisco of $100 today. We don't actually see that hit the bottom line until we turn a unit or turn a lease. And so there's a building lost to lease which means the scheduled brand which is really driving the income statement is declining still. So just to give you some numbers there, January scheduled rent was up 4.3%, by March it was 3.9% and preliminarily in April it was 3.7%. So that trend of declining scheduled grants and building loss to lease is going to continue throughout the year until about Q3 where it turns around.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah and Alex, that is why we view that, we’re going from a 5% revenue growth down to 2% in the third quarter. What that means is, in the second quarter we think that revenue will come in that low the mid 2 range.
John Burkart: Alex, this is John, I’m going to add one more piece here, just so we get the context. As Mike said we went from 4.3 to 3.7 year-over-year in April on scheduled rents and we already said that the loss to lease was 1.8% or 180 basis points in March. In April it went up to 260 basis points or 2.6% in April. So the market's doing as we expected it's moving up but because of this delay our schedule rent continues to go down again as expected. So this is all, according to plan things are good but it's just the way the numbers roll out. And then I mentioned before the occupancy adjustment that will be a net neutral in the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: I guess my question really is when I think about what you're seeing fundamentally in 4Q versus 1Q there's been a big thing in the Northern California market and things keep swinging around all the time. Could you just talk a little bit but kind of fundamentally what you kind of doing week in week out to kind of make sure your fully capturing the kind of crazy inflection point. Again you know you guys are doing you know you're meeting a budget and things of that like have you kind of think anything procedurally to kind of just make sure that all this volatility you don't kind of get caught on the wrong side of it.
Michael Schall: Tayo, I’ve been in this business a long time and honestly there's not a whole lot you can do on a week to week basis. Certainly with respect to you can monitor the lease ups and you can react based on what they're doing now and again we do the same thing we have our own leaseups that are in the marketplace right now and we have a weekly pricing calls and we try to monitor everyone's - what everyone is doing in the marketplace so that we're not out of step with respect everyone else. But you know that's about as much as we can do this business is really driven by the long term trends both with respect to demand and supply.  And so we try to make good decisions as to those longer term trends and then just execute well when we're on the ground you know the decision a year ago for example in the third quarter last year to build occupancy by 50 basis points was a strategic decision because we thought okay, if we're not going to have rent growth let’s try to build occupancy and play a little bit of an occupancy game and I think we did that pretty well. So with that said, John, do you have any additional comments?
John Burkart: Yeah I would just add, I mean clearly in the big picture, it’s the supply demand game as Mike said. But on a daily basis our people are working extremely hard, they're trying to understand the market obviously that it is, they just need to understand it and react properly to it. And so we have great communication amongst teams, making decisions. The team is in power to make decisions, we don't make them from corporate. They're empowered to make the good decisions and the communication is often and that's what enabling us to thrive in that pretty challenging market and it does as you point out, change pretty significantly week to week, months to months, but they're doing an awesome job.
Tayo Okusanya: Again, could you just talk a little bit about fundamentally what you're seeing in regard to how the Class A versus Class B assets that’s performing within your market.
John Burkart: Sure. Interestingly as the market came back, we are seeing better activity higher growth in some of the Class-A assets for certain and will again watch cautiously watch how the supply enters the market in the competition comes because they'll be the first to feel more significant impact. But as we came back in the first quarter the As did a little bit better than the Bs overall, really across the marekt.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Conor Wagner: John I apologize if I missed this earlier did you give new lease growth in renewals for 1Q and then where things are trending thus far into 2Q?
John Burkart: I didn’t and I’m on glad to give you some of that impute. So new lease growth for Q1 in total was roughly 2.4% and pretty consistent in the different markets across SoCal. As we get to NorCal it was actually negative new lease and that does gets part of our numbers all kind of tied together, it was, we were negative about 1.6% and then as we get to Seattle we were again positive about 2.5%. on the renewal side for Q1, SoCal was about 4.5%, the Bay Area was about 2% and Seattle was a little bit closer to 5%. And going forward very, very preliminary input numbers, NorCal has now switched to positive. So we've moved from negative to positive again, we're moving up as Mike as mentioned and so NorCal is a little bit over 1% up year-over-year and Seattle's is over 5%, it’s taken off. SoCal is fairly flat, it is around 2.5 still on new leases, but the movement is going all in the right direction. Does that answer the question what you're looking for?
Conor Wagner: Yeah. Maybe give me a further portfolio as a whole in 1Q and then as a whole for renewals thus far?
Michael Schall: Sure. As a whole, around 90 basis points in 1Q for new and about 3.5% for renewals and looking out, I guess, the last piece for you, looking out the renewals we’re sending out, overall, are about 4.5%. Moving us incrementally for each of the different terms.
Conor Wagner: Okay. And then you will have some bleed off of that, the 4.5?
Michael Schall: Yeah. It’s interesting. It depends because in some cases, sure, people want to negotiate, but oftentimes what happens with renewals is you send them out and we’re typically quoting a 12 month lease when I give you that. We're obviously offering all different types of lease terms. It's not uncommon for people to choose a shorter lease term and pay a premium. And so it really is -- it will vary. Sometimes, we’ll actually do better than that because more people chose the shorter term instead of a 12-month terms if that makes sense.
Conor Wagner: Okay. And then on the other income items, it looks like in the same-store portfolio, that grew around 10% or 11%, the non-rent items and you highlighted some of those, just want to make sure I understand what’s going on there and the extent that that is going to persist throughout the year, you mentioned utility reimbursement and some break fees, is there anything else there that we need to understand and then just so I get it correctly on the utility reimbursement, does that have a matching item on the expense line where your expenses should be higher, but then it gets washed out.
Michael Schall: Yes. Big picture for sure. I think Angela's covered the adjustments in the updated guidance. Again, some of the utility was really related to one-time items, collecting some past delinquencies. As we mentioned last quarter, we pushed very hard and we continue to push and all the nickels and dimes and so some of that just carried over into the first quarter. So that's what some of that was. The lease breaks, those really are one-time items and they've actually started to trend down as we would expect. And so that one-time, there are a few additional ongoing items and that's what Angela has picked up in the guidance.
Angela Kleiman: Brian, kind of just to add on the expense side, the 7% increase in utility expense, that is what we actually expected. So it’s built into our guidance. That was not a surprise to us.
Conor Wagner: Okay. But the level of reimbursement, right, but I mean just, as we think about it right, like if there was a surprise on utility expenses, you're getting paid back to that by your resident. So this is more of the catch up as John mentioned?
Michael Schall: Yeah. It was a catch-up and again going forward, yeah, it is you roughly 60% to 70% of utilities get reimbursed. So if there was a negative increase on utilities that was unexpected, we're going to collect roughly two-thirds of that coming back.
Conor Wagner: Okay. And then as we’re thinking about the same-store growth just going forward, should we expect that non rent component to grow closer to the overall level of Brent in the future.
Angela Kleiman: I don't think it’s that direct correlation. I mean, we did factor that into our guidance. That’s part of the 25 basis point increase, but it’s not correlation.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to Mr. Schall for closing comments.
Michael Schall: Okay. Very good. Well, all of us thank you for your participation on the call and we look forward to seeing many of you in NAREIT and do the conversation. Have a good day and a good weekend.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman and John Eudy is here for Q&A. This morning, I will comment on Q4 results, market conditions and investment activities. 2016 was another successful year for Essex even the though operating environment became more challenging with each passing quarter. Apartment supply deliveries with large lease concessions intensified the normal seasonal slowdown in apartment demand that occurs every fourth quarter. These factors underlie our Q4 same property NOI results, which hit the midpoint of guidance range and a $0.01 per share beat to core FFO. I believe that our operations team did a good job of managing the portfolio given these conditions and we greatly appreciate their effort. We have noticed that consensus estimates for our 2017 FFO have risen in the past six weeks, attributable to an expectation that the U.S. economy will strengthen improving the outlook for apartments. Clearly, we agree that a better economy will produce more housing demand. Although the timing of that improving is debatable. As anticipated and discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we experienced a challenging fourth quarter and a slow start to 2017. In the near-term, we continue to experience deliveries of apartment supply with large concessions, particularly in Northern California. Loss-to-lease, which is defined as market rents minus scheduled rent was negative as of year-end and should rebound as we approach our peak leasing season. Therefore, any positive impact from an improved economy is not apparent at this point and therefore likely won’t materially impact our outlook for 2017. Generally speaking, our 2016 expectations for the U.S. economy were too optimistic both in terms of GDP and job growth. With respect to job growth, the most disappointing result last year was the Los Angeles, which we expected to outperform the nation much like it did in 2015. Unfortunately LA Q4, 2016 quarter-over-quarter job growth was only 1.5% versus our 2.2% year ago estimate. Measured against its historical relationship to the U.S., job growth in the tech markets over the past several years has gone from extraordinary to good. Although the U.S. underperformed our outlook in 2016 the San Francisco Bay Area produced 2.8% job growth, nearly matching our year ago estimate and Seattle outperformed with 3.7% job growth. We have continued to overweight the tech markets from an investment standpoint, largely because it is one of very few industries with above average growth prospects. In a slow growth economy, which we expect for the next several years, we believe that tax continues to be the best alternative. Thus, we view this economic cycle differently as we have not increased our South California portfolio allocation like we did during the later and in the prior economic cycles. On last quarter's call, we discussed our 2017 market forecast and in F-16 is materially the same with the exception of lower market rent growth in Los Angeles attributable to lower job growth as previously noted, which resulted in LA 2017 market rent growth forecast to be reduced from 4.2% to 3.7%. We still believe in our overall thesis as to Northern California that rents will improve as apartment supply deliveries decline, with reduced supply the large concession should also declined given stabilized owner greater pricing power. While affordability will remain, a key issue in Northern California estimated median household incomes improved in the three Bay Area metros by between 5% and 7% in 2016 leading to an overall improvement in affordability. We expect wage pressures for tech workers and minimum wage loss to push incomes higher. As noted last quarter, we have confirmed our supply definition to Axiometrics. Although there are differences from Axio due to project completion timing. In general, apartments supply is expected to increase about 11% in Southern California and most of that increase is attributable to a 65% increase in Orange County. The Bay Area should see apartment supply decline about 9% and we estimate that 64% of the total 2017 supply in Northern California will delivered in Q1 and Q2. The greatest reduction in apartment supply in the Bay Area will be in San Jose at 28% drop. This leads us to believe the pricing power in the Bay Area should improved in the second half of 2017. Venture capital investment remains healthy, although each of six quarters had less PC investment compared to its peak of 8.5 billion in the second quarter of 2015. We share concerns about potential slow down in the technology industries. We still see tech as the world’s leading economic engine and believe that leading tech hubs in the U.S., including the Bay Area and Seattle, will be the primary beneficiaries. The least part of the slow down and job growth appears to be finding workers that have the skills and backgrounds that needed by the top tech companies. We track the number of job opening at the top 10 tech companies all of which are located in an ethics target market, which indicates some 21,000 open positions compared to the 17,000 last summer. We anxiously await news on immigration policy especially with respect to the H1-B visas. An example of tech potential is the internet of things or IOT. It has taken about five decade to bring the microprocessors to its current state and its usefulness is about to expand dramatically. Coupling the microprocessor with sensors and actuators while being connected to the internet creates a different time machine, one that is capable accomplishing a wide variety of task in almost every industry in household. The estimates of its growth are extraordinary, for example, our PricewaterhouseCoopers’ report suggest a massive increase in devices connected to the internet from 14 billion in 2014 to 50 billion by 2020. IOT products that relate to housing have hit the market and they are mostly focused on single family housing at this point involving devices that they can remotely control a variety of system including locks, alarms, blinds and garage doors. It is not difficult to image a refrigerator that reorders essential food items or a device that reports a malfunction or leak. With reductions in cost and integration of common item into comprehensive systems, you will start to seeing an IOT devices in apartments. They should allow us to utilize our [indiscernible] productively by understanding traffic patterns, improve property security, while reducing cost and become more efficient and knowledgeable in our use of utilities. We expect our tech markets to be at the forefront of this activity and are well position for the related economic growth. Our next topic is investments. We noted on our Q3 earnings call that we expect to be more active in the transaction market in the fourth quarter. Impart that relate to increased disposition activity, necessary given that we did not issue common stock in 2016 and we won’t in 2017 unless our cost to capital significantly improves. Recent dispositions are outlined in the press release and Angela will discuss in further in a moment. As to the acquisitions, we bought two communities in Valley Village, a submarket of Los Angeles for 185 million. The San Fernando Valley continues to perform well and this area has minimal apartments supply expected for the next several years. We also converted our preferred equity interest in the recently built 166 unit Marquis Apartment in San Jose into a common equity interest. Being a good partner allows us to be part of the discussion when construction end, which in this case provided an opportunity to acquire half of the property. Cap rates remained stable last quarter with A quality property and locations creating around of four to four and a quarter Cap rate using the ESSEX methodology and from time to tome more aggressive buyer to pay sub four cap rates. B quality property and locations typically have cap rates from 25 to 50 basis points higher than A quality property. With most of the reef on the sidelines, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market compared to the year ago. Recent increase in interest rates have caused some noise in negotiations, but ultimately cap rates have not changed. As noted before, we continue to be active in our preferred equity in subordinated debt program, which aggregates around 250 million in outstanding including the two new investments closed during the quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see headwinds to new development deals and believe that the trend for apartment supply is downward in 2018. That concludes my comments, thank you for joining the call. I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. The ESSEX team had another solid quarter delivering total same-store revenue of 5.8%, and NOI growth of 7.1% relative to the comparable quarter. Our performance was impart related to our strategic decision to save our occupancy. The team did a great job executing our strategy and increasing occupancy by 70 basis points relative to the comparable quarter. In 2017 to maximize revenue, we will favor occupancy, yet take advantage of market strength as the opportunity presents itself typically in the summer. I'll now comment on the each of the major markets from the North to the South. The economy in the Seattle MD continues grow by the rate well above the national average, fueled by both the major well-known technology employers as well as the developing technology ecosystem that is nurturing numerous system start up and smaller technology firms similar to the ecosystem in Silicon Valley. There are over 30 technology focused co-working office spaces and about 20 accelerators and or incubators. The top nine angel networks and 15 venture capital firm have made over 1200 investments in the Puget Sound area. Employment grew at a rate of 3.7% for the fourth quarter 2016 over the prior year's quarter adding 59,300 jobs. Office absorption was 2.6% with 5.9 million square feet under construction, 46% of which is pre-leased. Numerous leases were signed in the quarter by companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Pokeymon, Snap, Big Fish and Big Titan, with activity focused in the South Lake Union and Bellevue Market. Each of the market performs well with respect to the fourth quarter revenue growth with the CBD submarket achieving 6.6% and the East, North and South submarkets achieving between 8% to 10% revenue growth relative to the comparable quarter. Onto the Bay Area where the economy continues to grow with employment growth of approximately 2.8% for the three Bay Area MDs, San Francisco, Oklahoma and San Jose for the fourth quarter of 2016 over the prior year's quarter, substantially outperforming the nation's employment growth of 1.5% for the same period. During 2016, the Bay Area office market absorbed 4.4 million square feet or 1.9% of total office space. Currently there is 15.3 million square feet under construction, 43% of which is pre-leased. As Mike mentioned in 2016 median household income grew in the three Bay Area MDs while market rent declined approximately 1.8% December over the prior year's period improving affordability. The decline in market rents has created a gains release in our Bay Area portfolio, therefore although we're expecting market rent to increase 2.5% in the Bay Area in 2017, the impact on Northern California gross revenues will be muted and are expected to be less than the market rent increase. In 2016, our Bay Area revenue substantially outperformed the market due to loss-to-lease. In 2017, the conditions are reversed and we expect to grow loss-to-lease setting the portfolio up for a better 2018. The impact of the lease up is now reflected in the market rent. The supply deliveries are expected to be greater in the first half of the year subject to weather delays with some of the pressure abating the second half of the year. The likely impact will be a reduction in concession for the product impacted by the new supply ultimately positioning the market for a stronger 2018. During the quarter, we started lease up at Century Towers a 376 unit high rise in downtown San Jose, currently it is 13% leased. Galloway at Owens continued to lease up during the slower demand period and is currently at 87% leased with concessions at six weeks on selected units, which is consistent with the new lease ups in the local market. Finally as planned, we are preleasing Galloway at Hacienda a 251 unit podium building adjacent to Galloway at Owen. Moving down to Southern California each of the markets performed well this last quarter. Despite LA’s slower job growth the MSA achieved 5.5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable quarter. It is noteworthy that West LA achieved 4.6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter below the average while our CBD assets achieved 6.1% above the average. The best growth during the quarter was in the Tri City submarket where we achieved 8.3% revenue growth all relative to comparable quarter. Technology footprint continues to grow in Santa Monica, Hollywood, Century City and other West LA locations. WeWork, Fandango, Snap and Netflix all added space during the quarter. Additionally Citi National Bank, which is headquartered in downtown LA signed a lease for 300,000 square feet of space on Bunker Hill as part of an expansion plan in downtown LA and of course, George Lucas has chosen Exposition Park to be home to his $1 billion Museum of Narrative Art with the groundbreaking before year's end. In Orange County, the market continues to a solid Southern California performer with year-over-year job growth for the fourth quarter of 2.3%, the North Orange submarket outperformed the South Orange submarket achieving 6.4% revenue growth compared to 4.1% revenue growth. In 2017, there will be significant increase in supply being delivered in the Orange County market with the greatest concentration almost 2000 units being delivered into the Irvine market where we have limited exposure. Finally, in San Diego the performance across the submarkets was fairly consistent leading to a 6.3% revenue growth relative to comparable quarter. In 2017, the supply increased significantly with approximately 1,700 units being delivered into the San Diego CBD that will clearly impact the CBD market as those units absorbed into the marketplace. Currently our portfolio is at about 96.6% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4.8%. Our renewals are being send out at about 4% for the portfolio overall which breaks down to 2.4% for Northern California and 5% for the Southern California and Pacific Northwest. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, John. I’ll start with the brief review of 2016 results then focus on 2017 guidance, capital markets activities and the balance sheet. 2016 was another good year for Essex, we generated same property revenue and NOI growth of 6.7% and 8.1% respectively. In addition, we achieved core FFO per share of 12.4% for the full-year which exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance by $0.12 per share. Turning to 2017, our same property revenue growth of 3 in quarter percent at the midpoint reflects our view that rent growth in our market will moderate to the long-term average following five years of exceptional growth. We also expect same-store revenue growth to be lower than the market rent growth published on 2016 as current in place rent are slightly above market. Our operating growth forecast is 3% resulting in NOI growth of 3.4% at the midpoint. As for the FFO guidance, we continue our track record of driving operating results to the bottom line and are projecting core FFO growth of 5.8% at the midpoint, which is 240 basis points higher than our projected NOI growth rate. A complete list of assumptions supporting our FFO guidance range can be found S-16, S-14 of the supplemental. Moving to capital and funding activities. In 2016, we funded our investment activities with disposition proceeds and joint venture capital in lieu of issuing common stock. We expect to maintain this funding plan in 2017 with the common stock pricing remains unattractive. We are cognizant of changing market conditions and are focused on allocating capital appropriately in Salta. For example, in the fourth quarter, the $185 million acquisition in Valley Village was funded by contributing four wholly owned properties into a newly formed joint venture where we have retained majority ownership and it is what we have been referring to as a dispo JV. In general, the dispo JV provides for an alternative source of capital to match fund our investment activity in lieu of issuing common stock. Key consideration to transact via a dispo JV are to divest from properties with lower total return expectation relative to the portfolio. And minimize dilution and rational sales cost via management fees, promote and other economic benefit. Leverage is not a key driver to transact in an off balance sheet vehicle. In fact, our joint venture platform leverage is only around 28%. Lastly, our private equity platform has done well, currently with a total estimate promote ranging from $30 million to $50 million. We will look to optimize our returns as we evaluate opportunities to monetize this value creation. Lastly, onto the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we retake the existing $225 million term loan and originated a new $350 million term loan, which matures in 2020 and priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We have swapped $150 million of this term loan to a fixed rate of 2.2%. Major debt maturities in 2017 primarily consists of $300 million unsecured bond in mid-March. Our current preference is to finance this debt with five to 10 year unsecured bonds depending on the treasury rate and underlying spread. But we will be opportunistic as we have several options to refinance this debt. With a low level of unfunded commitments for 2017 of $215 million, which represents only 1% of total market cap. Our $1 billion line of credit expandable to 2020 and a light maturity schedule over the next couple of years. We continue to be well positioned to weather any potential capital market dislocation. That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first comes from Jordan Saddler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it's [indiscernible] here with Jordan. I was wondering if you could provide a little color on your Southern California outlook of 3.5% to 4%. How that breaks off across the various submarkets, you mentioned an Orange County having significant supply this year. So some color on the various submarkets would be helpful.
John Burkart: Sure, this is John. The submarket that what we're seeing going forward is Irvine and downtown San Diego are going to get hit with more supply significantly more than they had this year. So those areas most certainly would be weaker. As we look at the on the job side, the LA market slowed down quite a bit in employment just broadly, but yet supply is kind of in the zone. But the big hits on supply big changes would really be in the Irvine area, we don't really have assets, very many will be impacted by that and then downtown San Diego. Does that give a little bit more color on what you need or are you looking for more?
Unidentified Analyst: No, no that's helpful. And then just Northern California, I was curious it sounds like it's going to be a little bit volatile or choppy at the beginning of the year with the deliveries more heavily weighted. How would you expect sort of the quarter-by-quarter trends to spread across throughout the year across Northern California? I mean do you expect it to snap back in the second half of the year or once concession begin to abate or more of just stabilization.
John Burkart: Yeah I would call it more stabilization. But one of the good things last year I used the word choppy I’m kind laughing to that we're using it now. A lot of the impact of the lease ups is really in the market rent, as last year was kind of transitioning in, so things were somewhat choppy. I think going forward it will be softer in the first half as we continue to absorb the supply. As we get into the second half, I think what is going to happen ultimately is some of the concessions are going to evaporate. And so it won't be like a pure snap back, but if you think about it a property giving two months concession, if that goes away as they finish lease up that's effectively a 15% rate increase. And so ultimately as we move through the year, I think the market will move up a few percent, some of the new lease ups are going obviously be reducing the concessions, and so they will see better rental strength, but not necessarily pushing rents up, per say coupon rents. As we roll into 2018, we should be in a pretty solid position for a good year in 2018.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi good morning. Still just wondering if you can give a little bit of color on, you talked a little bit loss-to-lease, kind of what you are expecting on new leases, may be across three regions and the spread to renewals you are forecasting. It sounds like you are saying Northern California new lease growth could be negative but, if you could just give us a little on that that would be fantastic.
Michael Schall: This is Mike, thanking for joining the call. Our January to March renewals are going out at somewhere around 4% and within that Seattle and Southern California are in the 5% range and Northern California is in the 2.5% range. So that should give you some idea. As to sort of follow-up on what John just said, because again we expect the supply and hangovers John said to clear over the next six months. And from that point market should recover. The issue that we have is that for market rents to recover, it takes time before it really hits the bottom line. And so I think this year is one, first couple of quarters being pretty challenging especially Northern California, but in the several others Southern California submarkets is well. And then as we get into the second half of the year, feeling much better about resumption in pricing power and again, where this weird dynamic where the 1% that are leasing up apartment are effectively setting price for the 99% stabilize donors. So when that clears the market, we think it will be a much different environment. Unfortunately we will be probably at that point in time in July or August and there are just not that many month, that we can turn the corner with respect to the rent that actually get reported, because there are just not enough months left. So, I think those dynamics what we see happening on market rent looks much better in terms how they get the number is the part that we think lags and its causing the little bit getter lag then expected as it relates to same property revenue.
Juan Sanabria: Okay great and then so for concessions, how are you guys seeing about it, I guess Northern California specifically is the level going to be pretty similar 2017 over 2016 for the year as a whole, any color there in terms of how 2017, because just because of the supply is still pretty elevated on an year-over-year basis in 2017 and how you guys have approached that?
Michael Schall: This is Mike again, and again it varies dramatically by market, like right now for example in Sunnyvale which is just north of San Jose, there are eight leases ups in the marketplace. And therefore as you would expect, because they are all trying to get 25 to 30 units a month. it's not surprising that there is six to eight weeks of concessions in the marketplace. That is not true for all of Northern California that is that specific submarket and really is derived from the number of lease ups that are competing against one another. Fortunately I think the trend for concessions is getting better, although slowly in the fourth quarter off course you have two phenomenon that are affecting price. One is the normal seasonality in the marketplace where demand drops off in the fourth quarter and the second is the continuation of delivery and supply into the market. So those two factors together I think is what really caused a very weak Q4 relative to other Q4s. So I think Sunnyvale being the key example where we have lots of lease ups in the marketplace. Salta market is probably near that around six lease ups, one to two months free and some of the other submarkets in northern California continuing to improve. So with demand resuming as we approach our peak leasing season, I think that the level of concessions will be starting to scale back as these deliveries come online and by the time we get into the summer, I think we are going to be look at much better scenario in terms of less concessions and better pricing power.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Mehta: Thanks. A c1ouple of question on investment activity, I was wondering if you could provide more color on the expected development stuff in 2017 and how are the yield expectations for new starts versus last couple of years?
Michael Schall: Well Mr. Eudy is here, so I'll let him handle that one.
John Eudy: We have as many as three starts plan for this year, all of which are land yield that we negotiated two, three, four years ago and titled prior to the current exaction that are being asked for on new deals being transacted with various cities. And relative to the amount of exposure compared to say two years ago, our peak will be stabilized out a third where we were at the peak, if I heard your question right.
Gaurav Mehta: That’s helpful. And then as a follow-up you talked about dispo JV as form of expected funding in 2017. So I was wondering the $400 million to $700 million guidance that you have for dispositions does that include assets currently going on JV or is that only for wholly owned dispositions?
Angela Kleiman: The guidance is a net number, so it include disposition. Is that what you are asking?
Gaurav Mehta: Yes sorry I didn’t include both dispositions as well as the asset that you will contribute in a JV.
Angela Kleiman: Right. So its 400 million to 600 million in our guidance range of acquisition.
Michael Schall: Yes, 400 million to 700 million in disposition. Dispositions probably will include some dispo JV activity, but it will also includes the continuation of calling the portfolio. And so there is a couple of different disposition strategies, one of them is call the portfolio, in other words, the property that don’t perform up to the level that we expect and we expect the underperformance to continue we will sale those assets out right. Then there are some properties that have decent growth rates and decent operations and they will become dispo JV possibilities. One of the things about dispo JV is we can again through management fees and promote and some other savings opportunities, we can get a higher yield on dispo JVs. But we are only going to do that obviously for properties that we want to own for the long haul. And then every once in a while there is an opportunity to sell an asset and reinvest at a higher total return expectations. So we will pursuing all three dispo strategies and it’s difficult to tell you right now how much will fall into each bucket.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Lesnick from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick: Hey everyone. I guess first off, I know you guys mentioned preferred equity investments that you originated a couple or converted one in 4Q. As you look out to 2017 especially given the development market right now, how do you view the size of that market and how that will trend through 2017, is that a fairly significant opportunity there or is it just kind of one up opportunities.
Michael Schall: Hi Tom, it's Mike, I would say that it is market that we see a fair amount of opportunity, we have a goal of about a 100 million, most of that related to apartment development transactions, again these are properties in our core market that we would otherwise like to own, but they don't generally hit the yield thresholds that we would be willing to put our own money into them as a common equity owner. And so we see 100 million as being a goal that is achievable, but there is a lot of transactions out there candidly that are falling below the yield thresholds that will allow that to work and as time goes on we see more and more transactions that the going in cap rates are so low that you can't layer in a preferred equity piece with a 10% to 12% coupon and make the numbers work. So I would say that we have a decent pipeline, we have good reputation in the marketplace, but I don’t think we would be able to for example double the $100 million goal. I think that we will get four or five deals done, it will be around 100 million and that's probably what is likely to happen this year.
Tom Lesnick: That's very helpful. And then I guess bigger picture, how are you guys expecting, I don't know, have you guys done any studies on how immigration policy might impact your major markets over the next four years. Do you have some sense as to the number of H1-B visa residents in your portfolio?
Michael Schall: We have a substantial number of H1-B residents in our portfolio, you have this huge purpose in my prepared remarks of talking about the number of open positions within these big tech companies really highlights that issue. The H1-B program in general allows 85,000 H1-B visas to be granted annually, I think that happens on April 1st. I think they are somewhere between 500,000 to 600,000 people in the United States on H1-B visas. I don't know where they are per se, because that is not disclosed so. But it's an important factor and I don't think we know what is going to happen with respect to policy coming out of the new administration for this and a wide variety of things. And so I really can't go there, I can say that from our perspective, we are a big fan of allowing the best and brightest of the world to come into the U.S. and I think that's really important that that happen. I saw a statistic the other day which I think kind of underscores this, which is about half of the U.S. based unicorns were founded or cofounded by immigrants, which seems to be a pretty compelling and amazing statistics. So as it relates to policy going forward, I don’t think we can predict what is going to happen, I’m hoping that the groups of people from Silicon Valley that are meeting with the administration are making the same point that we’re making now. But we’ll have to wait and see what happens.
Tom Lesnick: All right. Thanks. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Just want to clarify your expectations for the same-store revenue growth in 2017. Decided consumer deceleration on a quarterly year-over-year basis throughout the year or does it assume a stabilization in the back half?
Angela Kleiman: We are assuming a stabilization in the second half as the supply pressure abates a little bit more and also the fleet work through the concession that both Mike and John commented earlier.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay. So, I know its little early for 2018, but would it be fair to state getting your comments about economic growth and what supply that you might see a reacceleration into 2018?
Michael Schall: This is Mike, Nick. You know how we are, we are more conservative. But I certainly would think that 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year. This year the problem is that we start the year with a gain-to-lease or schedule rents are above market rents in Northern California by 3.5% and - I'm sorry by 1.9%, excuse me and overall in the portfolio by 25%. So, with respect to that systems that we have over the last several years from loss-to-lease, we’re not going to see that. And in fact, we’re going to need to rebuild some loss-to-lease. I mean we need market rent growth happen, if its happen tomorrow it would immediately become loss-to-lease and then it would roll into schedule rent over the next year. So, a moving rent does not translate into a move in same property revenue for some time. So, we’re in that rebuilding year in my view and as we get into the summer, I think we’re going to see things look much better and unfortunately it doesn’t really help us that much in 2017. But I think it does help in 2018. So, we look forward to that.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Appreciate that. And then finally, what was the gain on sale of marketable securities in quarter?
Angela Kleiman: From time-to-time we have marginable securities that we just sell out. And so that’s all that is.
Michael Schall: We have captive insurance entity that has generated a lot of cash and so we have reinvest that cash and so from time-to-time they would be selling securities.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question c is from John Kim from BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. Mike I appreciate your comments and your color on immigration reform concerns. I know it’s very difficult to answer these kind of question. But I was wondering is the 21,000 job openings by major tech companies is that a recent high or high as far as you can remember. And also is your concern at all embedded in your rental projection for Northern California in addition to the gain that we…
Michael Schall: Yes. I mean, 21,000 I think is the biggest number that we’ve found since we've been tracking that and again, up from 17,000, last summer sometime. So, there has been a surge in that. We all know, I think the unemployment rate for college educated people is somewhere under 3%, 2.5% to 3%. And so, obviously, we have a shortage of skilled workers, and that is causing some of the issues here I think in the tech world, because the demand is there for those workers. Those workers are not able to find the jobs for whatever reason. We saw for example Apple’s opened a campus is Austin. We view that as not as nearly as attractive as having those jobs here. In other words, the tech companies may go and build facilities and move jobs to the places where the right types of workers exist. And that could be in the U.S., and we fear potentially, it could be outside the U.S. So, again, this is an important issue to us, and we try to track it fairly closely. And I'm sorry, you've asked another question and I forgot what it was. Will you please repeat it?
John Kim: I’m just wondering if that was embedded in your Northern California rental projection?
Michael Schall: Well, I think it's embedded in the Northern California actual job growth numbers. And yes, again, what we try to do is create a scenario with respect to job growth in our markets; it’s really based on historical relationships to the U.S. So, we know for example that LA is very close to the U.S. in terms of job growth. And we generally don't deviate very much from what the U.S. job growth expectation is in LA because it mirrors the LA in many respects. We actually pushed quite a bit higher in 2016 because we thought there was some lag, and we were wrong because the job growth in LA is almost exactly the same. The job growth in the tech markets tends to be better than the U.S. And so, based on those relationships, we expect it to do better than the U.S. Now, I’d say generally speaking, some of these factors, the shortage of skilled workers to get employment rate of people with college degrees and other factors are really holding back the entire U.S. and holding us back at the same time. So, some solution to that problem, some of those problems is really important to us.
John Kim: Okay, great. And if I could ask just a quick balance sheet question, what is the net debt-to-EBITDA including joint venture debt? And also, where do you think you could price 10-year unsecured notes?
Angela Kleiman: Well, the net debt-to-EBITDA including joint venture, that won't be a whole lot different, just because our joint venture is only at 28% leverage, so it's very similar to the parent entity. And so, if you're -- in terms of the net debt-to-EBITDA changed from last quarter, it's more of a transaction timing, it's more that we had sold properties, so we lost EBITDA there and then the newly acquired properties just have not had chance to have an EBITDA. As far as where the rates would be, it would be somewhere -- if we issue today, a 10-year bond, unsecured bond, will be in the high 3s to 4%, in that range.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon. Mike, why sell 50% of the four older assets into disposition JV, why not sell 90 or something like that, if you’re really a disposition JV?
Michael Schall: Why not sell 90?
Rob Stevenson: Percent.
Michael Schall: Yes, with that. There are some pretty good reasons for that actually. But, the main ones are we have fees; we have promoted interest. And as we’ve seen, these promoted interests can be pretty substantial over time. And there are -- from a structuring standpoint, we would like to prevent a reassessment, generally speaking under of property taxes. So, there are some pretty important reasons to structure it this way.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. So, the latter was really the driver. You sold another -- you sold Downtown minority shares and then the tax, would you revisit it?
Michael Schall: We look at the whole equation.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, all right. And then, given the comments before about starting three developments, I don’t know if any of that’s the next phases of Station Park Green or whatever. But, I looks like, at least from your listing on development [ph], you're guys are starting to run short of land. I mean, how aggressive are you guys at this point in backfilling either through ownership or through option of future development parcels?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. First off, you are correct on Station Park Green being a piece of the three deals that we think we’re going to do this year. As far as being aggressive, yes, we're on the sidelines and we're looking at a lot of opportunities, and we’re trying to be opportunistic. But no, we're not going to do four to four and a quarter cap development deals to do deal. So, that’s an easier talk than it is an execution, as you know. That said, with the stress in the market, with financial ability being very difficult and the preferred program that Mike talked about earlier, we do think that this is a year where we may be able to strike opportunistically in a few occasions, but we're not going to do it in retail.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeffrey Pehl from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Pehl: Just a quick one again on investment activities. How are you guys thinking about redevelopment opportunities in your portfolio? And could your redevelopment pipeline grow from current level?
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. We take a very deep look every year at the entire portfolio, sit down in a meeting, go through every asset and every angle of opportunity, whether it’d be unit returns, adding laundry, backyard extensions, complete full renovations like we have at some of the assets. And at this point, I would say, we're pretty much at a stabilized number. If you look at our unit turns versus the total portfolio, we’re somewhere in the 5% to 6% range typically, which implies a 20-year life, somewhere in that zone for the kitchen and bath. On the larger assets, we're putting a few two, three to four through major renovation at any one time. We're pretty much on a sustainable level to continue forward. To accelerate from here, there is few things we're looking at, some opportunities that relate to technology and a few other things but not a lot of acceleration as it relates to major assets or unit turns. We’re probably slow unit turns down a little bit in 2017, just based on market conditions but not huge.
Michael Schall: I'll add one more thing to that that is when you have new lease-ups that are submitting concessions at the levels that we’re seeing, it compresses the rehab return. So, it makes it more difficult to make them work economically. And so, we've seen some rollback in terms of the number of unit trends that we’re able to do. That’s a factor that will be a drag until the concessions start burning the off in the marketplace.
Jeffrey Pehl: And then, just on the development pipeline, how much of that is condo math? [Ph]
Michael Schall: That we will have condo math, it would be two to the three deals.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: I just wanted to go this -- back to this issue of market’s forecast in rents that you guys have for this year of 3.6% and your same-store revenue growth midpoint below that. I think you gave some reasons, but I just wanted to be clear on why is that occurring this year?
John Burkart: This is John. So, if you look at the -- big picture, if you look at the economic rent forecast , you end up with 3.6%. Right now, we have a gain to lease in our entire portfolio of about 0.5%. So, if you do the math there you end up little bit over 3% and the difference that gets you to the midpoint at 3.5 -- 3.25, is other value added, those types of things, big picture. The practical side is the rents come throughout the year at different points in time where we have lease expirations. And so, some of the leases are going to expire and they have a gain to lease, so they are going down, while at the same time, the market’s moving up. And so, it never matches perfectly. It’s a timing issue that rolls through. But, big picture answer, it really relates to the gain to lease versus the market.
Michael Schall: Maybe one more thing to reiterate what John said, using maybe little bit different words. If supply abates, as expected, in Northern California, after the second quarter, we would expect market rents to grow. But again, that won't show up in revenue until -- it won’t be fully priced into revenue until the middle of 2018. So, in other words, you can see market rents grow but the impact on same store revenue is delayed to some extent, just to know operationally how this works.
Nick Yulico: So, it seems like this is an issue of -- sort of a timing issue in the first half of the year where you face this pressure and then things get better in the second half of the year. Is that the way to think about it?
Michael Schall: Well, I think that that is part of it, that’s given the fact that we have all this delivery of new supply in the first half of the year in Northern California, which is the primary concessionary market. The second half looks much better than the first half. But more fundamentally, in terms of looking at loss to lease, I think I said on last quarter's call that at September 30, 2015, we had about 7% loss to lease and by September 30, 2016 we had about 2% loss to lease. So, of the reported revenue over that period, 5%, the difference between 7% and 2% came from loss to lease. So, when rents are going up, you are building loss to lease and it’s not been reported as rental revenue. When that flips around on you and rents are going down, you start eating in your loss to lease, and it makes your results look much better than they really are when you look at market rents.
Nick Yulico: I guess the question is whether -- and I think it's definitely helpful to get all this market level forecast you guys give. But as we think about the last couple of years, you’ve been outperforming the market forecast on rent growth. And now, this year, you are underperforming a little bit. And you’ve kind of got this original number of the market rent forecast, it kind of felt like that was a guidepost to where your results could be this year and yet ended up being little bit optimistic, I guess. Do you think about maybe changing that kind of messaging going forward or…?
Michael Schall: If we had to do over again, yes, I think we would change the messaging. I mean, we don't like the market to be surprised with respect to anything that we do. But candidly, Q4 was part of the problem and that Q4 was much weaker than we thought it was going to be and the deceleration that happened. Again, you had the combination of seasonality plus lots of concessions in the marketplace. So, Q4 was just a really tough quarter. And so, I'm not sure if we replay the whole thing again. I am not sure that we would have come to the right conclusion, because I would have thought if we had 2% loss to lease at September 30th, as I just said, I would have thought we still would have some gas in the tank with respect to going into the New Year. And again, I think that as we get into the peak leasing season, what goes away quickly, tends to come back. And so, maybe we'll get a little bit stronger bounce back as we get into the peak leasing season. But again, I think Q4, the underperformance and the issues that we had in Q4 are part of this issue.
Operator: Our next question's from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: I'll still say good morning out there, I think we've got another few minutes. Mike, on the JV capital front, has there been any change from the JV partners for their appetite to invest in your market? And then, if there has been a change, if you could just talk about where they may be either more interested in investing or less interested in investing?
Michael Schall: I'm going to let Angela handle that one because she's probably the point person in touch with most of the institutions on that. Angela?
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. Hey, Alex. In terms of the demand of institutional investors in our markets, that has been actually steadily increasing. The change is really in the type of products and their return profile. So, for example, three four, years ago, there were -- a much stronger demand in development and correspondingly higher return threshold. And more recently, the focus has moved toward more of a core, core process type of investment. And as a result, the IRR, our return hurdles have also decreased. But, the net dollar interest in our products still remained at a high level and has continued to stay strong.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. But Angela, they're still happy to invest in Northern California as much as Seattle and Southern Cal, or are they focused more on one specific geography versus the others?
Angela Kleiman: They're happy to invest in all of those markets because they're not-- they're very long term in terms of -- these funds are 7 to 10 years. And so, they're not as focused on a one-year supply concern with say Northern California. They definitely understand and then believe in the trade of technology as the engine and driver of growth, not just with West Coast but for the U.S. economy. And also, given the thirst of transactions available in the West Coast, they have demanded just as much as in North Cal, SoCal and Seattle.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, just second question is, again, looking at Seattle, that market just continues to impress and you guys have a sort of the same type of growth as Southern Cal. So, despite all of the supply and all the stuff like union contraction et cetera. Do you have any concerns about that market or in your view the decoupling that you’ve witnessed between San Fran and Seattle will just continue for another year or two?
John Burkart: This is John, Alex. Actually, we respect the amount of supply coming into the marketplace, the market has performed really well. There has been a lot of job growth out there. At the same time, there is -- the supply is something to be alert to, we see some supply coming in at the east side. I can tell you our east side portfolio performed very well in the fourth quarter as it relates to revenue, as I mentioned in the remarks. But at the same time, slowed down somewhat significantly as it just relates to just really achieved economic rents. And that’s typical for the season but it was a little bit more than normal. So, we’re going to wait and watch as we roll into really past Super Bowls Sundays when leasing kind of picks up much more and see how that market performs. I think we’ll hit our numbers, but it’s slowing down a little bit from where we were before, and I think we have the right outlook.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Tayo Okusanya: Good afternoon. First of all, just thanks for all the detail on calendar on the call, that’s really appreciated. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on some of the acquisitions and disposition activity. I think the schedule on S-16 gives some basic pricing information. But, I was hoping, maybe you could just talk in terms of cap rate, where some of these 4Q and 1Q transactions were done especially the JV and generally what kind of cap rate just being in most of your major markets?
Michael Schall: Yes. Tayo, it’s Mike. And they are very consistent with what my comments were in the prepared remarks. The JVs and the non-core assets were in the 4.5 cap rate range. So, they tended to be a little bit older assets. And the Jefferson Hollywood deal that was closed was in the 4 cap rate range. So, very consistent with what we talked about. I think in every case, we’ve hit our internal NAV estimates for these assets. And so, again, we haven't seen very much movement in cap rate. We certainly had some noise. I think we had two or three buyers on the Jefferson deal, so some backed out. But, obviously -- and interest rates were our concern out there. But, all you need is one buyer to go through and complete a transaction. So, there is different sensitivity levels to interest rates out there. And there is still as Angela said, quite a bit of interest in West Coast department product.
Tayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. That’s helpful. And then just another quick one from me. I mean, apart from kind of the whole situation with integration reform, everyone's freaked out about it, tax reform under the Trump administration. Could you a talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about that? And if it could have any material impact on you in regards to your dividend or anything of that nature?
Michael Schall: That's a great question, Tayo. I'm not sure I'm equipped to exactly answer it, because again these proposals are dramatic in terms of is 1031 exchange is going away, are we going to be able to write-off all of the non-land purchase price, buildings that we buy, and how will that relate to -- do you really even a reelection if the corporate tax rate is 20% and you have all these other write-offs. I mean, these are all questions that candidly I can't answer at this point in time. We're just going to have to wait and see. As we get closer to having something written, we promise you we'll be studying it. But right now, we've looked at it but it's just too unclear to draw any conclusions from. And we have lots of other things to do, at least right now. So, as soon as we feel like it's coming down the road and we really have to focus on it, we're just going to spend our time on other things. But, I got to agree with you, it's potentially very significant in terms of its breadth. I have a feeling that it won't be anywhere near as [indiscernible] comes out. I think it's like the story is going to be much worse in the pipe. But I don't have any reason to know that that's going to happen. 
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Wes Golladay: Hello, everyone. Looking at Seattle, do you think that could be the next San Francisco or is there just enough job demand to absorb the supply?
Michael Schall: Hey, Wes; it's Mike. That's a great question. We have been -- as you know, we've been a little bit reserved on Seattle for the last couple of years because we're so concerned about the supply. The flip on Seattle is that it's much more affordable, rents are lower, incomes are still pretty high, and so it's -- I suspect it's taking some of the jobs that would otherwise have landed in Northern California; they're going to the Seattle area. So, what I think we’re seeing here is the market reacting to conditions and affordability specifically and moving some of that job growth to Seattle. For us, it remains a market that has too much supply, could be let’s say to double down in. Because candidly, I wish we knew with certainty exactly how these things were going to roll out. And obviously, if you look at the quarter and look at the guidance, we obviously don't know exactly how they're going to roll out. But, there is a multi-family supply, the stock of 2.3% expected for 2017; that's a lot of units; that's a lot of multi-family units. And it concerns us. So, you haven't seen those expand a portfolio in Seattle recently, and that is the reason. So, we'll probably see on the sidelines; we're not settling in Seattle either. Although we might sale an asset or two in that area that will be part of the calling process. But that percentage of the portfolio is somewhere around 18% of the portfolio; we feel pretty comfortable with it. And we'll continue to write it out. But it's a little bit concerning to us.
Wes Golladay: And what’s the behavior of the development during -- are they being rational to this point?
Michael Schall: No, developers have a much different view of the world than a stabilized donor. This is what causes our problem, because the developer and we’re developer too, and I’m not saying industry [ph] is not rational. However,…
John Burkart: [Multiple speakers] have 10,000 units in the pipeline.
Wes Golladay: Relative to San Francisco may be, the developers out there.
Michael Schall: Yes, maybe, but we have the same dynamic, I mean -- and we’re like everyone else is a developer. When we have a building, we want to fill it up as soon as we can, because what we're trying to do is we're trying to minimize free rent over the whole building over that initial period of stabilization. And the way to do that, like or not, is to offer some big confessions or the net effective equivalent of that. And whatever that takes, that fills up your building and then you become a stabilized owner and then you're back with everyone else throwing rocks at the guys that are giving 4 to 6 on the street. So that’s the dynamic. And until that goes away, it has -- as we've seen, it has an impact on pricing over the broader marketplace. For example in Northern California, we’ve had enough of this concessionary environment in San Francisco and San Jose that it really started to affect even the markets that were protected initially, like the East Bay for example. And then, again the same thing can happen in Seattle. Right now, the Downtown is two to four weeks in concession and Capitol Hill has four to six weeks in the other part of Downtown and four weeks in Bellevue. So, I think the concessions in that one month period, people generally don’t want to move in great numbers, to get one month concession, but you start bumping that to two month, and you will find that people will move. I think that the thing that really helps Seattle given the level of supply is this just continued to knock the cover off the ball with respect to job growth. The expectation for next year is we have Seattle at 2.7%, which is quite a bit of slowing from the 3.7% it did in the fourth quarter. If it continues at 3.7%, I think we have probably no problems in Seattle; if it goes down to what we have on S-16, which is 2.7%, I think they are going to see more concessions and more concessions will lead to once again the lease-ups setting price for the stabilized owners, and that’s the scenario we don’t want to be part of.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then, last one, looking at Northern California, I know a lot of these are just going to be baked in by t the time we get to the second half. But how do you see the new leasing participants playing out? You mentioned it could be good but are we talking here may be 5%, high single-digit, what type of snapback are you looking at, in your base case, assuming your employment projections are achieved?
Michael Schall: It’s less than that. I mean, realistically, what we would expect in the portfolio overall is in the 3% to 4% range. But, what you're going to see again is some of the A product that competing head on with the new lease-ups, yes, net effective is it’s going up in essence 8% to 16% all the way to concession. But if you go across the whole market for our portfolio, which includes the BS, it’s all the way through; you're going to be closure to the 4% to 5% range, somewhere in there.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Steve Sakwa: Most of my questions have been asked, but I guess I just had two quick ones, just in terms of general development activity and kind of what you're seeing from private developers. How’s the landscape changed maybe over the last six months? And I guess what is your expectation for starts and have you seen projects actually get put on hold here? And then, I guess secondly Mike, maybe you could just address where the share buybacks sit into your overall capital allocation strategy?
Michael Schall: Okay. Steve, thank you. I’ll have Angela answer the second part and John Eudy is here. And John and I meet every week and we talk about deals and what's going on out there. And what I hear John tell me week in and week out is the factors of construction lending continue to get - become more difficult to obtain. Costs have moderated a little bit but still are significantly up from where they were. And then the cities are atop in general; there are couple of exceptions to that. And so, it’s a very challenging development scenario. Having said that, there are some deals that are out there that have very low land basis because they started many years ago and are carrying forward a rally low land base. And some of them will be dealt and we see some of them. Those are the ones that typically work for our preferred equity program. There is a whole significant portion of other deals that have much higher land basis and maybe even developers that aren’t completely in touch with how far costs have gone, that is where the distress is in the marketplace, because they are trying to scramble to see how they can get their deal done. And again, our preferred equity program works really well at somewhere between 4.75% to 5% cap rate measured today, not stabilized. But, if you stop pushing that down to the 4.25% to 4.50% and we see a lot of deals in that range. If our preferred equity doesn’t work, nor does anything else work. So, that’s my view. Again, John and I talk about this stuff all the time. We look at a lot of deals. I mean, especially as it relates to the preferred equity program, there are more people looking at that now. There is a little bit more competition within that area. But for the last year or so, we have had great visibility into the development world given preferred equity and it’s pretty interesting to watch. So clearly, I think from my perspective, clearly the trend is for construction declining and 2018 looking like a pretty decent year. John, do you have anything to add to that?
John Eudy: No, I think you hit on everything, Mike. Clearly, there are a number of deals that were conceptualized in double digit rent growth years that don’t work in 3% to 4%. And when you do the math, there are a lot of transactions that are being talked about that will never get executed. You see the burn off of inventory; we think it's going to continue in the direction that it is going in 2017. It’s a challenging time to get deals done. And you can't borrow any money to get more than about 50% which you could get 80% from a construction lender three years ago.
Angela Kleiman: Yes. And on the stock buyback, as you may recall, we have $250 million buyback program and we did buy back such a small amount of stock earlier in the quarter. But it was immaterial, so we didn’t need to report it. But as far as how we think about that piece of the allocation, when we sell an asset, what we would look to is how we maximize the returns. And so, we look at what are we selling the asset, what kind of cap rate and then what are the acquisition opportunities versus buying back stock and what the stock is trading at that time. And so, it's a relative consideration. But, we certainly -- if a window opens that makes sense, we certainly would execute.
Operator: Our next question comes from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Conor Wagner: Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you please comment on the measures in Los Angeles, the one that was passed in November and the one that's coming up in March that would limit supply growth? What do you think the potential impact that could be, and then how that plays into your outlook for LA over the long term, please?
Michael Schall: Yes. Conor, it's Mike. And what was that proposition, was it...
John Eudy: SSS and then I think JJJ was in November than S in March.
Michael Schall: Well, anyway, these are proposals and we've seen several of them, not just in LA but in San Francisco and a variety of places. Then those actually were passed but there are many cases where city councils want more below market rate units, want other exactions and those types of things. So, even though in LA they're actually mandated now, there're plenty of other places that the spirit of that is in play. I think we've seen this many times before where you end up layering on more requirements and then the next thing you know, you build less housing. And I've mentioned -- I made some comments on last quarter's call about just the sheer number of housing demand versus the amount of supply. In effect, we built -- California's built somewhere around a third of the number of housing units that would be indicated given its job growth. So, it’s incredibly chronically undersupplied housing market, and you're finding the political process leading to further restrictions and further exactions on building more housing. And so, I think it has the effect of slowing down housing production and actually exacerbating the rent issue, the affordability issue because if you slow down the number of housing, the number of apartments you build, it will improve the price or rents will go up. It's a conundrum that one would not expect, but this is the state in which we live.
Conor Wagner: And then, since Measure JJJ was passed in November, have you guys observed any changes in land pricing or developer activity within Los Angeles for unentitled land?
John Burkart: We haven't yet but we expect to.
Michael Schall: I'd say there is distress, again within the land area because again the construction costs continue their relentless March upward. And the cities, they look at developers like a problem as opposed to a solution. And so, the more that sentiment gets baked into various places, the less housing you're going to have built. So, I don't know where this is going to go exactly. I suspect that the landholder ultimately bears the brunt of anything that happens to cost. So, if you’re going to have BMRE and it’s going to increase cost relative to returns and it comes out of the land. So, it has to affect the land values at some point in time. But again, I think it's too early to tell.
Operator: And our last question comes from Neil Malkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions real quick. First, given the elevated supply environment in your markets, are there any markets in particular that you view as particularly opportunistic or that you think you have a better chance to acquire into, to gain more exposure? Any thoughts would be helpful.
Michael Schall: That is a great question. And I think as rents have moderated here, again, we’re focusing more on Northern California than we are Southern California, principally because the job growth or just the relationship of how many jobs are being produced and what the future looks like as compared to the amount of supply hitting the marketplace. So, I think we’re still better -- in California, Northern and Southern California, you have similar levels of supply, yet Northern California has much better job growth. And so, our preference has been, given that prices come down pretty significantly in Northern California, to continue to be active in the acquisition and investment market in Northern California. So, to get more granular than that is somewhat more difficult, but so maybe I’ll leave it with that at this point in time. Northern California still would be our preference in terms of making acquisitions. 
Neil Malkin: Okay. And then, lastly, everybody’s talking about immigration and the visas and job openings, but I think job openings is no concern [ph] here; I guess it doesn’t really matter, people who take their jobs [indiscernible]. So, I'm just wondering if you have any sense and I don’t know if you have any numbers, but the people in your residence who maybe are again H-1Bs, are they more in Asia or is it more Middle East, because I would suspect that if it is more Asia, there is really no risk of anything happening as far as immigration goes, whereas there'll be a bigger question mark if it was more -- of the seven countries primarily on the list?
Michael Schall: Yes. That’s a good question as well. And I don’t -- I haven't seen a breakdown of what countries the H-1Bs are coming from at this point in time. I know that they are wildly oversubscribed. Again, it’s 85,000 a year, they get granted in, I believe it’s April 1st, and they go almost immediately because they’ve got many times that number of people that would like to come into the United States. I can tell you that we have -- it’s interesting, 20 years ago, we didn’t have communities that were one ethnicity or from one background and we do have that today. And so, I do suspect that there are more people, but again, exactly, where they come from, I can’t really tell you as it relates to the H-1B. So, I don’t know who's here on an H-1B and who is the country through other sources. So, again, I can’t tell you; it’s changed a lot in the last 20 years.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I’d now like to turn the floor back over to Schall for any closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you very much. And in closing, I just want to note that we appreciate your participation on the call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi Conference in March. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments followed by Q&A. I'll discuss the following three topics: the third quarter results and current conditions; our 2017 preliminary market forecast; and an update on investment markets. First topic, we're pleased with the Company's performance during the quarter in which we reacted opportunistically to rapidly changing conditions. As a result, we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter by $0.05. I thank the E team for their great effort and result. Similar to the second quarter Q3 was challenging from an operations perspective against a very tough comp in 2015. Job growth remains strong relative to the U.S. especially in Seattle where September month-over-month job growth increased from the prior year to 3.5% in 2016 versus 3.2% in September 2015. Northern California continues to significantly outperform the U.S. in job growth although it has decelerated. For example, in San Francisco, September 2016 job growth was reported at 2.6% significantly below 5.1% reported for September 2015. Southern California job growth was significantly better than the nation in Orange County and San Diego and slightly behind in Los Angeles and Ventura. Overall, against the backdrop of decelerating of U.S. job growth, the West Coast economies continue to outperform. Rent growth continued to be muted in Northern California which we attributed to the large concession being offered by lease-up communities. Job quality ranked by annual salary levels for each industry was another issue in Northern California as there were more service jobs and fewer tech jobs being produced. In San Jose for example approximately 10% of the jobs created year-to-date were in the highest paying information and manufacturing industries as compared to about 32% in 2015, less significant deterioration in job quality occurred in San Francisco and Seattle. It’s surprising that more service jobs are being created given the wealth effect related to the financial success of so many tech companies and their highly compensated workforce. Our venture capital contacts tell us that there is considerable movement of personnel within the technology industries as the next ways of new product services and companies are emerged. Recent loss of pricing power of Northern California and a few other submarkets could indicate that we have achieved equilibrium between housing supply and demand. We don’t believe that this is correct, and we use historical data from San Francisco and San Jose metros to demonstrate. For the period 2011 to 2016, San Francisco and San Jose have produced about 440,000 jobs, assuming two jobs equals to one household that would equate to demand for about 220,000 home. The actual total housing units built over that period was about 65,500 or less than the third of the expected demand that would ordinarily result from 440,000 jobs. We experienced exceptional pricing power in San Francisco and San Jose from 2011 to 2015, and the delivery was about 10,000 apartments in 2015 which are included in the 65,500 previously noted that has done little, we believe to eliminated pent up demand in prior years which leaves us with the question of why such concessions are required if there is so much pent up demand. We believe that the answer to that question relates to the concentrations of supply, the fundamentally different financial objectives of the apartment lease-up versus stabilized community and affordability factors. Apartment developers in an effort to minimize overall free rent over the lease-up period typically set absorption targets of 25 to 30 leases per month. In some markets as many as five leases are directly competing for this lease volume. That means that over 100 leases per month are needed in that submarket to achieve leasing velocity to be target. Recent job growth has not generates sufficient demand and the large concessions run out of stabilize communities. Two months free rent again equate into 16% annual rent drives that absorption and at least temporarily resolves the affordability problem at the same time. We see this is a short-term phenomenon that will likely clear the market as supply deliveries decline in 2017. Higher incomes are probably the most important solution to the affordability issue. Many rentals are displaced by large rent increases and search for more affordable housing when rents grow faster than income levels. The opposite occurs when income begin to grow faster than rents which is now happening. In Q3 2016, as compared to the comparable period of 2015, San Francisco and San Jose are estimated to reproduce 6% growth in medium household income, which is the huge growth rate that improves affordability relative a year ago. As through supply we expect about a 20% drop in apartment supply in San Francisco and nearly 30% in San Jose in 2017, and fewer deliveries in each quarter for our 2017. Therefore, we expect supply pressures to moderate in northern California especially in the second half of the year, assuming of course the job growth was kneeling on track. Southern California apartments supply will be similar to 2016 and will decelerate throughout 2017 with the exception of Orange County, which is expected to have a 30% to 40% increase in supply. I wanted to provide a quick update on rent control there are ballet proposals during that rent control in five Northern California cities, while slower rent growth has removed some of the motivation for rent control. There are well organized and finance groups that are pushing ahead. At this point, we expect some but not all of the ballot proposals to path. In any events, these measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's the reasons provided in previous conference calls. And then my second topic market outlook for 2017. Page S-16 of the supplemental provides an overview of the key housing supply demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2017, as before our macroeconomic scenario for the U.S. realized on leading third party sources. The Essex economics we have been estimate how the national economic picture will impact housing supply and demand for each submarket we have selected for potential investment. For 2017, the U.S. economy is expected to experience muted grow with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.2% and 1.6% respectively. This year we made three notable changes to our assumptions that are incorporated in the S-16 including; first, we have modified our definition of multi-family supply to be similar to add few metrics, which includes multi-family properties under development with at least 50 units and excludes senior student and 100% affordable communities. We diligence this information by driving each property to understand deliveries schedules, saving and remove project duplication. Therefore our supply estimate should differ from the data vendors. We have observed that the various research providers estimate supply in a variety of ways often with materially conflicting conclusions. We hope others will follow our lead with respect to using a similar supply methodology. Second, as we approach the top of the cycle development deliveries are often delayed due to shortages of trained construction personal. This causes some development deals to be pushed into the following year. With that some of our 2016 schedule deliveries have emerged into 2017 and the same thing may happen at the end of 2017. Therefore our supply estimates may be too high. Third, as noted in my previous comments the typical relationship between supply and demand is connected in Northern California in 2016, there is no historical President for the adjustments we made to consider affordability they represent our best judgment. Notably on Page S-16, each of our West Coast metros is expected to outperform the national average job growth. In each metro again assuming the two jobs equals one household, housing demand exceeds total expected housing supply that's both rental and for sale. The resulting 2017 market economic rent growth is slightly above the long-term CAGR of rent growth in Southern California and Seattle and slightly below in Northern California. In summary, 2017 seems likely to produce a soft landing, thus the extraordinary rent growth from several years should transition to the long term averages in the Essex portfolio. And now the third topic investments, we experienced a relatively quite quarter from an investment standpoint as outlined in the press release. During the quarter the stock traded mostly at or below net asset value making accretive acquisitions challenging to execute on a match funded basis. We expect to be more active in the fourth quarter with all new deals being funded with disposition proceeds. Cap rates remain stable in the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4 to 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology. And from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub for cap rates. Generally, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. We don't see cap rates changing materially given the extraordinary amount of positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and a seven year fixed year loan is approximately 3%. In connection with our preferred equity program we look at both existing and to be developed apartment communities that are consistent with the Essex portfolio. Recently we've noticed an increasing number of development transactions that don't meet our criteria, typically used due to increased cost of construction and conservative construction lending practices. This supports our belief that 2017 will represent the peak of supply in Coastal California. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. The Essex team had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9%, and NOI growth of 8.3% relative to the comparable quarter. I want to thank our associates for their daily commitment in providing exceptional customer service and for their enthusiasm in achieving our company objective and helping make this possible. Our markets are reaching a point where the strong performance in Southern California will enable the region to outperform Northern California. Although, this quarter, they both were equal at 6.5% revenue growth. In Seattle, the strong demand in the market fuelled by above expectation in climate growth enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenue. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenue 8.5% in the third quarter of 2016, relative to the comparable quarter. The CBD submarket outperformed the expectations growing revenue approximately 7%. East side, North, and South submarkets were over 80% of our portfolio located, all grew revenues between 8.4% and 10.8% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. During the quarter, the market absorbed 950,000 square feet of office space or 1% of total stock. Amazon continues to expand with our 10,000 posted job openings and signing another 360,000 square foot office lease for a building under construction located in Belvieu where the Company would founded. Currently, there's approximately 7.2 million square feet of office space under construction with 41% of it preleased. In contrast to the strength of Seattle, the Bay Area rental market has been impacted by affordability and aggressive lease-up. Currently, Axio shows September rents in San Francisco and the San Jose market relatively flat compared to the beginning of the year. Submarkets that are most impacted are those with higher levels of new lease supply and related lease-up concession. Concessions in the marketplace vary they are driven by the concentrations of high-end lease-up which largely podium and high rise buildings, where in order to obtain this difficult typical occupancy the entire property needs to be largely completed resulting in 100s of rent ready unit at each property hitting the market simultaneously. Generally, the lease-up managers generously give away concession to achieve certain coupon rent and absorption goal. In certain markets with concentration that supply such as San Francisco and South San Jose, we are seeing selective cases were managers are providing two month free rents or more. During the quarter, we completed the lease-up of Agora of 49 unit luxury property in downtown Walnut Creek and continue to successfully lease-up the Galloway in present and private station. Currently Galloway is 63% lease and in order to maintain leasing velocity we have increased concession to about six weeks for lease which is up some four weeks offered during the peak demand season of the summer. Office absorption continues to be positive in all three Bay Area market with over 800,000 square feet been absorbed in the quarter. Some of the quarters leasing activity included General Electric expanding their footprint adding their additional 100,000 square feet in San Ramon and Google signing a lease to occupy the entire Moffat Gateway campus, which is approximately 612,000 square feet. Currently, 11.5 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Bay Area of which 46% is preleased. Moving down to Southern California. The region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the LA market, CBD grew revenues 4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year’s quarter, as it continues to absorb the new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-City submarkets continue to be strongest in the LA market growing revenues about 8%. In Orange County, the North Orange submarket continues to outperform the South Orange submarket in the third quarter with revenues growing 6% and 4.4% respectively. With 1.9 million square feet of office space under construction, this would support the addition of approximately 11,000 jobs in the Orange County market. Finally revenues increased 8.4% in San Diego with Northern submarket outperformed in the CBD and Southern submarkets relative to comparable quarter. Third quarter office absorption in these three Southern California markets was over 1.4 million square feet with San Diego leading the way of almost absorbing 1% of total stock. Currently our portfolio occupancy is at 96.7% and our availability 30 days out is 4.4%. Our renewals on average being sent out at about 4.5% for Northern California a little over 5% for Southern California and about 6.3% in the Pacific Northwest. We are positioned well for the end of the year and 2017. Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, Don. Today, I will discuss our quarterly results, the full year outlook and comments on the balance sheet. We are pleased to report that our core FFO per share exceeded the high-end of our guidance. The outperformance this quarter was primarily attributed to favorable operations, accretive investments and lower G&A, some of which is timing related. Turning to the full year outlook, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same property guidance of 6.8% revenue growth and 8.1% NOI growth. As for our core FFO, we have increased the midpoint by $0.05 per share to $11.03. We are now projecting a 12.3% year-over-year core FFO growth, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double digit growth. Onto the balance sheet, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 5.7 times this quarter from 5.9 times last quarter primarily due to continued growth in EBITDA. In addition, we received an upgrade on our senior unsecured debt rating from Moody's to Baa1 and from S&P to BBB+ with stable outlook. The upgrades substantiated the strength of our balance sheet and our improved debt metric. The rating agencies also face their upgrade on the solvent operating track record and long-term favorable economic fundamentals in our select race course market. We believe this upgrade will enhance our cost with debt capital going forward. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: So, I want to just get a little bit more color from you about the comments about the peak and supply in 2017. Does that mean you see supply pressures still accelerating into 2017 and then looking forward into 2018, when do you really start to see these supply pressures starting to decelerate and maybe providing a little more release for me in the reasons that you mentioned?
Michael Schall: This is Mike. Thanks for joining the call. I would say what we are seeing is movement of some of the supply from 2016 into 2017, and we see it continuing at a pretty significant level through about midyear in 2017 and then dropping off pretty significantly from that point. And again, I think that there is a lot of deals being discussed here on the west coast, the issue is because of construction cost increases delays in the cities because the cities are very busy and the construction lending environment which is becoming more and more conservative that is starting to make deals push them off or hand over they are not achieving the level of returns required to make the deals work. So, we are seeing those deals being pushed off. And so that gives us confidence that the supply is underway it will be delivered late and hence the movement from supply from 2016 into 2017 but it gives us confidence that we are going to see a pretty significant slowdown in the middle of 2017.
Richard Hill: And just two quick follow-up questions about that, your same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth, should we think about that as sort of the steady state right now, with supply pressures being moved into 2017? And then I've follow-up to that. Thank you very much for the disclosure on high end job growth, that's really helpful. Did I hear you correctly that you thought the high end job growth would begin to reaccelerate as some new products are coming to market?
Michael Schall: We're hitting that one first, we don't know. We can't tell you. We think that, there will continue to be more service jobs created and more services consumed for the reasons noted namely that we have very high income workforce, and we're going to consume more services, so we feel pretty confident with that. We do think that there'll be more tech jobs, again, we think that tech is going through a essentially a retrenchment or really defining what the next chapter is going to be in fact, which is a variety of things for example the Internet of Things, the use of Big Data, more mobile applications, sensors and security devices as it relates to many-many applications and including apartments for example, sustainability in cyber. So there's a whole bunch of things that are happening in the tech world that are being pursued but we're not really seeing it in the job numbers yet. So, again, we view the tech industry as an ongoing revolutionary type of process and -- but it's not a straight line. And so, but we expect it to take on more momentum as we get through the next couple of years.
Richard Hill: And the same-store revenue growth is -- is that sort of a steady state that we can expect at this point, do you think? I know it's hard to project.
Michael Schall: Yes, it's hard, I mean we don't want to get in the -- into giving guidance at this point in time, but from our perspective here, we think that probably Q1 and 3Q will be a little weaker. You have our market forecast expectations on F'16, so you know what the overall view is for the year. But if I were to look at the first part of the year versus the second part of the year, I think we'll have somewhat of a slow start and then pick up momentum as we go through 2017.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: I guess just sticking with that theme, what's the loss to lease for the portfolio today versus at this point last year?
Michael Schall: This is Mike. Welcome to the call. It is September '16, '16 is about 1.9% and 7.2% last year. And it was back in July typically, if we had the peak of loss to least in July was 4.9%. So, it's been a fair amount of deceleration since just July.
Nick Joseph: And then, for the 2017 economic rent growth forecast, when you think about the potential variability of each regions, which regions are you most or I guess which region are you most confident and which is the widest range of potential outcomes?
Michael Schall: Let's see, that's a good question. I would always point to Southern California as being more stable. We don't -- it's more like the U.S., it doesn't have really the upside or the downside typically because you've got more pieces to the economy and they trend a little slower. When I think about Northern California and Seattle I think overall over the long term it grows faster, but it's more volatile and is generating faster growth over the longer period of time. So, I think that’s always case, I don’t think there is anything unique about right now the Southern California is closer to the U.S. economy, Northern California has the ability to move aggressively a little bit aggressively in both directions. And you’re seeing part of that, I mean affordability is the concern about Northern California because demand grew so quickly and we have the great pricing power that rental grow at much faster than incomes and you can do that for some period of time. And but at some point rents and income have reconcile one another over the long haul.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning on your end. First of all big congratulations on a putting up such great numbers against the backdrop you’re operating in. Just on the Northern California in general again you look at the aftermarket data on the pin to a very green picture. If we look at your results and you guys are still doing very, very well. Just trying to understand again how you're managing against all that pressure from aggressive developers trying to fill up their buildings, the concession, the store job growth. I mean is it just the quality of the portfolio in regards to owning a lot of the assets not at the very high end of the market. Is it -- what is that actually you guys doing this is creating this kind of massive alpha?
Michael Schall: Well. Thank you, Tayo for apprising to that. I would like to believe it’s because we have the smartest operations team led by Mr. Burkart. So, we’ll get hit more shut out on that point. But I think that if you look at the Axio charts what we saw this year was a pretty weak peak leasing season and so I think John and his team did was anticipate and really understand and execute around that. And so, but I don’t want to steal John's thunder. John, what if you do that was magical this quarter?
John Burkart: I prayed a lot. As Mike said, we think our reaching the strategy typically the software where we’ll do what I call is actually closing the leasing door where it takes certain units and it holds them out above the market trying to identify top potential market rents. And so we make some changes in the settings to bring those units to market which enabled us to gain occupancy during the peak demand period and positioned us very well going into the fourth quarter. That strategic change plus the loss lease that we have taking the advantage of that as well as quite frankly nickels and dimes executing in all different many different places from collections to reducing models et cetera. We worked very hard and I’m very proud of the team, they did a very great job.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Well, thanks. A couple of questions, first on the 2017 market forecast that you gave on rent growth. Are those numbers only for like a new lease growth or is that some sort of like a blended rent growth?
Michael Schall: Yes, Nick, it's Mike. This is supposed to be marker rents and not the asset portfolio but all the assets in the submarkets in which we are invested weighted as if it was our portfolio. And so we’re not trying to make a comment at all about Essex or As versus Bs or anything else. Just broadly speaking what do we expect, the submarket to do take a market rents at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year.
Nick Yulico: Okay, so I guess when we look here at Northern California 2.5% that's higher than I guess where the latest sort of monthly Axiometrics data has been, which is sort of no growth or slightly negative, it is some sort of difference and then you are assuming that there rents actually are growing and across the market next year just trying to kind of reconcile.
Michael Schall: I think the question is that I would ask historically back to you is how many straight lines do you see on these rent graphs and pretty much the answer none they don’t act in the straight line they move. So yes if you look at September alone you'll say okay that's this is extrapolate and figure out where things are going from there I think you end up with the bad answer because I would say what impact as of September the seasonality have on the overall results we already know but we have affordability issue, we have too much supply in the form of these lease ups to operating typically 16% off on your annual rent and then now we have the affordability factors layered on top of that. No one can get aggregate what each of those pieces means, so by focusing exclusively on September, I think that you are making an implicit assumption that, hey, this is the way, it's going and it's going to continue that way. We don’t believe that if you look at just look at the Axio chart for San Francisco, San Jose and in California markets. There was the point on which we were getting 2% to 4% rent growth, and again trying to stagger leases so that you take advantage of that and make good decisions with respect to building occupancy during the right period of time, allows you to have some ability to manage around that. And so I wouldn’t focus too much on the one September number, but look more broadly at where rents have gone this year. And I would to assume the next year again will be a little bit challenging in Q1 and Q2 because we're going to be dealing with this issuer to much supply and big discounts because lease ups operator is heavily incentivized, they have a bunch of big units to discount and absorb apartments. And he does so by just stealing from the stabilized -- so I think that dynamic is not going to change and that will have the effect of dampening our results. However, we start building demand in February or March. And we would expect that to happen and that will temper that. So, again we try to understand these relationships and how the rents vary throughout the year and try to make good decisions and execute well around what we expect to happen.
Nick Yulico: Okay, that's helpful. Mike just as a follow-up I don’t know if I miss this but can you give a sense for where new lease growth was in Northern California through your portfolio in the quarter and how it's trending in the fourth quarter so far? Thanks.
John Burkart: Sure. This is John. So our new leases in the third quarter So-Cal were about 3.6% and Nor-Cal about 1% and Seattle about 5.6%, so on an average about 3% year-over-year and where it's trending we're going to the lower demand periods, so I don't have the correct numbers but it'll trend typically little bit lighter, but one thing to remember is that last quarter -- a year ago quarter '15 was a weak quarter so that'll help the year-over-year comps.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: First one just has to do with the -- I think people are trying to get their arms around whether the supply curve peaks in '17, extends in '18 and you draw out the point, I think others have as well, that you might get more of a smoothing effect, as things get delayed and pushed out. I guess, the question is, if you guys look at it, do you feel like we end up in a different place in 2018 whether it pokes up into '17 or it gets smooth outs? Is there a preference in your market as far as one or the other? And do you think it matters as far as the end game?
Michael Schall: It's Mike again. I think it does matter and I think that it's very difficult to look out too far out there because conditions changed and back to the point I was trying to make before there're no straight lines, and it's industry we react based on what we see happening on the market day-in and day-out and again what we see and we see a lot of this with good visibility onto what's going on in the development deal, because of our preferred equity program where we are coming at that 55% to 85% loan to cost ratio on development deals and so we're seeing a lot of deals and we're originating these preferred equity loans on properties that we would -- that would be very consistent with the Essex portfolio. But I guess the point is that a number of those are ready to go development deals that don't hit the yield thresholds that make them buyable in the marketplace and therefore they're being pushed off and they don't qualify for our program and a lot of that is when you get into the discussion of reconciling costs, I think a lot of that land owners think that the cost are much lower than they really are when they sit down and actually price things out. And that process I don't think is going to change any time soon. It's possible for example that the construction industry will have less fewer projects and they will become more competitive from the cost standpoint and some of these land deals will start working. But we're certainly not seeing that at this point in time. So, what we've before us is a number of I'll say half the deals that we're scheduled or could come to market or actually getting done because of again these constraints, the cost rising issue, silly delays from deal and planning departments -- they're really busy and the impediments from conservative construction lenders. So, as long as those circumstances remain in place, I think we're going to see the development pipeline moderate as we model for 2017 and you would not expect it to get any better in 2018. Hope that answers the question.
Dennis McGill: I think so, but just making sure, I am thinking about it -- so I think it smoothed out, do you think that ultimately leads to more supply because they make the underwriting a little bit less cautious?
Michael Schall: No, I don't think it's a matter of the underwriting being cautious. I think that -- again we've never seen a pro forma that didn't have the right numbers on it. And so we see lots of pro forma's that have un-trended cap rates development deals in the 5 to 5.25. But again when you actually sit down with someone to price that out it is coming out to be somewhere in the 4.5 to 4.75 range. And that pressures the numbers in terms of how much equity you need and some of the other constraints. And begin very conservatively lenders, lenders that have a huge balance sheet that are somewhere in 55% to 60% loan-to-cost ratio et cetera. So, I don’t see that, I don’t see that will see that changing I don’t see construction cost moderation happening in the very short-term again if developers become or if the developers become less busy, I’m contractors becomes less busy and cost are down and maybe some of these deals will made it through. But, again right now I feel pretty confident and our forecast in terms of first half of 2017 be in a bit heavy and then abating each quarter throughout 2017 in the second half of the year been much better. So, I feel very confident in that although again like we’re seeing before there could be some movement of projects quarter-to-quarter as delays and other things happen.
Dennis McGill: Okay. That’s helpful. And then and you did mention the preferred equity program. Can you just give us an update on how you see that pipeline it seems this quarter was as their resignation quarter and heavy relative to the outlook that you gave last quarter? Are you seeing more opportunity or that opportunity expand?
Michael Schall: Yes. I think, what I would say about that, so we’re at 186 million outstanding and we did few deals that funded a few million dollars this quarter. We have a pipeline of around 50 million, but and talking to our team there they are again lot of deals of this business, they can make work. And so they it is not like we have 30 deals and we’ll pick in deals the best of it, it’s more or like we’re looking at the lot of deals and somewhere around half of them are making sense to the other half or again not producing the returns. One would normally expect that you’re going to take development. And I would, but that's against the context of looking at an acquisition and an acquisition you can lock in somewhere around 4.5 cap rate, with seven year loan in around 3% range. So you have a huge amount of positive leverage. So, I guess I would say, why would you take all that development risk when there is so much positive leverage on existing acquisition all things being equal. So, I think that the alternatives with respect to where capital get allocated are putting in interest in and it means that development deals plenty of handful into the development deals at lower yield because there is another alternative out there that is better economic and certainly risk rewards.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick from Capital One. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Most have been answered already, but just wanted to adjust subjective buybacks since you’re share price still looks relatively discounted, any update or thoughts on that?
Angela Kleiman: Well, as you may recall we have a $250 million program in play and we’ve always been opportunistic when it comes to us capital allocation and we plan to continue to do so. And so, we had a small purchase, but not enough as it relates to subsequent investments to the very small amount. And like I said, we're just continuing to be opportunistic on that front.
Tom Lesnick: And I guess where the stock is trading today, how do you evaluate that as opportunity against your overall investments?
Michael Schall: I think we like the better yesterday. It's interesting I mean the one thing I would add that it's a continue conversation between Angela and me is that it's isn’t like we can sell our whole portfolio primarily because the cost to routine tax planning etcetera we have somewhere around a 1 billion dollars, so we call sell relatively easily. You need to pay us special dividend and/or buy shares back, we don’t really care about which of those we might want to do. But I guess the point is there are some assets that are many assets that we had huge games on the business large difference between while we pay as property tax as wasn’t what the buyer pays his property tax and the buyer will cap out that difference and you get a lower value. So, there is something there is a headwind in California to large scale dispositions and we purchase transactions and so we have essentially gone through our portfolio and categorize them by type and so we have a list of assets that we know we can sell, we have a calling portfolio, we have opportunistic sale portfolio and again we are just trying to get the relationships right but we are not going to do it if it has a very small impact with much rather weight for opportunities to see meaningful differences between the value of the real estate portfolio and the value of the share and so we are going to be patient on that. As Angela said we did execute on debt repurchase and so that will give you some ideas that we're interested in it and following through.
Tom Lesnick: That's really helpful. And just one last one from me, I think you mentioned the aggregate loss lease figure earlier in the call, but I was wondering if you can provide that between your three portfolio segments?
John Burkart: Yes, sure. This is John Burkart. So, the aggregate as we said is about 1.9% and that breaks down with Southern Cal at about 3.4%, the Bay Area with a slide gains in lease at this point in time about 40 basis points, and then Seattle add about 2.6%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: So, another sort of twist on the loss to lease question, so and I don’t know if you can answer this readily on this call, but I'm trying to get a sense of what loss to lease has represented in terms of Essex's outperformance tend to your rent growth versus the market rent growth or your competitors rent growth over the past couple of years, if you could attribute that outperformance the last at least if you can attribute part of it to that a revenue management just trying to get a sense of the split there again attribution of outperformance I guess.
John Burkart: I'll take a shot at it and if Mike wants to follow up, but ultimately loss to leases is the product that of rent growth, right. So, it's assets by acted in the marketplace and are we investing the right locations? What's the rent growth look like? And then loss to leases is drives by what we actually rent at versus where the markets at? So, at Essex we've had very strong markets. As Michael said many times on the call, we had a self-imposed rent cap that we put in at basically 10%, that has plus the market strength has led to loss to lease growth over time and over the last year as we said earlier, about a year ago we were about 7.2% loss to lease now we're about 1.9% loss to lease, so you can see that a big portion of that has rolled through to the bottom line. Does that basically answer your question?
Rich Hightower: And then my second and final question is just on Seattle, I think you guys quoted renewals running around 6% and change in the Pacific Northwest earlier in the prepared comments and then when I compare that to the market forecast for next year around 4.5% and then also measuring that again it's around 8% which is what you guys have done so far in 2016, I'm just wondering what all that implies in terms of new lease growth in Seattle for next year? It sounds like it should be pretty low to get to kind of those numbers when you tie it all together?
Michael Schall: We think we've laid out -- in our supplemental we see as rental growth rate whereas 4.6% for next year for the market place. As it relates to the renewals for the fourth quarter, what we say, what we're setting at this point in time, that's going to be a function of the leases in place that are there. And as you get to the fourth quarter you got to pull back a little bit, but we're setting it now like 90 days in advance or 60 to 90 days in advance. So, the renewals are very strong. I won't look at that as staying the market is not strong.
John Burkart: I think, let me add something important to that. In Seattle, we have two couple of things that have happened, so we have supply in '16 estimated as 9,800 units, this is multifamily. So we have that increasing to about 10,900 units and we have job growth decelerating from 3.5 to 2.7. So, now will that happen, exactly like that? I'm not sure, but again our market forecast is based on a scenario and those are the two key inputs in the scenario so we have some moderation of market rent growth in Seattle, again this is market growth on F'16. It does not include loss to lease.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.
John Kim: I think John mentioned in his prepared remarks, that pick up in office net absorption in some of your markets and I realized there's different supply and leasing dynamics but I'm just wondering if you -- office leasing has the leading or lagging indicator to your market?
John Burkart: This is John. From our perspective we look at that, we try to look at a variety of pieces and that's one of them to understand A do we have enough space that's going to be available which is via optimal measuring construction because we've got such jobs -- strong job growth, we've enough space for the people and then B is that space being leased up, in another words so the Company is making decisions, real capital decisions preparing for the people. And so that's why we bring that up and somewhat is a leading indicator, confirmation of our jobs numbers.
John Kim: And then on Page S-8, you had an increase sequentially in both turnover and financial occupancy and I'm wondering how we should read that?
John Burkart: Turnover, yes I look at it as it from a yearly perspective. So, if you look at year-to-date our turnover for the portfolio is about 55% that’s up about 1% from last year year-to-date and its pretty consistent there.
John Kim: But are you leasing second year faster or turning over units quicker?
John Burkart: We are and it's kind of get about to the change of strategy where the software would typically holds unit vacant at above market rent trying to find the peak of the market so to speak. And so we're making that modification and a few others we’ve reduced our vacant days down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. And still good morning. So, it’s unlike if we use a word analogy you were a mood ring did you wear that in the last year it would be kind of nice shade of blue and it’s now kind of brownish. I don’t know if you wear mood ring, but it did that would probably be the right analogy. And you’re talking about the soft lending scenario in 2017. But so often our expectations of whatever happens to the future, it’s hard identify until they actually happen. So, the point is, I know you’ve mentioned behaviors of municipalities and behaviors of lenders to kind of cut off the supply chain to some degree. But is that all that’s kind of pinging on what could either pivot from being a soft lending to something materially worst than that, because if you were to kind of just plod how your view has changed over the past year, it would suggest that it could be something worst than that soft lending in 2017?
Michael Schall: Well, Rich only you could phrase a question like that. I appreciate it, I guess I would say I’m not sure what color this should translate into is, I would say is we are cautiously optimistic.
Rich Anderson: Well, green is jealous.
Michael Schall: Okay. Well, we need to send me that wheel, the motion wheel. But, I think we are cautiously optimistic. We think we’re, it feels timing to be like starting to be late cycle and so that is one element of caution be the weaker GDP report looks great, but the jobs are decelerating. So, we see a lot of inconsistencies out there in the marketplace and that cause the great deal is concern. We feel pretty good about the supply projections, there is been a lot of time on them. If we miss that, it’s our bad. So the broader issue I think is what goes on in the economy, and we’re always concerned about that and especially over the last several years where we just every time it seems like we’re getting a little bit of momentum something come better to wood work to knock it again down. So, I guess cautious optimism is what I would get, as it relates back to supply, just look back. So, if you get, what there's been 7% to 12% rent growth in Northern California for four years guess what’s going to happen, every piece of land it's available to put some apartments and its going to be build. And that is predictable. And so the current pipeline deliveries is really a function of the extraordinary rent growth we had over the last several years. Normally, half of those sights there were some portion of those sites would not have been build able and so and then this is what always seems to happen as they get delivered in a different economic environment and soften conditions further so this is what causes the greater volatility of Northern California and Seattle again with better long-term growth rates overtime. So I think it's just various function of what's happened in the function of history again huge rent growth making every deal work and then have been all of that hit the development pipeline at the same time and then delivered at the same time. Again as you are looking at development deal today versus looking on it two or three years ago it is completely different world out there you don’t have the expectation of rent growth that you had couple of years ago you don’t have this financing infrastructure from the banks and specialty that have become much more conservative and you got a backlog in the cities and a variety of other constraints so we feel very comfortable that we are not materially up as it relates to with the current conditions and what's going to be build that comes out of this for those reasons. So again from my perspective it's all about the economy.
Rich Anderson: Okay, I guess as it seems to me that you get 12% rent growth then you're destined to get, have these wide swings as you describe, but I guess it's just, maybe different this time I don’t know, but if you recall back to when the year to before Northern California went to heck. And if you guys saw that coming as clearly or do you think it's just there is so much more information well now you just had a at more of an advantage to see this things coming a little bit more clearly?
Michael Schall: Well, I think to comment we saw the supply coming definitely where we miss is what's going on with the economy when the economy paying, so we didn’t see how correctly the mortgages became in 2007 and 2008. We didn’t know that. And then the impact of that was something that clearly we didn’t see, we have I think a very good idea what the supply was going to be. But I don’t really, and again this is where our asset doubles, something that keep you awake at night because we just didn’t see that asset double develop. And we didn’t see if lowered up in the days when you go back into the internet boom/bust period we will be coming a lot more conservative. We were moving our portfolio pretty dramatically from Northern California to Southern California because we didn’t believe in the rents and we didn’t believe in the sustainability. And so actually I think that we play out when pretty well, but again did we see the magnitude of the economic sort of disaster that happen when the internet companies in floated, no I don’t think we've got that one right either.
Operator: Our next question is from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Conor Wagner: And as you guys, you mentioned the development is leasing up and the aggressive pace or at the pace that they had to do there. How do you guys anticipate things going when most of these lease up turned within a year of the development. Do you have any idea what impact that will have on the market or are you trying to position yourself for that in anyway?
Michael Schall: Conor, it's a great question. I will just start trying to figure out how to put that into my call comments because I think it remains to be seen, it's enormous question. Developers, there's a limit on which they can offer concession and that limit in effect what it does is it pressures the first renewal to huge extent. And if you're -- in essence, it becomes a something that fills up their buildings quickly sometimes with the wrong tenants, and so when there're first lease renewal come, you end up with either another concession or people that have to leave in fairly large numbers. So, I'm not sure exactly how that's going to play out, I think that that is been big problem with a lot of people that are moving into San Francisco for example or San Jose because they can now afford it. And even though they are relying on that 16% concession in order to make those numbers work I think you're going to see a change because each of those newly developed apartment communities go from being a leased up with their very unique financial equations to be stabilized owner and when they do I think there's going to be a lot of people who're going to be shocked within their resident pool. In our experience one month it's no problem, at two months it begins to be a problem as it relates to your tenant base cannot generally pay market rent and they end up with this problem on the renewal. And you start getting above two months you end up with a real problem. And I think that we're starting to see that as John noted in his comments. There are some two plus months concessions out there by the time we added free parking and a variety of other things and I think that's going to make for a very ugly first renewal on those buildings.
Conor Wagner: And the impact they'll have on your pricing power or is that sounds like negative for owners who've stabilized that?
Michael Schall: No, no, I don't think so. I think you go back into normal supply and demand. People that can't afford it have to move into more affordable housing which means longer commutes for them and or double ups. And so I think it's a good thing for us because again they become a stabilized owner, they're -- right now they're disconnected from the stabilized ownership. We've got two different constituencies with dramatically different financial objectives. So, as soon they become a stabilized owner they're interested in generating the most rent they can. They're going to have a messy situation in dealing with the people that they let in. They can't afford to pay mark up rent. And you're just going to see another transition within the renter pool. I think it's all better because net-net the places that the properties of best locations and the best property will go back to having the pricing power that they normally have whereas the secondary or tertiary areas are going to have people moving to them that they will probably they will underperform and the better areas will recover these 16% rent with their loss or some portion of that. So, it's good for the area.
Conor Wagner: And then with the diminished outlook the rent growth in the Bay Area, 2017 does that change your ability to do revenue enhancing CapEx in the region or the economics there?
Michael Schall: I'm afraid it does, because again if they can offer on your A product to 16% discount you're going to compress As and Bs and the -- we have premium somewhere between the difference between the A rent and the B rent and so your premiums that you're going to achieve on your rehab properties will likely change a little bit and then be lower. And so, from our perspective, I would aspect the volume of turns in our rehab program to moderate or decline, and as we become more selective and find the market that can get the premiums that we need in order to make the number for us.
Operator: Our next question is from Drew Babin from Robert. W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hi. Quick question on your expense growth side given the market forecast from the deceleration from next year is there anything you might be differently next year relative to this year in terms of running when you normally do earnings that you’re doing specifically there?
John Burkart: Yes. This is John. A couple of comments there, to the skit market get slower there is commonly and there is been a little bit more on market. So, cutting back to necessarily work in that spend but, we are pretty focused on procurement and FX and really refining some of our pricing and taking advantage of our largest scale here. So, that’s working for us at this point in time. And I think that two will work together will end up that at a reasonable spot. But, normally when the market slows down there is been a little bit more in marketing and that’s often which is expenses up a little bit. And the other thing just to note, in California we have the minimum wage growth so that is effecting lower wage positions like the turnover, the landscape security the effective rate going up at about a 7.5% rate a year, it’s not the same each year, but effectively that’s what’s happening for several years so that is putting pressure, upward pressure on those different area and where we’re working to offset that various ways.
Drew Babin: Okay. That’s helpful. And secondly, Alameda County had posted -- it wasn’t the worst, but had a decent amount of sequential revenue growth deceleration. Is that a product that Alameda County just having the most robust growth last year? Or is that an indication that the new supply in downtown San Francisco, San Jose the impression expression are aggressive but not to draw from lower price point further out in the suburbs?
John Burkart: Yes, it’s more of the later. It’s a -- it's benefitted from people moving out there for affordability and now you can see the reverse of that as people search them back as there is not as much rent pressure in San Francisco and San Jose.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kodish from Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Michael Kodish: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a one quick one. And I’m sorry if you answer this previously but, in your developments at 500 fulsome, I believe cost went up about 35 million on the – underlying assumption changed. Do you know what drove that cost increase?
Michael Schall: I do. This is Mike Schall again. The same things that we’ve been talking about as it relates to the broader issues and development it was driven by delays number one in terms of getting through the city process and construction cost growing at double-digit rates which out-script our expectations for that property. And so, again back to these conditions that are leading to lower supply obviously we’re not immune from those conditions and that 500 fulsome deal is a good example of that.
Michael Kodish: And is the same thing kind of happening with the Galloway Hacienda and Pleasanton? I mean, is that part of the under the same issues there?
Michael Schall: No, it really isn’t because that was started couple of years ago, so again 500 fulsome we just signed the contract with the general contractor. Finish up the city requirements. We hope to have done that several months ago. And again the delays and movement of cost increases are really the reason for that cost bust. And Hacienda was fortunately done before that. Again, this is one of the reasons why we are trying to decelerate the development pipeline. The bottom of the cycle we end up with really good cruise because it's not that much going on. Cities are helpful, trying to push deal through. At the top of the cycle, it's sort of the opposite. The cities are trying to increase fees, increase supportability requirement; have greater say in the product that's been built. They are less motivated actually to get the construction workers back working because the construction workers are really busy. And so, this is why we tail back the development at the top of the cycle.
Michael Kodish: Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on that, with cost up and pricing power down, how is that affected your yield functions on 500?
Michael Schall: It was certainly had an impact. I think were in the 4 and 3 quarter percent expected cap rate un-trended 500 fulsome where I was somewhere around the 5 to 4.
Operator: Our last question will come from Jordan Saddler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, guys. It's Austin Wurschmidt, here. Mike, you mentioned early in the call that the concentration of supply is contributing to the heavy concessions by developers, and I was just wondering if that concentrations spreads further out. And if so, could we see that concessions start to abate before our overall supply actually abate?
Michael Schall: That's a good question, we do have some increase in Oakland for example in terms of development but again off a very small base and so we don’t see that is that's a major issue. I think it has more to do with California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 where California is trying to create a residential model that is going vertical as opposed to horizontal and trying to eliminate urban sprawl. And the way to do that is to have high density projects on all the major transit hubs. So, later seeing is greater concentrations of apartment buildings and actually condos and other housing in an effort to become more efficient from an environmental perspective. And I don’t think that that changes, so I think that, again, in the Bay Area, we need to go through a map which is upgrade of our public transit system and but I think you are going to see more and more residential construction just on the main trends at lines at all in that urban core I do not think that's going to change anytime in the next several years. And I think, if that access a further supply constraint that is a more recent phenomena.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for that. And then just lastly on the investment side you mentioned last quarter you were previously working on some acquisitions. Did those just get push further out or does anything change with the deals you were previously looking at?
Michael Schall: No, we do have some acquisitions that remained in the process. We're trying to 10/31 Exchange which has caused us to push out some of the closing dates. And again, we'll be more active in the fourth quarter, so you'll start seeing a few deals closed, again funded with disposition proceeds.
Operator: I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comment.
Michael Schall: Thank you. While in closing, we appreciate your participation on the call and look forward to continuing the conversation with many of you at the NAREIT Conference in a couple of weeks. So have a great weekend. Take care. Thank you.
End of Q&A:
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as other information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. And thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second-quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, our commentary on quarterly results and market conditions; second, an investment market update; and finally, the latest on rent control proposals in California. So, on to the first topic. The second quarter was challenging operationally, as job growth was weaker than expected in several key markets, often coinciding with peaking apartment supply deliveries. With that said, we're pleased that we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter, and are increasing our 2016 core FFO guidance by $0.06 at the mid-point. We are also tightening the revenue guidance range, leaving the mid-point of our revenue guidance slightly lower, largely attributable to reduced rent growth expectations in northern California. Once again, I thank the Essex team for their focus and effort in driving bottom-line growth in a demanding and changing environment. Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to outpace the slow growth national economy, which we now estimate will produce 2016 job growth of 1.8%, down from our prior estimate of 2%. Throughout our California markets, we have pockets of strength and weakness, coinciding with the quantity of new apartment deliveries, and the level of concessions being offered by landlords. In response to these conditions, we have lowered our 2016 market rent forecast by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Page S-16 of our supplemental package. Generally, B-quality apartments and locations continue to perform better than As, as lower price points become more important to renters as affordability pressures increase. In my 30 years at Essex, I have not seen the divergence and performance between Seattle and northern California that we're currently experiencing, and our Seattle results have been a huge positive surprise. The economies of Seattle and northern California have a large tech component, and thus usually follow a similar path in terms of rent growth. Seattle generates more housing supply measured as a percentage of stock, which has historically moderated its long-term rent growth, again relative to northern California. The cause of this divergence is largely on the demand side, driven by job growth. To demonstrate this, I'm going to refer to non-seasonally adjusted job growth from January to June, primarily because the year-over-year job numbers are significantly influenced by the strong second half of 2015. Seattle had the strongest job growth for the first half of 2016 compared to each of the past six years, and the margin of out-performance is notable. In 2015, which you likely will recall was a very good year, Seattle increased total jobs for the first half of the year by 30,000. The comparable job growth for 2016 was 43,400 or 44% more jobs added relative to 2015. To contrast this with Northern California, in January through June 2016, we added 27,000 jobs down from 44,100 in the comparable period of 2015. Based on this activity, we are changing our 2016 forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement as follows. In Seattle, job growth increases 15% to 55,800 jobs, and our 2016 market rent forecast increases to 8.5% from 6.1%. In northern California, job growth is reduced from 93,100 to 74,200, and our 2016 market rent forecast goes from 6.5% to 3.8%. We still believe that our apartments located in the centers of technology and innovation will deliver above average rent growth. This belief is supported by the integration of technology into virtually every part of our lives, resulting in high growth expectation, higher income levels, and better wage growth. Southern California remains on track to achieve our targets for 2016. There are, however, pockets of supply that impact price in certain sub-markets. Overall, we had solid results through the south land, especially in L.A. and San Diego. As a result, we're leaving our 2016 rent growth expectations unchanged. As noted on our last call, apartment supply deliveries are inherently lumpy, which affects market rents based on the concession level and other pricing considerations. Last quarter we estimated that approximately 70% of the 2016 supply will occur in the second and third quarter in San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles. In San Francisco and San Jose, we expect apartment supply to begin to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect new deliveries of apartments in 2017 will fall about 20% to 30% in San Francisco and 30% to 40% in San Jose. Second topic, investment markets. Our 2016 guidance called for $400 million to $600 million in acquisitions, and $200 million to $300 million in dispositions. Through the second quarter, we've acquired around $150 million and disposed of about $110 million, including our pro rata share of co-investments. We've also added approximately $67 million to the outstanding balance of our preferred equity investments. We are working on several acquisition deals that we expect to be largely funded through dispositions. With this activity, we should be in the range of our guidance assumptions for acquisitions, and at the high end of the range for dispositions. We also have about $50 million in potential preferred equity transactions that are being underwritten. During the quarter, the stock traded at or marginally below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions and dispositions challenging to execute. We continue to wait for market conditions that allow accretive transactions, strongly preferring that to acquisitions or dispositions that accomplish little with respect to growth in NAV and core FFO per share. We will also continue to selectively call the portfolio, re-investing in lower-risk or higher-growth opportunities. Cap rates have been stable for the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology. From time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub for cap rates. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property. While rental growth rates are moderating, so is the cost of debt, such that the percentage of positive leverage on real estate deals is approaching record highs. We continue to see fewer development-starts in northern California, largely attributable to increased cost of construction, and discipline shown by lenders. We expect a small increase in apartment supply in Seattle and southern California in 2017. Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate a 4.5% to 4.75% un-trended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower targets in the near term. And then finally, third topic, rent control. Generally there appears to be less urgency related to rent control now that rents have moderated in northern California. However, the process started by tenant rights groups in several northern California cities has led to several ballot initiatives. So far, qualified initiatives exist for the ballot in northern California cities of Mountain View, Richmond, San Mateo, and Alameda. Burlingame remains in the qualification process. Generally, these proposals provide for CPI-based rent increases on renewals only, subject to a cap. These are in addition to changes to the rent control ordinance in San Jose that I discussed on last quarter's call. It is important to note that all local rent control ordinances must comply with state law, which mandates among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control. We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cut-off dates, and the various stabilization ordinances or state law, whichever applies. Finally, in our experience, rent control ordinances generally shift the pricing burden from the renewing renter to the new resident. In other words, while rent control reduces renewal rent increases, it also reduces turnover in all rent control property, which means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people looking for a new apartment, which likely pushes rents upward on the vacant and available apartment inventory. Thus, while renewals will often occur at below-market rates, this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control. That concludes my comments. Thank you again for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. We had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9%, and NOI growth of 8.2% relative to comparable quarter. As northern California has slowed down due to the factors that Mike mentioned, Seattle has strengthened and Southern California continues to perform. Now I will share some highlights for each region. The strong demand in Seattle fueled by the surge in employment through the first half of this year, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenue 7.5% in the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. The sub-markets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing revenue about 5.4%, and the east side, north, and south sub-markets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, growing revenues between 7.7% and 9% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. In the Bay Area, the market has strengthened from the first quarter. July rents are up about 5% from the beginning of the year; however, due to the tough comps from last year, net effective rents are up only about 0.5% from last year's rents at this time. San Francisco and San Jose continued to absorb the supply at a rate of approximately 19 units per month per lease-up, and 30 units per month per lease-up, respectively, per Axial. Concessions have decreased from six to eight weeks, down to four to six weeks. The East Bay has been stronger, however. It has the toughest comps for the peak leasing season. Our two lease-ups in the East Bay, The Galloway and Agora, are leasing up as planned with The Galloway absorbing about 30 units per month, and the 49-unit Agora leasing about 15 units per month. The Bay Area economy continues to be a vibrant economy, benefiting from the ongoing expansion of technology into traditional industries. Numerous corporations have created innovation outposts in the Bay Area, such as General Electric, Walmart, BMW, Nissan, and General Motors. According to a recent study, there were over 50 corporate innovation outposts located in the Bay Area. The next largest concentration is in London with only 10. Office absorption was positive in all three Bay Area MSAs from 321,000 square feet in Oakland MSA to 790,000 square feet in the San Jose MSA. There were numerous leases signed in the Bay Area recently by companies such as FitBit, Lift, Stripes, LifeLock, Tesla, Uber, and Twitch, a video gaming division of Amazon, all combined leasing over 1 million square feet of space in the quarter. Currently there's approximately 10.8 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is pre-leased. LeEco, the Chinese electronics maker, just purchased nearly 50 acres of land that belonged to Yahoo near Levi stadium in Santa Clara, California. The acquisition adds 3 million square feet of space for LeEco's operations, which spans smart phones, bicycles, virtual reality headsets, and eventually electric cars, and is enough for about 12,000 workers. Finally, the city of Santa Clara recently approved related $6.5 billion major project just north of Levi stadium, the largest private development in Silicon Valley history. The project includes 5.7 million square feet of office space, 1.1 million square feet of retail space, 1,360 apartment homes, 700 hotel rooms, and 450,000 square feet of restaurant and entertainment space. Construction is expected to start in late 2017. The southern California region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. MSA, the CBD grew revenues 3.8% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-City sub-markets were the strongest in the L.A. MSA, growing revenues over 7% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. Silicon beach continues to see new investment from technology companies. Google is out-growing its 100,000 square-feet space in Venice, and is expanding to the 319,000 square-foot hanger where Howard Hughes assembled the wooden sea plane called The Spruce Goose. Google purchased the adjacent 12-acres of empty land next to the hanger a couple of years ago. In the Orange County and North Orange sub-markets -- in Orange County, the North Orange sub-market out-performed South Orange sub-market in the second quarter of 2016 with revenues growing 5.9% and 3.1%, respectively, over the prior year's quarter. Revenue increased 7.4% in San Diego's MSA, with the northern sub-markets out-performing the CBD and southern sub-markets relative to the comparable quarter. Recently, Google signed a 60,000 square-foot office lease in northern San Diego's tech-heavy Sorrento Mesa area, expanding its southern California footprint into San Diego for the first time. Currently our portfolio is at 96.2%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.2%. Our renewals are being sent out in the 5% to 6% range in both northern and southern California, and at a 6% to 8% range in the Pacific Northwest for the third quarter. We are positioned well for the second half of this year, and we look forward to 2017, when we expect the supply to decrease in northern California. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, John. Today I will comment on our second quarter results, the state of our balance sheet, and the updated full year guidance. Once again, our core FFO per share for the quarter exceeded the mid-point of guidance by $0.08, although $0.04 of the out-performance primarily related to property tax refunds and timing of expenses. The remaining $0.04 was driven by stronger than anticipated operations, capital, and investment decisions, which benefited the bottom line. In addition, our total FFO for the quarter was actually higher than core FFO per share by $0.07. This was primarily attributed to successful insurance recoveries for lost rents, due to the MB360 fire, which occurred prior to the BRE merger. As for our balance sheet, during the quarter we issued $450 million of 10-year unsecured bonds at a coupon of 3-3/8%, and retired our Series-H preferred stock. Our only remaining debt maturity this year is a $200 million term loan due in November, which we plan to refinance with a new five-year unsecured term loan, and we expect to obtain a more attractive pricing than the current 2.4%. So far this year, we have funded our development equity needs with disposition proceeds, and have not issued any common equity. Currently, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is inside of our target range, and we are comfortable with this ratio resting in the high fives, as this range has proven to have successfully weathered the great recession. With our $1 billion revolver undrawn, a strong balance sheet, and numerous sources of equity and debt capital, we continue to be well positioned for future growth. Turning to our revised guidance for the full year, as Mike commented, even though northern California is facing headwinds this year, we still expect the region to perform well relative to the nation, and produced over 7% same property revenue growth. However, the lumpiness of supply deliveries in northern California, coupled with lower job growth in the region, will impact our full year same-store rent growth. Therefore, we have tightened our range and lowered the mid-point. Our expense growth assumptions remain unchanged at 3.8%. The resulting expected NOI growth is now 8.1% at the mid-point, which remains within the guidance range provided at the beginning of 2016. From an FFO perspective, the projected reduction to same property growth rate is approximately $0.05 per share to the full year core FFO; but due to favorable year-to-date results which have exceeded our original forecast and accretive capital markets and investment transactions completed so far, we are able to raise our full year core FFO mid-point by $0.06 per share to $10.98. For 2016, we are projecting core FFO growth of 12%, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question. 
Austin Wurschmidt: It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. I was just curious if your guidance in northern California assumes steady-state rent growth, or what you've achieved in 2Q or July in the back half of the year? Would you expect there to be a re-acceleration, since we've surpassed peak supply now, and it sounds like concessions are abating a bit?
John Burkart: Yes, this is John Burkart. We're not necessarily expecting acceleration up in rents, but we are expecting to have a better fourth quarter than last year. So our guidance assumes that the rents don't fall off as much as they do normally seasonally, that we maintain rents a little bit better than we have in the past, that we take advantage of increasing occupancy a little bit, and that we continue to achieve what we've been achieving on our renewals around 5% to 6%.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then just switching over to Seattle, you mentioned increased supply in Seattle in 2017. Is there any concern that Seattle could see some similar headwinds that's been seen in northern California next year?
Michael Schall: Hi, Austin, it's Mike. It's interesting, when we talk about how unusual this has played out this year, it almost means that we have to determine whether it's a one-time occurrence, or if this is part of trends going either direction, both in northern California and Seattle. And the answer to that is it's I think unknowable. And it becomes one of the things that we're very focused on trying to figure out. But I think the expectation would be, well, let's go back to where we started the year. We started the year with the expectation that Seattle would have continued good job growth. And because of the supply, there would be pressure on rents. I think we started the year with a rent growth expectation of around 4.9%. So what happened is we got the supply, but we dramatically exceeded the job growth, as noted in my comments. I suspect that some of those conditions will even out. Again, I've been here for 30 years, just had my 30th anniversary here at Essex, and I've never seen this divergence. An so I would say two things. One, we don't know. Two, we suspect that we will see a more normal balance, more consistent with 29 of the 30 years I've been here. And Number three, we're going to be studying it to try and determine what we think the longer-term trends might be. Does that make sense? So the answer is we don't know.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. No, that's helpful. Not to jump around here, but last quarter you talked a little bit about a disconnect between the supply and the demand. Has that started to correct a bit here into the second quarter and early third quarter?
Michael Schall: I'm not sure exactly what we're talking about, but I think that we are seeing -- but we saw the concentration of supply. Are you talking northern California? Let me just try to be clear.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes.
Michael Schall: Yes, Northern California, part of the issue was that 70% of the supply in San Jose and San Francisco hit in Q2 and Q3. We've had some slow down in jobs. Again, I suspect that will work it-self out. The supply picture is declining, fortunately, next year. So I think we start seeing a little bit better pricing environment beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your questions.
Gaurav Mehta: So couple of questions on investments, I think you talked about cap rates for As and Bs. But I was wondering if you would comment on any changes that you have seen in cap rates in northern California, given a slow-down there?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. We have not seen changes in cap rates, and I think you've got, as I tried to comment in my prepared remarks, you have two forces. I think on the one hand, you have lower growth rates. Although, to put that in perspective, the growth rates that we saw over the last four or five years are extraordinary in northern California. So I don't think that most of the private investors that were buying property in northern California had the expectation of the rent growth they got over the last several years. So, I think the growth that we got over the last several years was an anomaly, not a normal thing. And I don't think again that most buyers have that expectation. Having said that, as it relates to the longer-term picture, the private markets tend to be long-term oriented in terms of making these investments. And I think they still see northern California as one of the strongest long-term CAGRs of rent growth generators that there is in the United States. And so they know that, and they play a long-term game. And so I don't think that the attractiveness in the investment markets of property in northern California has changed very much. And then finally, the third factor is you have debt costs that are lower now. And so the amount of positive leverage you have on apartment properties is pretty extraordinary. And we're 26% levered. A lot of investors out there are 60% or 70% levered, and obviously that makes a huge difference. So, I don't see anything in the near term where you can buy a property that yields somewhere around 4.5%, finance it with a lot of positive leverage with some growth over time. I think in this environment that looks like a winner, more broadly. So I wouldn't expect cap rates or valuations to change very significantly at all.
Gaurav Mehta: And as a follow-up on the preferred equity transaction side, are you seeing more products? And what's your appetite to grow that platform?
Michael Schall: Yes, we are seeing more, because of some of the conditions that we talked about earlier. The increase in construction cost and lenders cutting back loan-to-cost ratios on construction loans have both have the effect of property owners or developers need more equity. And this is a targeted program on property that we would like -- that we could own, that's consistent with our portfolio. But it's a unique opportunity in the marketplace. In terms of our appetite for it, I would say that it probably is in the $300 million to $400 million range total outstanding, probably not more than that. Again, it's limited because we're not going to deviate outside of our markets, and we're going to continue to look at property that we could own if things don't end well.
Operator: Our next questions comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your questions.
Ryan Meliker: I wanted to talk about a little bit of a big-picture topic. And it's one that we probably haven't talked about too much over the past year or so that's Airbnb. I'm wondering if you guys have given any thought to the new regulation in San Francisco and Anaheim. It sounds like things are in the works in Seattle, and whether that's going to have any impact on overall market fundamentals, if there's a lot of long-term -- a lot of short-term rentals now entering the long-term rental pool. Do you think that's been a tail wind for you guys over the past couple of years? Are you -- do you have any expectation for it to be a head wind as some of these regulations take shape over the next 12 to 18 months?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. It remains to be seen. Obviously, any product that enters the market for rental is incrementally, puts more pressure on the market, and provides more availability or more supply, so that is a given. It's hard to extract or to focus on that component and determine what impact it is having, other than that general statement that I just made. We continue to study Airbnb, and we have some experience in the area as a pilot program type of thing. And I think that there is so much noise and so many issues as it relates to an apartment community, where if you have people showing up with their roller boards day in and day out, it's generally not a good thing. So we continue to evaluate Airbnb. We realize that again, as you point out, long term more rental has a pricing impact ultimately on the marketplace, but I think it's fairly minimal. And it's going to be something that we're going to continue to evaluate. Over the next several years we'll make some decisions about to what extent we want to participate in that area.
Ryan Meliker: I guess I'm coming at it from the perspective of there's some reports that there are over 12% of Seattle stock has been pulled out of long-term rentals in favor of using Airbnb for short-term rentals. People are running businesses renting out apartments instead of long-term competing with you, short-term competing with hotels. In San Francisco, we've heard something like 9,500 apartments that don't have registrations. And with all the regulation, have you guys looked into trying to figure out what the number, the amount of supply that really would be competitive with you guys is out there that's working in the short-term rentals, or is that something you haven't focused on yet?
Michael Schall: It falls within the area of in a supply/demand analysis, there's always going to be factors you have trouble quantifying, and you're going to make some broader assumptions surrounding. As you point out, I agree with you on Airbnb to the extent you have more apartment units that are pulled out for a hoteling type of use. Obviously that helps us. The flip in San Francisco, for example, where you're going to start regulating them and they're going to flip back the other way, it's going to hurt you. We have not tried to do that. But again, I think there are other factors that are similar to that to the extent people are doubling up, to the extent that employers are allowing people to work from home X days a week so that they can commute longer distances, and/or connect by telecommunication devices, et cetera, and not come into the office at all. So there is a whole cadre of things that we try to capture in our relationship between job growth and demand, or households. And so to the extent that Airbnb or any other factors might enter into the equation, we would alter our -- it's generally two to one relationship, so two jobs equal one household. And that one household covers both the for-sale and the rental stock. We would start changing that ratio if we thought that any one of these factors became more significant.
Ryan Meliker: But it sounds like that's not something that you guys have looked into making any changes to yet?
Michael Schall: No, that's not the right answer. In fact, right now we're, as I mentioned on the last call that, based on the job growth in various sub-markets, we could not explain why X amount of job growth, well, let's take L.A. for example. 176,000 jobs, given what I just said, should give us somewhere around 85,000 households, and they're producing 32,000 units of total supply, so there should not be an issue there. So, having said that, that's at a two to one ratio, our tendency is actually starting to push the two to one up to a higher ratio, and actually doing that in connection with affordability, as well, because people make different decisions based on relative affordability of apartments within a marketplace. It's all part of a discussion, but it's a larger discussion than Airbnb, is my point.
Operator: Our next questions come from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: I guess, sticking with affordability, can you talk about how rent to income metrics or any other ways that you measure affordability have changed over the last year?
Michael Schall: Yes, Nick. They are increasing, and have increased. This is Mike Schall again. And again, going back to northern California last year, for example, where we had an incredible surge in rents, it pushed the affordability in San Francisco to about where we -- it's well over the long-term high. We have that at almost 29%, and the long-term average is 26.5%, and the high is 33.1%. So we're starting to push beyond that range that people can afford. And our view is that affordability basically is constrained. It doesn't mean that if it's super cheap that's good. Having a very low ratio of community, you just have too much housing in the marketplace, and that's obviously not a good thing, either. But there are a couple markets in San Francisco and the Bay Area that are pushing that ratio to a level that we haven't seen in a couple decades, so that is an area of concern. Having said that, with rents moderating this year and personal incomes increasing it helps take pressure off of that ratio, so, again, my view is that last year we got -- let's say two years of rent growth in northern California, and there's a little bit of a breather. Part of that is caused by affordability, and part of that is pushing renters into the other markets, the East Bay for example, which is where we're getting the best rent growth this year. So it's part of the equation that we consider, again when we start pushing up into the mid 20s. When people are paying 25%, let's say, or higher of the median income in rent, or in their rent, then it starts becoming an issue.
Nick Joseph: When was that 33.1%, what year was that?
Michael Schall: That was in -- I don't have the year, it was it 2000? It was the dot com. But again, it's interesting, because I've heard the comment made that Southern California -- actually there's an Axio chart that has this. But Southern California CAGRs of rent growth is the same as Northern California over the last 15 years. But it misses the fact that rents in Northern California went up 40% in two years to establish this 33% ratio that I just referenced. And the 15 year period misses that. It picks up the decline of rents over that period, but before that in two years rents went up about 40% in northern California. So, again, these things have to all be considered. These are just facts and they have to be explained in context in order to be meaningful.
Nick Joseph: And then quickly on the transaction market, have you seen any changes in the buyer pool, either in terms of the number of bidders, or the composition of those bidders?
Michael Schall: We have. I mean, in general there are a few bidders. But there are certainly plenty of bids out there and it's still an active marketplace. Again, I would characterize it as going from a marketplace where you have many bidders, several rounds of best and finals et cetera, to a market place that has fewer bidders, still pretty aggressive, still looking for product. Still see a number of the institutions involved in transactions. Some have talked about foreign buyers and investors being active in the marketplace. I think the REITs have generally taken a step back here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: I just wanted to follow up on your commentary on Seattle, Mike. This period you took up your market rent forecast by 240 basis points. But it sounds like you're a little bit cautious on the potential impact of supply, in an answer to a prior question. Is this because this is very sensitive to employment growth? And can you also talk about the rent income ratio in Seattle versus San Francisco?
Michael Schall: Sure. And maybe John or someone can help out with this question, in general so going back to the beginning of the year we had Seattle as our weakest market and it wasn't because we thought that there was some implosion intact or even a problem intact, it was just simply -- if just look at the ratio of supply and demand, it has looked like it was more exposed then either Northern California or Southern California, so that's what caused that. Again we do that base on experience history of judgment and sometimes we're wrong, so certainly that's the case in Seattle at this point time. As to going forward, we're going to continue a 3.5% of growth in Seattle which will take care of whatever supply the market can put in. I would guess that it's going to continue to be better than we think, but I don’t know we can sustain 3.5. I still rank our markets as in terms of the variability as Northern and Southern California obviously those big geographies, but Northern and southern California has been more desirable than Seattle because we've seen supply really get out of whack in Seattle in prior cycles. So that's how we would judge California has all these various other elements where they try to convert from the suburban type housing profile to more of an urban high rise residential around transit that's going to be a long-term difficult thing to do and I think it will have the overall impact of muting supply deliveries. So I guess that's why we give California the urban core coastal California markets a little bit of a positive relative to Seattle. As it relates to rent to median income Seattle's current ratio is around 21%. The long-term average is around 18%, so this is a good example of the long-term average not be all that meaningful, you might say yes there is plenty of room for rents to grow there because it's only 18%. The problem is its 18% because there is too much affordable housing in the marketplace. So the lower that ratios get the less pricing power you generally have in the marketplace. So that's why I say that rent to income acts mainly as the constraint modest sort of a driving force. So there is plenty of room for price I know Seattle has very high median household income levels in the $80,000 to $90,000 range and the rents are pretty attractively priced. So I don’t see that is the constraint.
John Kim: So sticking to Seattle, it's not part of your development pipeline, so is your preferred method to increase exposure through the preferred equity investment and through selective acquisition?
Mike Schall: Yes, I think we would look to trade assets in Seattle and actually we're looking at the same strategy up and down the coast, not necessarily for example trading out of Northern California and in the Southern California which we have done in the past, we don't think we are the point at that point in time. Again the thing that makes us more cautious in the Seattle in the long-term its ability to product a lot of housing, so it's going to probably remain our third choice looking at things very big picture relative to the three markets, Northern and Southern California and Seattle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Tom Lesnick: I guess, first, it looks like a lot the supply is concentrated in San Francisco proper and San Jose. What are the necessary conditions for that oversupply issue to being the spread out size of San Jose and the Bay Area? And what is the looks like the scenario for further slowing in quality job?
Mike Schall: This is Mike again and John Eudy who heads development and is Chief Investment Officer along with Craig Zimmerman can maybe comment this as well. I think it's just rent and cost to bill, so you need really high rents in order to pencil a development deal and where do you find those really high rents, you find them in San Francisco proper and on the peninsula and in San Jose and to some extent in various parts of LA which again it has more supply than that has had over the last several years. So that's what moderate construction outside of the core areas, the rents are quite as high, construction costs are pretty around similar. And I guess the issue that this bring up is how deep is the A tranche of the rental market because now that it has several years of delivering aids into that top tier. How deep is that, how long can you continue to get those, achieve those rents before you really deepen down into the B part of the rental pool and you're making some of that top lines of Bs they're pushing them into the A product which is I think part of the problem here. So again we're watching that, I think there is a certain level that which went California need is more affordable housing and the current solutions to this situation are to produce more very high-end luxury housing. And so there is an obviously disconnect that needs to play out. Do you have any comments for that one John Eudy?
John Eudy: The only other add would be the exactions that cities are getting now on the entire side and the burden of the cost and with construction lenders going back as Mike mentioned earlier. You all add that up and that speaks to why we're seeing you need supplies next year in the fall and compare to what we're seeing this year in the fire. And there is a lot fresher to try to put deals together but at the end of day the 4.5 cap development transaction allow them are going to come to fruition that maybe being entered about but have to be executed on.
Tom Lesnick: Appreciate that and then my second question having to do with income actually you guys are clearly doing demand forecast, but for this incremental job what is the income mix of those jobs and still how is that shifted over to last few quarters and how does that affect you future outlook?
Mike Schall: Hi, it's mike. We don't have perfect information there. I think the comment we would make is that there is some indication with the quality jobs and Northern California has deteriorated, so another words we're able to rank in all the different industries and what they the average wages are within the industry and so there is more for example in Northern California more lease or hospitality jobs there have been typically technology jobs, but again in the short-term lots of things can happen, actually the flip is also true in Seattle but in the short-term lots of things can happen and if I learned anything in this business, it's don't take couple of bullet points or data points and start creating a trend on because you're going to also up and wrong. I realized that human beings are making decisions have a number of biases and then we try to work through biases as thoughtful as we can, but I would hate to take some very short-term information and then try to extrapolate what it means. And that's all we have at this point in time and I don't think that any of it is conclusive, but I say we're looking at it and trying to see if we can determine what those longer term implications of this diversion that I talk about my open remark. We conclude what you're talking about now, so we just don’t know at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just few questions here for you, first, just going back to Seattle historically Seattle, San Francisco sort of linked as far as health of tech, but it sounds like those trends may have disconnected a bit, so it's your view that the market is disconnected or there is just again to your earlier point about don't take a data point and make a trend or it is just there is a little bit of nuance here and therefore the markets are still late overtime to tech but right now there is just a little bit of decoupling?
Mike Schall: So again I get to celebrate my 30-year here and Mr. Eudy is here for 30 years too and he has been an amazing partner and Mr. Burkart for 20 years. We haven't submission this onetime in 30 years, so now we're going to pay attention to this one diversion and ignore the last 30 years. I mean that's essentially the dilemma that we're talking about. I mean tech is tech. Businesses are going to make decisions. People are going to make decisions based on the opportunity before them and live where they can afford to live in a good place, high quality life et cetera. And wherever that opportunity presents itself, they will find people smart. They are smart when it comes to make rental decisions. They're smart when it comes to make close decisions with most part. And so I wouldn't see any diversions at all. I think the market is fluid and things change. I think you could have some tech companies opening more office space based on where their people want to take that's the possibility. Having said that, as John said, there is millions square feet in commercial space deliver here and you have these tech giants which have enormous amount of cash and enormous financial capabilities that are building deal that are investing these office building. Every part of the Silicon Valley I think has been essentially remade in a number different ways. They work at another staff that hasn't come up on these calls before but there are at least 50 non-tech companies that have innovation standards here, actually John you have mentioned this in his remark. But non-tech companies within innovation centers here because technology is so integrated never thing we do. So Alex my belief is that this is an anomaly not a trend and…  of different ratio was $100 applicable on this call for their our families the non-cash that have innovation centers there is not done this mentioned in this market companies with innovation centers for because technology is still integrated everything we do so alex for my we is that this is normally not trend and as a result of that things will go back to a more normal balance between the two markets.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay and then going to Southern Cal where it's like LA you had a lot of permits I think for biggest metro for permit, you have given what we've seen of the over building of the high end San Francisco and New York where that's all that penciled, is your view that the supply coming online in LA again is all high end and do you think it's going to be an impact as those permits are putting to the ground or because either where it's located or just the size of the market that supply will be absorbed in an normal fashion.
John Eudy: This is John. Number one you ride in LA as far as the total number of permits, but it's a huge market, so we always look at it in sense of percentage and then that kind of changes its perspective, but where the supply is located in those pockets very competitive. There is no question about that. The downtown location and other playa Vista and so it's submarkets by submarket, but in the supply U.S. what is it even in the sense of AB pretty much anything get delivered these days A quality, so the competition is high if you're an A quality building across the street from a lease up it's very high and to the degree that you're B and submarket away is not so much. So as we said Woodland Hills performed well, CBD a little bit lesser, so does that answer your question?
Alexander Goldfarb: So John as if as this stuff comes online, are we going to see in 17 or we're going to hearing about hard stories about two months free all over LA impacting apartments or it's just not big enough to really impact the way we’re seeing and impact San Francisco and San Jose?
John Eudy: I don't expect that Alex. I think that was combination of little bit less job growth and the supply hitting in the fourth quarter and then Nor Cal and Seattle tend to be more seasonal and So Cal is less seasonal so Southern California I don't expect to see horror stories in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford: There was an article on the Wall Street Journal talking about Facebook building 1500 million is for the general public on its land and number of park, I know it's coming along with 6500 new jobs from them, but tech companies obviously is a low cost capital incentives to accept to lower return, do you see this as potential source of new supply in the Bay Area?
John Eudy: Well obviously it's absolutely new supply but in a sense you mean competition with technology companies building multifamily, I don't expect that in the article that I read. I think what was -- what they're trying to achieve was get approvals for their development, there has been a lot of stress of course in rents so they were trying to build a more balanced development where they had some housing as well as good jobs related construction for the office base. So I don't think they're going to be in the business of building multifamily.
Karin Ford: Are you hearing of any other tech companies looking to do something similar?
John Eudy: I haven't, no.
Karin Ford: My second question is just for Mike. Just going back to the cap rate question, in any your experience house of the year and have prolong would the growth slowdown need to be before we should expect to see a change in cap rates?
Mike Schall: That’s a good question and I am not sure I have an easy answer. Cap rates tend to be pretty sticky that's the first thing that happens is buyers and sellers do not agree with the prices so sellers remember the last 10 transactions and buyer think the world is changed. And they so demand something different and so that can go on for some period of time and you would see that in transaction volumes of deals closed. Normally the thing that motivate transactions are financial distress and those type of things which in a world of positive leverage we don’t really see that happen and I am really great economic as well. So I would say that you would have to see maybe I'd say a year before you really saw a real directional change in cap rates. This is again I think you're going to end up with the dearth of transactions in the mean time. Maybe the dearth of transactions will be the indicator that maybe something is changing, but you won't actually see a change for some period of time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Looking the concession comment you said they were down just curious if it starts to spread though other submarkets outside the core?
John Eudy: No, the concession really started, the standard of course was developed at least that's typically commonalty it's four weeks what happen is, concession moved up, people had a little bit aggressive when the demand was in the slow season and so that moves up to 6 to 8 weeks and it's moved down, but other than assets that are head on competition to brand new assets next to a lease up. There is a not a lot of concessions in the market and we do not see it spreading outside of those very competitive zone we believe lease-ups are.
Wes Golladay: Okay and do you have a loss to lease for the portfolio and maybe Northern California?
John Eudy: Sure loss to lease for the portfolio overall is about 5% and for the Northern California right now it's about 5.2%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Rich Anderson: Thanks, still good morning out there, I guess. Angela, maybe you did this and I missed it, but can you break out that $0.11 that offsets the down-draft that allowed you to raise guidance this quarter? Are there factors outside of same store?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, happy too. So we beat by $0.08 last quarter and by $0.08 this quarter so that gets you to the $0.16 right. And we raised by $0.06 for the year, so the remaining $0.10 is really the breakout so $0.05 of that $0.10 is timing related, so these are G&A items and other items that will spend in the second half of the year and $0.05 were really more of the -- by the way I am only talking same-store just that we're clear and the other $0.05 were the really more of the onetime spend. So it's a $0.05 with the lower same-store growth so that's the other $0.05.
Rich Anderson: Yes, okay. Maybe I'll talk to you off line. Let's imagine for a moment like you said that we go to a more normalized balance between Seattle and San Francisco in the future. I guess it's a question for Mike or whomever. How does that not mean there will be a meaningful deceleration next year if that does in fact happen, since Seattle has basically come to the rescue so far this year?
Mike Schall: Rich, this is Mike. I don't know it's interesting. If I would have said to you that we got 5% rent growth in Northern California this year and 12 last year that's 17. Let's say happen 8, 8.5, I think we all are going to be really happy with that because we can't sustain the amount of growth that we've had. Again I think that we missed how incredibly great northern California has done and we've assumed to cut maybe partially because it's done so great that has to very poorly in the future. I don't follow that logic. I don't think that's right. I think that we can end up with a more normal growth rate in Northern California and this business works just fine. So I'd be the first to tell you that getting 12% rent growth in the year we did in 2015, it's great while it's happening but it has a secondary effect and we're seeing part of that secondary effect this year because again it stretches affordability, it has implications beyond that one year. So I don't think that the fact that you see in flow of slowdown this year again relative to what happen last year as extraordinary that we have last year as being somehow indicative of what's going to happen next year.
Rich Anderson: All right, so you're saying that the closing of that gap is a decline in Seattle and a similar level of improvement in the Bay Area. Is that what you're saying?
Mike Schall: Well let's say that the Bay Area goes to be more normal market as opposed to an extraordinary market that has been for the last several years. Again these businesses -- our business was not founded upon 6% annual rent growth for long-long periods of time because income levels have some relationship to rent levels in order for people to afford it. So there are constraints within this industry or within the housing market that will constrain you ultimately. Again, it doesn't mean that we're going to go from being a great market to a lousy market and I think that maybe investors are focused on the great recession which I think was an extraordinary period of time or the internet boom/bust period, where often neglect the fact that rents were not 40% in two years and with all the way back down in two and three years. But nonetheless those things I think are dominate in people's memories but I think that the normal cycles would not be nearly that experience so again I think Northern California goes back to being more normal market. What is that mean? It means let's say 3% to 4% revenue growth let's we're going to add some value in renovation and maybe can add some value in transaction and the business runs well with that.
Rich Anderson: And then how are you able to -- or maybe you're not -- but you had this lumpiness effect to your supply in the Bay Area this year. Is there a way to judge that for next year and have a relative level of confidence that won't be the case again, or is that a wild card as well?
John Eudy: In the sense what buildings are out there it's pretty easy to judge or people drive pretty easy to judge, people drive all the sites that they know what's out there. The thing that moves around a little bit relates to construction timing. What we expect to happen to happen because it necessarily happen, things get tend to be slowdown a little bit and they get pushed into a future period, so to the extent that things get slow down they get push into a future period it's sort of benefited the current are, right. And that's a little bit what happen last year, so it's not perfect but I don’t want to give the impression that we can't know the building, we know the building very well. We literally drive the buildings and detail spreadsheet outlined in each building, what's going on and shift as part see those and when they start to lease up and get occupy that moves around a little bit. That frankly always moves out never really surprises us in the sense of being sooner.
Rich Anderson: Right, so no one is asking you for a perfect crystal ball, but based on what you're seeing right now, you think that lumpiness effect that happened this year -- who knows for sure, but feels like it may be a little bit more of a typical pattern next year?
John Eudy: Currently yes. I think it's really difficult.
Mike Schall: Actually it's interesting, in our economics department we have it broken down by quarter, but they said please don't give that out the phone call because it's not only in timing of construction, but phasing in, absorption rates and all those things get into the equations as well. So it's really challenging to get this exactly right.
Rich Anderson: Come on, 30 years, you can't figure this out by now?
Mike Schall: Way to rub it in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
Conor Wagner: Howdy. Angela, you mentioned your revised guidance from northern California a little over 7%. Could you give us revised full-year guidance for your three regions, please?
Angela Kleiman: Sure, so Northern California is somewhere around 7 little over 7, but I'll just talk about the midpoint, so Southern California up slightly of the midpoint around 5.9 and then Seattle is up from the original midpoint by about higher 20 basis points, so closer to somewhere else 7.7 range. But I'll get you to the math.
Conor Wagner: Yes. Okay, great, that makes sense. Then for northern California, the slow-down you guys see in the second half moving more towards low 6% in the second half. It sounds like based on your view of supply that you wouldn't expect a large drop-off in 2017 in northern California. If you're trending towards low 6% revenue growth for the second half of the year, you don't expect a similar level of decline throughout 2017 that you saw this year, is that a fair assessment?
Angela Kleiman: Well, so you're right about Northern California I mean the second half to get the midpoint is around -- we've to list exist kind of half, but it's difficult to just interpolate that to 2017, so we do know the supply is going to be lower. But we still have to look at what our job growth expectations are and we're still evaluating that.
Conor Wagner: Okay, and then into 2017, maybe Mike or John on that, what's your forecast for Oakland? Do you see that if rent growth in San Francisco is taking it the hardest this year, do you expect there to be a greater impact on East Bay rents or rents that are pricing off of San Francisco?
Mike Schall: Conor, it's Mike. No, we still see muted deliveries in Oakland and again we don't want to go into the 2017 guidance too far. Supply numbers are fine. Barb wears pointy shoes on day like today and she will kick us if we start giving out too much detail.
Unidentified Analyst: But we're on the call. We are all here.
Mike Schall: Put her on the call.
Unidentified Analyst: No, we're all here. This is Oakland, everyone is hearing it.
Mike Schall: Conor, if you want to ask your question it's fine.
John Eudy: No, there is actually about the same supply which is very muted 1600 units roughly in 2017.
Conor Wagner: Just with San Francisco slowing down, I'm thinking more of the -- for people who are looking -- going to the East Bay for a discount, does the slow-down in San Francisco in this year, does that then start to show up more in Oakland next year?
Mike Schall: It's all relative obviously and the one issue we have here throughout California is lack of transit which I think you know a little bit about and traffic-snarled traffic. People in general don't want to commute much right against the borrow line and that's why Mr. Eudy has a couple development deals that are actually near public transit to do it. But basically I think that there will be maybe some because of relationship I think what's happening is again you're putting more in the A category and you're pulling some B, the top echelon of the Bs into the As because with concessions at a net effect that is too closed to with some of the Bs are. So I think the movement probably is more the other way, you're pulling people out of the Oakland MSA and into the City because the net effective aren't that different as I think was happening, but if there is not enough supply, the answer of your question, not enough supply in the East Bay to really make a difference.
Conor Wagner: Okay, great, thank you. Then last one, what was the decision to delay the phase 3 and 4 on the development in San Mateo?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. It's not so much of delay. We should have broken it out into two phase building 1, 2 and 3 and 4 originally to be honest with you because they're not going to be all delivered at exactly the same time.
Conor Wagner: Okay, but yes, just the initial occupancy got pushed back, as well, but that's not related to the break-up?
Mike Schall: Well the site work that we did on the site improvements and its cushy soil for lack of better word we had to firm up, took a quarter longer than we had anticipated and it brought things out and that's a majority of reason for the slow up on the initial occupancy.
John Eudy: Then we talk about construction cost increases. We're not meaning to that obviously because the cost we're also increased and we chose to just do the front half, it also front half of the building as well. It's a verity of things but as John said, typically we have multiphase projects we do break them out right up front and this case we want them all together.
Mike Schall: And this cases four separate legal parcel buildings sounding park though there individual buildings few well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Richard Hill: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Just a quick question. Obviously a tremendous amount of focus on San Francisco, I think you touched upon this a little bit earlier, but I'd like to get a little bit more color and clarity on what you're seeing in San Francisco between Class A and Class B. It's really all the weakness that you're seeing in the Class A space, and are you seeing more strength in the Class B? How's that working out? Any color you could give would be great.
John Eudy: Sure, this is John. There's no doubt that the Class A is highly competitive because of the new developments that are out there. As far as Essex's portfolio and what we breakout, we don’t have very many assets in that area, so we have so we have Fox Plaza and Park West, and both of those are older assets. So there's renovations going on at those assets and so that impact their performance. They are impacted a little bit but not in all to the same level as the A product that’s out there, that’s going head to head with the other product that's coming on. Most of the B product is impacted to some extent but not at it all to the same degree.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions.
Tayo Okusanya: My questions have been answered, but a quick one I had, just in regards to July trends, and especially in areas where there's still concern about new supply. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing, whether it feels like there's some type of stabilization, or whether there's a lot of competition and concessions going on?
Mike Schall: July is rolling through just like June. June was an up-tick from May, the markets not as described it's been on fire but when you say are there more, its sounds like that you are looking for a tick down and more concessions going on, we are not seeing that. Usually July, though, is the peak leasing season. So you won't truly expect to see that item.
Tayo Okusanya: Got it okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead with your questions.
Dennis McGill: Hi, thank you for squeezing it in. Just a bigger picture one for you, Mike. When you talk -- the industry in general I think is looking at the lending environment and seeing tighter lending criteria, and assuming that's going to be a governor on supply. But at the same time, I think as you alluded to, cap rates haven't moved and valuations haven't moved. Has there been times in the past where those two things can disconnect, where lenders are pricing in more risk but investors are not?
Michael Schall: I guess -- Dennis, and welcome to the call, that would something -- I don’t think I have seen in 30 years as well. The lenders let's say, were not particular in the second half of the cycle somewhere. And the lenders at some point tend to get more aggressive, John and I have seen loan to cost or actually loan to value than a construction loan gets to 75%, and now we are somewhere in the 55% to 60% loan to cost. I don’t think we have ever seen really this amount of discipline by the lenders ever. So I would just say, kind of an extraordinary time and that -- I think the banks have been -- it's probably a bad word, but somewhat neutered in terms of what they are able to do probably for fear of too big to fail and a variety of other political issues.
John Eudy: The regulatory hangover from the last drop-down left a lot of baggage where they're being watched extremely closely, and I think they are overacting a little a bit because they have to, and that’s what's coming in. It's not a conscious disconnected to discipline area disconnect from regulatory both looking out for sure, that’s what I think.
Mike Schall: Yes, it's great. And does that help Dennis?
Dennis McGill: Yes, it does. Appreciate it, thank you. 
Operator: Okay, thank you. Well this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Schall for closing.
Michael Schall: Okay, great thanks operator. So thank you once again very much, appreciate for your participation on the call, I have say that I am incredibly grateful to be able to lead such an amazing Company over the last several years and really over a 30 year has an quite an excellent. So that said, we wish you all a safe and relaxing end of your summer of 2016. And we always look forward to continuing the discussion next question. Thank you and good day.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question and answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call. First, comments on Q4 and market conditions. Second, investment activities. And finally, an update on rent control proposals Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the first quarter of 2016. For the past several years, one of our primary operating goals has been to grow core FFO per share. I congratulate the Essex team for accomplishing that goal with over 100% increase in core FFO per share since Q1 2011. Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to perform well and we are on track to achieve our 2016 market rent forecast shown on page S16 of the supplement. Recent job reports have generally equaled or exceeded our expectations. In Southern California, we have modestly increased our market rent growth expectations from 5.2% to 5.5%, again mostly related to better-than-expected jobs representing more evidence that our thesis for slow and steady growth continues. For Northern California, we are lowering our economic rent growth forecast from 7.5% to 6.5%. As noted on our last call, supply deliveries during the typically weak fourth quarter caused lower rent growth in Northern California. Mostly focused on three submarkets, Dalston market in San Francisco, the Peninsula South of San Francisco and North San Jose, which combined account for approximately 7% of our same-store NOI. As reflected in our Q1 results, we experienced a choppy but nicely down from Q4. March and April have bought renewed pricing pressure focused on these three submarkets in the form of greater concessions, often equal to six to eight weeks of rent as newly delivered apartments push rapid absorption in a competitive market. The greater concessions provide enough incentive to draw people out of nearby properties pressuring price for stabilized communities. Apartment supply deliveries and hiring are inherently lumpy and much like Q4 2015 and the past couple of months, conditions can change quickly. John Burkart will elaborate further in his comments. Turning to Seattle. We have significantly increased the economic rent forecast for Seattle from 4.9% to 6.1% as its great job growth and strong economy has provided the demand to absorb Seattle's significant new apartment pipeline at higher than expected rents. On to the second topic, investments. During the quarter, we originated a preferred equity investment on an apartment development consisting of 494 apartment homes located in Glendale, California. The investment provides a 12% preferred return on outstanding principal with a total commitment of $47 million. We are working on other preferred equity transactions as developers are finding themselves in need of additional equity given construction cost increases, more conservative construction lending standards and more challenging and expensive entitlement processes. Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate around a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria and we are not likely to lower our target in the near term. There has been widespread discussion of increasing cap rates in the West Coast markets. Two of our recent acquisitions, Mio and Enso, both in San Jose, were cited by brokers as examples of cap rates that are higher than comparable properties trading a few months earlier. We take this as a compliment that we acquired property at a better than market cap rate. However, in our valuation, many deals that we have recently underwritten, the value of Mio and Enso did not change materially in the past several quarters. In our experience cap rates change slowly primarily because buyers and sellers don't change their pricing expectations quickly or easily, rather buyers and sellers need to be convinced that market conditions have permanently changed. Financial distress often shortens this process for changing cap rate, but currently there is almost no distress in well located apartments. To the contrary, the amount of positive leverage available to buyers at existing cap rates represents a compelling opportunity in this yield starved environment. During the quarter and as outlined in the press release, we acquired two properties to facilitate 1031 exchanges and sold two properties as part of a portfolio culling process. Similar to last quarter, A-quality property and locations traded around a 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, but from time to time more aggressive buyers will pay sub-poor cap rates. B-quality properties and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property. Now on to my third topic, which is rent control. There have been several new developments with respect to rent control in various California cities, mostly in Northern California. Most notable, the City Council in San Jose has amended the existing rent stabilization ordinance to lower the maximum rent increase on renewals to 5% from 8% previously. The amended San Jose ordinance also contains a provision to bank or accumulate up to 8% of potential rent increases to be used during period that market rent increases are below the 5% maximum. Finally, the San Jose ordinance is applicable only to properties built before 1979. Oakland, which also has been existing rent stabilization ordinance, recently passed an emergency 90-day moratorium on rent increases applicable only to properties built before 1983. In addition to the specific actions in San Jose and Oakland, we believe that tenants rights groups will attempt to win for vote of approval of referendums that will impose rent control in several cities. It is important to note that all local ordinances including the activity just described must comply with state law which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control and rent control can only be applied to property built before 1996. We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff date from the various stabilization ordinances. In addition, because rent control limits renewal rent increases, residents stay longer, which reduces turnover at tent control property. Reduced turnover means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people moving into the area, which likely pushes rents upward on the available apartment inventory. Thus renewals will often occur at below market rates, but this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control. I am incredibly grateful for John Eudy and many Essex team members for attending and advocating on behalf of the company and the industry at several city council meetings. The meetings contain a lot of emotions and often end well past midnight. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. We had a good quarter delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229% from 247 units in the first quarter of 2015 to 813 in the first quarter of 2016. The increased unit turns negatively impacted our vacancy rate by about five basis points for the quarter in the same-store portfolio compared to the prior year. Now I will share some highlights for each region. Strong demand in the Seattle market fueled by employment growth of 3.3% in March, which was above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenue. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made a strategic decision due to the market strength in the first quarter to emphasize achieved rental rate over occupancy and we will continue to do so as we enter the spring leasing season. That decision is paying off well with better-than-expected performance and it will position us well going forward. The submarkets performed similar to last year with CBD growing rental revenue about 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter and the East, North Seaside, North and South submarkets are all growing between 7.5% and 9% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. In the Bay Area, as I mentioned previously, our expectations for the first quarter was that the market would be choppy and then it will be followed by the normal seasonal pattern. However, the market is currently softer than expected. Our same-store achieved rent in March 2016 was about 6% over achieved rent in March 2015 and the achieved rent in April of 2015 are roughly 4% over the comparable month, due to the difficult comps. The BLS survey continues to show strong employment growth in the Bay Area. Industry survey reported March 2016 employment growth rate of 4%, 2.4% and 3.8% for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose MDs, respectively, which are above our expectations. The household survey reported unemployment declined at average of 50 basis points in each MD year-over-year, which is consistent with strong job growth. Both reports indicates strong employment market, which should be able to absorb the total supply of multifamily and single family units and continue to grow rent. It appears that in addition to the lumpiness of the multifamily supply deliveries during the low demand period, other factors are currently impacting the demand in the Bay Area market such as doubling up increase in renters to the single-family homes, which enables more roommates to share the rent, onetime impact of the crackdown of student Visa program which has reduced demand for outside the country and an increase in the flexible work arrangements enabling employees to telecommute from outside the normal commute zone. We have noted a slight change in the geographic location of the open positions listed by the major tech companies with a sight increase in total open positions between Washington and California. However, California open positions have declined slightly while the Washington open positions have increased slightly. This shift maybe the product of a tight labor market and housing market that we have in the Bay Area. Southern California region continues to perform driven by strong job growth exceeding our expectations. As expected, the momentum we saw in 2015 continued into 2016, enabling us to achieve a revenue growth of 6.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. In the LA MSA, LA CBD, which is impacted by popular supply, grew rental revenue 4.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. And the Woodland Hills submarket, which had the greatest positive impact from Porter Ranch Relocation performed at the top of the MSA with an increase in rental revenue of 8.6% for first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. We estimate that the increased demand for short-term rentals related to the Porter Ranch leases increased the year-over-year growth rate for the LA MSA portfolio by about 30 basis points during the first quarter of 2016. Currently our portfolio occupancy is at 95.8% and our availability 30 days out is at 5.4%. Considering the underperformance in the Northern California portfolio, we are cautiously optimistic about the spring leasing season. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks John. I will start with our first quarter results and then provide an update on recent capital markets activity. I am pleased to report that our core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 per share. Although $0.04 was related to timing of expense, the remaining $0.04 was primarily driven by stronger than anticipated operations, which led to another quarter of solid operating results. Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.60 per share, which is 11% year-over-year increase and represents our 20th year of consecutive dividend growth. Moving on to recent capital markets activities. In April, we issued $450 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at the rate of 3.375% per annum. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay off the balance on our line of credit, redeem the Series H Preferred Stock and fund other corporate activities. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use for some portion of the proceeds, we believe it was an opportune time to enter the debt market. Only remaining maturity this year is $200 million term loan which comes due in November. With zero outstanding on our $1 billion line of credit and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet is well-positioned to be opportunistic as we evaluate future investments and refinancing alternatives. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance for same property revenue, expenses and NOI growth and the midpoint of our core FFO per share of $10.92. Lastly, I would like to highlight a new page S12.1 in our supplemental which provides additional disclosures on our revenue-generating and non-revenue generating CapEx spending. We hope these enhanced disclosures will be beneficial to the investment community. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Saddler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question, sir.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi guys. It's Austin Wurschmidt for Jordan. On the preferred equity deals, I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the number of deals you are looking at and the potential magnitude of transactions?
Michael Schall: Sure. This is Mike Schall. We are looking at several deals. So somewhere between around five deals going forward. Previously, we have established an overall cap on what we would consider at 5% enterprise value. I think at the end of last quarter we were somewhere around 140 million funded on the preferred equity investments. And so we have quite a ways to go. I don't think we will get anywhere close to the cap.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the detail. And then just on the affordable housing, do you think at any point that it spurs, I guess, loosening and permitting or zoning for multifamily housing in the Bay Area?
Michael Schall: Again it's Mike Schall. And John Eudy is here and he may have a comment on this as well. It seems like all the forces are working against that. Number one, the entitlement process is just very challenging. If anything, there are some cities like San Francisco that would like to bump up the number of units that are dedicated to below market rate units. And construction costs are going up at double-digit rate. So it would be difficult to see, especially with rents moderating, a lot of momentum toward more apartment development going forward, at this point in time.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for taking the questions.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Yulico: Well, thanks. I just want to go back to the comment John made about, I was a bit confused about, April. I think, you said something about 4% year-over-year rents. Was that for the entire San Francisco Bay area?
John Burkart: This is John speaking. That was for Northern California. So effectively, what happened is rents between March and April were basically flat on a year-over-year comparison because last year normally seasonally rents move up in April. That means that our comparison went from 6% to 4%. And so that flatness is what I was commenting on which is unique in the context of the season. So it's a short window, but that's what we are at right now.
Nick Yulico: And that's your blended new and renewal rent growth?
John Burkart: No. That's new only. Our renewals are in the 6.5% zone in Northern California at this time.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Just wanted to clear on that. And then can you just remind us seen in the entire shore of Northern California region, where are your rents in place today are versus market?
Michael Schall: Do you mean loss off-lease?
Nick Yulico: Yes, right.
Michael Schall: I have that number. This is Mike Schall. Northern California loss to lease, so the difference between scheduled and market rent is 4.8%. A year ago, it was 8.1%.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. One question on guidance. I think for the last two years after the first quarter, you would beat in the first quarter and you raise for the full year 2016. I recognize that part of the beat in this first quarter was timing, what are your thoughts not revisiting overall 2016 guidance at this point?
Michael Schall: Hi. It's Mike Schall. I think John Burkart's comments cover that to some extent. It was that slowdown, from month-to-month actually through the first quarter and into April that was concerning and there was a couple of other pieces too. One is that our evaluation of apartment supply indicates further lumpiness in Q2 and Q3. So roughly in the San Francisco MSA, 3,600 units get delivered in Q2 and 2,700 in Q3. So roughly 70% of the expected annual deliveries will happen in Q2 or Q3. So we are concerned about that and the significance since we renew or turn around 50% of the leases in these next several months, that has a pretty significant impact on the overall result. So I guess perhaps we are being overly cautious but those were the factors that led us to do that. And actually, let me add one more factor and that is overall supply and demand, as you look at the numbers, appears to be disconnecting in some way. As an example or to go through the numbers, the Bay Area is expected to produce about 93,000 jobs in 2016. That would ordinarily add a 2:1 looking at all housing, not just apartments, would give you 46,000 units of demand against about 20,000 apartments and homes being delivered into the marketplace. So about a 2.1 relationship. So there should be sufficient demand to absorb the supply if it comes onboard yet what we are seen in the marketplace is that there is more concessions and the supply is not being absorbed as easily as we otherwise would expect. So that supply demand disconnect is of concern to us. It could be indicative of perhaps employment is slowing, but it hasn't really hit the numbers yet. And the last many years that I have been here, it seems that sometimes we see changes in the marketplace before they actually get reported in the numbers. So those would be the little bit of background on why we decided not to change guidance.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the color. And then the spread in terms of same-store revenue growth between Northern California and Southern California continues to contract for the reasons you have discussed. Do you expect at any point this year for Southern California to actually outperform Northern California?
John Burkart: Yes. This is John. It's hard to tell, right. We right now are expecting that the NorCal will follow seasonal patterns. As Mike laid out, there is a lot of strength if you look at the jobs versus the supply. But honestly it's not necessarily working out that way. So yes, there is a year that it happens. This year is Southern Cal is stronger than expected and is doing very well. It might happen somewhere down the line this year or into 2017.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Stevenson: Hi. Good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about LA County results? Was it strong across the board? Or were there pockets of relative strength, relative weakness in the quarter? Obviously 7% plus relative weakness in probably a strong statement, but where within the portfolio was the best performance in LA County? And was it noticeable between some of the submarkets?
Michael Schall: Yes. Overall the submarket were fairly consistent. However, if we are really breaking it down, clearly the Woodland Hills area got some benefits from Porter Ranch. And so that moved it up. It doesn't really move the needle so much as it relates to Essex. But that enabled that submarket to move up a little bit. You might see it some of the AXIO numbers. And then of course the downtown area is a little bit on the low side, again we have supply going in, in that market, but still doing strong. Overall SoCal, as a big picture, is doing well as is LA County. Really, it is interesting. There wasn't a lot of changes. And if you look at the Bay Area, it's a little different. In the Bay Area, you clearly have San Francisco is underperforming and then you have other market, other submarkets in the Bay Area doing stronger. SoCal was much more consistent.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then in terms of the shadow development pipeline, how many units are you sort of working through entitlement process through that could start the next year, year-and-a-half or so out there versus basically exhausting your land supply at this point?
Michael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. And again. John Eudy may want to add to this. Our view is that we are more aggressive on development at the bottom of the cycle and we scale office, we go to the top of the cycle. And so we do not have a significant land inventory or land bank at this point in time. In terms of deal making, I know John is looking at deals that are fully entitled, ready to go, we are not taking any cost risk because again construction cost are moving so rapidly that we are concerned about committing and being naked with respect to when we commit to a deal and when it starts. So we have turned to become more conservative and again that really provides the opportunity within or for the preferred equity transactions where we can come in between somewhere sum around the 60% loan to cost to about 85% loan to cost and earn a 12% return there. We fundamentally like that business and we think it's a great time to do that relative to the opportunity in the marketplace.
Rob Stevenson: Are you looking at that business as a path to ownership? Or just basically a 12% investment at this point?
Michael Schall: Well, we would love to negotiate an option to buy at the end of that, but we have not really been able to do that. We could do it if we were willing to give up a significant amount of current return. We haven't made that choice at this point in time. So at this point in time, we are happy to earn that fixed return and get repaid and if there are some bumps down the road somewhere, perhaps we are in a position to buy out our partner.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Kim: My questions have been asked. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about refinancing environment with respect to availability of financing for construction lending and just land development? And if anything, if we should be modeling more conservatively if the cost is increasing given some less desire from the banks? Or are you guys not seeing that?
Michael Schall: No. That's exactly what we are seeing. A number of our preferred equity transactions over the last several months have really come together because a construction lender is cutting back their construction loan commitment and becoming more conservative. In one case, the construction lender was at the 65% to 68% loan to cost, they cut it back to about 60% and actually in that deal, we went from essentially, there wasn't a place for us in the transaction, they could finance it themselves to creating this the tranche that we ultimately invest in between the 60th and 85th percentile loan to cost. So we have seen a pretty significant change, not just in one or two lenders but really across the board as construction lenders have become more conservative.
Ivy Zelman: Got it. Well, that's helpful. And then just secondly, I think you or Mike Schall was citing some numbers on expected deliveries and I really compliment you guys on being conservative with respect to the outlook. I think that's prudent. When you talk about those deliveries in 2Q and 3Q, Mike were you talking about deliveries in the Bay Area for all of multifamily or was it just the rental portion?
Michael Schall: Yes. Ivy, there are a couple of nuances there. We do not include student housing and we essentially ignore under 100 units and that's part of it. And I was referring to San Francisco directly when I gave out those numbers. So San Francisco, we have again 3,600 units in Q2 and 2,700 units in Q3. San Jose also has pretty significant deliveries in Q2 and Q3 as is Los Angeles. So again, relative to the total, we see Q2 and Q3 is creating potentially more lumpiness similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter and again in March, April.
Ivy Zelman: And just then keeping with the prudent more conservative guide, when you think about deliveries that are coming from condos and recognizing that many of those condos are being bought by investors that might want to cash flow and rent out those units, is there potential risks that could put more pressure relative to market because we are hearing about that, Equity Residential mentioned, they had someone come in below market against their rent by like $800 more than the cash flow. So how do you guys think about that as a rift to your guidance?
Michael Schall: Yes. In terms of how we approach it, we try to lump all housing together because we know that people move out of apartments and buy condos or homes and some will actually go the other direction as well. So our basic analysis is to look at all the jobs, try to determine what the total households are and really not distinguish between what's a rental home and what is a for-sale home. Having said that, the other thing that we pay attention to is affordability of rentals versus homeownership and in every one of our markets and Ivy, you know this better than anyone, the cost of these homes is pretty significant. I think the median priced home in San Francisco is over $1 million and so that transition from a renter to homeowner is really important to us and it's obviously very difficult in this marketplace. But in order to avoid this issue of, okay, how many of these demand units are going to go to for-sale versus for rent, we just look at the whole thing.
Ivy Zelman: No. And I appreciate that. I am sorry. I may have miss communicated the question, right. What we are hearing is that the condos that are being delivered, those that have already been purchased, has a for-sale unit, they may be an investor whether they are from outside the U.S. foreign buyer that wants to now rent it out. Is that a risk that you have incorporated into your outlook that they may be competitive now in the rental and I guess you are saying you just look at it overall and shelter and every delivery you view as a competitive risk?
Michael Schall: Exactly. It's a household. And so we don't care. Well, I mean we care but it should not effect us.
Ivy Zelman: Okay. No, that's great. Well, I got it. Great. That's really helpful and very conservative. Thank you. Good luck.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Tom Lesnick: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple ones on development. I saw your new start this quarter went into the consolidated bucket of 100% ownership. Can you talk a little bit about how you make the risk allocation decision between placing development into a JV or keeping it on balance sheet?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. That was a deal that we basically bought out of bankruptcy about four years ago. As you know, it was an operating property, took it through entitlement and have a substantial low land base of the little over 30,000 a door. We were able to get the entitlements without any increased exactions or inclusionary requirements. So the yield is very attractive and not replaceable in today's market which, the short story is, we are probably leave that on the balance sheet.
Tom Lesnick: Got it. I appreciate that color. And then one other quick one. Obviously with the Agora close to initial occupancy and not being a condo finished project, are you guys contemplating any other condo finished development at this point in time?
John Eudy: We map everything we can, just so you know, which is a majority of our deals. But by your question, it sounds like, do we plan on going to a condo program in it out of the shoe? No.
Tom Lesnick: All right. Great. Thanks guys.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hi and good morning out there. Just a few quick questions for you guys. There was a lot in upfront about, I guess increase in rental homes and people doubling up in the Bay Area. So two part on that. One, are you seeing any dynamic at the super, I guess where are these people coming from? Are they like super high-end renters who just got tired of it and said it's cheaper to rent otherwise? Or these are entry level people who just can't make anything else work and therefore they are defaulting to do this? So one, are you seeing more pressure at the high-end rental or at the low end price point? And then I will ask a follow-up after that.
John Burkart: Let me answer a little bit broad here, Alex. First off,, with the supply coming in and they are trying to get the units absorbed, they are naturally offering concessions and those have been increased and they are in at the start of the process as it relates to some of the concessionary activity and then of course others with the consumer, the empowered consumer and with the information age you have some concession jumpers. And so people are moving around and that causes some pressure then on the next level of the apartment. As it relates to the doubling up, it's really happening at varies levels within apartment zone and you have people that are doubling up into twos, people are doubling up into one, just various things going on and it's all incremental, right. But that incremental takes the hair off the demand that's out there and again ultimately reduce this demand. And so you see it all over. The feedback that we get anecdotally is that the single-family market is very, very high occupancy right now and that again would have taken up some of the demand. And it makes sense if you think about it, the larger unit in effect and you can put a couple of or two, three, four people in income earners and have a nice space. So I think people are finding ways to deal with the higher rent and some of those again means doubling up.
Alexander Goldfarb: So is it fair to say that, the high price point rents aren't the issue. It's more the lower price point renter is more the pressure point, not the high end renter?
John Burkart: It's across the whole zone.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Mike Schall, you had mentioned previously that Seattle and San Francisco coexist on the tech side and that you don't have a disconnect. Do you think that that still holds true? Or do you think that may be the affordability issues in San Francisco coupled with that supply means that the two markets could disconnect on the fundamental side?
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex. Just to be clear, those comments, I think I made in connection with Q4 and the point I was trying to make is that it did not appear to be a tech hiring issue. It appeared to be a supply issue, a supply lumpiness issue. I think I commented that around 40% plus of the supply in Northern California hit the fourth quarter during the seasonally weakest time. But again to the point, it appears that Seattle and San Francisco, i.e., both being tech markets are performing very well on the job side and therefore if we look at the supply side, the lumpiness of supply is being a contributing factor or a driver of this disconnect. As we go forward, it's going to be interesting to see because again if you look at the overall numbers going from jobs and job growth to household formation to supply, it would not indicate that we should have weakness in the apartment area and the concessions seem to be going from roughly a month to six to eight weeks that would not be indicated, given the overall supply demand numbers. But yet here we are and so we are trying to make sense out of why that is occurring. We do not have any at this point.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just finally, you made some comments in the opening MD&A about cap rate maybe softening a bit. Was that normal cap rate volatility? Or were you indicating that cap rates are in fact backing up on the West Coast?
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex. The comment I made was that there were comments in the marketplace from brokers. There was a couple of articles that I read where brokers in the marketplace were suggesting that cap rates were increasing. We have not seen that and the point I was trying to make is, we underwrite a lot of deals and we are always in the market, so we have a very good sense of what's happening in the marketplace. And so we disagree with those brokers. So if that didn't come clear, I apologize.
Alexander Goldfarb: No. Look, it's been a long week. So I appreciate it. Thanks Mike.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Yes. Hello everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So looking at this dynamic of what appears to be still a favorable supply and demand market, yet you have a flood of supply in terms of submarkets. Is that what it is weighing on it and wants to be get through this flood and then we could get the more normal pattern up in rental growth?
Michael Schall: Hi Wes, it's Mike and John may have comments on this as well. Again, we are not quite sure. If you look at these overall supply demand ratios up and down the Coast, it would indicate that we would continue to have pricing power. And again we are seeing concessions on the newly delivered product increasing from a month to six to eight weeks. And I think it's lumpiness but we are going to let this next quarter go by and then we will reevaluate guidance and results at that point in time. So essentially we didn't, as a general rule, revising guidance at the end of the first quarter. It's something that is generally not what you want to do because it's only quarter. So we would rather be a little bit cautious and hopefully we blow right through this period and absorb begins and we are back into a very strong pricing power type of mode come at the end of summer. But we will have to wait and see.
Wes Golladay: Okay. So is that like the velocity is actually going pretty nicely on those new units. So it's just a matter of getting them through out of a little bit lower price point?
Michael Schall: Yes. But keep in mind that an extra month of concession is an 8% reduction in price and when you look at it that way people that otherwise wouldn't move might say, oh gee, at that price I am willing to make a change and move to a brand new apartment unit. And so that's the effect of concessions and it seems to me that concessions are prevalent in the marketplace and they have increased. And again, that's what's causing the softness. Again I believe that the concession can abate much like they did in January and February quickly, but we just don't know exactly how that's going to happen. It's a function of how many units do you have, how aggressive the owners are. Obviously if you deliver new building, you have zero dollars coming in on your vacant unit. So you are highly motivated to rent them. And many of those owners are saying, hey, rather than leaving it vacant, I will try to hit really high absorption numbers and increase my cash flow. Again, they are incented, they have a different financial objective or a different financial view relative to stabilized apartments. But they have a dramatic effect on the stabilized apartment. So that process is going to play out and so we are going to be clearly under a bit more pressure than we have over the last couple of years and we will have to see how that ultimately turns out.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. So is the concession enough to pull people in from maybe from the East Bay into the SoMa market? Or do you think people will still stay in their own submarket?
Michael Schall: No. I think everything will happen. People are looking for opportunity, I have been in this business a long time, as you know, Wes and people are smart. They figure out the opportunities in the marketplace and they go after them. Many of the renters just don't have that much furniture and so moving is not that big a deal. And so if you give them another 8% off their rent in the form of a concession, they are all over it. And so it's a very fluid marketplace and what I suspect will happen is we will go through this period of time and we will absorb the unit. We will get back in Q4 in San Francisco where we think roughly 1,300 units will be delivered and we will have much more pricing power. So it will be a temporary dislocation in the market, is what I suspect.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for clarity.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Babin: Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about the three submarkets you mentioned, the SoMa, Peninsula, North San Jose and what the supply outlook looks like in those markets for next year, once you deal with concession and everything going on now when it might be more sustained just drop off in new supply deliveries?
Michael Schall: That's a good question. I don't have that information with me. I think it will be slightly lower in 2017 relative to 2016, but I just don't have enough focus on those numbers at this point in time.
Drew Babin: Okay.
Michael Schall: Again, the dynamics, let me go back to the dynamics. With construction costs increasing, lender issues, et cetera, it seems like we are at the point where going to start seeing slower development deliveries going forward, just as a general rule.
Drew Babin: Okay. And then one question, going back to a topic that was frequently visited on the last quarter's call, prospects for share repurchase. Do you expect you are able to sell property at cap rates below the implied cap rate on your stock? Has anything changed in the market over the past few months that would maybe cause you view doing something like that differently?
Michael Schall: Yes. Our thoughts have evolved in that area and for background, we have a $250 million share repurchase program out there. Last quarter, we were trying to not use the balance sheet. We were trying to align sales proceeds from properties such as, I think I mention that roughly a third of the Sharon Green sale, we wanted to use for share repurchase. And when the stock price recovered and we were trading at a discount to NAV, we decided to just go ahead and redeploy that with a 1031 exchange. So the evolution of our thought process on that is to go ahead and use the balance sheet because it seems like the dislocations in the stock market. And we had one in the first quarter, those dislocations are relatively temporary in nature and so I don't want to give you exact targets, but of the $250 million program, we have decided to take some balance sheet risk to the extent that the stock trades at a significant discount to NAV. And again, I am not going to share with you our targets and how that works, but practically if it's not 10% to 15% type of discount, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. So we will use some balance sheet and we will look for significant discounts and we will be ready within a relatively short period of time given dislocation in stock price.
Angela Kleiman: So as long as it is after that, as far as using the balance sheet, that will just be a temporary bridge because then we will look to sell assets in arbitrage, public and private market pricing. So ultimately, the goal was to just have it to be a balance sheet neutral transaction.
Michael Schall: Thank you. Yes.
Drew Babin: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes. A very good afternoon everyone. Just in light of some of the commentary you have made about lumpy new supply going forward and some of the market dynamics, does that change how you think about disposition activity especially if, based on your commentary, cap rates really haven't moved at this point?
Michael Schall: Yes. Tayo, this is Mike Schall. At this point, to the extent that we believe it's temporary in nature and again lumpy supply, I don't think it has a significant impact on how we allocate capital. However, if that changed, if we saw job growth dynamics change for example, I think that would be more fundamental in nature and that would change our thinking about how we want to allocate the portfolio. So again, we have these exceptional job growth numbers that have continued in Q1, San Francisco at 4.1%, Seattle at 3.2% et cetera. That's a trailing three-month number. Those numbers are incredibly powerful when it comes to owning apartments. And so as long as those numbers remain as strong as they are and not to mention the amount of wealth that's being created within the technology area, I think we estimated that 10 top tech companies have produced about $1.8 trillion in wealth and obviously some of that is not of the West Coast, but a lot of it is here. Those dynamics keep us excited about earning properties in Northern California despite the lumpiness with the supply.
Tayo Okusanya: Got it. And then just my second question. Again you guys are well known in this space for being data junkies and I know you are kind of doing a lot of analysis suggesting rents should still be strong, occupancies could still be strong. And at least I hear from your tune, you are kind of scratching your head a little bit wondering what's going on, why is this really going on? And I guess the question is, if we all don't know but you had to at least make one or two educated guesses, what will they be? What does that tell you about if that continues going forward or if truly this might be temporary?
Michael Schall: Well, John Burkart and I looking at each other. I hope we can come to the same answer to this one. But clearly the impact of affordability is one that concerns us and generally speaking we think affordability is a constraint not a driver, in some markets it's a driver, but not in our markets. And so anything that affects affordability and John mentioned doubling up, longer commutes, working from home, those types of things would be concerns us and we are back here data junky point, we are trying to find ways to measure them and we have some data on them. And we do have some information about the level of double up, but it's not perfect at this point in time. But clearly, we are trying to become more refined in how we look at this and where we have a disconnect, we are trying to explain it to ourselves so that we can obviously use it proactively to manage the portfolio to do a better job of capital allocation.
Tayo Okusanya: Thank you.
Michael Schall: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good afternoon. I am sorry to keep it going here, but just a couple of quick ones. Getting back to the rent control issue, while you made the point that it doesn't hit you because of your newer assets and all the rest, but is there an indirect effect, do you think, that is playing a role in some of the "choppiness" that you are seeing in the Bay Area? Is there any way to see that?
Michael Schall: I don't think so, Rich, because I would say the opposite, to the extent that people that were forced out of the marketplace can now stay there longer and turnover rates are going to be reduced. The number of units that's actually coming to market therefore is reduced and therefore you should have better pricing power. So on our portfolio, it's probably a net positive just because we don't have that many units, again, subject to what might happen in these referendums because we don't know what cities they are going to be effecting at this point in time. But based on San Jose and Oakland , for example, we think we have probably a positive effect not a negative effect.
Rich Anderson: Because of the turnover factor?
Michael Schall: Because more people, there is going to be fewer units vacating. The turnover goes down with rent control, right. It will go portfolio wide. It will go from 50% to 30% turnover. So you are going to turn only 30% of your unit therefore your units available for leasing to people moving into the area, you are going to have fewer units available to lease to the same number of people and therefore it's going to put more pressure on price as to the units that are turning. So again because we don't have that much rent control product, it probably has a favorable effect on us.
Rich Anderson: Got it. And then some have been alluding to why you haven't addressed guidance this quarter and I understand all of the answers, but to me, I am wondering if the guidance direction should be up or down? I think most people are indicating that maybe you should have raised guidance because you beat numbers in the first quarter. But is it as clear cut as your bias is upward? Or does the lumpiness in the Bay Area put at least them into the possibility list that guidance could weaken in the future?
Michael Schall: I think when you raise guidance in the first quarter, you better be really sure about what you are doing, otherwise why do. We just gave you guidance a couple of months ago. So that's kind of the basic premise of the whole thing. Obviously we are going to push to make the year and next quarter as good as it possibly can be and to react appropriately to changing market conditions. But I just don't see a lot of motivation. I am probably one of the ones that prevented the guidance increase of the group here. And that's the basic background. It's really uncertainty and the feeling that raising guidance after a quarter just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
Rich Anderson: Okay. But at least the conversation was up not down?
Michael Schall: Well, we have had other conversation. We have lots of conversations. And most of the pressure was on up not down, yes.
Rich Anderson: Okay. That makes sense. And then lastly, you talked about some of these supply numbers in the second and third quarter. What are you guys seeing beyond that? Is there a notable reduction that you could speak to for fourth quarter of this year and beyond?
Michael Schall: Yes, there is. However the comment I made on in the fourth quarter on the fourth quarter call about transactions deliver when they deliver. We may schedule them to happen in, I bet a lot of the transactions that hit in the fourth quarter last year were scheduled for delivery in the second and third quarter, but they got delayed to the fourth quarter. My point is they deliver when they deliver. And we don't have, we actually have our people go around and look at buildings and try to see exactly what is being delivered. But having said that, you don't have great certainty with respect to exactly when it's going to be delivered. And it can easily slide a quarter.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kris Trafton from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Kris Trafton: Hi guys. Just wanted to circle back on the preferred equity. Obviously, there's a lot of demand for this capital, but could you speak to a little bit about the supply of preferred capital? And maybe the other players involved that are offering it? And then maybe how you are mitigating it in terms of risk?
Michael Schall: Yes. It's Mike Schall. I think there are several people that are active in that area, different types of specialty finance organization. So we have plenty of competition there and much like acquisitions, we don't win nearly all of the business and part of the reason for that and it goes through your risk mitigation point, is we only want to originate preferred equity on apartments that we would like to own. So it has to meet our locational and other criteria and again, if everything goes great, then it's a good piece of capital for the developer. If things don't go great, we want to position to step in at what would be an attractive price to us. So that's how we think we have the best of both worlds. We have high-yielding vehicle and we also have something that is synergistic with our portfolio if things don't go well.
Kris Trafton: That makes a lot of sense. Okay. Second question, when you are looking within a market and you are looking at cap rates that they are trading at, do you see a difference, obviously adjusting for properties that are just above or just below the year where you can do rent control in California?
Michael Schall: I haven't looked at it really that closely, but let's see, I just look at Oakland and San Jose and then again the statewide law, Costa-Hawkins, has a pre-1996 date and so we have obviously more properties that are within the Costa-Hawkins realm that's pre-1996. But with respect to the cities that already have rent control ordinances like the ones in Oakland and San Jose, that were pre-existing, the nice thing about them is they can't bump their prior date or effective date or cut-off date, they can't move it to 1995, at least at this point in time, because that was prohibited by Costa-Hawkins as well. So again I think our overall exposure to rent control is actually not that substantial, as I look at the portfolio.
Kris Trafton: All right. Okay. And then just one last quick one. I think your original guidance was to have three now developments in 2016 at $230 million at share and you just started one here at $230 million. Is that incremental to the other three? Or was that originally going to be a JV? Or can you just talk to what's updated there for development start guidance?
Michael Schall: The one that we announced is one of the three. So it's not incremental.
Kris Trafton: Okay. So that was originally going to be at 50% or something?
Michael Schall: No. That was always going to be at 100%. I am sorry. I didn't answer that piece of your question.
Kris Trafton: Okay. I thought the original guidance was $230 million for three properties?
Angela Kleiman: No. It was $220 million for the year.
Kris Trafton: That's a spend, not starts?
Angela Kleiman: That's the spend, correct.
Kris Trafton: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Conor Wagner: Good afternoon. Have you seen fewer properties come to market in the Bay Area in recent months?
Michael Schall: Come to market, you mean sale?
Conor Wagner: Yes. In the transaction market.
Michael Schall: No. Actually, there is a pretty decent deal flow out there. And we are looking at quite a few properties. As I would say, activity has generally picked up a bit.
Conor Wagner: And from your earlier comments, I gather that sellers haven't reset their expectations?
Michael Schall: Yes. Again, this is our experience and we underwrite lots of transactions and I can think of a deal in Fremont that we recently underwrote and we got handily beat and on that transaction specifically, that was, I don't actually think that it's closed yet even. So I think it just has been awarded. Again as we look at the transactions out there, we don't see a lot of evidence that cap rates have changed. And again we win some, we loose some, but we underwrite a lot and from our view things have really hung in there, which is what we expect by the way.
Conor Wagner: Okay. And then I just wanted to confirm, earlier you said that traffic at your properties has not slowed down and I know you have indicated before that you think that's a leading indicator of job growth. But is that correct that actual traffic at properties has not slowed?
John Burkart: Well, this John Burkart. I don't think we spoke about traffic earlier, but as it relates to traffic, it's actually up year-over-year really across the whole portfolio. But traffic is a challenging number sometimes. It can be driven, of course by better marketing and a variety of other items. But it is up. It's very strong.
Conor Wagner: Do you guys get the sense then that perhaps renters in the Bay Area because they read the headlines about slowdowns in tech and job growth, that perhaps they become more cautious on what they are willing to spend or their willingness to trade up?
Michael Schall: We are not seeing that in sense of anecdotal hearing about that. I mean, obviously people make comments about everything else, but obviously as been said a little bit earlier in the call, we are trying to reconcile the supply demand equation with the reality in parts of Northern California and I don't have the answer to that, what's exactly causing that to not fall in line exactly as we have expected other than some lumpiness in supply and possible doubling up.
Conor Wagner: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael Schall: Thanks Conor.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Karin Ford from MUFG. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford: Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the divergent trends between some of the markets in Northern Cal and Seattle, given similar job trends. On the affordability side, do you guys track rent to incomes in each of those markets? And do you think there is a big difference between the metrics in those two?
Michael Schall: We do definitely track them on an ongoing basis. And yes, there is very significant differences. So Seattle which has much more affordability, obviously, the rent to income is around 19.6%. And so less than 20% in Northern California, those numbers are in the 25% to 27% range. So definitely affordability is much, much different in Seattle and San Francisco and that would drive what John Burkart was talking about with respect to double ups, the more affordability is in the equation, the more doubling up you would expect to happen. So clearly Seattle, if you look at median income levels are high, about $84,000, which is less than San Francisco and San Jose, they are both over $100,000 but nonetheless, when you look at that relationship between average rent, which are about $1,400 in Seattle on average, this is the whole marketplace, there is a high level of affordability in Seattle. There is not in Northern California.
Karin Ford: Thanks. So just to round that out, where is Southern Cal on that metric?
Michael Schall: Southern Cal on that metric is in the 21% to 24% range. So it is between the two.
Karin Ford: Between the two.
Michael Schall: Yes.
Karin Ford: Got it. Great. Thanks very much.
Michael Schall: Thank you Karen.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Schall for any closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you very much. Hey, we really appreciate your participation on the call and obviously we are pleased with the results and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month to continue the discussion. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your time and participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day.

Operator: Welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. When we get to the question and answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call. First, comments on Q4 and market conditions and second, commentary on investment activities. On to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2015. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 17% compared to Q4 2014. For the full year, core FFO was $0.42 per share above the midpoint of the initial 2015 guidance range. For the five year period from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have grown core FFO per share by 96%, increased our dividend nearly 7% per year and led the multi-family REIT industry with an annual total return of 19%. Angela Kleiman will comment on guidance in a moment which anticipates continued strength into 2016. As widely reported, an unanticipated slowdown in rent growth occurred in Q4 in northern California. Third-party research firms have reacted by lowering rent growth and occupancy expectations for 2016. We believe that the Q4 slowdown does not materially change the 2016 outlook for northern California for the following reasons. First, we believe that 2015 rent growth in Northern California was greater than anyone expected. I'd say, 2015 was an extraordinary year. This context is important, when comparing results because any disruption can appear disappointing. In this case, we expect to go from extraordinary in 2015 to strong in 2016 which is a scenario that we outlined in our 2016 market forecast in connection with our Q3 2015 conference call and we're now reaffirming that forecast. Specifically, we believe market rents will increase by 7.5% in Northern California in 2016, down from the 2015 average of 10.9%. Our second comment relates to the typical seasonality in Q4 which in my 30 years at Essex always occurs, although in varying intensity. Demand driven by job growth moderated in Q4 which is typical as many companies wait until after the holidays to add workers. New apartment deliveries will also vary throughout the year. And so, above average deliveries in Q4, along with lower demand can cause temporary softness until demand recovers, typically by early February. We estimate that Q4 deliveries of apartments in Northern California represented about 44% of the roughly 10,000 apartments delivered in all of 2015, versus 35% and 25% in Q4 2014 and 2013, respectively. John Burkart will summarize January results in a moment, giving us confidence that the Q4 slowdown is not indicative of a trend. Our final point relates to our estimation of excess demand relative to supply in 2016. In our market forecasts, again unchanged from last quarter, we project the three Bay Area counties to generate 2.9% job growth in 2016, significantly lower, but still strong relative to the extraordinary job growth of 4.1% for the comparable metros in 2015. That 2.9% Bay Area job growth equates to around 95,000 jobs. Those 95,000 jobs will produce demand for around 47,000 housing units, assuming the typical two-for-one relationship between jobs and housing demand. In 2016, we expect the Bay Area to produce around 18,000 homes, both apartments and for sale which represent only 38% of the demand attributable to job growth. With market occupancy around 96%, expensive single family homes and demand well in excess of supply, we believe that great pricing power will continue in 2016. Rental affordability is often mentioned as a possible cause for lower rent growth. However, these are high income and high cost areas and fortunately incomes in the Bay Area are growing substantially. San Jose, for example, has a median household income of around $102,000 and personal incomes grew by 7.3% in 2014 and are estimated to increase 6.5% and 7.1% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In Santa Clara County which includes San Jose, monthly rents in the Essex portfolio average around $2,500, as compared to median rents in San Jose of around $2,200. The median income will allow someone without a roommate to rent either the average Essex apartment or the medium-priced apartment in the metro area. Nothing in this discussion should imply that we lack concern about the U.S. economy, recent market volatility or the resiliency of tech jobs, all of which are risk to our market outlook. If economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to achieve the macro assumptions driving our forecast, including 2.8% U.S. GDP growth and 2% U.S. job growth. We see nothing in our markets that would indicate that tech jobs are imploding. To the contrary, the tech markets continue to do well, as indicated by San Jose's 4.4% December over -- December year-over-year job growth. Further, our analysis of the largest tech companies indicates that they are growing in market capitalization and generating huge amounts of cash. Who would have thought 10 years ago that Alphabet and Google would be the world's largest listed companies? A comparison of the top 10 U.S.-based tech companies against the top 10 non-tech companies shows just how much the world has changed. The top 10 tech companies are worth around $2.8 trillion, 21% more than the non-techs and have $556 billion in cash, more than twice as much as the non-techs. Approximately $1.8 trillion of the equity capitalization of the tech leaders was created in the past 10 years, over 3 times the non-tech. Finally, while only three of the non-tech leaders are based in the Essex markets, all of the tech leaders are headquartered on the West Coast. We clearly don't see the end of large investments in technology in the foreseeable future and believe that our portfolio is well-positioned for this continued growth. To the second topic, investment activity. So far acquisition markets have experienced little impact from global economic conditions, cap rates have not moved much. At this point, A quality property and locations trade at around a 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, but more aggressive buyers are often sub 4%. B quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A quality property. We're seeing three significant headwinds affecting development in the West Coast markets which we believe will moderate apartment supply going forward. First, construction lenders are sizing construction loans based on loan to cost ratios of between 60% and 65%, down about 5% from a few months ago. Second, cities continue to increase demands from developers in the form of low income housing units, higher fees and costly improvements. Finally, construction costs have increased around 10% in each of the of past two years despite declining commodity prices, as skilled labor forces are inadequate to meet related construction activity. Obviously, this lower housing supply is beneficial to the Essex portfolio overall. As previously announced, we sold the 296 unit Sharon Green Apartments in Northern California for $245 million or $828,000 per unit, at a cap rate in the high 3% range. We used 1031 exchanges to reinvest the proceeds of Sharon Green into three properties that are detailed in the press release. We estimate that core FFO will increase by approximately $1 million in 2016, as a result of these transactions. Our business plan for investments is outlined in the press release. We hope that economic uncertainty will bring more transactions to the market and that financing rates remain attractive. Depending upon the stock price, acquisitions may be funded as part of our co-investment program or on our balance sheet. We currently have two properties in contract to be sold. Similarly, the use of proceeds from dispositions will also be strongly influenced by the stock price. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkhart: Thank you, Mike. 2015 was a great year in the West Coast markets. Our results exceeded our initial revenue guidance in all three regions for the combined Essex BRE portfolio and expenses were favorable to guidance leading to an exceptional 10.7% NOI growth, the highest in 15 years. Our outperformance was attributable to job growth exceeding expectations and lower than expected housing supply. As of December 2015, our markets added 361,000 jobs, compared to December 2014, 40 basis points higher than our original projection of 2.5%. A total of 63,000 new units of supply, both multi-family and single family was delivered into the market in 2015. That's about 6,900 units below our original forecast, largely for the reasons that Mike mentioned including, labor shortages, municipal delays, rising costs and more stringent lender underwriting. The supply/demand imbalance is the key factor behind our market strength. We estimate, assuming two jobs creates one unit of demand for housing, that the 331,000 jobs created is equivalent to about 165,000 units of housing demand, compared to only 63,000 units of new supply delivered, meaning demand exceeded supply by over 2.5 times. The fourth quarter which is the low point in seasonal demand and rental rates in our markets, was relatively strong across all three regions, with the 7.5% increase in gross revenue, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Achieved rents on new leases were up 8.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. We have made great progress in our management of the BRE portfolio. However, we still have more work to do with respect to refining unit amenity pricing, lease expiration management and renovations. Therefore, for the purpose of comparable sequential results, the Essex legacy portfolio provides the best insight. Adjusted for occupancy changes, the Essex portfolio achieved 1.6% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as 2014. We continued to find opportunities with our renovation program. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio143%, from 254 units in the fourth quarter of 2014, to 618 units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The scope of the unit turns are site-specific based on opportunities in the marketplace. Now I will share some highlights for each region. The Seattle market continues to absorb new supply and push rents outside of CBD higher. Revenues for our Seattle CBD portfolio increased 5.3%, while revenue for the majority of our portfolio which is located on the east side near Bellevue and Redmond, grew 8.3% for the fourth quarter, compared to the prior year's quarter. According to Axio, the Seattle market had the strongest year since the Great Recession, ended the year with approximately 8% year-over-year rental growth as of December 2015. In the Bay Area, the successful technology companies continue to lease or pursue space to grow their companies. The technology-driven San Francisco peninsula and Silicon Valley markets absorbed over 1 million square feet of space in each -- in the fourth quarter of 2015 or 50% of the total absorption for 2015. Alphabet leased space in Alameda, North San Jose, Shoreline. YouTube, a division of Alphabet leased space in San Bruno. And Microsoft recently submitted plans for a new campus in Mountain View, with construction expected to begin next year. Southern California region continues to be strong, just driven by solid job growth in each market. The 8.4% NOI growth rate achieved in 2015 was the highest in 15 years. We expect the momentum we saw in 2015 to continue into 2016, given the limited new supply in the Southern California region, although we do expect some challenges in the downtown LA, as that local market absorbs the planned deliveries. Rental increases in the San Diego market have increased each year since 2010 and ended the year up 7% over the prior year according to Axio. I'm pleased with our 2015 results and although I recognize the real economic risk and concerns in the marketplace, the current conditions that we're experiencing in our markets, gives me confidence that we will achieve our plan outlined in guidance. Our portfolio occupancy as of February 2 is at 96.1%, consistent with our budget and our net availability out 30 days stands at 5.3%. We're positioned well to take advantage of the spring rental season. Looking forward into 2016, we again expect demand to substantially exceed supply in our markets by over 2 times, leading to continued rental market strength. In January of 2016, our average achieved rent for new leases for our three regions was 2.4% above our achieved rent in December of 2015, consistent with our budget. I think our momentum positions us well for 2016. Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thanks, John. Today I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8% which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Same property revenue growth and NOI growth for the combined portfolio which consists of the last three quarters of the year was 7.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Both of these also exceeded the midpoint of our most recent guidance. On to 2016. We anticipate another strong year, with 11% projected core FFO per share growth, primarily driven by same-property growth assumptions. Top line growth of 7% at the midpoint reflects our expectation of continued favorable supply/demand relationship. For reference, this midpoint is 25 basis points higher than our initial guidance for 2015 which was 6.75%. We're projecting higher operating expense growth of 3.75% at the midpoint. Controllable expenses are expected to increase modestly at around 1% for the year, therefore, the two key drivers to expense increases are as follows. First, higher utility costs. Note that 2015 utility costs increase was only 0.3%, so very muted, primarily due to water conservation and second, an increase in our allocation to property management expense. This is consistent with what we've previously communicated. We will review this allocation on a regular basis, in conjunction with our transformation plans. The new management fee allocation equates to 2.4% of revenues which is less than 3% commonly used within the industry. The resulting bottom line is that we're expecting another strong year, with 8.5% NOI growth at the midpoint. As for G&A, the increase by 5% of the midpoint is primarily due to our new corporate headquarters lease. The offset to this expense as discussed on the previous call, is the yield from reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of our former Palo Alto headquarters, thereby the resulting net impact of FFO is about a $0.01 per share. For the first quarter of this year, we're projecting core FFO per share at the midpoint to be $0.03 below fourth quarter of last year. The reduction is attributed to one-time items such as favorable variance in the fourth quarter in property tax for the legacy BRE portfolio, generating $0.04 of core FFO per share. In addition, we have recently sold several properties, including Sharon Green and have not fully redeployed those proceeds. The result is a $0.01 per share drag on the first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Other assumptions for our guidance can be found on page 5 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. Moving on to the balance sheet, we repaid $150 million of private placement bonds in January and have assumed an unsecured bond offering in our guidance for 2016. The only noteworthy maturity remaining in 2016 is the $200 million term loan in the fourth quarter. We have several options available to refinance this debt which allows us to be opportunistic. We generally favor refinancing our maturities with unsecured debt that is 5 to 10 year in term, depending on the interest rate curve and the related spreads. Lastly, we're ahead of our schedule in reducing our net debt to EBITDA to 5.8 times, due to substantial growth in EBITDA. Based on recent $215 stock price, our leverage or debt to market cap is at 27%. In comparison, heading into the great 2008 recession, our leverage was 35% at the end of 2007. Therefore with our $1 billion line of credit extended to 2021 unfunded commitments of $230 million which is below 3% of total market cap and with a light maturity schedule over the next several years, we're well-positioned to be opportunistic and to weather any potential capital markets dislocation. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kris Trafton with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.
Kris Trafton: Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the same-store revenue growth guidance. It looks like you're modeling about 100 basis point decrease in the revenue growth rate, but since 2015 rent growth was about 70 basis points higher than 2014. Would it be safe to assume that maybe there's 50 or so basis points in higher loss to lease there? And then, does the -- I appreciate the San Francisco slowdown, but does that really get you all the way down, to the revenue growth rate guidance that you have for 2016?
Michael Schall: This is Mike and if I miss a piece of your question, please go ahead and correct me. But our general thesis has been that Northern California has obviously been the strongest market for a long time and Seattle right behind it. But over time, we expected Southern California to slowly improve, while Northern California which was hitting these double-digit NOI growth rates would slowly decline. I think that we're still anticipating that process to occur, although the resiliency in the tech markets has been a little bit surprising to us, obviously a positive surprise. And so, I think the numbers this year, we have -- again, if you go to the forecast, the market forecast -- we have Northern California at about 7.5% and our guidance is marginally higher than that. And so, we're expecting a little bit of loss to lease usage. That would with the delta in the two different numbers. So does that make sense, as it relates to Northern Cal?
Kris Trafton: Right. It just seems like that would imply a pretty strong slowdown, given the loss lease is higher this time this year, than versus same time last year.
Michael Schall: Well, it was at the end of the year, loss to lease was 2.8% and so it decelerated a lot in Q4. Of course, Q4 was a dip and it is higher at the end of January than it was at the end of December. Again, you have the impact of what we think happened. Again as I mentioned in my comments, we had lumpy supply hitting the market in Q4 in Northern California. And when that happens, some people that are trying to lease up their apartment buildings become more aggressive, with respect to concessions and/or rent levels and when that happens everyone else adjusts along with it. And again, this is within a period that you always have a lower demand for a variety of reasons. And so, you have lower demand. You have too much hitting the marketplace and owners reacting very aggressively. I think that, that as John Burkart has pointed out has largely run the course, because demand has returned to normal levels. Some of those lease-ups have adjusted in price. And as a result, the world looks like it's more or less on track for what we thought was going to happen. So again, from my perspective, the fourth quarter is the least relevant quarter. And I know, seems like the analysts focus on it many times over the last 10 years and I think that they give it too much weight, in terms of the overall relevance of the quarter. It's the least relevant. Things can happen, just given the slowdown in demand and I think that's what happened this year and it's happened many times before.
Kris Trafton: And then second, looks like you're going to be a strong net acquirer next year too. And even though you have a near historic low cost of capital and price, private valuation in apartments hasn't probably peaked yet. Valuations are still pretty expensive. Is this mostly a function of your implied cap rate relative -- or your price relative to NAV? And then, I guess, generally what's the rationale for being a strong net buyer this year, when peers across the board are heavy net sellers?
Michael Schall: I think we're going to be a more aggressive seller and a more aggressive -- well, not a more aggressive buyer, we're going to be consistent on the buy side and we're going to be a more aggressive seller. The question is how we fund that activity? And we have a co-investment program, that if we don't like the stock price -- in other words, if we think the stock price implied return is higher than the asset that we buy, we're obviously not going to issue the stock in order to buy it. So we will go into a co-investment type function. I think as I look back at many years of doing this, we do best when there's a disruption in the marketplace and assets can sometimes be mispriced. And if that happens, we want to be ready to do so. Again, I think the chances -- of exactly where we fund it, change every day, it's change with the stock price. Based on today's price, obviously I would not be excited about using our stock. But if you go back three months, our stock price and the markets in general have been all over the place. And we can't tell you what's going to happen in the future. We just recognize it's a very volatile period of time. And I guess, we would ask people to trust us, to make wise decisions with respect to how we conduct ourselves in the investment markets. It is possible that we won't do nearly that much in acquisitions, if we can't find transactions and we -- relative to our cost of capital that makes sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please state your question.
Nick Yulico: Mike, I think at one point you had said that, back in November when you were looking at the sale of Sharon Green, you contemplated doing a stock buyback, instead you went to 1031 acquisition route. I mean, looking at your stock today, it's lower than in November. And presumably, you would still go out and do a sizable disposition and potentially buy back your stock. I mean, how are you thinking about that today?
Michael Schall: The answer is we can't possibly predict. It's all over the place. And it's hard to run a business and enter into transactions that take what, 60 days to close and expect anything with respect to your stock price. As it relates to Sharon Green, you're right. Originally, we had intended to1031 exchange around two-thirds of the proceeds, pull forward a dividend in order to create some money that we could use for a stock buyback. We changed that plan when the stock was in the $230 to $240 range and decided to 1031 exchange everything. But that demonstrates how we think about the world. We try to again, make good decisions with our eye focused on building NAV per share and building cash flow per share. And it's worked out for us really well over a lot of years and we'll continue doing that going forward. But to your point, it is incredibly difficult to plan exactly what we're going to do, when the world is changing so much. And I would say the same thing is true, with respect to our guidance. We issued our market forecast last quarter. Many may argue that the prospects for GDP growth are not nearly as good today, as they were just a couple of months ago. But the reality is, who knows? We're using a number that economy.com, the 2.8% GDP growth, with the expectation that the economy will improve as we go through 2016. But the reality is, we don't know that either. We try to again, react to the business, keep our eyes focused on the transaction activity out there and then make the decisions. We expect this to be a challenging year, from the perspective of uncertainty and volatility. And again, I think that we generally do well in that type of environment. Certainly, with respect to transactions because things tend to become mispriced and/or there -- it could cause sellers for example, the uncertainty often can cause sellers to become more interested in selling. So maybe we'll see more transactions hit the marketplace. I know on the development side, the construction side, there cost increases and other factors have caused development deals to not pencil the way that developers had hoped that they would pencil. And that could lead to some other opportunities in that area. Again, I don't know what's going to happen this year. And to any great extent, there's so much volatility out there. But we think that we have produced a scenario that makes sense, given the broader environment and we will see what happens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please state your question.
Nick Joseph: You talked about Southern California improving and Northern California moderating. When would you expect Southern California to actually catch up to Northern California, in terms of absolute revenue growth?
John Burkart: You're talking year-over-year, not in 2016, not likely -- this is John Burkart, I should say. But 2017, it's a little bit early to tell, but we're seeing good strength out of Southern California. We're pleased with what's going on out there and it's fairly solid across the markets down there.
Nick Joseph: And then in terms of maybe the relative strengthening of Southern California, versus the moderation in Northern California, would you expect without giving 2017 guidance, would you expect them to meet somewhere in between? Or would you expect Northern California to come down to where Southern California is or conversely the other way?
Michael Schall: Now you're going into the unknowables, obviously when you get into 2017. That's far enough away, that it's difficult to see that far, because the world is changing as you know rather quickly. But I will say that, the other point that I made in my comments what is the impact of wealth, this incredible wealth that's been created by Alphabet -- and I think I said Google, I meant Apple in my comments -- the tremendous amount of cash that's there, the wealth that's been created, et cetera. What is the long term impact of that on the marketplace, as you look out two or three years? And we don't know the answer to that. We think it's pretty positive. And as an example, we can cite what happened when Bill Gates decided to move Microsoft to Seattle and really form that business in the Seattle market. I think it transformed Seattle in ways that we can't really understand. There are books that are written about this and we've talked about them before. But again, this incredible wealth generation will increase economic activity, we know that. It will bring the best and brightest people into the marketplaces and those that own these companies will reinvest those funds, in ways that are generally very, very good for the economy. So that is part of the equation that's difficult to predict, as you get beyond 2017 and 2018. Although hey, I wouldn't count the tech markets out of the ballgame, with respect to growth rates in 2017 and 2018 because of this factor. Again, it's hard to understand it exactly right now. But looking at Seattle as an example, I think you'll see continued development in these markets for a longer period of time.
Nick Joseph: Then just, you talked about the loss to lease in the portfolio. So if 2016 plays out how guidance in your market growth assumptions assume, what would you expect the loss to lease in the portfolio to be at the end of 2016?
Michael Schall: Typically loss to lease will peak in July and the number will be roughly half in December, what it was in July. So last July it was around 7% to 8% -- I think it was 8%. And so, you would expect December to be around 4% and it was 2.8%. So it was a little bit less. But again, we attribute that to the unique factors that occurred in Q4. I don't think that's a normal deviation. So but I would expect another good year. And I think that we will peak in loss to lease probably in July and somewhere around 7% is what I would guess.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Greg Van Winkle: Just wanted to get a little more color on Southern California. If I'm not mistaken, I think your guidance actually suggests a little bit of deceleration in same-store revenue growth there from 2015 to 2016. So just want to understand that a little better. Are there certain sub markets driving that? If I look at some of your peers, it looks like some of them are actually expecting acceleration. So I don't know if that's a difference in sub markets or if it's possible you guys think you'll see some acceleration too, but you're just being a bit conservative for now?
John Burkart: This is John. We tend to be a little bit conservative and try to be thoughtful in how we're looking at the world. And so yes, 2015 was an exceptional year, no question about it. We think 2016 will be very strong. We've laid out the numbers as far as job growth and supply and the market is still very supply constrained. So we do expect 2016 to be a very good year and I think it's very positive. We're not anticipating that market slowing down. It's doing very well right now.
Greg Van Winkle: And then, being in the center of the tech world in San Francisco, I'm curious what your thoughts are on Airbnb? We're seeing some of your competitors, start to discuss partnering with them. And I'm just curious whether you're viewing Airbnb as potential opportunity at this point? Or more of a threat or something you're still trying to figure out?
John Burkart: Yes, I think with -- this is John again. I think with Airbnb or any of these sharing economy type entities, what they're trying to accomplish is really deal with one of their issues which is the prohibition of the leases to sublet space. So a lot of the discussion, people -- I think people think that they're trying to move the apartments into hotel-type situations. And that's not really the case or at least not what I've seen or heard. It's really a matter of trying to work with the landlords that -- to encourage the landlords to allow their residents to under certain circumstances move forward and sublet some space. And that concept is in exchange for a very small fee to the landlord, that is really their goal. From my perspective, there's a couple of issues out there that are pretty important which includes municipalities who commonly forbid this. So that would be another issue. And really the biggest issue is, our resident satisfaction for our current resident. So weighing a relatively small fee, versus the resident satisfaction or the impact to the quality of life to our residents, really doesn't seem like a program that would make sense. We're aware of these things, we watch these things. But it's -- I don't think it's something that you're going to see anyone jump into in a big way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Thanks for taking the question. Given your comments, I guess, on the dislocations you're seeing today in the construction lending market, I was just curious if you guys were looking at any mezz opportunities today?
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike, Austin. Yes, we're. It's one of the areas that we're looking at. In the development area, we all know that there's permits that are being pulled. And those generally speaking do not meet our underwriting criteria for, to get us excited about a development. But we're looking at some of them as it relates to a joint venture type opportunity which could include potentially a mezz type of transaction. So yes, definitely something we're looking at.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then in kind of in a similar light, I guess, given the credit market disruptions. And then you mentioned even some supply challenges in downtown LA, is that -- are you seeing developers bring market -- bring assets to market, just looking to kind of unload today, amidst some of the disruptions?
Michael Schall: It's Mike again. We just don't see that much transaction volume out there of the property that we want to own. There are transactions. If you look at broader transaction markets, there are plenty of real estate [indiscernible] trading hands, but we tend to be very focused on more of the urban and the higher quality suburban areas, suburban transit for example areas and so we're very selective. And that product does not come to market often. And when it does, we're obviously very excited about it. So again, it's hard to anticipate exactly what is going to happen, given all this disruption. We hope for a more active transaction market going forward and if we find that, then you can expect us to be pretty active. But we just don't know at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
Jana Galan: Just a quick follow-up on the investment market and acquisitions, as you're looking at potential market disruptions, are you considering any markets outside of your current geographic footprint?
Michael Schall: No, we're not. We have identified the markets that we want to be in and we're going to stay focused on them. And I think our reputation as a local sharpshooter is important to us and anything outside of our existing markets would be viewed as deviation from the plan. So no, we're not looking at anything else.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford with Mitsubishi U.S.J. Please state your question.
Karin Ford: Have the unique drivers that you described in Northern Cal that drove the rent weakness in 4Q 2015 already reversed in January or is it too early to tell?
John Burkart: Yes, this is John. Let me give you some insight there. I'm going to give you some rents here. This is year-over-year rents, so you can get a feel for what was going on there. So in November, our achieved rents on new leases were up about 10.4% in Northern California. In December, that number dropped to 4.9% and that's what everyone has noted. In January, we went back up to 8.9%. So January turned around and was much better for us in Northern California. And those rents in January, of course, are above December rents and above year-over-year significantly. It's a little early to tell at this point in time, because again, there's still not a lot of transactions that go on in November, December and January. But what we're seeing is very positive. It's consistent with our plan for the year and we feel good about things.
Karin Ford: Would you say January's back to normal seasonality or is it a sharper snapback?
John Burkart: No, it was a sharper snapback.
Karin Ford: Okay.
John Burkart: Really mirroring the drop in December.
Michael Schall: And let me just interject for a second? Sorry about that. But consider, again, I think a lot of it was supply-driven, a lot of supply hitting the market in December and move-outs to buy homes. I think there was a piece of that in that -- with Fed interest rate increases, more people went out and bought a home. And so, we had more move-outs to buy homes. So there were a number of supply factors again hitting in the seasonally lowest demand period. So it makes sense -- what John said, I think makes total sense, that there was a relatively sharp snapback, as soon as those conditions normalized.
Karin Ford: And just lastly, can you talk about any trends you saw in your current lease-ups and give us any details on your planned new starts for this year?
John Burkart: I'll talk about the lease-ups and then I'll have John talk about the starts. But on the lease-ups, what we saw is really a tale of two stories. We have the MB360, where we continue to power-on with high lease-up velocity. In that particular case, we lowered our net effective rents a little bit to keep velocity. In Epic, we kept rents a little bit higher. We have a Phase I and phase II leasing out of the same building. And in that case, our velocity went down a little bit, but again all of this is according to plan. So overall, we finished up the One South Market lease-up in the quarter. Epic, we're very close, we're over 90% and MB360 is flying along as you can see. So the concern that people had, I certainly share. We read the papers and we listen. Reached out to an awful lot of people and of course, including the managers that are running the lease-ups and had good conversations with all of them. And their view was, this is really consistent with seasonal issues, with some level of -- as far as demand goes and then the supply impacting the rents. So hopefully that helps. And I'll let John talk about planned development.
John Eudy: We anticipate three starts this year, around roughly in the mid $400 million to $500 million range, all three of which have older land costs and entitlement costs, that were prior to the big spike that we've seen in the last 1.5 year. We're going to be facing the current construction costs, of course, but because of our basis is much lower, that's why the starts make sense. I can say, if I was out to go transact on the same deals today or at least over the last six months, with current land prices and fees, exactions from the cities, we probably wouldn't be able to do the deals. Hence, we have what we have in the box and we anticipate it happening by the end of the year.
Karin Ford: Can you tell us which markets they're in and what your expected yields are?
John Eudy: Sure. One is in Southern California in a prime market and one is in Silicon Valley in a property, that you're probably aware of that we bought out of bankruptcy in, right after the 2010 meltdown, at a very low land basis. And then, the other one is in Northern California in a ground zero location.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please state your question.
Tom Lesnick: I guess, starting off, Angela, with regards to the balance sheet strategy, I was just wondered if you could kind of walk you through your rationale on putting out a preferred issuance to replace the redeemable preferred issuance this year? And also with regards to the Fannie Mae issue, I guess, just given the amount of capacity you have on your line of credit and the expectation for another unsecured issuance this year, what's your rationale behind all of that?
Angela Kleiman: First part of your question as it relates to preferreds, it's a very small amount. It's only $73 million. And so, in terms of the thinking potentially to refinance, it's really to keep the flexibility of having a preferred equity tranche. We haven't decided that we would execute that plan, but it is a part of our guidance just as a base case. And as far as this -- I wasn't sure what you are referring to in your second question. Can you repeat that?
Tom Lesnick: Well, it's the Fannie Mae credit enhanced issue from this quarter, correct?
Angela Kleiman: Okay. The total return swap on the refinancing on that, essentially it just -- it was to lower our interest rate. It's $1.4 million in savings. The $4.3 million non-cash write-off was essentially the unamortized loan fees. So it was just an economical decision that was in our favor, in terms of the cost of debt. Is that what you were looking for?
Tom Lesnick: Yes, I was just trying to weigh that against the cost of having a more complicated debt stack, as opposed to one that's more simplified. But just keeping it to unsecured.
Angela Kleiman: Actually, the structure itself is more simplified. And so, if you want, we can talk a little bit more after the call. But this is a SIFMA plus 70 and the other one was a Fannie credit enhanced. So the trade-off in terms of structure, it's not more complex.
Tom Lesnick: Okay. And then my other question was just, can you provide an update on Phase III and the progress with BRE in that regard?
John Burkart: Sure. Yes, this is John. From the BRE perspective, as far as the legacy portfolio, we've certainly come along way. As I mentioned in my remarks, some of the opportunities we still have going forward, specifically with that portfolio relating to amenity -- refining the amenity adjustments and expirations. And the expirations have been commented on several times, but for clarity, clearly we can fix that within a 12 month period as the lease expires and force things into a certain bucket. The problem is it's not the best thing to do economically. Typically you're better to work through that over a couple year period and not force people to take actions that are inconsistent with the market. So we just try to move it on the margin and that's what we're doing. As it relates to the amenity adjustments, that takes several years to get right. And frankly, on the Essex legacy side, we're still refining that as well, trying to really connect with how the market perceives the different valuations of our similar unit types and make adjustments is an ongoing effort at our Company. It just needed a lot more work on the BRE side, as they really just started that revenue management process. On the big picture, on the expense side, things are in pretty good order there. We now have the BRE portfolio, legacy portfolio performing on a controllable expense basis, maintenance, admin and those types of expenses, on a per unit basis below the Essex portfolio. And that makes sense, that portfolio's a little newer than ours. And so, we've done an awful lot of work and we have that in very good order. From a management perspective, we have great people and that is completely intermixed throughout the portfolio. So there is no Essex or BRE assets. They're all Essex assets and how we manage them is almost exactly the same. There's a few nuanced items that are getting cleaned up, but basically almost 100% the same. That's come along way and we're very pleased with where that's at. On the renovation, the last big piece, that piece takes time. Again, our renovation program, we're pretty focused on making sure our product meets the market exactly. It's a very asset by asset program. And so, we've mentioned we have launched it which we have. 2016, we'll have a greater focus on the BRE portfolio as a percentage, than we will on the Essex portfolio. And that's a switch from this last year and we'll continue to explore those opportunities. Hopefully that answers the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please state your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: So a few questions here. First, Mike, can appreciate your comments on tech and the jobs out there in your opening remarks. Looking, I guess, what was a little surprising is looking at your job forecast, the latest one in your supp today, versus the one a year ago, the job growth forecasts are sort of similar. And yet obviously, the news headlines today are clearly fresher than they were a year ago. But Twitter, Yahoo, you see some of these companies that are in the news, whether for business model issues or space giveback on their office use. And just trying to reconcile the two, what would be the things that you guys would look for that would tell you something is happening -- a red flag out there that would tell you that things may be changing? Because the outlook that you gave in your job picture is a bit different than sort of the sentiment, if you read the newspapers or speak to folks? Not your folks, but speak to on this side of the country.
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex, it's Mike. The one point, is that we pretty dramatically outperform the job forecast last year. So yes, this year as a forecast is pretty similar to last year, but you had the large outperformance in the middle of that which we didn't expect, obviously. So we're going back to a, what we consider to be a more sustainable job forecast. And so, going forward, how do we detect that things are different from plan? We would use our own portfolio as being a primary source. Typically what happens in the portfolio, when you look at 30 day forward availability and some of the other portfolio metrics, you will see dislocation happening more quickly than the data vendors will pick it up, generally by one or two months. So we would generally see that a hiccup happening right in the rental activity and the forward availability. So we'll look for that and that will be the primary trigger to focus more effort on what's going on. In terms of what we're most concerned about, a lot of people talk about the unicorns out there. And we're less concerned about them, more concerned about the large tech companies. Because when you look at the number of employees, it's pretty dramatically different. Again, back to our top 10 tech public companies, there's about -- they have about 165,000 employees in the Bay Area, whereas the top 20 unicorns have about 11,000 employees in the Bay Area. So we're clearly more concerned about the top 10 or the big tech companies. But we're also on the flip side, we also recognize that they have such tremendous financial capabilities, again the amount of cash that they have, the amount of growth that they've generated, the office space that they're leasing and the overall commercial activity. There's nothing to us that appears to be a hiccup in what their activities are. And that is what's really driving or anchoring our forecast for next year.
Angela Kleiman: And Alex, I just want to address your comment about office space. Because we saw the same thing which was Google and Apple, they were pulling back in their office lease in the East Coast. But when we looked at the whole -- the big picture, we also recognized that they expanded their office space here close to headquarters. So there's been a conscious decision to try to be more centralized. But net office space as concerned, they've not decreased in that. The news about Yahoo laying off 700 employees. But what we also saw was Sony PlayStation Entertainment moving their headquarters from Japan to San Mateo and expanding obviously their office needs and which will bring in another -- what we would expect 700 -- or hiring 700 to 800 new employees.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay.
Angela Kleiman: So the context.
Alexander Goldfarb: The second question is you guys -- one of the 1031 properties was downtown LA. You guys had been investing in downtown LA for quite some time. So just sort of curious, now that you've had a number of properties there, how do you view that the properties have been performing relative to your underwriting?
Michael Schall: They performed generally in line with our underwriting. There is a pretty significant amount of supply coming into the downtown. And from our perspective that's going to require people that are working in the downtown, but living somewhere else to relocate to the downtown. And we expect that to be somewhat choppy. But the overall supply/demand of LA is incredibly positive to us. Los Angeles County produces somewhere around 0.5% or 0.6% of its stock every year. And it's getting demand growth that is well in excess of that, but that supply is focused really on the CBD LA, as that transitions from being a sleepy downtown to being a 24 hour city. And we believe that is on track and we believe that the long haul or long term potential is fantastic in that marketplace, even though there might be some bumps along the way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.
Jim Sulivan: Mike, at the risk of beating this dead horse on the demand forecast, just to make sure I understand. In your prepared comments, I think you mentioned economy.com as the source of a, I guess, as the U.S. GDP forecast assumption and the national job growth assumption. For the individual markets, is that data also economy.com or is that based on your own research or some other local research source you look at?
Michael Schall: Do you mean the job forecast by market?
Jim Sulivan: Yes.
Michael Schall: Or the economic rank forecast?
Jim Sulivan: Well, the job forecast by market -- and I understood you to I say that the economy.com forecast was both job and GDP. Is that not right?
Michael Schall: Well, it really is a -- we use of variety of data vendors and again we prepared this forecast last quarter. So the world was a little bit different then. And we could go through the process of changing the forecast dramatically, but the reality is the world is changing so rapidly, that you can't change the forecast every month. It -- which would almost be necessary, based on the amount of volatility we've had in the marketplace. But what our process is, is we use the macro data for the broad macro numbers which are U.S. GDP growth and U.S. job growth. And then we derive the more specific market forecast, based on our own supply/demand analysis. And Angela has come up with a regression analysis, that takes into account various different factors, including supply and demand. It includes wage growth, for example, as one of the key items or affordability. And so, the economic rent growth in our market forecast is Essex proprietary, but it's driven by macro numbers that come from data providers. I think 2.8% is the highest of the data providers, as I recall looking at the list. There are some that are in the 1.5% range. Again, we could change this on an ongoing basis, but to what point? I think that the forecast looks achievable. If you look at last year, we missed the GDP forecast, but outperformed on the job side. So is this a perfect science? Obviously, it's not. And it seems like we had resilience on the job growth side, relative to historical relationships. And again, I think it goes back to that wealth -- the incredible wealth creation that we've had on the West Coast that is really driving economic activity, that is disconnecting from a lot of the data going back 5 or 10 years. I think a lot of things are happening. It seems to us that these are achievable numbers and again we'll see. We expect a volatile year, as I know everyone knows.
Jim Sulivan: Sure. Yes and you mentioned that a few times here so. So the bottom line is, in the terms of the forecast that's contained at the end of -- at the back of the fourth quarter supp, it's basically as it was at the end of the third quarter. And it's -- I take the point, you don't want to be reacting to every zig and zag in the data. And the data has been volatile itself, of course, but the regression analysis that Angela does, presumably that gets updated quarterly? Or is that where you put it in place at the beginning of the year and if reality turns out to be a little different, you may readjust, but it's not like you redo the regression every 90 days?
Michael Schall: Yes, I mean, it's impractical to do that. Obviously, the market forecast drives our budgeting process. It isn't like we're going to change our budgets overnight or every month.
Jim Sulivan: Sure.
Michael Schall: So we try to do this in a thoughtful manner. We debate this -- we debated whether we should reduce the forecast and no doubt some people out there think that we should have. But ultimately, we felt comfortable with it -- with the caveat that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that there's probably greater risk to the forecast than there was a quarter ago.
Jim Sulivan: Simply because the macro data and the announcements we're hearing from companies is indicating cutbacks in capital spending and other call it, general moderation across the economy?
Michael Schall: Yes, given that, but again -- you look at what we see out here which is, again, these amount of cash and wealth that these companies have. And looking at Alphabet specifically, I think they have the financial worth to do pretty much whatever they want to do. And in fact, are in a whole bunch of different businesses. And that I don't think is going to slow down a whole heck of a lot. It doesn't appear to be slowing down a whole lot. And the financial wherewithal to purchase pursue multiple businesses at one time is absolutely assured. That's part of what we're thinking as well, is the ability to continue to push forward with expansion of these various businesses, is something that we're counting on continuing going forward.
Jim Sulivan: Sure. Just finally from me, if I could, the -- your supply forecast is presumably something that your team puts together, I guess, based on your knowledge of what's happening in the market? That's obviously a lot less volatile than potentially the demand forecast. But is that the source of that primarily, it's your own team's forecast?
Michael Schall: Well, again, we use data providers to give us the list of transactions. And then inevitably, you have the same project called three different things. And so you try to go you through and identify -- this is what our team does -- we try to go through and we identify where each project is. And then based on that, we eliminate the duplication in the data. And we think we get a much better forecast as a result of that, than a lot of the data providers have. We exclude from this student housing, senior housing and some of the other categories that others include in their data as well, as historically that has not proven that relevant to our overall activities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please state your question.
Drew Babin: Quickly, I was hoping to isolate what you are assuming in terms of ROI from the resource management initiatives implemented already, particularly within the BRE assets? And whether increased activity, being able to touch more units this year may provide some upside to the expense growth guidance that was given?
John Burkart: I think regarding our expense growth guidance, we've factored things in appropriately. But just big picture for clarity, we have our resource management and we categorize that separately than the renovation. So on the resource management, those initiatives tend to have pretty high IRRs and they tend to be somewhere between the mid-teens,15%s to 25%s. And we found some very good opportunities in the renovations. Those tend to be in the mid-teens or a little bit less and we're executing those as well. But the guidance reflects what our expectations are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay: I just want to follow up on San Francisco. Can we fast forward to the next slowdown, how much do you see it playing out? I think it's always viewed as a boom/ bust market, but you mentioned the well-capitalized companies. Its sounds like there may be pent-up demand and some good visibility for office leasing? So your thoughts on the next slowdown?
Michael Schall: Again, let's put this in the unknowable category. And when it comes to the unknowables, I have to go back and maybe summarize what I've seen in the last 30 years, as it relates to Northern California and I've seen huge dislocation and disruption. Obviously, the Internet period was an incredible period, in terms of that. And for example, you had I think price to sales ratios were something like 49 times in year 2000 and they're more like 7 now. So you had an incredible asset bubble, with respect to these tech companies. And that went on for a lot longer than anyone expected it to go on and ultimately had a horrific impact on things. I think that really is the exception, though. When you look at 2007, 2008 or 2008, 2009 recession, actually the tech world did rather well. It was construction, government, manufacturing, et cetera, that did incredibly poorly and tanked everything. I think that's actually more of my belief, with respect to the tech world. It's not necessarily the tech world that tends to be so volatile, in terms of employment. It's the broader economy. So I don't have necessarily any great fear about tech itself. I have fear about just generally, what's happening in the economy on -- because I think actually tech, with the one notable exception of the Internet boom and bust period, tech has actually done reasonably well during the economic cycles and the downturns.
Wes Golladay: Okay. So on a relative basis, it could hold up the cycle. I think maybe fears may be a little overblown, at the moment on a relative basis at least?
Michael Schall: Well, I guess, I'd ask, where else are you going to go? I mean, what are you going to -- you can stay in cash at 20 basis points or something like that. But I mean, as we look at the industries and what's happening in the world, it seems like tech is actually pretty well-positioned, relative to some of the other choices. We know that Southern California, for example, is a more diversified economy and therefore will have less dislocation. But again, not the same growth rate either. So if we see significant dislocation in the tech markets, we will obviously try to move more of the portfolio southward. There is a small bias toward that, as you saw in the Sharon Green transaction, where we sell Northern California and we reinvest two-thirds Northern California, one-third Southern California. I think you'll continue to see some of that again. But again, we're not in a mindset that we need to divest of tech, the tech market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please state your question.
Rich Anderson: So several years ago, I remember sitting down with Keith and he was complaining about his $100 stock price. And I thought at the time how crazy it was to think that, let alone say it out loud. Of course, had you known your stock would have gone up to $250 or close to it a few years later, you all would have taken that in a heartbeat and your execution has been outstanding. But right now, this long list as Goldfarb pointed out of things going on, to what extent -- a lot of people are asking what are the signals and you're not seeing in your fundamentals yet? But with all this in mind, what would you do? Forget about what the signal might be, but what would you do? Would there be an idea of selling assets in bulk? Because one thing that you still have is fantastic asset value, you could sell assets today at incredibly low cap rates, maybe pay a special dividend, delever further and really hunker down. I mean, what kind of action would you take, if you do see something pop up in your fundamentals?
Michael Schall: It's Mike and Keith is still here. I talked to him this morning. He asked what happened to his $240 stock price? But yes, Keith is always with us. Again, it goes back to that relationship between asset values and the stock price and that has been changing, seemingly every day. And we sure would like to see some consistency in stock price before we make big, strategic decisions. And unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen this year. And so, but we will look for opportunities, much like Sharon Green, where we think we can sell an asset and either buy the stock back or pay a special dividend. Both of them are potentially attractive to us. And but we want to see some meaningful pick-up, in terms of impact on NAV per share. So today, that is probably there, but it wasn't there last week. And again, the -- it takes, what 60 to 90 days to actually go through the transaction process and then you have got to work through the reinvestment plan. So we're trying to do the best we can. I will tell you that we will sell more assets this year, than we've sold for the last several years. And I think that will continue to trend and we'll look for both -- really two different things. One, paring off the assets that we think will underperform over the longer period which will probably be in a higher cap rate type of area, but then the more opportunistic, much like Sharon Green assets that traded at a very attractive, very aggressive cap rate that we can redeploy at a positive spread. So we'll be looking at those.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And so, you said that the fundamentals tend to give you a month or two head start. Is it possible now that, when you look at just the craziness of the Bay area housing market, that maybe what's going on is being hidden from view? It's just a different set of circumstances right now? Is that something that keeps you up at night as well, that maybe the indicators that we've relied on in past cycles may not present themselves the same way this time around?
Michael Schall: Well, that's always the case and we're always concerned that we're missing something. And I'll say in the fourth quarter, there were more move-outs to buy homes and that caused some availability increase. Again, I think a lot of it was tied to the Fed action and the belief that you need to get into a house now, as opposed to wait which turned out to probably be the wrong answer. But that 30 day availability has really been the bedrock of our management of both price and where the market is going. And it's a pretty sensitive variable, that I think it captures appropriately what's going on in the marketplace. So we're going to pay particular attention to that. And then if that moves, then the next position -- next point is hey, is this a one-time only or is it a trend? And so, we'll be trying to figure that out, right after there's some movement in that area. Again, as John has indicated, January bounced back so nicely, that we don't think that what happened in Q4, is anything other than an isolated occurrence.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Please state your question.
Dave Bragg: As you've discussed on the call, Mike, I think that Essex has earned a reputation as one that will adjust, as needed to the change in cost of capital. But just have a couple questions on specific things -- that I'd like to understand how you think about a couple specific things? The first is, I think that you suggested that if the stock price is unfavorable, you would shift away from wholly-owned acquisitions and more towards co-investment. But how do you think about co-investments, relative to just making no acquisitions at all?
Michael Schall: We have to be able to add per share growth, NAV and cash flow to the portfolio. And I don't know if we've shared with you, but we have an accretion model that we run for every deal, that tries to measure those against the portfolio. And again, we're trying to add value to the stock, not subtract value from the stock and our process is really designed around that. And so, we do not feel compelled to do transactions, just for the sake of doing transactions. And we certainly don't feel compelled to do transactions for quote, unquote, strategic reasons. We want to make deals that make sense and that are additive to shareholder value over the long haul. And I go all the way back to 1995, 1996 and we talked about what our long term goals were and they are as relevant today as they were back then. And we said basically, hey, if we can grow -- effectively what's core FFO was FFO back then -- at somewhere around 8% or 9% a year and pay a dividend that's in the 4%, 5% range, that's going to be a really great thing for shareholders. And we've stayed true to that and we've added a little bit of NAV sensitivity to it as well. But that's what makes these entities do well over the long haul. And as you know, it's worked out pretty well for our shareholders and us.
Dave Bragg: Second question, it just relates to the logistics of hypothetically selling assets and buying back stock. Would you -- if you were to tee up assets for sale and you have maybe some confidence in the private market, would you take that private market risk and buy back stock immediately? Or would you wait the 60-ish days that it takes to close, have the cash in hand and then buy back the stock? How do you think about those decisions?
Michael Schall: We don't like them, Dave, to answer your question because the transactions markets, again they're all over the place and the ability to close with all the variables are -- make it risky. But then again, yes, we've seen this with the Sharon Green transaction, where roughly two-thirds we were going to exchange. And we're going to pull a dividend forward and do -- buy some stock back if we saw some weakness there. And that was on the table for about 10 seconds and then off the table. So it's a really incredibly challenging thing to do to match this -- match these off in a way that is additive to the shareholders. Fortunately, I have Angela and it's her job to make that happen. So Angela, you want to add anything to that? Hey, it's challenging. It's one of the most difficult things I think we have to do this year.
Angela Kleiman: Well, I think the only thing that I would add is, yes, agree that it is challenging. But we can move generally pretty quickly and we do have a very flexible balance sheet. And so, if -- we have a track record of doing the right thing and we're going to continue to do that.
Dave Bragg: Okay. But on that specific point, it sounds like it's fluid. You don't have a hard fast rule, that you have to wait, get the cash in the door, before you go buy back the stock. You will evaluate it on a case by case basis?
Michael Schall: Well, it's magnitude, right, Dave? I mean, if cap rates go up 100 basis points and the stock goes down, then you're compelled to do it. And you feel like hey, under any scenario, we're going to be able to capture that difference in valuation. If the magnitudes are relatively thin, then why would you take the risk? The risk becomes more apparent. So it's a question that really doesn't have an answer. We do not have any pre-set biases. As you know, we try to be pretty thoughtful about looking at things and keeping risk in mind. And not do things just because, the common wisdom is to do them, but rather do things because we can add value doing them. So again, it's going to be case by case. And it will be an interesting year and I hope the stock does well. But if it doesn't, we'll come up with another plan. I can assure you of that.
Dave Bragg: Okay. One last one if I may. To what extent have you analyzed your portfolio, to determine what share of it fits within Fannie and Freddie's current definitions of affordable multi-family assets, that are outside the loan -- the caps?
Michael Schall: I don't think that we've actually done that, Dave. And so, it's only relevant to the extent that we have co-investment transactions. And it will be something that we will have to look at as -- if we go down the co-investment path for funding our acquisitions.
Dave Bragg: Well, I thought more so, from a disposition perspective. There's more clarity on that debt capital's presence throughout 2016 than from LICOs [ph] or others, because there's no limits on the amount they can do on the affordable side. So from a disposition perspective, it seems relevant.
Michael Schall: Yes, I'm sure it would be relevant. Again, we have not seen that enter into the equation. We have two transactions in contract on the disposition side. That issue has not come into play for either of them. But it's a good point. It's something that we're going to have to factor in going forward.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Schall for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Well, thank you all for joining the call today. We appreciate your participation. And obviously, we're pleased with the results last quarter and the outlook ahead. And we look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi conference in March to continue the discussion. Good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Please standby, we are about to begin. Good everyone. And welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time.

When we get to question-and-answer portion, management ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you, April. Thank you for joining us today. And welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments. John Eudy and Erik Alexander are here in attendance for Q&A. This part quarter John Burkart assumed leadership of our Asset Management and Operations functions, and thus he will provide commentary for those activities today and in the future. Also as you know, Angela became CFO on October 1st upon Mike Dance’s retirement. Please join me in welcoming both of them to their new roles on the quarterly call. I will cover the following topics on the call. First, Q3 result and activities, second, an update on rent control discussions, third, review of investment market, and fourth, comments on our 2016 preliminary market forecast. On to the first topic, yesterday we were pleased to report another impressive quarter driven by strong West Coast economy. As expected, demand from robust job growth led the continued high occupancy for apartments and significant increases in for-sale home price. Thus our reported results for same property revenue, NOI and core FFO per share growth exceeded our expectation and led the multifamily industry. As to the quarterly results, I would like to recognize the Essex team for their tremendous effort and for exceeding expectations once again. With the few exceptions, rents at the B quality property and locations are growing faster than As, exemplified in the Oakland Metro with 12.7% same-property revenue growth, the highest in our portfolio. Despite the fact that Oakland -- the Oakland Metro generated only 2.2% year-over-year job growth for the nine months ended September that significantly lag San Francisco and San Jose at 4.6% and 5.5%, respectively. These occur because affordability and commute time are two critical considerations for most apartment figures. With traffic congestion growing, the accessibility to major employment centers has become incredibly challenging and more people are doubling up living with relatives or moving to less expensive areas. Thus we believe that B location closest the job at public transit will continue to perform best in 2016. In recent investor meetings, we have heard concerns about tech hiring and changing housing preferences favoring homeownership. As the tech hiring, we closely follow tech job growth, especially in the current environment given broader economic issues, such as the strength of U.S. dollar, weak commodity prices, weak global growth and the divergence and performance of key sectors of the economy. The Essex portfolio will normally experience softness in traffic and pricing a month or two before slowdown in hiring is picked up by the data vendors. This is complicated to some extent by the normal seasonal slowdown that is typical in the apartment business this time a year. At this point, we have not experienced a slowdown beyond normal seasonal pattern and reported job growth has been excellent. Perhaps, the best way to demonstrate the current condition is the 2% improvement in loss to leave at the end of Q3 from 5% at the end of September 2014 to 7% at September 30, 2015. As to the homeownership rate, we continue to focus on the relationship between the number of new homes, both rental and for-sale that are being delivered, compared to household formations estimated from employment growth. We have heard some economist use national data, when discussing this relationship, which we believe is often misleading, apartments at our local business and therefore, our valuation of supply and demand is regionally focused. For a variety of reasons, including the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and related law, we continue to expect very muted production of for-sale housing in the coastal metros of California, as cities implement an urban village housing concept accessed by a robust public transit system. This new concept is likely to take years to implement and will favor apartments and condos. Therefore we believe it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in for-sale housing production that is necessary to materially increase the homeownership rate in Coastal California. On to the second topic, rent control. I commented last quarter that proposed -- proposals for local rent control ordinances are being in discussed in several West Coast cities, particularly in California. Cities are generally protective of their rental stock and voters that live in apartment, and there is a growing concern that high income tech workers will displace other resident that have not received large increase in the compensation. I’ve commented on previous calls about Richmond California, which is the first city to approve in preliminary form a draft of rent control ordinance. Opposition led by the California Department Association has been able to force the Richmond rent control proposals to the voters in 2016. For context, California State Law supersedes city ordinances fortunately for landlord, state law mandates, vacancy decontrol and prohibits rent control on apartments completed after 1995. We have also seen some cities and community organizations focused on the long-term impact of inadequate housing supply, particularly at lower income levels and acknowledge of rent control has unintended negative consequences and ignored the real issue, that is a shortage of housing production. Our view is that there is no near-term solution to the housing shortages, especially in Northern California, because cities are generally not supportive of progress strategies, entitlements for new housing continued to be challenging and costly to obtain, and construction cost has spiked around 10% in each of the past two years. Therefore, we don't expect that rent control discussion to end anytime soon. We encourage landlords to self-regulate by considering these factors as part of their lease renewal strategies. Third topic, investments, as commented previously, we will become more selective as to our external growth activities, although we continue to be very active in our search for both acquisition and development deals. As noted previously, construction cost increases are pressuring development deals and some development deals are likely to solve. The flipside of a more selective acquisition market is the better market for property sale. You should expect to see the level of disposition increase modestly in 2016. Cap rates remain lower throughout our markets. Using the cap rate methodology of the most active buyers, our best estimate is that the highest quality property and locations create around 4% cap, while B quality property and locations create around 4.5% cap rate, lesser quality properties trade at higher cap rates and periodically and aggressively underwritten or trophy property will trade in the high 3 cap rate range. Some buyers make more aggressive assumptions that can add 25 to 50 basis points of cap rate compared again to the yields underwritten by more active buyers. On the fourth topic which is the -- our market outlook for 2016. Page S-16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply/demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2016. As before, we assume each of the West Coast metros except Ventura will outperform the national average job growth assumed to be 2%. While we are not projecting the continuation of the exceptional job growth that we have enjoyed in 2015, we have no specific reason that hiring is going to moderate other than the concerns about the global economy noted previously. Note that we do not need extraordinary job growth to generate favorable supply/demand relationship and great results. Should job growth continue at the pace experienced in 2015, we are likely to exceed the forecasted results for market rents shown on our market outlook. Finally, the 2016 same-property revenue growth expectation for the Essex portfolio are likely to exceed the forecasted 6% economic rent growth on S-16 due to our healthy loss to lease and other factors, all of which will be discussed as part of our 2016 guidance on next call. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will turn the call over to John Burkart.
John Burkart: Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate the hard work the operations and asset management team this last quarter executing our plan which enables our great results. Third was robust. We continue to have a positive outlook for all our markets, higher than expected job growth continues to be the primary catalyst for increasing rent and higher occupancies throughout the portfolio. Strong demand pushed economic rents higher leading to our fourth consecutive quarter of 10% increases in same-store property NOI growth. Gains from renewal activity increased 6.6% portfolio wide in the quarter and a turnover was down across the portfolio from 63% in 2014 to 60% this quarter. As of yesterday, the same property portfolio in all regions had occupancy at or above 96% with a 30-day availability of just over 4.7%. All of our markets are benefiting from the combination of strong job and income growth and insufficient supply to keep up with the demand. According to Axiometrics, market rent growth was stronger in September 2015 year-over-year than last year at this time in each of our region, Seattle, Bay Area, Southern California. So while we are not giving guidance for next year, we conclude from this that our markets are strong or stronger than last year at this time, which bodes well for next year. Ramping up our redevelopment pipeline has been a major focus for 2015, including the restart of the program for the legacy BRE property. Our renovations team completed over 1,000 apartment home renovations during the third quarter and an increase of 50% compared to the third quarter of 2014. A little over 30% of the unit renovations are currently focused on the legacy BRE portfolio, which negatively impacted occupancy during the quarter. We continue to make progress on our merger integration phase II and phase III as outlined in the June NAREIT presentation available on our website. The resource management efforts, renovation, and refinement of the revenue management unit amenity pricing are ongoing efforts that will continue for the foreseeable future. We are making good progress on phase III which is focused on improving our customer experience, growing our employees and increasing our efficiency, the results of which will be realized after 2016. Now I will share some highlights for each region beginning with Southern California. Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego continue to be strong performers this quarter, driven by job growth of 2.3%, 3.3% and 3.2% respectively, all exceeding our initial expectations and U.S. averages. Personal income growth continues to grow well above the national average in all three metros. Northern California continues to perform above expectations due to exceptional job growth in San Francisco and San Jose, which was reported for September at 4.6% and 5.5% respectively. The robust personal income growth in the Bay Area forecasted to be 4.6% San Francisco and 6.5% in San Jose. It is enabling strong market rent growth with a limited impact on affordability. Oakland continues to perform well due to its strong income and job growth as well as its proximity to both San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Uber purchased Uptown station in downtown Oakland and is expected to accommodate 2,500 to 3,000 employees beginning in 2017. Several other tech companies are following Uber’s path, having announced their moving or expanding to Oakland to take advantage of the lower cost office space and shorter commutes for their employee, a trend that we expect to continue over the next several years. The exceptional demand at the Bay Area is evident by the strength of our lease up. One South Market in downtown San Jose has averaged over 40 leases per month. Epic has averaged about 39 leases per month and MB360 Phase II in San Francisco which is close to being rebuilt following the tragic fire in March 2014 is already 26% pre-leased with the first move-in scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year upon completion. Finally, in Seattle, the employment growth in this region continues to be strong at 3.3% and personal incomes are expected to grow 5.7% for 2015, maintaining rental market affordability. CBD Seattle continue to perform with revenue growth of about 4% quarter-over-quarter while the other markets, East Side, Snohomish and South King grew at approximately 8% quarter-over-quarter. 25% of the 6 million square feet of office development in the region is being delivered into downtown Bellevue with the first tower expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Sales force has announced that it signed a lease for 75,000 square feet in Bellevue and it plans to double its current workforce in the area. We expect housing supply to decline quietly in 2016 as rising construction cost began to limit apartment development. We're very pleased with our results year-to-date and I think our momentum should position us well into 2016. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.
Angela Kleiman: Thank you, John. Today I’ll discuss our third quarter results, the revised outlook for the year and provide an update on our balance sheet. For the third quarter, we exceeded in this point of our core FFO guidance by $0.06 per share. $0.03 of the outperformance resulted from higher revenue, primarily driven by the strong job growth in our markets which accelerated the rate of lease-up absorption at higher than projected rents. $0.02 of the outperformance resulted from lower expenses within our consolidated properties, although part of the favorable expense variance is timing related. Therefore we expect our year-over-year same property operating expense growth to be between 3% to 4% with the combined portfolio in the fourth quarter. Following two previous revenue guidance increases totaling 115 basis points at the midpoint, we are reaffirming our same-store revenue growth forecast and are pleased to report that we are currently tracking slightly above the midpoint of that range. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our net debt-to-EBITDA has now declined to 6.1 times, which is one quarter ahead of our target due to stronger than anticipated growth in EBITDA. Based on our market rent growth outlook, we expect this metric to decline to the high five’s in 2016. In addition, we are currently evaluating our options to refinance $114 million of Fannie Mae credit-enhanced bonds in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we anticipate potential fading of $1.4 million annually over the 7-year term. And we would incur approximately $6 million in write-off, of which $4.25 million is non-cash. These costs will be excluded from core FFO but included in total FFO and are shown as non-core adjustment on S14 in the supplemental. As for our plans for the $350 million debt maturity in 2016, we have good flexibility with access to multiple options. For example, our $1 billion revolver has virtually no outstanding and if we leave this debt floating, our variable-rate debt exposure will only increase to approximately 10% on a low average balance sheet. Although this is not a preference, if we were making this decision today, we favor refinancing most of the maturity, returning debt with a five to seven-year term loan and/or a 10-year unsecured public bond execution, depending on the interest rate curve and the related risk. Lastly, we have classified one property as held for sale, our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter. We will be moving to a newly leased space in San Mateo. We’re presenting the final steps in the office relocation plans which will consolidate the BRE corporate office in San Francisco with the Essex corporate office in Palo Alto. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Michael Schall: Are you there April?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Nick Joseph of Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. One of you can frame the 7% loss in the lease in a historical context. You mentioned last year it was 5% but is this the largest loss to lease that you have seen at the end of September?
Michael Schall: Nick, hi. It’s Mike Schall. I don’t have that statistic going back each year historically for a long time. But I know that as of July that typically is the high point of loss to lease as you go through the year and the low point is in December. So July ‘14 was 8%, July ‘15 was 8%. The low point was December. So December ‘13 was around 4% -- I’m sorry December 14 was about 4% and 13 was up 4%. So gives you some idea. Those are obviously during a very strong periods of time. I’ve seen loss to lease at zero at the end of December and at 5% to 6%, I would guess is the probably the more normal high for loss to lease in a typical year. Again, these are, from my view extraordinary years. And that metric, I think at 8% in July is near the most -- near the strongest that we’ve seen historically in my almost 30-year career.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And just staying with that. The 6% economic rent growth outlook for next year is actually higher than the 5.6% you had predicted at the same time last year. So what gives you the confidence to make that prediction today?
Michael Schall: Well, a couple things. If you go back to our original guidance that you noted for 2015, it was based on 2.5% percent job growth. And if we are tracking, if used in September, year-to-date numbers are at 3.3%. So, we pretty dramatically outperformed that number and so we are carrying momentum into this next year. And our view is you add limited amount of supply and supply-demand relationship is moving in your favor, you will build pricing power. So there is a little bit of an incremental pricing power just from the supply-demand situation and consequent impacts on market occupancy levels then the place where people want to live most.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi guys. It’s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. You commented that conditions are strong as they were last year. Is it conceivable to think that you would be able to push rents at a pace that was higher than what you achieved this year?
Michael Schall: Again, this is Mike Schall. I would just go back to the job question and if we exceed the 2.5% job growth that is the basis for our 6% market rent growth and I would say, yes, again, we will exceed it once again. We are concerned about affordability. We are concerned about all the issues with the global economy that were noted before, although one compelling factor is the personal income growth that we are seeing, especially in the tech markets, which is in the 5% to 6% range. So if you're getting 5% to 6% personal income growth and rent sort of let’s say growing at 8% or 9%, it doesn't have that bigger impact on affordability. And again, not everyone is going to get the big increase in income. The personal income growth is driven largely by people, the new tech worker coming in, making a lot of money and displacing someone that is not getting a big increase in their compensation who has been forced to move to a place that’s further away from their deployment center. So this transition is ongoing through the rental pool. But if we bring in high income tech workers in greater numbers than we have projected on F-16 then yes, we would expect rent growth to be higher.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the detail there. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks also about a decline in housing supply in 2016. And I was wondering if you could expand on that a bit and give a little bit of detail by market.
Michael Schall: I don't think that we actually have much of a decline in supply. So, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think it’s very nominal. Who has those numbers? Let’s see ‘15 versus ‘16. I think the supply decrease is somewhere around like 0.1%, so overall. So, we are not expecting supply to decrease. Again, we don’t have complete certainty. We have some factors that would lead us to believe that supply could decrease, i.e. construction costs going up at 10% in each of the last two years. And John Eudy is here and he is looking for development deals every day and he's having trouble with the underwriting because costs have moved so quickly and pro forma, it sometimes don't reflect the most current cost structure. So, when John and I talk about new deals, we are finding it more difficult for us to underwrite it. And if we are having trouble underwriting them, I can pretty much assure you, others are having trouble as well. John, do I have that right?
John Eudy: Yes. Any interactions that we are seeing, cities are getting tougher and tougher. Nothing is going in the favor of oversupplying market.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks. And then just on your comments there about the aggressive bidding going on for new deals. You mentioned being a net seller next year by a little bit amount about. Are there any markets that you are looking to lighting up and how should we think about the assets that you're taking to sellers, are this more BRE assets or they legacy assets?
Michael Schall: I don't know -- just to be clear, I don’t think that we will be a net seller next year. But I don’t have complete clarity on that. I think what I said was that we will likely sell more next year than we sold this year. And so to be clear, the way we look at this is there are other two sides of this coin. One is what’s going on, on the capital slide. In other words, what’s the relationship between where REIT stocks are valued and the private real estate markets? Is there a disparity there between the two? And if REIT stocks should trade at valuation above where private real estate markets or then we want to be buying real estate? And the flip, we want to be selling real estate and our view is that we are currently somewhere around parity, which means we call the portfolios. So that’s that the capital slide. On the real estate side, we have very few assets that we put into the two bottom categories. Those two categories we are most motivated to sell, which are substandard operating properties and marginal properties that’s trading like good properties for whatever reason that people are forced to take substandard properties. But we don't believe when the economy changes that they will be the beneficiaries. So those are the calling assets and then the other categories of properties that we would be more interested in selling, again if this relationship between REIT stock values and private real estate values is appropriate, would be the properties that have some other maybe some minor physical or operational impairments and/or the properties that we consider to be market performers. About half our portfolio, just by way of background, we consider to be within the irreplaceable category, which we are unlikely to sell almost at any price. So, we have a ranking process that ranks the properties in terms of our desirability of sale, again within the constraints of how we look at the capital side and that’s how we run our disposition function.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you for the clarification and the details.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. Was wondering -- relates to the dispositions, would you have more of an emphasis on the pre-1995 entities where they would be subject to rent controls if they are to be passed as per my knowledge?
Michael Schall: Hi, Dan. It's Mike Schall again. It comes up as a consideration. But I don't think it's one of the key considerations primarily because of California State Law. Again in California, State Law, vacancy -- there is vacancy decontrols mandated. So even though you may have rent control upon move out your -- moving people’s market at that point of time, we operate in several rent control cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tennessee. So, I don't think that that would necessarily change things. Our experience in San Francisco, for example in our rent-controlled buildings in San Francisco is that fewer people move outs, so your turnover rates are lower, which means you can’t capture the loss to lease as quickly and you think that might be a real problem. But the flip of that is there are people that otherwise would have moved out of that building, if not for the subsidy and bought a home or move somewhere else and those people now are occupying a unit, which effectively makes the availability of units that are vacating smaller and giving us more pricing power on the other side. So again, rent-controlled cities are not necessarily horrible for us as long as state law remains in place.
Dan Oppenheim: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then I guess other question, wondering about the magnitude of the rent increases and the turnover which clearly was down year-over-year. But just wondering in some of the areas Santa Clara, San Jose where you’ve seen the high levels of rent growth, are you also seeing more move-outs on account of those rent increases? Or is actually lower because of the strong income growth in those markets so that it’s initially a function of the rent growth, but it’s more of the income growth that’s driving into that if those rent increase aren’t an issue.
Erik Alexander: This is Erik. I would say no, that we haven’t seen an increase due to or significant increase due to financial reasons. If you look back over the last couple of years, that number is bounced around between 15% and 18%, that people are citing financial reasons. And so that’s where it’s today as well. The one caveat is that there has been some uptick in people citing relocation out of their area as the reason. And we believe that some of that is probably related to financial reasons, but again that hasn’t moved enough for me to believe that it’s significant.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks so much.
Erik Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good afternoon, or I guess good morning out there. And Angela welcome to the hot seat. Just quickly a few questions here. The first one, Mike, is you said that you’re considering increasing dispositions for next year. If we look going back, you guys have harvested some of your funds over time, unloading of meaningful parts of the portfolio. There is also a focus I think of Essex to always grow FFO. So would you guys ever contemplate a transaction where if you thought that the pricing so dramatic that you think that to do a sale of property that would result in earnings coming down, because you saw the significant part, even though you may generate huge gains for shareholders. Or the view is to always prune in smaller amounts and leave the larger portfolio stuff to joint ventures.
Michael Schall: Yes, Alex, good question. No, I think if there is a compelling opportunity to sell assets and distribute through a special dividend, I think we would absolutely do that. Again, right now, we are in this I just described in the sort of the parity base on the capital side where the stock obviously bounced in all over the place, so maybe getting out parity. But we’re at that point where there is no compelling arbitrage between the REIT stock price and the private real estate values. And so our motivation in that environment is not -- is great as it would be if I would say share prices and private real estate values diverging in as they have over the last several years. So there is some concern about, whether people will remember, whether ambassadors will remember that we paid a special dividend and that will probably get factored into our track record, but that’s a relatively minor concern. And since that is the only reality with respect to selling assets with large gain and distributing money, we obviously can use a 1031 exchange. But if that’s a reality and that’s a right thing to do, then we are going to do it.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then switching to Oakland, last cycle you guys did some investments over there, there is a high-rise tower that you guys got involved in. And then if memory serves I thought you guys sort of exited the market or weren’t as be pleased with the results that you’ve got. But at the beginning of the call you guys spoke highly if the market as far as just the accessibility to San Francisco in the low cost option. So is this a market that we should see guys increasing invested, or is it still, even though maybe attractive right now, you maybe hesitated to put longer-term REITs there?
Michael Schall: Yeah, I think there is maybe a little definitional issue here. The City of Oakland is different from the Oakland Metro. The Oakland Metro includes Fremont and Pleasanton and Walnut Creek, etcetera. And so we’re seeing that the Oakland Metro, which is -- what generates the 12.7% same-store revenue growth is the broader metro and there are places within that metro that are very high quality and are accessible to San Francisco and some of the major job hubs. The one thing the Bay Area really got right was the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which essentially has train to go from a variety of locations into San Francisco and many, many people, including myself, are living in Fremont, which is in the Oakland MSA and getting to San Francisco is a heck of a lot easier than driving. So it’s the one thing they got -- I think that they got very right. And so there are locations within the Oakland Metro area that we think are high quality durable in the San Francisco etcetera. We also believe, as John said, that as cost on the office side increase that some employers will start looking at different options that will benefit some of the other metros, including Downtown Oakland in this case, but I wouldn’t limit it to just Downtown Oakland. There could be some businesses or some parts of businesses that will move up and down the coast and/or potentially other markets as well as the cost of business increases.
Alexander Goldfarb: So as Downtown Oakland is not something you may revisit or right now it’s not on the radar?
Michael Schall: To be clear about just Downtown Oakland, we have a high-rise building that we built down the street from the one you’re referring to. And I don’t think that we’re looking at anything else than Downtown Oakland. It has to be so specific because there are some areas in Downtown Oakland that we really, really don’t like. And so we would avoid them, but we would be highly, highly selective in Oakland, maybe less on so some of the other locations within the Oakland Metro, the broader metro.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thanks, Mike.
Michael Schall: Thanks.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities.
Tom Lesnick: Hey, guys. Just quickly on the same-store guidance range, obviously on the 443,000 units, the ranges were unchanged, but on the 28,000 units OpEx was revised lower kind of implying that on the DRE portfolio, there was a revision higher and hence the range was unchanged. I was just wondering what was driving that.
Angela Kleiman: No, it’s not because of that. We revised the Essex same-store because we have realized the savings from the first quarter. And so we have not revised it for the combined portfolio, because we are still waiting primarily the taxes, the biggest component of expenses. We’ve only received 75% of the taxes from the DRE acquisition. And so although that has come in slightly favorable, there is still a quarter of a less, so we are just waiting on that first before we make any decisions.
Tom Lesnick: Makes sense. That’s helpful. And then on the insurance reimbursement accounting, so there was about $3.1 million on the income statement and then call it 1.8 was backed out for FFO and then another cost, 600 was backed out for core and fine that there was a piece in there that was considered core. Could you clarify what that was?
Angela Kleiman: Yes, happy to. And we did move the geography a little bit this quarter and so, but the net, net is all non-core. And we added a line in our -- I think it’s in the one of supplemental, S-2 that showed insurance reimbursement and so, and there were because of that we did a prior period adjustment. So it looks like some got ended in four, but it’s not in Q1. We can now talk after the call and I can walk you through the math.
Tom Lesnick: Sure. Happy to follow up on that. And then quickly, what was the recurring CapEx number for the quarter?
Angela Kleiman: The recurring CapEx is about $18 million for this quarter and you will see that in our Q3 that’s coming on next week.
Tom Lesnick: All right. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question from Greg Van Winkle, Morgan Stanley.
Greg Van Winkle: Hey, guys. Going back to your market forecast from the last page of your supplement. You talked about how job growth versus supply growth still really get all your markets, which is waiting to the strong rent growth forecast between '16. If you had to think about the risk though and where you might be wrong, where you the least certain about your projections, are there any of those markets that forecast where you think the more risk and others, whether it would be the upside or the downside?
Michael Schall: Hi. This is Mike. That’s a good question. We think about risk in really two different ways. One is the risk that in a major economic blip. It seems like all the job growth across the nation goes to zero and so the market with the highest overhang of new construction as a percentage of stock is the greatest hit. So, Seattle from that perspective at 1.3% has the most overhang with respect to deliveries, potentially in an environment of, again, if demand or job growth goes to zero across the nation. It would have the greatest impact. In terms of the supply side of the equation, we expect to do enough diligence to have very high degree of confidence that the supply numbers in this document are accurate. The one piece is you can throw up or build single-family homes relatively quickly if you could entitle them, whereas the apartments and condos it takes a very long lead-time and it takes couple years to build those building, so we should be able to get them 100% right. So we feel very confident as it relates to the supply estimates, which leads us with, of course, the job forecast. And on this, obviously, no one has the right answer. None of us have a crystal ball. We try to take a middle of the road type of approach and maybe with an element of conservatism. And again, last year if you look at how we approach the same document, we were pretty conservative. This year we’re not estimated that. We’re going to continue with this incredible job growth that we’ve had in 2015. We’ve moderated it somewhat. But the reality is we don't know. We think this is our expected case scenario, so therefore we expect the West Coast coastal metros to outperform the nation, the nation at 2% by -- what is that around 20%, 25% and I think that’s a rational relationship over a longer period of time. So we put this as a -- maybe it tends to be a little bit conservative and we hope to outperform it, but we view this essentially a balanced forecast. And I think the risks are really the economy and what happens with the economy. That’s going to drive whether we hit these job growth forecast and whether the nation hit its job growth forecast and then you would rank this and say, Seattle would be your greatest exposure if you end up with the major economic issue.
Greg Van Winkle: Okay. And absent any nationwide economic slowdown, there are any of the three major geographies for you that are more or less risk in the job growth side, just from kind of market specific issues?
Michael Schall: Well, you say, I mean, Southern California is a more diverse economy, so you would say, the chances are that if you’re going to have widespread dislocation in Southern California, it has to come from a variety of factors. Obviously, we have more tech focus in Northern California and Seattle. So you would say, if something happens to the technology, we have somewhat greater exposure there just as relates to the components that drive the economy. So I would say, same is true, I mean, all of this divergence within the economy, where certain sectors are doing really well and others are doing poorly, look at what happened with energy, for example. So anything that has a greater concentration of any part of the economy, I guess, potentially is more exposed.
Greg Van Winkle: Yeah. Sure. That makes double sense. And then last one here is, if we think about upside from, I mean, redevelopment and also optimizing lease expiration in the BRE portfolio, how much of the tailwind you think that could be the same-store revenue growth in ’16?
John Burkart: This is John. The -- on the theory on the renovation side will probably add about 50 basis points to the growth rate towards the second half of ’16. It still take a little while to ramp up and that’s the impact hit the bottomline. As it relates to city in the expiration in better order and the amenity in [indiscernible] better order, that’s an ongoing process that that took us several years for our revenue management team that was very hard to make adjustments in the systems for the Essex assets. We see that continued on for the next couple of years. I can’t quite quantify the impact other than to say that as we mentioned earlier, we had some issues earlier on this year because of the expiration. And it’s not as simple that you just solving it at that point in time. The most people in the marketplace want a 10 to 12 month lease and so by trying to force a new expiration schedule, you don’t get -- surely get the best results so you solve that types of problem. We’ve couple of rental renovation and it will take few years.
Greg Van Winkle: All right. That’s great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.
Drew Babin: Hi. Great quarter. Looking into next year, I mean the BRE portfolio integration, it terms your expense line items. Any visibility at this point on which line items we may see kind of shift one direction or the other, as different cost savings initiatives take deeper effect. And also kind of what G&A run rate expectation is the same factors?
John Burkart: Yeah. This is John again. I’ll be careful not to get into forward guidance but just to give some flavor. Right now Erik and his team, they’ve worked very hard [indiscernible] over the portfolio and we ultimately have our expenses and BRE expenses on it due to per unit basis pretty close. So from the go forward basis, we don’t expect large changes that relate to one portfolio and the other. We are working as I’ve mentioned on our Phase III of the merger integration which includes procurement. And we do expect to see some savings there. We don’t have our hands around all of that this point in time. We also have better set of resource management as we mentioned previously and that is really largely focused on the BRE portfolio. We expected something else that to save as much as a $100 a unit in utilities as we implement that. That’s pretty tedious. It takes several years to implement each of the programs and to do it well. So that will work its way into the BRE portfolio over say a three year period some of which we’ve already completed.
Drew Babin: And any impacts noticeably on the G&A front with the office consolidation?
Angela Kleiman: We are in the process of rolling up our 2015 budget. And so on the office front -- that’s play this way, I think G&A as a whole, probably would expect in modest increase but its not going to be materially different from what we’re seeing right now.
Michael Schall: I think there will be a little bit of geography difference because we’ll take the proceeds from the sale of the office building and reinvest them and that will offset some of the G&A that were coming from the office relocation. So we expected the net core FFO impact to be modest but the geography will be a little different.
Drew Babin: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Schall: Wes?
Operator: Wes, if you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.
Wes Golladay: Hey, sorry about that. Good quarter everyone. Here we go. Real quick on the job forecast, how did you derive that? Was that a third party or you looking at that individual office leasing day that you’re seeing and coming up with your own forecast? How granular does it get?
Michael Schall: This is Mike. Wes, we use a variety of data vendors, economy.com, Rosen, and variety of others. And so we try to build a consensus as to the U.S. job growth. And from there, we look at historical relationships that the U.S. is doing this, what is the likely impact on the West Coast on our metros? And we’ve given consideration to specific sector. So it isn’t granular in the sense of we've got an estimate for what’s happening at HP but it starts with the broader macro expectations for the U.S. and then it looks true to the sectors and tries to predict what is going to happen. And then of course, we take that information and we create a supply demand model for each of our metros, our 25 submarket and then we rank them from the perspective of what we expect rents to do over the next four years and that’s how we make our capital allocation decision.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then you mentioned more about rent control this quarter as well. Quick question for you on that. How much of your tenant base is that customer that you don’t want to displace the teacher, the police officer versus the tech port of course, which is growing their income faster than you’re growing the rent?
Michael Schall: This is going to be completely anecdotal, but I think it is significant part of our rental base. So I am guessing in Northern California, Seattle, it’s somewhere in the 40% range, 30% to 40% range. And again, those people -- this is an ongoing process, essentially people come in and make in a lot of money, able to rent that expensive unit and displace into someone that doesn't get a huge increase in compensation and they move to next wrong out let say. So it’s hard to tell. I mean, we’ve seen this play out many times in the Bay Area. It's not nearly to the extent that I saw in 1999 and 2000, this one on maybe three or four more years, and therefore that transition area effect continues to happen. But it is not limited by any means to California or San Francisco, it goes on a New York City for example. So this is the ordinary operation of the rental pool and incentiving the people that make the most money and therefore get the choice of where they want to live. So my view it is entirely again normal part of the marketplace, although I do believe that California would benefit itself and the employers and the whole economy would find a way to increase more housing.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Nick Yulico of UBS.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Mike being that it’s in Palo Alto, the hard of venture capital land. I was wondering what you’re sort of hearing from people on that and about, there has been some data showing venture capital funding, number of deals has been coming down, fewers are start ups. How is that -- are you looking it as leading indicator for the economy out there and kind of what is your take on this discussion?
Michael Schall: Yeah, it’s a good question. And we are somewhat concerned about venture capital and we do track it. We’re less concerned about the valuations and whether there's an exit into the public market and liquidity as it relates to those entities. We are more concerned about how many people do they have, how many employees do they have, how many people need housing. And in that light, I can’t express how different the current environment is from the internet boom in the late '90s. If you take the top 20 unicorns for example, I believe that they employed somewhere around 26,000 people. If you take five public companies Oracle, Apple, Cisco, Google, Facebook they employ 367,000 people. We are obviously much more concerned about the big tech companies and what they are doing. And it's amazing, we’re looking at what for example Google is doing with the Alphabet company and all the different technology related spin-offs and combined with the fact that they have an enormous amount of capital to deploy into those entities. It gives us some comfort that the tech hiring is not going to follow fall off quicker. And that is why we feel pretty comfortable with our expectations on F'16 and our market outlook, because it seems like there's a lot of activity out here and there is a lot of money out here that pursuing that activity both we see and some of the major corporate entities.
Nick Yulico: All right. Good points. I guess turning down to Hollywood, the Nickelodeon site you guys have, can you just remind us what sort of ultimate cost on that project and little bit more about where you think maybe land value is to equity, there has been a lot of site change around there recently and on the market right now for sale. And then just lastly, I want to be clear, I don’t -- whether or not that site is actually listed in your land held for development or if it’s still some other piece of real estate because at one point there was lease on it?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. In general, you are aware of the specific location in Hollywood. It is a ground zero for Hollywood locations. It has been in a number of other transactions in the Hollywood address area that are completely different. As far as it being, let’s take it as future, it still has an investment I believe. Is that correct Angela? The Hollywood asset is an investment because we kind of lease with the Nickelodeon.
Angela Kleiman: Yeah.
John Eudy: In terms of our basis where we believe, well below what we would be able to trade it for today if we choose to go in that direction and we are under the radar in terms of the height of the building that we are going after and less visibility in terms of pushback on the entitlement side. So, long and short is we expect sometime late next year is when we would transfer it over from a leased investment to an active land development transaction.
Nick Yulico: Okay. I guess, I mean that’s helpful. But anything what you can tell us on just sort of the ultimate, how to think about SAR and because there are -- I know, we can look at land comps in the market but some idea but how much you could actually build on that site?
John Eudy: Approximately, 200 units is what we are going forward and it fits within the SAR fairly nicely. Until we get it all done, we don't like to do a lot of projecting assumptions until we are ready to announce so.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.
John Eudy: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.
Conor Wagner: How meaningful is factor, the low market tax is due to Proctor’s keen in ranking your potential dispositions for next year?
Michael Schall: Hi, Conor. It’s Mike Schall. It is a factor. Procter team gives us a fair amount of wind to our back relative to what buyers will have to pay if they purchase an asset. And so, I say number one is the factor. Number two, we are looking for a variety of different transactional approaches to avoid a proper team reassessment. So it could involve selling less than half 49% of portfolio of assets for example to an institutional investor. So there are some ways to manage that we believe but the management of Procter team is a factor for sure.
Conor Wagner: And then on the dispositions for next year, is there any thought to condo yet or is it still too early?
Michael Schall: I think it is still a bit too early. Again, we can only pull that trigger one time. And so we targeted a 30% to 40% premium to apartment values in order to make it worthwhile to convert from an apartment to a condo. And we are not seeing that 30% to 40% premium anywhere. Although in San Francisco and actually a couple of the other Bay Area cities, we are starting to see 10% to 15% premiums of condo values over apartments. So, we are starting to see that divergence, taken longer, not necessarily that those condos have done poorly but because apartments have done so well. So the work we continue to monitor it.
Conor Wagner: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Conor.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Michael Schall: Okay. Thank you. Well, in closing, I want to thank you once again for joining the call. We wish you and your family the safe and enjoyable Halloween and look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT Conference in a few weeks. Good day.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Please standby. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. When we get to question-and-answer portion, management ask that you be respectful for everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow up. And it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you. I would like to start by welcoming you to our First Quarter Earnings conference call and we appreciate you're spending sometime time with us today. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy, John Burkart, and Angela Kleiman are also in attendant. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, Q2 results and market conditions; second, rent control activities within the West Coast; and third, an update on the investment market. On to the first topic, yesterday we were pleased to report quarter driven by robust job growth which is expected, produced demand exceeded overall housing supply, a reported 7.8% same property revenue growth represents the best quarterly result in the past 14 years. I thank the Essex team for their tremendous effort and for exceeding expectations once again. Northern California continued its outperformance with the East Bay generating the best rent growth. Southern California continues its expected steady improvement in revenue growth led by LA and Orange County which both reported same stores revenue in excess of 6%. With the few exceptions, rents at the B quality properties and locations are growing faster than As due primarily to two factors. First, affordability has a greater impact on the rental decision given that rents have grown faster than income, and second virtually all the supply from apartment development is in A product category, changing the supply demand dynamic within that segment. We updated our economic forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement, increasing our 2015 job growth expectations for coastal California and Washington to 2.8%, up 12% from last quarter. As before our total 2015 housing supply both rentals and for sale are estimated at 0.8% of total housing stock supporting our believe that the West Coast housing demand is outpacing supply more than 2 to 1. Market occupancy remains high and the largest part of the millennial generation those between 20 and 24 years of age are about to enter their prime rental years supporting our belief to these conditions will not change materially in the next several years. Looking forward for the nation Axiometrics estimate that approximately 1.4 million households per year will be formed between now and 2018 while constructions start are only about 1.1 million to 1.2 million. This strong outlooks support the Axiometrics revenue growth estimates for selected West Coast market ranging from approximately 20% to 30% over the next five years. We continue to make progress on the Phase III merger integration planning process outlined in our NAREIT presentation and available on our Web site under the presentation section of the Investor tab. Most of the Phase III impact will be realized after 2016, between now and the end of 2016 we should benefit from the restart of the BRE redevelopment program which should add around 50 basis points of growth to the BRE portfolio in 2016. The resource management initiatives should reduce cost on the BRE portfolio by about $100 per unit per year when fully implemented and we should eliminate the 60 basis points occupancy differential that was embedded in our Q2 results. Now on to my second topic which is rent control on the West Coast, I commented last quarter the rent control is in ongoing discussion in several West Coast cities. We continue to see plenty of media coverage concerning the pace of rent growth and its relationship to income. The city of Richmond California recently decided to pursue a rent control ordinance although details remain in draft form. The ordinance appears to cover property constructed before 1995 a date mandate by state law and creates a CPI based formula for capping renewal rents. Recall that California law generally mandates statewide D control [ph] upon move outs allowing rents to go to market when residents move out, which is very important to property values and the flow investment capital into rent controlled areas. Essex owns one property in Richmond and it does not appear to be subject to the ordinance given that it was completed after the 1995 date. We'll continue to monitor rent control discussion throughout outer portfolio. And then on to third topic, investment markets. During the second quarter a combination of great NOI growth and a pullback in stock price caused our accretion hurdles for acquisitions to be difficult to achieve. But that in combination with fewer transactions makes the acquisition environment more challenging. Our acquisition preference is for undermanaged properties throughout our markets, transit-oriented properties and CBD Los Angeles given its relatively attractive price point that has been impacted by significant apartment deliveries. In CBD LA we believe that the short-term supply issues and relatively affordable rents for an urban market will draw residents from other parts of the metro area and meaningfully contribute to the transition of CBD LA to a 24 hour city. We thus believe that CBD LA is a great long-term investment. The flip side of a more challenging acquisition market is a better market for property sales. Our plan is to continue to slowly call the portfolio. Headwinds to more aggressive selling of the portfolio include the impact of Prop 13 in California and the often higher rental growth rates in the non-urban parts of our portfolio. Cap rates remain lower throughout our markets. Using the Essex cap rate methodology, our best estimate is that the highest quality property at locations create around a 4% cap while B quality properties in locations create around a 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality properties create a higher cap rates in periodically and aggressively under written or trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range. We are quite sure that aggressive assumptions on buyer pro formas often indicate that cap rates are 50 basis points or more above the cap rate that we determined using the Essex cap rate methodology especially on high rise apartment properties.  Before passing the baton to Erik Alexander I would like acknowledge as previously announced that this is Mike Dance's last earnings conference call, so take your best shot in the Q&A. I thank Mike and Angela Kleiman for creating a smooth CFO transition process and again I greatly appreciate Mike's many contributions to the company's success.  This concludes my comments thank you for joining the call. I will now turn the call over to Erik
Erik Alexander: Thank you Mike. I am grateful to the operations team that has remained focused on executing our plan and delivering the great results that we are reporting today. The second quarter was very strong and we continue to have positive outlook for all our markets. Higher than expected job growth continues to be the primary catalyst for rising rents and strong occupancies throughout our portfolio. The strong demand conditions that we expected pushed economic rents higher and generated a portfolio wide loss relief [ph] of 8% in July. We believe this is the peak season but expect a seasonal decline in rents during the fourth quarter to be of similar profile in 2014 which was less pronounced than prior years. Once again the Bay area led the way for Essex with San Jose and the East Bay posting the largest revenue gain. Seattle continued its healthy growth despite several new projects opening. We are monitoring CBD supply closely and believe the 2016 will have comparable levels to 2015.  We also continue to see good growth in Los Angeles and Orange County and expect San Diego to improve in the third quarter with stronger scheduled rent growth. Gains from renewal activity increased 6.7% portfolio wide and we’ll continue to support strong revenue results in the coming quarter. Renewal rates for the third quarter will be above 6% due to the portfolio. We are also pleased to see that year-to-date turnover has not increased over last year and was 55% during the second quarter compared to 57% a year ago and only 50% on a year-to-date basis for the same-store portfolio. As of yesterday the physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.4% with a 30 day availability of just over 5%. So while we are not giving guidance for the next year we believe the aforementioned condition, healthy job growth and static supply forecast for 2016 will help us deliver strong results for several more innings. Now I will share some highlights for each region beginning with Southern California. Orange County and Los Angeles continue to be strong performers this quarter with job growth remaining above 2.5% in both counties. The composition of jobs in Los Angeles is improving with nearly half the job growth in June coming from professional and business service and education and health service sectors. San Diego's were weaker than the first quarter but were hindered by some planned renovation activity that is now completed and has been re-leased. Since we continue to see strong job growth in this market I believe we will see revenue growth return to levels above 5% during the third quarter.  Office leasing for the region was positive in all counties with the greatest absorption realized in Los Angeles, where 1 million square feet was absorbed during the quarter.  We remain excited about the renaissance of Downtown Los Angeles and are seeing strong leasing activity in the sub market. Our 8th&Hope project has added more than 27 units per month through July and will stabilize next month. We have also leased 35 units since closing Avant in the middle of June and are 98% leased. Los Angeles is one of the markets that is expected to have an increase in supply next year but it remains very low at 0.6% of total housing stock. Turning to Northern California, the job growth engine continues to fuel great results in the Bay Area, not only did San Jose post a 5.5% gain in June, the 12 month trailing growth rate is also above 5% and more than twice the national average. The information in professional business service sector represented the bulk of the gain by accounting for more than half of the overall growth. Oakland has not enjoying the same job growth as San Francisco and San Jose but certainly has more than enough when combined with limited new supply and the overall demand from these adjacent MSAs to make this submarket a top performer of the portfolio with 12% year-over-year revenue growth. Office leasing remain strong in the region as over 1 million square feet were absorbed during the quarter. Of note Apple leased two buildings near San Jose airport totaling 600,000 square feet and signed their first lease in San Francisco. Palo Alto networks just signed and pre lease for 750,000 square feet in Santa Clara. As expected economic rent levels continue to be strong and are up 13% from the beginning of the year and we expect them to remain at similar levels during the third quarter. Strong occupancies make these double digit growth numbers possible. Currently, the same store portfolio stands at 97% occupied with less than 5% availability. We’re seeing the same strong demand for our new communities as well, we stabilized Park 20 and Emmy ahead of schedule during the quarter and one south market in downtown San Jose is 50% leased and has an averaged 40 leases per month since opening in April. With performances like that, very strong job growth and new unit supply we expect this trend to continue in the Bay Area. Finally in Seattle, the employment growth in this region continues to be strong as well and remains above 3.5%. Trade, transportation and utilities along with professional business services account for nearly half of the job formation. And June represents the 9th consecutive month that construction has eclipsed 10% growth. With 7 million square feet of office and dozens of residential projects under construction, it is easy to see why this job sector is so strong. Additionally, 40% of that space under construction has been preleased including two more buildings leased by Amazon totaling 810,000 square feet. As expected office leasing overall improved during the quarter with over 800,000 square feet absorbed. Demand continues to outpace supply which has led to strong revenue growth. Properties at the CBD have weathered the concentration of deliveries reasonably well so far but the suburbs in the south and north end continue to deliver the best results for us and we do not expect that to change in the coming quarters. As expected, economic rent growth continues to accelerate since last quarter and was 13% higher on a year-to-date basis. We expect continued strength in the north and south end as well as B properties on the east side. Given our strong occupancy position and low exposure in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect strong revenue growth in the next year. Currently, the physical occupancy in the Seattle portfolio is 96.7% and an availability at 5%. We’re very pleased with these results through the first half of the year and I think our momentum should lead to equally impressive second half. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to the honorable, Mike Dance.
Mike Dance: Thanks Eric. Today I will provide comments on the second quarter results and the increase to our ’15 guidance. Operating results are outperforming our expectations. The second quarter results continued to build on the strong first quarter driven by greater than expected demand fueled by the high quality jobs created in our markets. Accordingly, we are confident in raising guidance for the second time this year with a midpoint of our full year ’15 same property revenue forecast to 7.9%. The midpoint of our estimated expense growth has been reduced by 50 basis points primarily due to lower than expected utility cost from reduced water use and accordingly we have increased our expectations for ’15 net operating income growth to 10.5%. We are now forecasting same property revenue growth to be 60 basis points above the strong growth reported in ’14 demonstrating the benefits of investing in supplies constrained trade markets. Not surprisingly, our joint venture portfolio also contributed to our strong second quarter. Most of the stabilized operating apartment communities owned as co-investments are commutable to the urban job node and represent a value proposition compared to the rents in the urban location. The stabilized co-investment portfolio with comparable year-over-year results now total over 7,300 apartment homes and in the second quarter these communities grew revenues by 7.9% and net operating income by 11.4%. Through the second quarter, we have received over two thirds of the supplemental taxes with new tax assessment of values pertaining to the legacy BRE portfolio. To-date the net impact of the supplemental property tax statements received have been slightly favorable to our conservative estimate. The estimated property taxes pertaining to the 15 same property portfolio is expected to be 27.2 million for the third and the fourth quarters. The savings on property taxes are offset by an increase to our property management fees. We recently completed an analysis of our corporate G&A cost that concluded we should be allocating just over 2% of gross revenues as the cost of property management activities for the corporate department that support property operation. The new cost allocation is still 90 basis points less than the 3% property management fees commonly used by analyst and multifamily peers. The increase in property management fee allocation decreased general and administrative expense and accordingly we have reduced the ’15 forecast for G&A expense by $2 million on S-14 in our supplement. To summarize, this accounting allocation is merely a reclassification of expense that increases property operating expense and decreases general administrative expense by the same amount and has no impact to our net income or to our reported of core FFO. With the full year we're raising the midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance by $0.16 to $9.64 or a 1.7% increase over our prior projection. The revised midpoint in '15 guidance is a 13% growth in core FFO compare to 14. Our year-over-year results coupled with the lease up of the development pipeline continued to strengthen our credit metrics contributing to the change in S&Ps credit outlook in Essex from BBB stable to positive. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio at June 30 was 6.3 times and total debt to our market capitalization was just over 27%. In closing my last quarterly conference call, I do want to personally thank Keith Guericke, Mike Schall and the entire Essex Board for giving me the opportunity to serve as the Essex's Chief Financial Officer for the last 10 years. I have been truly blessed to have worked for such a supportive board and two chief executive officers that have great respect for. It has been a pleasure to be part of a management team and organization that cares about the qualities of homes we provide for our residents, the culture we provide for our associates and resulting financial returns that have benefited our shareholders. Our success has truly been a team effort and I am proud to have been a small contributor to the E-Team. Given the many talents of Angela Kleiman and strength of her supporting cast and finance, accounting, co-investments, research, investor relations and economic research, I am confident that the transition of my responsibilities on September 30th of this year will be seamless. And finally before the turn the call to the operator for questions, I want to stop the rumors that yesterday's earlier than expected press release was caused by my rushing to the exit.
Operator: And question-and-answer session will begin at this time. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question of the day from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Congratulations Mike and appreciate the colors on the rent control initiatives, could you give us an update on a talk on changes to Prop 13?
Michael Schall: Not a whole lot, Nick, has happened on Prop 13, and this is Mike Schall speaking. Although it's always out there and there are a number of organizations, labor units, et cetera that have almost continually over the last 40 years mounted an attack to Prop 13. So I think it's still early we will wait unit we're closer to the election to see exactly what's going to happen, but there is no update as this point.
Nick Joseph: Thanks and then you've talked about rents growing faster than income, so how was the rent-to-income ratio changed over the last few years for the qualified renters?
Michael Schall: The fortunate thing is we've been adding some very high income renters to the [indiscernible], so not only do we have great job growth, but we have jobs that are worked for a lot of these tech companies that are also high paying jobs and therefore if you look at the personal income growth for per capita, we're in some areas that have some pretty stellar numbers. For example, Seattle is at 5.8% projected for 2015 again, this is personal income growth per capita. San Jose is 6.2% et cetera. So I think in any event holding rent at medium income constant, you still will generate a pretty significant rent growth outcome there. So we are very fortunate from that perspective. Rent median incomes are below generally long-term historical averages in Southern California and about 10% above the long-term historical average in San Francisco and Oakland and little bit above in San Jose. So I'd say in summary, we are starting to push a little harder in Northern California on that metric, but still have lots of room to run in Southern California and Seattle.
Operator: Next is Jeff Spector with Bank of America.
Jeff Spector: On behalf of Jana and myself congratulations Mike, on to strategy going forward, just again listening to the call and the results, not only this quarter but of course over the last year beating even your own expectations, stabilizing properties better, employment stronger again from a strategy standpoint is there anything else, any other lever you guys can pull at this point, anything new you could bring to the company or get more aggressive on to do, now that it seems like you're moving on to the next phase with BRE?
Michael Schall: Jeff, its Mike Schall speaking again. We have a lot of work to do here both with respect to the BRE, the Phase III transformational process. John Eudy is here with me and we're looking at a number of development deals. We would love to find more development especially in Southern California. We are looking at every deal that comes to market, that meets our criteria and we will continue to do so. Having said that, when you get back to the reality, the stock is done, okay but it's pulled back a bit while earnings are surging and when you get to that point that on a leverage adjusted basis the returns on the stock going forward look better than the returns on the real estate going forward it causes you to pause. And so we are in that period of time. Now if the stock has some momentum here going forward, maybe that relationship changes. But we are going to continue to be prudent and we feel like we have an enormous amount of work to do as it relates to again the transformational activities, that we think that those will be material past 2016, it's going to take a lot of work to get there. So no means are we sitting on our laurels and we have a lot of work to do.
Operator: We will now go to Jordan Saddler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Saddler: You guys mentioned a few items on the call about CBD LA being an attractive long-term investment. I guess, what's your appetite to add more to the sub market and do you think as new supply comes to market next year that there might be more opportunities?
Michael Schall: Hi, it's Mike Schall again. I think we do like CBD LA as we all acknowledged and I think it's one of the areas that when we look at price points and we look at demographic issues in the preference of the millennials for more urban settings and the transition together, the broader transitions that are happened in CBD LA. It will continue to be one of our key focuses going forward. In our world everything is about the basic strategy which is finding properties that are located near jobs in places where people want to live. And we find that up and down the West Coast in a variety of places. And so we will stick to our knitting as it relates to that. And CBD LA fits into that, but it's not exclusively CBD LA we're going to be -- we're going to react to the deals that we see and the opportunities that we have relative to other great areas to try to make prudent decisions as we've done in the past.
Jordan Saddler: Thanks for the color there. And then just sticking with sort of Southern California. How has Orange County performed relative to your guys expectations this year and what's your outlook for the remainder of the year given some of the deceleration that occurred in the second quarter?
Erik Alexander: Hi this is Erik. We're looking for Orange County to be strong in the second half of the year, again supported by good job growth and we've had a mixed performance there in Orange County with respect to As and Bs. So we are getting contributions from [indiscernible] the Skylines of the world and we think that we're going to see some better performance with some of the -- kind of the middle tier properties in the second half.
Jordan Saddler: So would you say that it's tracking in line or what are your expectations for the year?
Erik Alexander: Yes, I think at the beginning of the year we had a close to the top performer with expectations that could possibly do better and I still think that that's possible in Orange County.
Jordan Saddler: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next is Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys this is Chris for Ian. Guidance seems to imply a little over 3% expense growth in the back half of the year. Mike is this -- it sounds like some of that comes from reallocation of expenses from G&A to property management, is the rest coming from like a normalization of property taxes and utilities or is there something else going on there?
Michael Schall: Third quarter is typically our highest expense month. We have most of our turnover and obviously the Southern California’s hotter weather, people are using air conditioning more so I think just a high expense month historically or high expense quarter and we expect that to continue this quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you, okay. And so we've seen NOI margins there approaching 70% and most will certainly go above there later this year in 2015 given your revenue and expense trajectories. But like on a DCS evaluation it seems like you'd almost have to keep it at 70% to get a meaningful upside on the stock. I just wanted to get your thoughts on where you think like a long-term NOI margin ends up, after things start to normalize?
Michael Schall: It's Mike Schall. It's ranged in that mid to high 60s to 70 historically, but I agree with you the math is math and it can push higher than 70%. We think that as we look at the world we are not a margin driven company, we are looking for rent growth, looking for supply demand imbalances and areas that we can operate properties efficiently on the expense side. And whatever happens to the margin happens to the margin. So it’s not the primary metric that we use. I understand how the math works and what you’re refine to, but from our perspective if we do our jobs we’re going to find areas where rents grow and expenses grow at smaller rates and it’s going to push margin up.
Unidentified Analyst: And then the last question. How much if any of the sequential slowdown in Southern California had to do with the change in the same store pool?
Erik Alexander: I don’t think much, I think the part of it was influenced by that what we talked about in San Diego, which we expect to normalize. And then we’re looking for better performance from a couple of assets again Los Angeles. And I think Orange County will stay on the same strong trajectory and Ventura has been stable.
Operator: Next is Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Michael you said before on one of the questions that you guys were hunting around for land in Southern California. I mean what’s been your ability to acquire across all of your markets these days and backfill the pipeline because it doesn’t look like -- I think it was like $38 million of land left that’s not been started on. Is that correct?
Michael Schall: I don’t know the exact number. We have several land parcels that we’ve been entitling for the last couple of years, one in San Diego, one in Hollywood and one in Santa Clara. But we’re always active out in the markets. And John Eudy is here and I know John and his team have worked hard to look at the transactions in Southern California which they have not been as attractive up to this point because of the rent growth differential in Northern California versus Southern California, but are becoming more attractive. John you want to comment on anything you see out there in the land market, I know we have trouble hitting our target in general. But any color on that?
John Eudy: As Mike said, we’ve got a couple of more there. We have -- that will be most likely showing up on the reporting next quarter or two, but not many. Right now land prices have been bid up, construction cost are up as we know, exactions are tough [ph] to do a development deal. We love it when we get in the mid six cap range and above, but we have to have that spread between acquisition caps and development to take the risk and we see stuff below 5.5 to 6 on current economics. We’re not going to pursue it and we’re running into a lot of opportunities that are well below our threshold, that’s the bottom line we’re culling a lot and we’re not seeing enough transactions worth taking the risk.
Rob Stevenson: Does that mean that in order to get to those numbers that you need to get to that it’s highly likely that it’s going to need to be done with a JV partners in order to access lower cost of capital and also get to promote in order to get you up into the range that’s acceptable?
Michael Schall: I would say no, it doesn’t have that much to do with capital per se. It has to do with remaining disciplined, since Keith’s favorite thing that he taught us along the way, remaining disciplined, waiting for the opportunities that make sense for us. Again we are trying to -- since we use capital, a great deal of capital we’re trying to make sure that on a risk and leverage adjusted basis the investments that we make are going to outperform the stock. And what the stock is going to do pretty well here given our growth trajectory. So we’re not going to push it just to make some deals work, we’re going to remain disciplined and try to stick to the strategy. And we’ll just wait for a better day. I think we’re going to have great results for the next couple of years just based on what we already have locked in. So, there is nothing within us that motivates us to bunch of stuff that keeps us even busier and perhaps distracts us from all the other things that we need to do.
Rob Stevenson: And then how much condo conversion and ground up development are you seeing these days in your market?
Michael Schall: Well, condo conversion and actually John Burkart is here as well. But I can probably summarize what he would tell you, this is Mike Schall again. Not that much and mostly because the relationship between apartment values and condo values is pretty much non-existent. And we need -- actually all condo developers need somewhere around 30% to 40% premium to apartment values, otherwise why would you do a condo, its lot less risky to do -- to completing an apartment. And so the preference would be for apartments. And there is a commerce department statistic that we recently saw where only 5.5% of the multifamily construction starts are condos which is the lowest since the 1970s. So I think that pretty much tells you what’s going on out there, that condo values have not recovered to the point that condo conversions make a great deal of sense. And actually, I would caveat that with -- in the City of San Francisco there is starting to be some significant premium, but not 25% to 40% that we really need.
Operator: We'll now to go to [indiscernible] Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: The question we had was just again, in new markets just given how quickly rents are rising and also some initial public backlash you're reading in the papers about how quickly the rents are rising, are you starting to see municipalities talking about making it easier or cheaper to build in any of those markets or it's just on the homebuilding side and the apartment side, I think just new supply is very limited and there is a so much demand, both side of the equation just keep going up?
Michael Schall: Well, this is what we love about the West Coast markets because, no exactly the opposite. They believe that they can get more out at the developer not less because things just so good and I'll use as an example that there is a pretty strong group -- couple of groups in San Francisco that are suggesting that the below market rate unit should go from 20% to 30% because everything is going so well. So I mean you have a number of headwinds and this is why John Eudy's comments are so apropos. You've got construction costs that are increasing somewhere in that 10% range which that's probably as good as NOI growth is going to get, so your this idea of going from 5.5 cap rate today to 6.5 cap rate is little bit in peril given that scenario. You've got cities that recognizes that they have housing shortages and especially with respect to the more affordable elements of housing and therefore they're trying to essentially give the developers to bear a greater part of that obligation and plus a number of other headwinds which are just long entitlement process NIMBY [ph], et cetera. This is why we love owning property on the West Coast because it's so difficult to build here. And so are we okay with not doing a lot of development, yes, we're because if we can't, guess what, no one else can either and if no one can develop significant amounts of property, then our existing $20 billion portfolio is going to do pretty well. So that is our dynamic and candidly we're going enjoy while it’s here.
Operator: Next is Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.
Tom Lesnick: I just wanted to address H1B Visas for a second, it’s becoming increasingly political top as we head into this election season and particularly for tech companies there has been report of a few major players laying off domestic workers in favor of asking for more H1B Visas, I am just curious on the West Coast in particular, what is your exposure as a person of your renter base and how do you guys view that risk politically?
Erik Alexander: Hi, this is Erik. I don't have the account of that in front of me, it is -- and you're correct, it is a segment of the population primarily in Seattle and the Bay area. And politically and I don’t know, but it's hard to judge the risk. But clearly we benefit from having those renters there and we'd be in favor of keeping them. Mike you have something to add?
Michael Schall: Yes actually I have a comment, I think that those are targeted towards highly skilled workers obviously and the skills that you cannot find here in the United States, generally speaking and therefore the positions within the tech community are -- it's hard to find qualified workers to take the positions that are available in the tech market, mainly in Seattle and Northern California. And I don't see even if they increase the H1B Visas, it being a threat to the domestic workforce because I think that you have a situation where there is enough demand out there, enough open positions out there that employers are having a hard time filling their positions again specially in Northern California and Seattle. And so I don't see the H1B issue being a big problem at all and in fact is probably beneficial. I think that one of your concerns as we look at cost going forward is actually because of the cost increases and difficulty in finding employees, I think that there is some wage pressure that we see throughout our market and I don’t see that abating in the near future. I know that a lot of people that we're looking at or coming from out of state and so again I think that the markets very vibrant here, the employment market, and therefore having good quality people coming in irrespective of source is not going to be a problem.
Tom Lesnick: Thanks for that color and then my second question, I understand that there are several corporate housing agencies that work with the big tech companies down in the Valley and that a percentage of your units are probably working with these agencies, what is the percentage across your entire portfolio and what is the rent sensitivity on those units relative to traditional direct leases?
Erik Alexander: This is Erik. So we don’t track the agencies separately, we do track the corporate leases as a sub category. So I will tell you that which is it is less than 3% across the portfolio and it is highest in the Bay area where it’s just over 4% and in Southern California it’s just under 2%. Our sensitivity is really related to concentration in individual properties and the thing that we pay most attention to is the lease expiration profile. So the thing that we don’t want to do is load up in expirations in any one month. And so we will look at these on case-by-case basis and they reviewed with the revenue management team and they -- a more senior level person in operations to make sure that we get the composition correct. Because there are times when the sort of tenants can really benefit us, like in a lease up for example and they fit in nicely and add to the cash flow. And there are other times where we need to be careful about the timing and when they add.
Tom Lesnick: Alright, thanks. Appreciate that color. Congrats again Mike.
Operator: We will now go to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman and Associates.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. A quick question here on Nor Cal in terms of the efforts to sort of prevents on the rent control by limiting the renewals to 10%. Are you seeing that keeping turnover down so far in Nor Cal or how are you seeing that in terms of what's happening in turnover with those renewals limits at 10%?
Erik Alexander: Yes, this is Erik again. So it does absolutely help to keep the turnover down. So we talked about 55% turnover overall in the portfolio for the quarter. It was 51% in Northern California for example where we have the most renewing leases exposed to this 10% cap. And so last year it was over 54%. So again the turnover is coming down in that area. And we commented before that [indiscernible] nor I are getting thank you notes from anybody on this stuff. But what happens is they go out into the market and look at some of the competitors and they come back and tell our staff well I had to pay attention to this and this, several hundred dollars, few hundred dollar higher. So it's absolutely having an impact on turnover.
Dan Oppenheim: Great, thank you.
Operator: And Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities is next.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning to everybody. Mike last time Mike Schall last time you said you get to 600 million of acquisition by September not that it is a long way to go from there but is that kind of line of thinking off the table now?
Michael Schall: No I don’t think so Rich, I think we're at 571.
Rich Anderson: No I know that, I know that.
Michael Schall: 471.
Rich Anderson: 471.
Michael Schall: 471 with a pipeline of about a 100 million.
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Michael Schall: It should take us to 571 that includes the three joint venture buyouts that we did. So I think we are on pace but again we are looking at a few things and it's pretty tough out there, it's interesting that we have -- we had about what about a 50 basis point move in interest rates from when we did our last bond deal at around 3.5 we would probably be somewhere around 4% now and certainly cap rates have not changed over that period of time.
Rich Anderson: Right. I was thinking line of thinking not so much for your absolute numbers like going forward basis maybe not thinking so much about guiding to a number after this is done?
Michael Schall: Rich again in our case it's such a function of -- again the stock that we're going to issue and how we're going to complete the match funding process, again whether the investments, whether we can find investments that are going to generate a total return that's better than the stock. So that equation changes literally daily and if the stock does well we're going to be more active and if the stock does poorly we're going to be less active and/or we would be more interested in selling.
Rich Anderson: Okay. I have heard from some folks that people are actually now living in rented tents in backyard in Northern California with access bathrooms from private individuals that own homes. Have you heard this? And before you answer that, putting the rent control issues aside, I mean do you guys have any concern about karma and alienating people at this point that cannot own a home or rent an apartment are actually taking very substantial steps just to put a roof or a piece of canvas over their head, just wondering if you could talk about the long-term ramifications of milking every last penny out of the market?
Michael Schall: Wow, somehow implied in that comment is that we are milking every last penny out of the market, which I would tend to disagree with, I mean as Erik just said we have cap on our renewal rents, we are trying to act as the responsible party and I am not sure I can comment on my karma. But having said all that.
Rich Anderson: Its Friday I am trying to keep it going here.
Michael Schall: I hear you. I've heard that people are actually living in freight containers for example, that was the most recent one. San Francisco is trying to entitle garages, unentitled units and second rooms. There is a variety of things that are happening. People are doubling up. And I think probably more telling is that people are essentially moving a little bit farther away from the core areas in search more affordable housing. And I think that is the way that the rental market works, that the people in San Francisco when rents go up significantly and the same is true in Manhattan and a variety of other places. When rents go up significantly, some people are priced out and they could go to Oakland and then the people -- Oakland rents go up and then the people that are in Oakland get pushed up to San Riamone or Livermore. And this radiates through the entire rental market until everything within let’s say the Bay Area in this case is completely full, in which case I think at that point it’s a real problem. I think at this point there is still pretty significant variations in price as you go further out from the primary rental market and the main job notes. And therefore I think it’s still -- there is still opportunity within the marketplace. And again I think that’s why we see the Bs are outperforming the As for example.
Rich Anderson: Thanks for humoring my question. And then last question is now that you’ve finally upgraded the CFO position, do you think we’ll see upgrade in G&A?
Michael Schall: Well, I guess I need to negotiate with Angela before answering the question.
Rich Anderson: I am sorry, had to do it. Good luck Mike. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll now go to Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley.
Greg Van Winkle: Wanted to get your thoughts on your Seattle and Bellevue exposures, you’ve given the Bellevue supply risk. Would you guys look at trimming some assets in that submarket maybe?
Michael Schall: No, I don’t think so. I mean Bellevue I think is another area that is undergone incredible transformation over the last several years and only continues to get better. I think you have high paying jobs and a vibrant economy in Seattle. And so I think we like our Bellevue exposure. I don’t view our exposure as being excessive in any part of the Seattle Metro area. We’re just somewhere in the 20% range downtown, CBD maybe that could get a little bit bigger. Although in the short-term we have some headwinds there from new supply. And we’re in the better submarkets on the east side. And actually the north and south ends of Seattle are the ones that are generating the best growth which would probably be the areas that we ultimately would want to sell. So, I think we’re happy in Bellevue and Redmond and Issaquah, and some of those core east side market. And we’re enjoying some of the incredible rent growth we’re getting in Renton and Everett so we’re happy with where we are.
Greg Van Winkle: That’s some good color. And then you guys issued above $90 million of equity during the quarter, did you do any dispositions. Should we read into that that you view equity as most important source of capital over dispositions today?
Mike Dance: As Mike pointed out earlier, we were match funding some compelling transactions in Southern California, that doesn’t work right now. So, we would look to, as he mentioned in his comments, calling some of the portfolio to fund the development needs for the rest of the year to the extent that there is an acquisition that works then we would look to issue equity again.
Operator: We’ll now go to Drew Babin with Robert Baird.
Drew Babin: Given your current outlook for property taxes and just visibility on the progress made with the CBE portfolio so far. Would it be outside the realm of reason to assume that same property expense growth might actually be lower in ’16 versus ’15?
Mike Dance: We pretty much have 2% this is Mike Dance. We have 2% expectation for the property tax increases. We are seeing some wage pressure right now with the strong economy. And so I think 3% is our expectation for ’16 in terms of operating expense growth.
Drew Babin: But not guidance?
Mike Dance: Not.
Drew Babin: And lastly just did you look at acquisition opportunities, and what’s the likelihood that the next acquisition could come from your co-investment portfolio? And what are sort of the advantages of doing it that way with regard to pricing?
Michael Schall: I think that that was an opportunity that was presented in the marketplace really framed earlier this year by the 10 year treasury been at 1.8% and the stock trading somewhere around 235 to 240 which we thought was a great time to match fund off a couple of the buyouts of our JV partners. Those dynamics have changed very considerably in a quarter and half, and therefore I don’t see that happening any time in the foreseeable future.
Operator: And we’ll take our last question today from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.
Conor Wagner: First question on development in some your markets, seen a tax purpose on development in Seattle in addition to requirement for affordable housing as well as a potential tax on residential development in San Francisco, can I get your thoughts on that and how it impacts you look at those markets in your future development?
Erik Alexander: By tax on development you're talking about in lieu for affordable?
Conor Wagner: Yes, in Seattle, I guess they're discussing having affordable acquirement on future buildings as well as linkage fee and then I've also seen in San Francisco discussion of that's the residential development that's currently on other commercial types of development?
Erik Alexander: Yes, that' is correct and there is also a few of those issues happening in California as well. It's another exaction that makes it tougher to make a number's work, that was what we were referring to earlier that dilutes the spread that we're looking between acquisitions cap rates and development. So it's out there with the pressure that's on, on the affordability side relevant to Mike’s earlier comment. That's what, is the gatekeeper to keep things from being overbuilt because that puts more impediments to developing.
Conor Wagner: Then follow-up, I'd like to know what the historical relationship band between rent spreads with Oakland and San Francisco, where they now? And do you anticipate that relationship changing in the coming years?
Erik Alexander: They obviously differ by product type, given the growth in Oakland has been filling up faster this year. It’s tightening and so it's been several $100 difference or more, and I think that's closing and I think you'll continue to see that as Mike talked about people moving from the peninsula and San Jose and San Francisco into the East Bay, including Oakland. So we like those markets going forward and we also like because over the years it just gotten better to commute back to job. East Bay has added some jobs as we've talked about, but certainly not as much as Silicon Valley and San Francisco. But the Bart line has been extended further. We see people with the properties that we have along that line commuting back into it, just becomes a better alternative to people every year.
Operator: And I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Schall for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Okay, thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank everyone once again for joining on the call. We hope and your families are enjoying a safe and enjoyable summer season. Good day. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank you everyone for your participation and have a great afternoon.

Operator: Please standby we are about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Incorporated First Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Hi, thank you. I'd like to start today by welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments and John Eudy, John Burkart, and Angela Kleiman are also in attendance. I'll cover the following topics on the call; first, our quarterly results and market conditions; second, a merger integration update; and third, investment activities. On to the first topic, we are pleased to report continued strong operating results consistent with robust demand for housing on the West Coast. Our guidance for 2015 contemplated slightly lower rent growth compared to 2014 based on modestly higher levels of housing supply, in particular in Seattle. Our housing supply expectations remain unchanged, however, we have experienced better than expected demand from job growth. As a result, our reported 7.7% revenue growth exceeded the high-end of our guidance range, equal to Q4 2014 and Q3 2012 for the highest same property revenue growth achieved since the great recession. The March jobs report supports that out performance with U.S. job growth of 2.3% versus our estimate of 2%, and the West Coast dramatically outperforming the nation in March year-over-year job growth of 4.3% in Northern California, 3.4% in Seattle, and 2.8% in Southern California. Demand from job growth is significantly outpacing our 2015 housing supply growth expectations, expressed as a percentage of housing stock of 0.8% in Northern California, 0.6% in Southern California, and 1.4% in Seattle. As noted on previous calls, a persistent housing shortage is ongoing in our coastal California markets.  For several years our theme in Southern California has been for slow and steady recovery from the great recession, which now is picking up steam as market occupancy improvements lead to better pricing power in selected sub markets. For the quarter, this was particularly apparent in Orange and San Diego counties. The typical seasonal slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter, abated faster than normal this year leading to stronger expectations for the rest of the year, which Mike Dance will review in a moment. Concern about rental affordability has rekindled rent control proposals in several cities in which we own property. Certain landlords are pushing through renewal increases well in excess of 10% resulting in political pushback with the threat of rent control. Essex follows a voluntary guideline that generally provides our customers with at least one longer-term renewal option at no more than 10% increase. Now to my second topic merger integration, April 1st was the one year anniversary of the closing of the merger with BRE. Last quarter, we outlined a three phased process for BRE merger integration with most of phase one already completed. We made significant progress implementing the second phase, including the re-launch of the combined corporate, property, and mobile website, a significant increase in renovated apartment homes, 484 this quarter versus 353 in Q4 2014, due to the expansion of redevelopment to the legacy BRE properties. And an approximate 50% increase in resource management initiatives designed to conserve water and energy consumption with the positive financial contribution to the company. With phase two well underway, we are now focused on completing the planning process for the transformational opportunities to comprise phase three, capturing the benefits of scale and property locational synergies. The goal is to complete that plan this summer with implementation beginning shortly thereafter. Once again, I thank all the E team members for their relentless effort to improve the company. And finally third topic, investments. In the first quarter, we experienced a sharp increase in stock price with really attractive debt rates, allowing us to improve per share cash flow, NAV, and the growth rate of the portfolio through acquisitions. We used this capital advantage to buy out our partner's ownership interest relating to three Southern California co-investment properties, following our match funding approach. We also acquired 8th and Hope, a high-rise community in downtown Los Angeles, which was approximately 50% leased upon acquisition and is now 68% leased. More recently, our cost to capital has increased making acquisitions more challenging. Our ability to react quickly to changing market conditions is a key part of our success in our acquisitions program. The importance of our co-investment program can be demonstrated by the recent buyout of our partner's interest in Reveal Apartments in Southern California. We estimate that the use of the co-investment format upon the purchase of the property in 2011 followed by the recent buyout of our partner resulted in approximately 155,000 fewer Essex common shares issued relative to the pro forma acquisition of 100% ownership in Reveal by Essex in 2011. Overall transaction volume of properties that meet our criteria is relatively thin, and we are frequently outbid. Anecdotally, broker contacts tell us that they are becoming more active and so transaction activity could increase during this summer. Including the pro rata buyouts of our partner's co-investment interest, we expect to achieve the high end of our acquisitions guidance of 600 million in 2015. Our preference continues to be properties located near public transit throughout our coastal portfolio as well as properties near urban areas of Northern California and the stronger sub markets throughout Southern California. As noted in the last quarter's call, the limited transaction volumes in institutional quality apartments in the recent past do not support definitive comments about cap rate trends. We spoke last quarter about modest declines in cap rates, our best estimate is that the highest quality property and location trade around 4% cap, while B quality property and locations trade around 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality property trades at higher cap rates and periodically a trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range. With respect to development, we continue to make great progress completing and leasing up our development pipeline, detailed in the press release and on page S9 of the supplement. We have three, possibly four projects scheduled to start in 2015. We have seen some moderation in construction costs growth after increasing approximately 10% in 2014. Before passing the baton to Erik Alexander, I'd like to note that it is with mixed emotions that we announced the retirement of Mike Dance. I thank Mike for his spirit, wisdom, and friendship and I acknowledge his many contributions to the company's success over the past 10 years. Keep an eye out for Mike on the nation's roadways as he promises to spend a considerable amount of time on his bicycle. I also welcome Angela Kleiman to her new CFO role. Angela has been working alongside Mike for the past year. You'll be hearing from Angela each quarter beginning with our Q3 earnings call. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now, I'll turn the call over to Erik.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. I'd also like to extend my appreciation to the Essex team for turning in another strong quarter. As Mike pointed out, we exceeded the initial expectations with outperformance in all regions. While occupancy levels remained in line with our plan for most of the sub markets, lower turnover and stronger scheduled rents have set us up for a very good year. Spurred on by higher than expected job growth, the market conditions in each region remained strong and have allowed us to progress while maintaining occupancy above 96% in all regions. We look for these favorable conditions to continue, while we approach the summer months. As you would expect, market rent levels have moved in line with these strong demand conditions, and we have seen our economic rents increase nearly 6% portfolio-wise since the beginning of the year and more than 9% over last year. Oakland and the East Bay have seen the largest year-over-year gains in economic rent, but San Jose and San Francisco are a close second. Seattle remains in good shape as well, but we continue to manage assets in the downtown carefully as we work through the peak of new deliveries. Also encouraging was the sustained improvement in Southern California. This is the second quarter in a row that year-over-year revenue growth has eclipsed 6% and is the 10th consecutive quarter that year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated. Growth in Orange County and San Diego led the way, but I believe we have a lot of upside in Los Angeles. Once again we expect renewal activity portfolio-wide to support strong revenue results in the coming quarters. Renewal rates for the first quarter were above 6% across the portfolio, and offered rates through June are also north of 6%. We also worked through the over-exposure condition that existed in the BRE portfolio this quarter, and the expiration profile for Essex and BRE is now within 1% of each other for the rest of the year. Earlier this week physical occupancy for the combined portfolio of same-store properties was 96.1% with the net availability of less than 6%. Now I'll share some highlights for each region beginning with Southern California. Orange County and San Diego were the strongest sub markets this past quarter, thanks to job growth above 3% in both counties. The employment picture continues to improve in Los Angeles, as well, with the unemployment rate decreasing 130 basis points year-over-year. Commercial activity, leasing activity for the broader region has muted in the first quarter and office vacancy rates continue to hover between 13% and 16%. One of the more significant developments in Southern California was announced this quarter as Broadcom broke ground on a 1.1 million square foot headquarter building in Irvine, with approvals to add another 1 million square feet to this campus. On our last call I laid out some challenges with the BRE portfolio in Southern California that resulted in a revenue gap when compared to Essex. We were able to make strides at some of those under performing assets in the BRE portfolio, and overall leasing activity in the region was strong. We were also able to work through the additional lease expirations in the BRE portfolio that I referenced earlier, and created a more stable profile going forward. However, this exposure condition did contribute to higher turnover, lower occupancy, and ultimately tempered our rent growth this quarter in the BRE portfolio. The carryover for Essex's successful renovation programs also added to the revenue gap between the portfolios during the first quarter. However, we believe the performance of the BRE legacy assets will be much more similar as we reduce turnover, expand our renovation efforts, and optimize the use of a single-revenue management system. We are making progress in all of those areas and based on the overall strength of Southern California market, I'm confident that the BRE assets will make a valuable contribution to our revenue growth this year. Turning to Northern California, the Bay Area continues to post the largest job gains in the portfolio and be the impetus for strong revenue growth. March year-over-year job growth in San Jose and San Francisco was 5.4% and 4.4% respectively. Once again the information in professional and business service sector represented the lion's share of the new jobs created this quarter, with nearly half of the employment growth coming from these high-paying jobs. Commercial leasing activity was robust during the first quarter and appears to be on pace to match last year's impressive absorption rate. 1.9 million square feet was leased during the first period, with the Silicon Valley accounting for more than 60% of that activity. HCP's co-project at Oceans Point in South San Francisco broke ground this quarter and will add nearly 900,000 square feet of life science office space once completed. Economic rent levels continue to be strong and are up 8% since the beginning of the year, and there are no areas of weakness on our radar. On a year-over-year basis the economic rents at our same-store properties are up 13%. This is a function of the Bay Area being the most occupied region in the portfolio. Currently the combined portfolio stands at 96.6% occupancy with less than 5.2% availability. Based on these results, we are looking forward to another strong leasing season. Finally in Seattle, employment growth in this region is also very strong and ahead of our forecast. The information and professional business service sectors accounted for 25% of the job growth while construction represents another 25% of these job gains. After absorbing 2 million square feet of office space in 2014, the first quarter results were actually negative by just over 200,000 square feet. This is largely a function of timing, and we expect to report much more favorable results next quarter.  Given that companies in the market are actively searching for nearly 4 million square feet of space, we still estimate annual absorption to be around 2 million feet in 2015. Of note, Expedia announced the acquisition of the old Amgen campus in Queen Ann, plans to relocate by 2018. And Facebook will double their footprint and consolidate in to a single building in the Lake Union area of downtown. New apartment supply is a potential risk to revenue growth this year, and we will have to carefully monitor the new competition this summer. The average absorption rate for the 26 active lease ups in the region was 18 units per month in March. Given the time of the year, I'm encouraged by the strength of demand. Economic rent growth in our portfolio through April has been ahead of our forecast overall and was strongest in the north and south ends of the region. These sub markets are now realizing the benefits of the job growth in CBD Seattle and the East Side.  Our properties in CBD and on the East Side have seen 5% and 6% economic rent growth respectively on a year-over-year basis, but have only increased modestly since the beginning of this year. As we move in to the peak leasing season with occupancy nearly 96% and availability just over 5%, we expect economic rents to press higher. We are very pleased with the results so far this year, and I think we're set up for a terrific summer. I am confident that property operations will be able to achieve the underlying results that are driving our higher guidance. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Dance, I would like to congratulate Mike on a successful career, wish him well in retirement, thank him for 10 years of friendship and counsel.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks Erik and Mike for your kind remarks on my retirement. I hope today's outperformance in the Essex stock price is in reaction to our great operating results and not the announcement of my retirement. I appreciate all the congratulatory correspondents from Essex shareholders, the Board, associates, the sale side and REIT peers.  It has been a privilege to have served as the CFO the past 10 years. For over a year now, Angela and I have been working together on building a strong team that is well prepared to perpetuate the Essex track record. I am also personally committed to assist in a seamless transition of my responsibilities. I will now comment on the first quarter's results and the changes to the 2015 guidance. Based on higher than expected job growth in all three regions, the Essex first quarter same property portfolio revenue growth is tracking at the high-end of our revenue guidance for the year. As a result of the strong first quarter results, we have increased our full year same property growth rate by 50 basis points at the midpoint, to 7.25% and by 25 basis points for the combined legacy and BRE portfolios for the next three quarters.  This revised revenue guidance reflects only the first quarter results and we will await for the second quarter leasing activity to occur, before revising guidance to reflect the higher markets rents that we expect to occur if demand continues to outstrip the housing supply. We reported a favorable variance in same property operating expenses resulting in an additional $0.02 per diluted share of FFO in the quarter. The majority of the favorable operating expense variance is timing-related and is expected to increase with the higher resident turnover activity expected in the April through August peak leasing season. Operating expenses also benefited from levy rates lower than forecasted on our Seattle properties. This favorable property tax expense variance resulted in a reduction to the legacy Essex same property guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint for the full year. We have not decreased the operating expense guidance for the combined BRE and Essex same property portfolio due to the uncertainty of future supplemental property tax assessments related to the legacy BRE California portfolio. We also reported core FFO in the first quarter of $2.29 per diluted share and have provided second quarter guidance for core FFO of $2.31 per diluted share at the midpoint of our range. The $0.02 net increase at the midpoint projects sequential growth in the consolidated and co-investment net operating income of approximately $7 million as a result of expected rent growth in the same property portfolio, accelerating lease up activity at the communities recently completed, and the acquisition of the three stabilized communities acquired from our co-investment partners. The 8th and Hope acquisition will be dilutive in the second quarter as it was only 50% occupied at the end of March and will not reach stabilization until the third quarter. In summary, the $0.10 per share growth expected from the sequential increase in net operating income will be offset by $0.07 per share related to the cost of capital required to fund the external growth, which includes the additional interest expense related to the $500 million bond offering that closed in mid March and a $0.01 per share increase in general and administrative expense expected in the second quarter as we continue to fill open corporate positions. In closing, a quick highlight on delivering the debt to EBITDA ratio we outlined in the merger financing plan. To fund the cash consideration of the 2014 merger with BRE, we contributed nearly $900 million of unencumbered assets through 50/50 joint ventures, which increased the company's debt to EBITDA to 7.4 times. A year later as a result of stabilizing the legacy BRE development pipeline and growing net operating income, the ratio has improved by 1 full turn and now stands at 6.4 times. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks, you acquired the two land parcels in the quarter, I think to deliver in 2017 and 2018. So I'm wondering if you could talk about the role of development at this point in the cycle and your appetite to continue to back fill the pipeline?
Michael J. Schall: Hi, Nick it is Mike Schall and John Eudy is also here. He may have a comment. We continue to be interested in development and as I noted we have three, possibly four starts this year. We did not believe that the parcels that we sold for future development sites met our criteria in terms of going in yield or expected yields. And there was some complications in terms of the entitlement process and so we decided to sell them. So I wouldn't view that as indicative of our overall appetite for development. I've commented on previous calls that as we go through the cycle, and now our view is we're mid cycle plus. We will de-emphasize development at some point and obviously we don't know when the end of the cycle will occur. So we'll never exit development, but we will slow it down as we perceive that we're closer to the top of the cycle.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Then you mentioned an increase in potential rent control initiatives, where are you seeing this push and if it actually comes to fruition, what's the process and timing of the actual implementation?
Michael J. Schall: That's a good question. I don't have the specifics. I think it will vary from location to location. And we're talking about at this point cities and local jurisdictions taking on this rent control issue. Obviously, they're concerned about the affordability of the rental stock within their communities and the ability of people to live and work within the same community. And with all the rent growth we've had it's obvious some of those issues are going to become more extreme. During this last quarter there was one specific city that was threatening a rent control ordinance, but negotiated with the major owners and ultimately concluded that if the major owners would agree to a 10% cap on renewal rents, and as you know we give out a variety of renewal options. So in our case we try to give longer-term renewal option subject to a 10% cap, and as long as we're willing to do that and commit to that, which we have done, that they would not pursue the rent control ordinance.  So there is an ongoing process here. We're also very active with the California Apartment Associations, when some of these really egregious rent renewal are given out, not by us but by anyone in the marketplace. We tried to be active in helping CAA mediate and work with them to try to make sure that the market pulls itself to the extent it can.
Nicholas Joseph: Just quickly, in terms of that example you just gave, what was the ordinance the city was talking about, what was the rent cap that they were going to present?
Michael J. Schall: It was much lower. I don't think that there was a specific number at this point in time. So, again this is the nature of the beast, to the extent that they feel that affordability within the city is being affected to a great extent. They will use this as leverage to try to moderate rent bumps on existing residents. So, I think it's an example of how the local jurisdictions are reacting to the large rent increases or large market rent growth within these marketplaces. And we see it everywhere, we see -- there was some discussion in Seattle and a variety of Bay Area cities and even in Southern California so, again we see it throughout our portfolio.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you and we will take our next question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Chris for Ian. Congrats on a great quarter. If you were to think about changes in rent growth forecast for the course of 2015, would it be fair to broadly assume that moderate deceleration in Seattle, maybe a little bit of acceleration in Southern California and then steady in Northern California and then I guess secondly, what markets do you see the biggest moves in 2015 on the upside and the down side?
Michael J. Schall: Okay Chris, this is Mike Schall. Good question. Erik may have a follow up. If you go back to S14, I think it does a good job of outlining the apparent issue. If for example Los Angeles has 84,000 jobs being produced in 2015 and we assume that 2 to 1 ratio of jobs to household, that's 42,000 households. And the total supply, that's multi-family and for sale is 16,000. So, basically demand exceeds supply by 2.5 to 1 ratio, if you believe these numbers. And the only one that's even reasonably close is Seattle. And I guess I would pose the question back, because from our perspective these conditions are ideal for the company because if you're producing less than 1% of stock in these markets that had very substantial revenue growth, it's unclear where that net excess demand is going to go, and that's what's pushing rents higher and it's pushing for sale housing prices higher. It is a great scenario for apartments and for apartment owners and property owners within the markets that we're in. And I agree with you, Seattle is the one question mark. It's a relatively small part of our portfolio and we're somewhat concerned about it. But having said that it looks like we're going to have strong revenue growth for the foreseeable future. I don't know how long that's going to last.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great, makes sense. Then following up on Nick's question on those large land acquisitions you made in the first quarter, is it too early to talk about stabilized yields for those projects? And then, I guess you also commented that you are de-emphasizing development in this stage of the cycle, but it looks like you have one of the largest capital budgets at share about $1.3 billion. Would it be fair to assume that you're going to sell off one of the projects to a JV partner, are you going to be looking for the Station Park Green, a partner for that one?
Michael J. Schall: Let me comment on both of those. We did joint venture, the high rise in San Francisco near the Transbay Center, and we did that because it's a 42 storey high rise. High rises have, I think, a greater risk profile from the perspective of it takes you a few years to build them and then you have a vacant building that you have to fill up. And so a lot can happen within that period of time. And as a risk mitigation strategy, we thought it made sense to bring in a partner in that context. Having said that, we still believe that it met our basic underwriting criteria of cap rate today, based on market rents now of somewhere in the low 5% range. And we would certainly expect that to grow to somewhere in the 6% to 6.5% range by stabilization or maybe a little bit higher on that one because the construction process is longer.  As it relates to Station Park Green, that is a different product. It's actually a four phase project and therefore that phasing allows greater flexibility with respect to how we manage through the process if conditions change. And therefore I think we're less likely to seek a joint venture partner on that, but we have not finalized that decision at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi guys, its Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Erik, I was just a little bit curious on your comments, you mentioned that there's lots of upside potential in LA. So I was just curious what gives you the confidence or what are you seeing on the ground there?
Erik J. Alexander: I think that the leasing activity at some of the properties, in West Hollywood for example, and the activities downtown give us confidence that things were going to heat up there. Downtown has become much more attractive place to go, and we're actually seeing people moving from some of the other areas around downtown to be downtown and we just haven't seen that before. The West Side continues to be strong, so the Marina Del Ray, the Playa Vista where we have properties there. We're encouraged. We've seen 8% to 9% increase in economic rent growth since the beginning of the year in those locations. And as we said earlier, Orange County and San Diego have done better than expected out of the gate. If you look at where our forecast was, we thought for the year that LA was going to lead the pack, and in the first quarter San Diego and Orange County are. Since those are really pressured by supply, if we get that kind of job growth going forward there's no reason that we can't continue growing revenue there. So, I've just encouraged overall and I don't see why virtually all the properties shouldn't share in that better market condition.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the color there. Then just, Mike, in terms of mentioning earlier about the cost of capital increase, you guys were pretty active on the investment front. But given your comments on competition and what you're seeing, I mean do you expect that the investments will be more second half loaded given the slowdown in the pipeline?
Michael J. Schall: We do have a couple of deals that we're looking at now and one of them is in contract. And so, I think that it will be fairly equally balanced. There's a little bit of uncertainty as to what is going to come out this summer in terms of product. Again it's been fairly thin at this point in time, but I would hope that we will be pretty close to the $600 million by late summer. That would be my expectation. Then it will probably slow down again as you go in to the more seasonal period of time in the late third and fourth quarter.
Austin Wurschmidt: In what markets are you seeing the best opportunities today?
Michael J. Schall: Well, I think the only market that we remain somewhat concerned with is the Seattle market. Northern California and Southern California has again given supply/demand relationships, both look very strong to us, and so we'll focus there. Southern California, the absolute rent level is lower than Northern California and over a long period of time that relationship is, rents are a little bit higher in Northern California than they typically are in a relative basis to Southern California. That's if you look at for example, rent to median income statistics, Northern California is above not by a tremendous amount, but above the long-term historical average. Where, Southern California tends to be slightly below the long-term historical average. So we think that even though the economy is certainly better in Northern California, Southern California has more affordability, and therefore we're interested in both geographies.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks for the time.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Robert Stevenson: Good day guys. Erik, did I hear you say that renewals were up 6% and if so, does that basically imply with the 8% on rental rate growth that new leases were up 10% in the quarter?
Erik J. Alexander: New leases were in the 9% range, so yes, it's pretty close. And I think that renewals going forward are going to be in the high sixes. April came in higher than the first quarter, so it's moving in the right direction.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Does that consciously have you guys thinking about driving more turnover to take advantage of the higher new lease rate than the renewals? Or are you worried, or is that sort of feedback in to Mike's comments about rent control that has you worried about doing that too much?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I think a little of what you said there but again we like the low turnover equation. More of that occurs in the second quarter in the summer anyway and so when you have that availability tied down, it does allow for upward growth on the new rent side which we would rather capture it there.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then what is the current -- what are you sort of tracking at the current opportunity between the legacy Essex portfolio as well as the BRE portfolio in terms of redevelopment, I think Mike said it is 484 units that you guys did in the first quarter, I mean, what are you expecting in the back half of this year and what sort of a run rate going in to 2016?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, so we expected with the addition of the legacy BRE assets through the redevelopment program we've increased about 50% the number of units subject to redevelopment. And I think our target for the total year is around 2,100 to 2,200 units. So there will be a modest acceleration relative to what we did in the first quarter.
Robert Stevenson: Okay and then just lastly, is the same store portfolio -- is BRE going in there because of the April 1st close or are you guys at January 1 same store portfolio?
Michael T. Dance: Well -- generally speaking, we're a January 1, but given the magnitude of the merger we will bring in the BRE portfolio in the second quarter. So the second quarter same store comparison will be a combined versus a combined, but then the year-to-date will be an Essex only. So, we'll have two different unit accounts for the year-to-date versus quarter-over-quarter.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, given how that's tracking, how the difference between the BRE portfolio and you still have some stuff that you're correcting there, is that going to cause any sort of abnormality when we look at first quarter versus second quarter, just thinking about our run rate, is that going to wind up having the combined company lower in the second quarter than what we'd otherwise see?
Michael J. Schall: I think that's spelled out in the guidance. If you go back to last quarter's guidance, you see a slight moderation in growth because of that. But again it's tracking very favorably, so I would go back to the guidance we provided last quarter that shows the moderation that occurs by combining the two portfolios.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan: Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on the five assets in lease up in terms of what's the pace of lease up, are there any concessions at all out there, and kind of how does this compare to a normal healthy lease up that you see?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. The lease ups are tracking very favorably. The one that we're paying attention to the closest is because it's new, is the One South Market asset that's about to have its first occupancy this month. We've already leased I think as of today 50 units, a little bit more even since yesterday. So, that's a really healthy absorption before we get started there. In the projects in San Francisco, Mosso and MB360 are coming up on stabilization, so their absorption was a little bit slower over the quarter but well within expectations. As you come towards the end, the Emeryville project has been clipping along at 9 to 10 leases a week and so we're just thrilled with that. From a concession standpoint, we probably have anywhere from zero concessions for the first 30 leases at One South Market, I think were done with no concessions on 24 of those and a half to one month on certain floor plans. So again that is an expectation there. And then at the other properties it would be four to six weeks on some of the floor plans. Pretty consistent with what's going on in the markets to get 25 plus leases per month.
Jana Galan: Thank you, Erik.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up on your assessment that your cost of capital is increasing. Your cost of debt is the same, your stock prices have performed well this year, so can you just clarify what you meant by this comment?
Michael J. Schall: Sure, it's Mike Schall speaking again. I think the stock went over $240 earlier this year and there was a pretty significant rally in the 10 year treasury as well. And so we have tried to match fund our acquisitions. And again, what we try to accomplish is capture the arbitrage between our blended cost of funds and the cap rate on the asset, trying to hold portfolio of quality constant, and try to improve the growth rate at the same point. So, at that particular point with the stock trading at $240 and the 10 year, I think it got down to like $170 or something like that was a -- I don't think it's ever been better in my 30 years, almost 30 years here. So, that was an extraordinary period of time. And then we tried to execute match fund transactions against that and again try to capture the arbitrage. So, every quarter that goes by that we're generating somewhere around 10% to 15% core FFO growth was against the cost of capital because you have greater cash flow coming out of the existing portfolio. Again, multiples are declining from that force and from the stock price moderation and from interest rates increasing, still attractive, but increasing. So, again as it relates to acquisition development is different, but as it relates to acquisition we're looking at that, whether there is arbitrage and trying to capture at a favorable moment.
John Kim: Got it, okay. And then right now your stock price is trading at an AFFO yield of about 4% and a pretty significant premium to consensus NAV. Can you just remind us what metric you look at in terms of utilizing equity for acquisitions?
Michael J. Schall: Sure. We follow a fairly standard program looking at the impact of NAV and core FFO. Core FFO on a per-share basis, what is the impact of the acquisition. And again, we're looking for some sort of arbitrage between those two numbers or else all things being equal, if there's zero arbitrage in those numbers and we're generally not inclined to do another acquisition. And more recently we've seen that arbitrage somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points. And again, when our stock rallies and debt rallies if we get closer to that 50 basis point type of number, and then of course we're interested in growth rates. So, we want any acquisition that we make to outgrow the average growth rate of the portfolio. So, we have a progress that we've developed internally that measured each of those things and if we can add value on the acquisition side, we do. If we can't, then we will pass.
John Kim: Speaking of market movements, there's been a correction in some of the major tech company stock prices, have you observed in the past a correlation between asking rents in Northern California and the way that some of these tech companies trade?
Michael J. Schall: I think on the margin, there is not a great deal of impact. If there's a shock to the system and/or something happens that's more pervasive, then absolutely we see an impact. When the internet boom of the late 1990s and early 2000 ended and the companies that were consuming huge chunks of cash had no access to capital, that obviously had a tremendous impact on hiring within the valley went negative by I think somewhere around 10% in Silicon Valley. But on the margin, we're not anywhere close to that type of scenario. And I don't think that they're all that sensitive to stock price as it relates to growing their business. Most of these businesses especially the social media businesses and a lot of the other businesses are very well financed and are not reliant on stock issuance in order to grow.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning and Mike we will definitely miss your conservative guidance.
Michael J. Schall: Hey you know what Alex, I think Mike taught Angela well.
Alexander Goldfarb: Then that means that the guidance will be even more conservative going forward. So, along those lines Mike D, it sounded like in your comments that you're anticipating bringing further boosting 2015 guidance, I mean, assuming that the market doesn't suddenly crack here, rents are very strong. So if that was the correct interpretation we should expect numbers to come up further when you guys report second quarter?
Michael T. Dance: Basically, all we've done is change our guidance to reflect the results already achieved. So basically bringing in our budgets to the scheduled rents and the occupancies we have today and moving it forward. We haven't gone back and revised market rents to reflect this demand/supply imbalance that Mike mentioned and Erik mentioned in their remarks, that we're seeing more jobs coming in than supply. So that imbalance continues. Yes, your comments are -- you understood me correctly.
Michael J. Schall: Hey Alex, you recognize the irony in your question because you accuse him of being a sand bagger and then you ask him if he's going to raise guidance.
Alexander Goldfarb: Well, maybe in his waning moments he's feeling weak as he is heading out the door. The next question is, as you guys look at the Bay Area and obviously visiting out there you can see it firsthand, the amount of growth and also people starting to spill more in to East Bay. Are you guys more inclined to invest further away from San Francisco to get acceptable returns or your view is that when the cycle does correct, those further away areas are going to collapse more and therefore you'd still rather pay up a lot more to be either in the Peninsula or hugging the East Bay Coast versus going out further East?
Michael J. Schall: Yes Alex, this is Mike. One of the strategic limitations that we place upon ourselves is commute patterns because people in general are willing to commute a certain distance from their jobs and trust me, commutes have become much worse out here than I think they've ever been in my career. And we think that limitation is somewhere around a half hour, a half hour commute for a renter. We realize that homeowners will commute longer distances to be sure probably typically an hour. And so that limitation and the increased traffic has meant that to get to your job, the jobs are very concentrated in certain places. To get to your jobs is more challenging than ever. And so we think that the high density residential alternative, be it the condos or apartments is going to be the overwhelming preference of the cities in order to meet the housing need within the area. Interestingly, this last quarter there was a single family development proposal that was at least put off and maybe canceled because of water use. Because single family residential homes consume more water than condos and apartments do. So again, I've commented previously on the impact of AB32 and SB375. These are California's global warming initiatives which have the effect of trying to become much more resource oriented and resource and conservation of resource oriented. And I think that has a bearing on where housing is going to be located so, hence our preference for transit oriented sites and areas that are fairly close to the urban cores or the job centers.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman and Associates.
Daniel Oppenheim: Thanks very much. Mike, given those comments in terms of the locations and the scarcity of properties on the market right now, what do you think about the communities in Riverside and Chino right now, could those potentially be up for sale, would you think about that given the focus in terms of the more core locations?
Michael J. Schall: Dan, that's a good question. I think the plan will be to continue what we've done over the last several years. We will be selling the non-core assets, which certainly Riverside would be included in at the appropriate time. And try to cull the portfolio, we're not in any particular hurry. We think the portfolio is as good as it has ever been and therefore we're happy with the portfolio. But if we see opportunities to dispose of those secondary locations, yes, we're going to do that.
Daniel Oppenheim: Got it and then in terms of the 10% supposed be longer-term leases, I guess what are you seeing in terms of the renewals on that. I imagine that tenants aren't exactly thrilled saying, oh, gee 10% for an even longer-time, I'll sign up for that right away. But do you think that is something that can reduce the turnover even further, and do you think it would benefit from that where it does, you keep the tenants longer versus just ending up getting a little bit in the way of less rent for that?
Michael J. Schall: Yes Dan, it's actually we've had that 10% or some type of renewal cap in place for some period of time. And so it really isn't anything new. And part of the reason why we do it, is it sets up a great discussion with your resident because yes, you're right they don't like a 10% renewal increase. However, the next step in that conversation is, hey, go out and look at the other properties in the area, and we think that you'll come back and conclude this is a rental value, a good rental value and we think we will keep you as a result of that. And so I think it does act as a reward for being an Essex customer which is important to us. And at the same time thought there are these benefits that you don't really see, which are lower vacancy, lower turnover cost. And if you have X amount of traffic coming in the front door, you now have fewer units to lease to that fixed amount of traffic, and obviously it can push rents on the -- for the people that are coming in off the street a little bit harder. So, I think it actually works really well and we've had great success with it over several years and we're happy with it. We think it's a great program.
Daniel Oppenheim: Great, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey out there, thanks for taking my questions. First, Mr. Dance best wishes on your next endeavors. You'll be missed. But I guess a bit of upside here is that there will be less confusion on these calls going forward when someone simply directs a question to Mike.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Question for you Mister well I guess, Mike Schall, a question on capital allocation and a bit of a twist on an earlier question. Help me understand a bit better the decision to acquire assets in LA while developing assets in San Francisco given how far along the San Francisco recovery is and what is still a relatively nascent but sustained recovery in Southern California as you guys described it? Do your recent capital allocation decisions in the region reflect what you believe are the best available returns or opportunities today, and then how do LA acquisition IRRs compare to development IRRs in San Francisco today, and when can we expect to see more South California development starts?
Michael J. Schall: Okay, you may need to remind me of some pieces of that question, because that was one of those multi-faceted ones. But I think what we said was that we like both, and I don't know when Northern California is going to turn again. If you just look at the basic numbers, if Southern California generates 2.5% job growth and Northern California is closer to 3.5% that means the demand is stronger, the supply is not all that different, of total housing I'm talking about, between the two markets. And so you'd say the stronger overall supply/demand imbalance still favors Northern California. However, as I said earlier the absolute coupon, the rent levels are higher in Northern California relative to Southern California. So, I don't know how to handicap which exactly is better. I can say that we like both and I think both will lead the nation in terms of the overall results over the foreseeable future. And I know that, I just saw some Axiometrics data that seemed to come to a similar type of conclusion, and so I don't know. As to development versus acquisition, that's more a function of the deals that we see and where they're located and whether we like them. And John Eudy is here, he may have a comment on that and what he's seeing in terms of deal flow. But generally speaking, I think both Northern California and Southern California are going to be leading metros for some period of time. John, do you have any comment on deal flow?
John D. Eudy: In Northern California, just to comment on the two starts that we've just announced recently, both of those were negotiated and started entitlements in 2011 and 2012 respectively. So, we had some wind at our back on our land basis in the exact locations [ph] on the entitlements that would be tough to match if we were out trying to compete for the same sites today, puts us in a better start position. In terms of the going-in yield, we think they're in the low 5% cap rate obviously. And if the land was higher and the exactions were greater, that would change. So, I think on the margin it's tougher and tougher to do deals in Northern California than it has been ever and given the fact of where we are in the cycle. When you go to Southern California, the problem on the development side is the acquisitions that we've done are at or below replacement cost as a general rule. So, any time you can do that why go through the brain damage of developing unless you can find the right site with the right metrics to make it work. So that's a challenge we have down there. We haven't seen the rent move that we've seen up here and granted it's coming, but the velocity isn't where we think that it's a slam dunk to find development deals.
Haendel St. Juste: How does the math go for the IRRs for acquisitions in LA compared to perhaps the developments in San Francisco?
Michael J. Schall: The IRRs, the typical acquisition IRR which again let's go back to basic strategy, if we're buying on balance sheet, we are really more focused on the impacts to NAV per share, core FFO per share, and the growth rate of the portfolio. In the co-investment world we're more focused on IRRs. But I think generally speaking the IRRs on the typical acquisition are somewhere in the 7% to 8% range, and the development IRRs are in the 9% to 10% range un-levered.
Haendel St. Juste: Got you, appreciate that. And sorry if I missed it earlier, but did you explain your concern on the Seattle market. I assume it's a function of the supply that's predicted to hit Belleview [ph] over the next year or two. And if that's right, can we perhaps see you cull some of your exposure there and maybe reallocate it to another region like maybe South California?
Michael J. Schall: It's a good question, Haendel and we're debating it at this point in time. I note that less than 19% of our revenue is coming from Seattle. So it's not a huge amount. We are looking at the possibility of culling parts of that portfolio. I want to be clear, I don't see a problem per se up there because the jobs growth has been so good. The issue is if there's something broader that happens more broadly to the U.S, economy, which could be geopolitical or international in scope or whatever, that has an effect on the economies around the world, if you have a couple percent job growth -- couple of percent supply growth in that environment, you could find yourself over supplied relatively quickly. So that's the risk that we're focused on. But I think things look good. Based on the numbers that we have in terms of job growth, relative to supply, I think Seattle is still fine.
Haendel St. Juste: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird and Company.
Drew Babin: Thanks for taking my question. As you're out there looking around for acquisitions and competing in the market, are there any new players that you're running in to or any private equity or international money coming in and looking at the space, is there a preference for location or it is in a store you go to the brightest, shiniest assets?
Michael J. Schall: Drew, that's a good question. We have plenty of competition from all the above. From some foreign investment, which I'm hoping a strong dollar might lessen that. But we haven't seen that thus far. And other REITs provide plenty of competition, private equity is in the mix. But everyone has their own little template that they like and that they're pursuing. And so you see a variety of different requirements or mandates out there with respects to the types of property, newer versus value add and locational differences. Some investors we've seen recently are really trying to focus on yield, so they're willing to go to an area that maybe not be in the CBD for example, or an urban area. Maybe go a little bit further out in order to get 25 or 50 basis points higher cap rate. So, again I think it varies from investor to investor. But I'd also say that we're not seeing that many transactions out there, so the transactions that come out tend to be aggressively bid. And right now there's quite a few merchant built properties that are being delivered and will be sold in several of our sub markets. There's also a demand for value add. In our discussion about value add, it seems like so much of the benefit of the value add is already being priced in. It's difficult for us to make those deals work. And so you see a variety of things, but the bottom line is a relative dearth of well located property and plenty of capital chase event.
Drew Babin: And does that kind of get you in a position or I guess I should say how close are you to being in a position where it might make sense to start selling some assets that you would consider more at the right price?
Michael J. Schall: And again we will cull the portfolio but what I said about acquisitions a few minutes ago, that they're accretive to NAV cash flow and growth rate to make that work in reverse, because at disposition you need somewhere to put the money. And having, it is funny most of my career the option of leaving money in a money market account or in short-term bond was not that painful. It's obviously incredibly painful now because money -- interest on money is 20 basis points or something like that. So you don't have that option. And acquisitions are still working, so that would imply that broad based disposition probably is not going to be part of our plan until those forces change.
Drew Babin: Okay, thank you very much.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. And Mike, I hope you dance in your retirement like no one's watching.
Michael T. Dance: Thank you. I am a pretty ugly dancer.
Richard Anderson: I just crafted that one just now, by the way. I just have one quick question for maybe Mike Schall or whomever. But I can recall many years ago, I don't even remember when, when your company was underperforming, your peers and I don't know about dramatic fashion, but certainly meaningful, and you had a situation with the State of California, obviously, driving that unemployment up. But what is it that could happen here, is that situation in any way, shape, or form repeatable in your mind in the foreseeable future as it relates to you relative to the rest of the country?
Michael J. Schall: Well, that's a good question. I'm hoping someone around the table here has a crystal ball because I don't have it. Rich, I would say that things look as good from a supply/demand standpoint and in terms of what the State is looking to accomplish as it relates to housing in terms of higher densities, more urbanization, public transits, getting people out of their cars, and reducing the impact on commutes. I mean all of those things are incredibly positive for us. So I think…
Richard Anderson: I'm just trying to create a road map of where it could go wrong?
Michael J. Schall: Yeah I felt so, it has gone wrong before, so that was my next point. One thing that's certain about the world is it will change. And people -- businesses make good decisions. In the late 1990s when Northern California became very expensive, you saw movement of businesses and back office operations, pieces of businesses to Southern California, and it was the beneficiary of the tech boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The tech community is, I would say, sensitive to broader economic conditions and Northern California from my mind is a more -- there's more volatility, but at a higher overall growth rate. Northern California generates the highest CAGR of rent growth over a long period of time as compared to any of our other markets. But there's more bouncing around, more volatility within that number. So, housing is very economically sensitive and to the extent you've got large supply pipelines that are undelivered, it becomes even more sensitive. We saw that in the last cycle in Seattle where we had 3% supply that went to jobs declined, something like 10% and that 3% supply hit the marketplace and decimated rents in that marketplace. So those are the types of things that we're concerned about. That enters in to our thinking though, and we try to react to it. People ask us, why do you joint venture your development pipeline and part of the reason for that is that we commit to a cap rate on day one and we don't know what the yield is and we don't know what our cost to capital is until the deal is finished. And therefore it exposes us during that period that we're building it and leasing it up to the forces that could change in the marketplace. So, we tried to -- part of the reason why our balance sheet remains at a very conservative level. So we try to build the model of the business and react to some of the forces that you're talking about in a thoughtful way. So that over the long haul we outperform. But, I would say that the answer to your question is dislocation in the economy will affect us and affect everyone at the same time.
Richard Anderson: Right, okay. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
Dave Bragg: Thank you, good morning. Mike Dance, congrats and thanks for the update on your leverage progress earlier. Can you just review where you stand today relative to your long-term targets?
Michael T. Dance: We're about 6.5 times turns with the growth that we continue to see in the sequential NOI and the continued success in leasing up the co-investments, it could be low sixes by the end of the year and continuing in to the high fives next year. So, basically to Mike's point, preparing for the times when things may change and we don't have that luxury, so I think continuing to build up that capacity for the rainy day is where we're headed.
Dave Bragg: And that leads to the next question. Essex was uniquely active during 2009 and 2010. I might be wrong, but I think your leverage in 2006 and 2007 is pretty comparable to where it is today. What would you say is the reason why you didn't do even more during that time, were you capital constrained or opportunity constrained?
Michael J. Schall: I remember it vividly. It's because the world was coming to an end remember that Dave? Or the fear was -- exactly, it was a very uncomfortable time to make big commitments because no one knew where the bottom was. And so I think that was the driving force that we were trying to focus on, let's maintain the dividend. Let's do a thoughtful job of operating the portfolio and let's not make any big bets in a very uncertain time.
Dave Bragg: And given that to what extent do you debate internally the idea of taking leverage even lower than those targets that you just walked through?
Michael J. Schall: We have discussions about the 100 year flood, and how well -- and we did pretty well during that period of time. Obviously, the stock didn't do well, but we raised the dividend very marginally each year and we paid the dividend in cash every year. So, we think the model for our balance sheet has been pretty well tested in the 100 year flood and it has done pretty well. So, that factors in to our thinking. So obviously, everyone wants to deleverage at the top of the cycle. No one has certainty with respect to where that is. But we are debating it and we're trying to get that right. We still think that we have at least a couple and maybe more pretty darn good years ahead of us given the supply/demand relationship. And so hopefully our hope is that we continue to just naturally deliver via growth and we end up somewhere in the fives.
Michael T. Dance: This is Mike Dance. The other change that we've made dramatic improvements on since the last recession, is most of our assets were encumbered, and so the ability to sell those assets was limited. And if that were to reoccur, we're in a much better position to sell assets and use those proceeds to buy back stock. So that's the other motivation for continuing to delever as we are in these good times.
Dave Bragg: Thanks for that, that's very interesting. And then the next question just rewinds the clock even further, back in 2005 and 2006, Essex pursued several mid-Atlantic portfolios and most notably the Town and Country portfolio and at the time you talked about your views that DC was quite like California and Baltimore was quite like Seattle over the long term, do you retain those long-term views that clearly hasn't played out over the last 10 years, your markets have done much better but what's your long-term thinking on that?
Michael J. Schall: We do believe that there are certain East Coast markets that are similar to the West Coast markets. I think the thing that's changed though since then is there are already four companies that are bi-coastal in nature, and we are the only ones that have this particular and I think very appealing piece of geography. So, I think the uniqueness in this case makes us favor a West Coast centric company. And I think that we've gotten pretty good credit for being the local sharp shooter out there, and I think that adds some value. And so, we're happy where we are, Dave.
Dave Bragg: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.
Tom Lesnick: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, I guess with so many jobs coming from the tech industry and VC funded start ups, employees are often compensated not just with salary but with equity as well. So, I guess in the context of that, how are you guys thinking about equity comp and how close we are to approaching an upper limit or so to speak, on what people are willing and/or able to pay in rent? Are you factoring equity comp into your rent income analysis or just base salaries?
Michael J. Schall: No, it's mostly base salaries. If you look at the base salaries in San Francisco and throughout the West Coast, I think they're high. And one of the things that's a little bit different about our markets is that personal income growth is pretty substantial. And I think that there's some fives and sixes in personal income growth and I have a chart here. 2015 personal income growth I think that San Jose is the leader at 6.2% and a lot of fives throughout our West Coast portfolio. So if we're growing rents at 7% and income levels are growing at 5% to 6.5% it's not really pushing that rent to median income level to a great extent. So we still feel pretty good about it. Anecdotally, I was talking to a young 26 year old professional that was renting with a couple roommates a place near the beach in Southern California and paying $3,300. And I said, how do you think about that $3,300, which to me is like the king's ransom in rent, but she thought, you know, that seems pretty good deal. So, I think we forget that each generation reprices and as long as the relationships are okay. So I think because we are in high income areas that the pushback from rent, which there certainly is some, but I think it's manageable.
Tom Lesnick: Alright, thanks. And then my second question following on that, I guess historically, when liquidity events have picked up pace, did you see any correlation to move out to purchase a home, did the realization of the equity create influence renter behavior in that regard?
Michael J. Schall: It's hard to tie it exactly to that. We hit an all time high, move out to buy homes in 2008, which you would expect before the crash. That was something like 17% or 18% and an all time low in 2009, that was about 7%. The recent trends have been a little bit below the long-term average which is 11% to 12%. I think the last quarter we said it was 9.8%, we move out to buy a home. So, we're not seeing a big move out push to buy homes at this point in time. But again, as I've commented on prior calls, there is a very limited supply of for sale housing and that is having a great deal of impact on the overall housing supplies within our markets, and it's helping us a lot.
Tom Lesnick: Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is George on for Tayo. I guess first off Mike Dance, congrats on the retirement and enjoy the bike riding.
Michael T. Dance: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: I guess my questions, in terms of your JVs, you're continuing to do JVs on the development side and you're buying out some JV interests. Just overall, what are you seeing from current and potential JV partners in terms of doing anymore potential JV buy outs and then also sort of interest from the JV partners to do more investments and then just additionally, are JV partners having interest to go in to other markets where you guys currently are not present, where you might be influenced to go into a new market because a JV partner would like to allocate capital there?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, this is Mike answering this question. Generally speaking we're in the markets that we want to be in and we would not enter a new market because there was financing from a JV partner. In general, we're 50%, around 50% of these ventures. And we believe that the co-investment option is important to us because there are certain times where if our cost to capital changes and stock price goes down and debt rates go up, it may be more advantageous to use a joint venture to buy a property when we can't make it work on balance sheets. So, it is really a diversification program with respect to having different capital options so that we can optimize the opportunities that we see. So, generally speaking that's how we view it. When, as I mentioned on the call, our stock price rallies very nicely and debt rallies as well, we see opportunities to potentially buy out some partners. We're less excited about that today than we were earlier in the first quarter, and so I think that's less likely. But I think it's still the on balance sheet cost to capital is marginally better than the co-investment capital in terms of just the overall cost to capital equation. So, we'd probably prefer to execute on balance sheet still.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. It's a long call, so I'll leave it there.
Michael J. Schall: Very good.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Schall, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael J. Schall: Okay, very good, thank you operator. I guess in closing, I just want to note that we appreciate your participation on the call. Obviously, we're very pleased with what's going on out here and the results last quarter and our outlook ahead. And we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month. Good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you. I would like to start by welcoming everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. As usual, Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy, John Burkart, and Angela Kleiman are available for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, comments on Q4 and market conditions; second, merger integration update; and third, investment activities. So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2014. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 15.1% compared to Q4 2013. For the full year, core FFO was $0.29 per share above the mid point of initial 2014 guidance range. In the four-year period from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have now grown core FFO per share by 70%, while tripling the total market capitalization of the company to almost $19 billion, and we are about a year ahead of our strategic plan outlined in our November 2013 Investor Day. Mike Dance will comment on guidance in a moment, which anticipates continued momentum into 2015, supporting our expectation for strong rental markets and financial results. The primary factors supporting these expectations include: number one, inadequate housing construction relative to demand. While new apartment deliveries have increased, for sale housing construction continues to significantly lag. Total supply of housing, both rental and for sale in our target markets will average 0.8% of stock. This is the fifth year that housing demand has exceeded supply pushing rents higher as market occupancy levels increase. Going forward, the suburban markets benefit most from this process, notably the East Bay which led the portfolio in rent growth.  Number two, we expect the U.S. economy to improve modestly in 2015 with our assumed 2015 GDP upto 2.8%. If that GDP assumption is achieved, our target markets are expected to produce 2.5% job growth, significantly above the U.S. average. Number three, California is different from Seattle on the supply side. In Seattle, where higher rents and for sale prices have lead to more housing supply, rent growth expectations have moderated. However, in Coastal California, supply has been muted by other factors including a long entitlement process, nimbyism, and large equity requirements for construction loans. In addition, a new factor has emerged resulting from new laws designed to reduce green-house emissions, notably California’s AB-32 and SB-375, both of which are described at considerable detail on state websites. These laws attempt to focus housing development in proximity to office and retail venues creating urban clusters that are accessible by public transit systems. Pursuing California’s massive proposed high-speed rail line instead of fixing clogged and failing roads demonstrates this change in direction in California. It is not coincidental that nearly all of our investment activity is in the urban core or near public transit. We believe that these factors will continue to constrain housing development in our coastal California markets, and these conditions will not change materially for at least several years.  On to the second topic, merger integration, during the quarter, we made significant progress on merger integration, and as expected we’re nearing the end of the first of three phases in the integration process. That first phase includes on boarding over 500 BRE employees, consolidating offices, moving all employees under one HRIS system, migrating all properties on to one property management and accounting platform, and consolidating pricing under one system. As part of phase 1, we also improved occupancy and pricing practices resulting in higher revenues from the legacy BRE portfolio, and we temporarily discontinued the BRE redevelopment program to prepare individual property assessments and rehab plans. There are still many details to complete in connection with phase 1, although most of the heavy lifting is done. I thank all the e-team members for their relentless effort.  We kicked off phase II of the BRE integration last month, which includes extending resource management which seeks to lower energy and water consumption, and the redevelopment programs to the legacy BRE portfolio. As discussed on prior calls, we will also continue to implement refinements to pricing, including amenity pricing and reduce turnover rates. Finally, we expect a new website to be implemented early in the second quarter. Our planning efforts related to the third integration phase is in full swing and is intended to transform the combined company changing how we deliver our services with greater ease and efficiency, utilizing technology and changing our highly decentralized structure, especially where we have significant concentrations of property. The goals of Phase III include integrating and simplifying systems, improving reporting and accountability, establishing greater flexibility and responsiveness to customers, customer relationship management, centralizing procurement, creating a regional management structure for maintenance functions, and a variety of human resource projects focused on management training and fast tracking high achieving associates. Phase III is expected to be financially positive with respect to both revenues and expenses. Finally, on to my third topic investments. We sold two properties in Phoenix that were acquired in the BRE merger at a cap rate of approximately 5.7%. This completes our exit from the Phoenix market, a market with a CAGR rent growth of less than 1% over the last 15 years. Given recent increases in our stock price and low debt costs, we continue to be able to add cash flow and NAV per share through external growth. We completed approximately 641 million in acquisitions in 2014, up from 461 million in 2013. Overall, we expect to acquire approximately 500 million in 2015 or more if we can find suitable transactions emphasizing Coastal California. A dearth of transactions in the past quarter provides little guidance on cap rate. Given rate liquidity and lower capital cost, cap rate could be up to 25 basis points lower than those discussed in our last call. Our best estimate is that the highest quality properties and locations trade around a 4% cap while B quality property and locations trade around 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality property trades at higher cap rates, and periodically a trophy property trades in the high 3% CAP rate range. With respect to development, we continue to make great progress, completing and leasing up our development pipeline detailed on S9. We have three projects schedule to start this year and are working on a fourth project that could possibly start towards the end of 2015. Falling oil and commodity prices should reduce the risk of significant cost increases for construction materials, a positive given our concern about construction cost increases. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call. I will now turn the call over to Erik.
Erik Alexander: I can’t thank the Essex team enough for another strong quarter achieving the kind of results that Essex has posted this period while expanding responsibilities, learning new programs, and converting our management system is impressive and a testament to the focus of the dedication of our team. After closing the occupancy GAAP last quarter, we were able to maintain parity between the portfolios with respect to financial occupancy, and both portfolios moved up 32 basis points during the final period of 2014. Also consistent with our strategy, we were able to keep turnover between the portfolios at the same rate, and average lease terms are virtually identical. Even the physical occupancy between the portfolio is currently about 50 basis points apart . We expect some difference between the portfolios at the end of the first quarter, with the result expected given the overexposure of lease expirations in the BRE portfolio that were discussed on our last call.  The markets were in line with expectations during the quarter. The Bay Area continues to set the pace for Essex followed by Seattle and an accelerating Southern California. The thing that was different between the portfolios in the fourth quarter was that the Essex portfolio exceeded revenue projections. The main drivers for this improvement was the continued benefits of higher scheduled rents due to our profitable renovation activity and greater portfolio weightings in strong submarkets like Santa Clara town. Additionally, the underperformance of three BRE assets in Los Angeles coupled with differences in delinquency and other income items as a result of our systems conversion, all contributed to a wider revenue GAAP in the fourth quarter.  However, with the BRE portfolio operating at a higher occupancy and reduced turnover, we believe that we are in good position to grow scheduled rents this year. These efforts will be aided by implementing our renovation plan in the BRE portfolio and completing the migration to a unified revenue management system for more consistent pricing and renewal practices. Predictably, market rent levels abated from the summer highs, but we saw less of a decline from peak brands compared to prior periods, and year-over-year gains in market rents were stellar led by San Jose, Oakland, and Fremont. The Bay Area experienced double digit market rent growth in 2014. We expect the same submarkets to repeat as the strongest markets this year and collectively the Bay Area should enjoy economic rent growth north of 7% in 2015. Sub-market details of our forecast can be found on S15 of the supplement. Also, encouraging was the continued improvement in Southern California, especially in Orange County and San Diego. While our plan for 2015 calls for 4.5% to 5.5% market rent growth in Southern California with Los Angelis leading the way, improving jobs and low supply could help Orange County and San Diego surprise for the upsize. Once again, we expect renewal activity to support strong revenue results, offered rates on renewals through March are in the low-6% range for Essex and in the mid-5% range for the BRE portfolio. Earlier this week, physical occupancy in the Essex same-store portfolio was 96.5% with the net lease of 4.8%. The BRE same-store portfolio was at 96% with the net lease of 5.1%. Now, I will share some highlights from each region beginning with Southern California. Los Angeles experienced the biggest revenue gap between the portfolios during the fourth quarter. Where we came up short was the three of our four largest revenue producers in BRE Los Angeles portfolio generated meager year-over-year revenue growth of 1.3%. We expect two of those assets, The Stuart and 5600 Whilshire to rebound nicely in 2015, because we completed disruptive exterior renovations at The Stuart last year, and we traded revenue growth at 5600 Whilshire for stronger absorption at nearby Wilshire La Brea, Dylan, and Huxley. Given the success of those lease-ups, we believe this was a reasonable trade. The third asset, Alessio, has faced a number of operational challenges pre-dating the merger. We were aware of those items and continue to work through some of the asset planning and resident profile issues that will take some additional time to resolve. Given that the West LA’s submarket is performing well overall, I am confident that we can narrow the revenue gap at Alessio this year. The employment picture continues to improve in Los Angeles. The unemployment rate has dropped 130 basis points year-over-year with the information and professional and business service sectors combining to produce 35% of all jobs added in 2014. This is important because these are high paying jobs and represent a larger renter contingent. Motion picture job growth was also up 5% year-over-year. Commercial activity remained consistent with all four coastal counties recording positive net absorption with the greatest contribution coming from Orange County. However, activity in Los Angeles generated the most positive news in the tech world. Google purchased 12 Acres in Playa Vista which is zoned for 900,000 sq. ft. of commercial development, and soon they are expected to announce the lease for the adjacent 300,000 sq. ft. Howard Hughes hanger. Additionally, Yahoo signed a long-term lease for a 130,000 sq. ft. in the neighboring collective campus development. This emerging technology cluster should bode well for the 21,000 apartments that Essex operates within just a few miles of this employment hub.  So the bottom line is that we are bullish on Los Angeles, and we believe the combined portfolio will produce stronger results in 2015. The broader region continues a path of steady recovery. Orange County and San Diego exceeded job growth expectations in 2014 and pushed Southern California above 2%. We look for these counties to be strong again in 2015. San Diego is expected to perform well this year, but this region has the highest level of lease expirations among the BRE assets in the first quarter, so we are likely to see some difference in the revenue results between Essex and BRE for Q1. Again, this is a short-term issue that is consistent with our plan, and solved in part by operating a single revenue management program and centralizing renewal activity.  We are excited about Orange County and have recently seen greater improvement in the performance of many of our A-assets. It’s too early to determine that this will be a trend throughout 2015, but we are optimistic about the results at these high quality communities. So, as the overall economy continues to improve and supply remains muted, we look for Southern California to be a valuable contributor to our 2015 results. Turning to the Bay Area, the Bay Area continues to post impressive job gains and be the catalyst for the company’s leading revenue growth. The December year-over-year job growth in San Jose and San Francisco was 4% and 3.7% respectively. Once again, information and professional business services accounted for more than half of those new jobs in 2014, and we are seeing much of the same for 2015. Commercial activity continues to be strong in an effort to support new companies and expansion. During 2014, nearly 5 million sq. ft. was absorbed in San Francisco, the Peninsula, and the Silicon Valley. The same submarkets have over 8 million sq. ft. of office under construction which is enough to support upto 40,000 new jobs. Economic rent levels remain strong and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis at the end of the fourth quarter. These markets have little trouble absorbing new supply, and our own leased up properties continue perform ahead of plan. Mosso averaged 33 market rentals per month during the fourth quarter. Even working from a trailer and heavy construction zone, MB360 secured over 50 leases during the quarter. Park 20 has recorded more than 60 leases since opening in mid-November, and we have not even occupied the leasing office yet. With such strong results throughout the holiday, it is evident that demand continues to comfortably outpace supply, so you can see why we look forwarding to opening Emme, Epic, and One South market this year. Now for Seattle, employment growth for the region remains very strong, and in December posted 3.1% year-over-year gain. Amazon and Microsoft continue to big drivers of this growth, and we have not seen any impact from Microsoft’s change in policies for contract workers. However, the software giant does have a new neighbour, SpaceX received $1 billion of funding from Fidelity and Google and has opened an office in Redmond with plans to employ 1,000 people within the first few years of operation. Amazon continues to march storage occupying 10 million sq. ft. in Seattle by 2019 and office absorption in Seattle region overall was 2 million sq. ft. in 2014 and is expected to reach similar levels in 2015. Our rent growth forecast is tempered by the impact of increased deliveries in 2015. The robust job growth will help these developments get absorbed. We continue to like our portfolio composition in Seattle, and we expected to produce solid revenue gains this year, especially on the east side and south end. I am very glad to have come through 2014 with only a few more grey hairs, though we still have some important integrations items to complete. I believe we are well poised to take advantage of the opportunities that our strong markets are presenting. Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Mike Dance. 
Michael Dance: Thanks, Erik. Before I begin my comments on 2015 guidance, I too want to especially thank the Essex accounting, IT, and HR teams that worked countless hours in 2014 to successfully plan, execute, and complete the integration of accounting and HR information systems. I’ll now highlight the key assumptions behind our 2015 guidance. Many of these assumptions are found on page 5 of the press release and on S13 of the supplemental package.  The first point emphasized on the ‘15 guidance is to reiterate Mike’s earlier comment that the midpoint of our core FFO guidance range is predicated on achieving 2.5% job growth in our markets. Continuation of the current Goldilocks economic recovery provides ample job growth to absorb new supply and perpetuates the chronic shortage of well-located housing in our markets. Next, I will explain why the first quarter midpoint for core FFO guidance of $2.22 per diluted share is $0.02 lower than the result achieved in Q4 of ‘14. In late ‘14 and early ’15, we sold two Phoenix assets. These Phoenix dispositions offset the increased net operating income from the same property portfolio and the continued lease of our development communities.  The remaining shortfall results from the first quarter issuance of equity to match fund our external growth pipeline. For ’15, we expect same property net operating income to grow in the Essex portfolio by 8.5% off the midpoint driven by 6.75% increase in same property revenues. We will be including the BRE properties that were stabilized at the time the merger closed on April 1 in the same store portfolio at the beginning of the second quarter. For the last three quarters of ’15, we expect the legacy BRE same property revenues to grow at 6% of the midpoint. The primary difference between the Essex and BRE same store growth rates in ‘15 is attributable to the restarting of the renovations in ‘15 in the BRE portfolio.  At the beginning of the renovation program, the increase in vacancies are not offset from the high risk scheduled risks. It typically takes three quarters before the increase in monthly schedule rents for the renovated homes begins to exceed the loss in occupancy. Our guidance assumes a 3% increase in operating expenses at the midpoint for both portfolios. The biggest factor driving expense growth is higher property taxes. Our budget assumes property taxes to increase 5% in the Essex portfolio driven by a 10% increase in Seattle taxes and the expected loss in California of over $1 million and successful 2014 tax appeals that are not expected to be replicated in 2015. We expect our controllable expenses to grow by less than 2% for the year for the combined portfolio. The ‘15 general administrative expenses before merger and integration, cyber and acquisition related costs, is expected to increase by approximately 6% over the run rate we had in the last three quarters of ’14. The increase was a result of filling several open corporate positions including a new Chief Accounting Officer and a new Chief Technology Officer, both recently hired plus annual wage increases. Our ‘15 cash flow projections for our ownership interest in the development pipeline will be approximately 285 million plus a 150 million in revenue generating capital expenditures to renovate units and add amenities to the stabilized portfolio. We plan to refinance the 95 million on maturing secured financing, and the 200 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit with the new issuance of unsecured bonds during the first half of the year. We will continue our disciplined matched funding of equity and long-term debt to finance our external growth capital requirements. I will close with the quick reference to the half turn improvement from Q3 to Q4, and our net debt to EBITDA credit metrics disclosed on S6. Most of the improvement in this metric is the result of the accelerated lease up from the BRE development pipeline and the strong NOI growth in the portfolio, and 15 basis points to the improvement is attributable to an update in a calculation of ratio from total indebtedness, the net indebtedness to be consistent with the reporting of our REIT peers. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question. 
Nick Joseph: Mike you mentioned cap rates are potentially compressing meaningfully since your last call. Do you attribute that to interest rates falling or are you seeing an increased demand for assets?
Michael Schall: I think it’s a couple of things. I think it’s lack of activity, lack of listed properties out there on the market place. So in other words there is a supply and demand for property out there, and supply driven by people listing their properties, demand driven by investor dollars searching for that -- for those properties, and they can become -- those forces can become out of wack just like any other supply and demand force. As a result of that, what we’re seeing is less property coming on to the market and still considerable demand for multi-family assets and we think that the combination of those two in addition to overall lower capital cost may push cap rates down a little bit. 
Nick Joseph: So do you think that the buyer’s underwritten IRR has come down as well?
Michael Schall: I do. Again, not materially, I mean as I said in my comments, there has really been very few transactions since last quarter, and so I think that we are interpreting the [tea leaves] perhaps a little bit here, and so what I’m talking about is I think more of an anticipation than a reality at this point in time. 
Nick Joseph: Okay, thanks. Appreciate that. And then for the BRE renovation program, can you talk about the scope of what they were doing and the returns that were being achieved and then compare that to how you think about renovation going forward? 
Michael Schall: Yes, this is Mike S again; and John Burkart is here. He may want to add to it. In effect, we just had a different set of objectives. Our objective is to generate returns and overall improve our properties. The BRE redevelopment program was focussed on trying to generate the same unit everywhere. So, our view is depending upon geography you need to customize the rehab program to the asset you’re dealing with and try to find things -- and John has done a great job with our redevelopment program because he has a whole list of potential amenities from backyards to other site amenities and interiors that really reflect the opportunity in the market place as opposed to trying and create more of a one size fits all type of approach. So, ours is a customized approach, and BRE was different from that. I recall at one of the first meetings we had in Las Vegas where we are looking at -- all the management team was there -- we were looking at returns from redevelopment efforts on the BRE site, again because they were trying to go to product consistency as opposed to investment return. They had some very low yielding redevelopment projects, and essentially that’s what we’re trying to correct or to improve. 
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just finally on the Walnut Creek development; it looks like the estimated total costs went up about $7 million. What caused that?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. A combination of two things, Nick, we had some environmental issues that we had during the course of the excavation. We believe we have recovery from Atlantic Richfield and a couple of others, but we’re not putting that in the number we are assuming, we don’t, that constituted about 2.5 million of the total. And then, there were some structural issues related to the build out on design of the units. We made some changes, and there are other issues that came up, and we went to the high end number. I think it’s going to be little less than what we have reported, the increase, but we wanted to put everything on the table, worst-case.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS, please proceed.
Nick Yulico: Mike Schall, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the acquisition environment and your guidance gives some acquisitions in it, but you know there is not a ton of the FFO benefits, it sounds like you might be balancing it off for some sales, I mean, how are you looking at maybe using the ATMs some more to do acquisitions this year. It seems like you guys are one of the few multifamily REITs that could actually drive some extra earnings growth by doing acquisitions. 
Michael Schall: Right, no, I totally agree with you. I think that cost of capital has improved since we submitted our business plan to the board, which is where the accretion number came from. Obviously, we sold the two Phoenix assets that are relatively high cap rate, and so we have had to overcome the dilution related to that from new acquisitions. I think that this year is one of the most difficult years to project what’s going to happen primarily because there is such a dearth of transaction activity out there right now. However, having said that, most of the transactions are bunched into the peak leasing season, whereas sellers have learned to try to get the benefit of the peak leasing season. If rents are up another $100, obviously that inures to their benefit and evaluation of their properties, and so there is likely to be more transactions beginning and let’s say the second quarter through the third quarter, we just have a hard time predicting what that might look like. So we’d love to do more. Again, I think cost of capital is only moved in our favor since our initial accretion numbers came -- that were presented to the Board. And so, I think that there is some upside opportunity, we’re just not sure about how deep the opportunity set is going to be on the acquisition side.
Nick Yulico: Okay. That makes sense and then just one other question. As I look at your market forecasts this year or any of the S15 in the supplemental, you gave a forecast for job growth which looks like it’s slowing down a bit, this year versus -- I had like 2.7% job growth in December for your markets and you have rent growth as well slowing down. It seems like the rent growth is almost slowing down similarly between these areas; Seattle, Northern California and Southern California. When I would have thought that may be the impact would have been more so in say San Jose, Seattle or maybe there is more supply. So could you just maybe talk a little bit about your thoughts are on these forecasts and how much supply and job growth is impacting them? 
Michael Schall: Of course. So we are on S15. Anyone who is trying to follow this discussion, where we reproduce the job forecast and a forecast for residential supply, it intended to be a scenario. So if U.S. GDP grows at 2.8% and the U.S. gets 2% job growth, we think that the West Coast markets on average will outperform that. We have 2.5%, you made the point that that appears to be a deceleration but I want to note that in 2014 we did the same exercise and what happened was we ended up doing better in terms of jobs in our initial forecast. So I think that there isn’t a chance that we can beat these numbers. I note that, as Eric also commented on San Jose’s job growth over December ‘14 was 4% and San Francisco is 3.7%; we have those numbers decelerating to 3.2% and 3%. So this is not a perfect science. We try to do a pretty good job of trying to have a economic scenario and a economic rent growth forecast. There is an element perhaps of being somewhat conservative because we don’t know what factors may face us in the New Year. And certainly we hope to move ahead. I think the other force that I referred to in the call which is in coastal California the lack of for sale housing production and the fifth year of demand over supply imbalance, are also really important considerations. We are not sure exactly how those will play out. It could be that once again it just pushes occupancies that much further and we actually get another really fantastic year rent growth. So there is an element of not knowing here and we probably interpret that to be a little bit more conservative than we could. I think that there -- specifically I think there is upside to the southern California numbers given again very limited supply of housing and improving economies we see it in -- certainly in Downtown LA and West LA, in West Hollywood and in Hollywood certainly and to a lesser extent other areas, like in Warner Center we have very limited growth rate and I’ve seen very limited growth for several years. So, I think that LA has the opportunity, the LA Metro area has opportunity to outperform and Northern California again the conditions are great, but we have a pretty high expectation there, certainly relative to axiometrics and some of the other numbers. So again it’s not a perfect science and there is a certain art to this and we think this is a reasonable scenario given what we expect the U.S. economy to do in U.S. job growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 
Jana Galan: May be following up on that, I was curious how you think about the macro risks to job and wage growth given the stronger dollar and lower energy prices, does that get us to the lower end of your guidance or do you think the type of job growth in your markets is less impacted than the national average?
Michael Schall: Jana, that’s a good question. I think Mike’s analogy to the Goldilocks economy is a good one because even though I would say that a strong dollar would hurt global companies in general, I think that there is enough momentum here especially in the tech world to continue with really good job numbers and again we have some deceleration forecast if you look at what we achieved in 2014 versus what we projected I think if you look at December-over-December 14 jobs we were up 2.8% as a portfolio we’re projecting 2.5%. I think that’s a reasonable expectation given what’s happening in the job world and with macro economics. So we feel pretty comfortable with that. 
Jana Galan: And then you mentioned the lower oil helping a little on that development commodity prices. Is there any benefit you can realize in your expenses?
Michael Schall: I don’t think that we specifically targeted that as the expense element. There might be something, Jana. I think in the scheme of things you know I think Mike talked about property taxes being the driving force here and so yes, I don’t see anything material. I’m sure there is something, because you know obviously oil cost affects delivery cost in a variety of materials and that could have some impact, but I don’t think it’s material. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. 
Dan Oppenheim: I was wondering how you think about the growth in terms of wages for the tenants and the ability to pay these high rents and I think we look at the lack of supply and the difficult affordability in the markets, tough to argue the rent were as forecast unless we see something change in terms of employment but, how much do you think we will see some movement whether it’s from Dublin further out on 580 or in Southern California’s from Orange to Riverside, that would sort of lead to higher turnovers, so the rent numbers may come through, but the expense end up being a bit higher.
Michael Schall: I think that we have the expense growth numbers that we think that are prudent as we go through our budgeting process which is essentially a ground-up type of process. I think Eric can probably talk about what that assumption is with respect to our budgets, but in general I think the driving force of personal incomes are these tech companies and business services that are actually doing very well. I think this is BLS data doesn’t forecast the personal income growth and they have San Francisco at 6.6% estimated for 2015, Seattle 5.6%, San Jose 6.8%; so very healthy numbers on the personal income side. And that of course drives the rent to immediate income ratio which still are within the ratios that we consider to be sustainable. So we feel good about that. Now having said that I think that not everyone obviously is getting these wage growth and so there is a transition going on within the portfolio, so if you are coming and taking a new job that’s a high end job you could afford to pay the higher rent. Someone perhaps is being priced out of that scenario and may have to move further out and I think you see that phenomenon occurring within our portfolio because you see for example the Eastbay, Alameda County and Contra Costa County growing faster than San Francisco. I think that that represents people that are being priced out of the market, looking for a suitable house that’s you know typically on a transit node outside the city. So there is a transition going on and I think that’s healthy for the market place.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Weisman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Weisman: I just wanted to talk a little bit about your relative out performance in California and across your core markets. Obviously the West Coast continued to dominate, but your performances materially bettered than your peers. I just wanted to understand whether that’s a bit of submarket exposure, suburban concentration or just operational outperformance? 
Michael Schall: I think a big part of it is redevelopment and we have really worked hard to perfect that. We produce less than 1% of housing stock a year, out here in our core costal markets. That means over 20 years you’re producing somewhere around 20% of stock that means 80% of the stock is more than 20 years old and realizing that the real opportunity is in the redevelopment area and certainly is the focus within acquisitions to try to find value added transactions. I think that is a big driver. I also think that our submarket selection is good and our capital allocation process which involves ranking 30 somewhat submarkets and deploying capital appropriately ahead of growth. I think all those things work together. I note that one of the transactions we bought last year Apex -- Craig, our senior acquisition guy was noticing that between the time that the deal was listed and the time it actually got through the best and final was like 45 day lag, something like that, in that period of time he noticed that the rents have moved up significantly and he went from sort of #3 in that process to #1 by increasing his bid a little bit and ended up with a superior transaction. So, I think it’s a variety of things about how we look at the world from capital deployment and allocation to the opportunity represented by the rehab program I think really drives that outperformance. 
Dan Weisman: Okay helpful. And just as a follow-up on the IRR comment you made earlier, in terms of IRR compression, where would you put IRRs today in your market and also how much of land prices increase year-over-year?
Michael Schall: May be John, you do the land price and then I’ll do the...
John Eudy: Sure. Yes, go ahead. It’s hard and this is John Eudy. It’s hard to define exactly on the land price increase but the ask is much higher than last year, I’d say by probably 10% to 15%. Those that are actually transacting at that level I can’t directly speak to, I can say that in our shadow pipeline it’s about a $1.3 billion fixed deals and they are all conceptualized on an average about four years ago that are set to close in part this year and next year. We have a very difficult time paying the freight on land prices that are being quoted today. So I don’t know if that answers your question.
Dan Weisman: And the IRR’s?
John Eudy: Yes, the IRRs, I think unlevered IRR’s on acquisitions, I think expectation is in the 7.5 range for acquisition, so you need significant amount of growth to get there, and on the development I think we are on the 8.
Dan Weisman: That’s again on unlevered basis?
John Eudy: Unlevered, yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Hoffman with Jefferies; please proceed with your question.
George Hoffman: Just a couple of questions, first on the Alecio property, can you give a little more color on what the issues are at that property?
Erik Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. I think they are primarily resident profile. We have a much higher delinquency and incidence of eviction there. So, just by way of example, in the fourth quarter we experienced 29 either evictions or encouraged move outs due to non-payment of rent. That would compare to something that’s more like 7 or 8 in a quarter under normal conditions. So we think we were working through those. We had some abatement of that activity in the third quarter that we saw returned. And the nice thing is that of all the evictions that we have processed in the last five months, 80% of those were existing residents. So we think we are making headway on the underwriting of the people that are coming in. And even of the 20% that we’ve already moved in and moved out, some of those were related to fraudulent activity. Again that gives us another opportunity to tighten up some of the screening process there. So that’s a big part of it. Because when you don’t have, it is the same equation when you don’t have the strength in occupancy, it is difficult to push the pricing on the new side and clearly with all the information that is out there, it then becomes difficult to push the renewal. So, we have to get that stabilized. And then I will say a second piece is we’re still figuring out what opportunities may exist at the property specifically for capital improvements, given that the overall submarket is so strong. So there are some things that we may be able to do, but under our normal discipline, we are going to have to prove that we think they are profitable before we just pull the trigger and start building fancy pools and gyms and stuff. 
George Hoffman: And then, so on the acquisition development front, since the fundamentals in the Eastbay are so strong right now and you’re having that spill over from San Francisco. Would this be an area you guys be targeting for more acquisitions and then again the two developments in Pleasanton, but you envision going out any further than that sort of 680 corridor?
Michael Schall: This is Mike, and generally no. We generally don’t like being beyond the 680 corridor primarily because it brings you too close to over the hill in Tracy where you can buy a house for a couple of hundred thousand dollars. So, we like this transition from a renter to a homeowner to be a very difficult one and so part of our broad strategic objective is to be in places where for-sale housing is very expensive making the transition from a renter to homeowner a challenging one.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb for Sandler O'Neill, please proceed with your question.
Ryan Peterson: This is actually Ryan Peterson here for Alex. As your cost of equity has come down, has JV capital come down commensurately or have you seen kind of a gap between those two making maybe the cost of equity funding more attractive than JV funding?
Michael Schall: This is Mike S. In general we constantly monitor the two and we are trying to find the best accretion solution given all the arrows in the quiver with respect to capital without making greater risk in the balance sheet. So at this point in time with the movement in the stock and the rally in the debt markets, I think the preference will be to grow on balance sheet. There would be perhaps some limited exceptions on the development side because that is a little bit different in that we’re committing to a cap rate today and we funded over the next couple of years. So our batch funding ability is more limited there, but I would say we haven’t marketed many acquisitions to the institutional market recently given what I just said about, our on balance sheet cost of capital, but I suspect that their yield targets have not changed all that materially, maybe come down a little bit relative to a year ago. 
Ryan Peterson: And then just one other quick question. How much of the 2015 redevelopment spend is for the BRE portfolio versus the legacy Essex portfolio?
Michael Dance: This is Mike Dance. Roughly a third of it will be targeted for the BRE portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zielinski with RBC, please go ahead with your question.
Michael Zielinski: Can you just go back to the development, in terms the starts for ‘15, I think you mentioned 1.4 billion shadow pipeline. How much and what the size and scope of the starts plan in ‘15 and then just given the positive commentary about leasing in the fourth quarter, where is the expected stabilized yield in that pipeline stand currently? 
Michael Schall: First of all on your comment of shadow pipeline of 4 billion, I think that’s -- one pipeline which includes the 2.5 billion# that we got plus the 1.5 that is in the shadow that we haven’t started, just to clarify that. As far as yields overall in the mid 6 to 7 range is where we’re landing our stabilization at and about half the pipeline that currently is in will be stabilized during the first couple of quarters and then half of the balance by the end of the year and then going into ’16. And maybe just to add one specific item that I think you asked which is the 2015 starts are somewhere in that $800 million range projected of the $1.3 billion shadow pipeline. 
Michael Zielinski: Okay, that’s helpful and a second question, just for Erik, do you have loss lease stats in the portfolio currently and if you could break that out between what you are seeing for the Essex legacy portfolio as well as the BRE portfolio, just in light of the 5.6% [indiscernible] you guys have forecasted?
Michael Schall: Yes, at the end of the quarter it was 3% for Essex and a little less than that for BRE, 2.5 range.
Unidentified Company Representative: Just one quick comment. December 31 represent the low point of loss to lease within our portfolio given seasonality, so just keep that in mind. So I think if you went back to July, July is typically the high point and it was in the 6 to 7 range, and so just keep that in mind, that’s little bit -- needs to be put in to context which I was trying to do.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One securities, please go ahead with your question.
Tom Lesnick: Just curious, how are you guys thinking about schools like Orange Coast College in the growth prospects for apartments surrounding similar tier universities in California, is that something that you guys are opportunistically looking at to growing your footprint around?
Michael Schall: It’s Mike. No, not really, we do operate some properties that are around a variety of schools and there are some unique challenges with those properties, namely that students don’t treat the property very well and you need specialized systems and ways of dealing with them and I think that there’s some price sensitivity at some level certainly with respect to students that are surrounding some of the major universities in the urban areas that are now very expensive. So it is not an area that we strategically are expecting to pursue. And I think that the growth rates that we are seeing on the properties that we typically target are generally better than the growth rates we see on the student dominated properties.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors, please proceed with your question.
David Bragg: Michael Schall, you have long kept us updated on your thoughts on prop 13. What are your latest thoughts on the prospects of that making into the ballot next year?
Michael Schall: That is a great question and I have to admit that I have not seen anything nor pursued, any of these latest discussions. Once upon a time we had a lobbyist in Sacramento that was keeping us up-to-date so I don’t have anything new to report there Dave honestly. So I’ll look into it and start commenting on that again in the future.
David Bragg: And the second question is, while first thanks for the interesting long-term perspective on Phoenix, we understand the criteria that you look for in markets. One that you used to be in, that we are curious about your related thoughts on is Portland which has put up a pretty good track record over the long-term and lately what extent do you consider re-entering that market?
Michael Schall: I was in Portland recently and we discussed it among the senior group here. We in the past were more on the periphery of Portland and in Beaverton, Hillsboro etc. And we found that the impact of for-sale housing was just too great and our original thesis surrounding Portland was that it was protected by an urban growth boundary that would be respected by the politicians and when that failed when essentially they expanded the urban growth boundary, built several thousand more homes, it changed our supply demand balance materially and we exited Portland.  So our discussion recently is surrounded of more focused strategy on the downtown area in looking at rents and the opportunities there I think that we get the similar type of exposure in Seattle and so will probably not likely to move there at this point in time, but I knowledge that it has been certainly in the downtown, certainly urbanization is having an effect there and we think it is a high quality market and improving.
David Bragg: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Buck Horne: Good afternoon guys. I want to go back to the supply outlook for your macro projection in terms of new deliveries into the market and I am wondering a little bit longer-term if we -- if you guys extended the forecast in terms of what you know now into 2016, what do you think the delivery pipeline looks like for markets like San Jose in Seattle in particular and does a potential supply surge in those regions affect, how you think about deploying additional capital into either Seattle or Santa Clara County.
Michael Schall: The Axio data on Seattle had a big spike in permitting activity that concerns us but not to the extent that we would tell out of the wells also very robust demand in Seattle. In California, I think 2016 is going to be a continuation of the same forces that we have had before which is tech continues to do well tech and life science that drives the job growth at somewhere in the two and half plus or minus range and you have – we just don’t produce enough housing to take care of that demand and as a result of that I think we have another very good 2016 at this point in time. We also track as you know rent to median income levels and it’s interesting LA or all of Southern California continues to be below the long-term historical average for rent to median income. Seattle and San Jose are pretty much right at the long-term historical average and San Francisco and Oakland are a bit above , about 8% or above long-term historical average. So we don’t see an indication that affordability is an enormous issue here, but we recognize for example that the adults living with parents and that type of phenomena probably doesn’t unwind all that quickly given the how high rents are in these marketplaces. So we still feel very bullish about coastal California and I would say that Seattle is more of more uncertain about Seattle but still positive but we are more uncertain about Seattle.
Buck Horne: Okay. very helpful and lastly just on the equity issue and from the ATM, you guys seem to have stepped up and accelerated some activity in January. you think pretty much you are done with the ATM for the quarter or do you envision continuing to, may be accelerate use of the ATM later this quarter or into the first half of the year
Michael Schall: Yes, we did jump ahead of it a little bit and we do have a transaction pipeline and we’re trying to match fund that and we did get ahead of that a little bit and we understand that produces some dilution in Q1. We thought it was still the appropriate trade-off and so we expect again to given our debt rates and where the stock is trading to be pretty aggressive this year on the acquisition area. And we think cost to capital and ability to add NAV and cash flow per share is really great. So, we hope the transaction markets cooperate with us. Again we do have a pipeline now. And now I am going to tell you how large it is but we hope to add to that and so we are stepping a little bit ahead of the transaction closings with respect to the ATM and capital rates.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. In closing we appreciate and we thank you for your participation on the call. We are obviously very pleased with our results last year and look forward to another good year 2015#. We look forward to seeing many of you at City Conference in about a month. Thanks for joining us . Good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As usual, Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with comments on operations and finance, and John Eudy and John Burkart are also in attendance for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, comments on Q3 and market conditions; second, an update on the cyber attack; third, investment activity; and fourth, our preliminary market outlook for 2015. Before proceeding, for the Essex team members listening today, I would like to recognize your extraordinary contribution to the company's success. Your dedication and relentless efforts has allowed us to prosper despite the significant challenges we faced this year. Thank you. You are extraordinary. On to my first topic, Q3 results and market commentary. We were pleased to announce another exceptionally strong quarter, demonstrated by our reported Core FFO of $2.16 per share. That result was $0.08 ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range provided in connection with our second quarter call and the components of out performance are noted in the press release. In our coastal California Markets, our results reflect a persistent housing shortage, attributable to limited housing construction relative to the robust demand really related to job growth. While apartment construction has increased in response to strong demand, for-sale housing construction continues to significantly lag, a condition that we don't see changing until at least 2016. At this point, in past economic cycles, it is typical to see banks lower their lending standards for mortgages and construction loans, leading to more housing construction. We're pleased that credit standards remain high to the benefit of both apartments and for-sale housing. While for-sale housing prices have accelerated, so have apartment rents and valuations, and so the significant premiums in value for condos relative to apartments have not yet materialized. We see this as a win-win scenario in which we'll enjoy escalating apartment rents and values until a meaningful premium materializes in condo valuations that will allow us to monetize our condo conversion optionality within our portfolio. On to the second topic, an update on the cyber attack. For a variety of reasons, I won't go into depth regarding the cyber attack that we announced in September. However, I can say that our IT team identified suspicious activity in our network and that we immediately engaged a team of nationally-recognized experts to investigate the matter and assist with our response. Evidence exists that both the Essex and BRE systems experienced unauthorized access prior to the merger. At this point, incident containment has been achieved and our investigation into the cyber attack, remediation efforts and system enhancements are ongoing. Recent media reports have highlighted numerous cyber attacks on corporate America, creating a new cyber security landscape. This new environment is described in a recent comment by FBI Director, James Comey to the effect that there are 2 kinds of big companies in the United States. Those that have been hacked and those who don't know that they've been hacked. We believe that changes we have made position us appropriately for this new environment. Third topic, investments. Last quarter, we outlined an opportunity to grow externally, given lower debt cost and strong stock price. To date, we've completed $425 million in acquisitions and have another $180 million in contract with contingencies removed. We believe that cap rates remain relatively stable with the highest quality property and locations trading at a 4.0% to 4.25% cap rate, while B quality property in locations traded in the 4.5% to 4.75% cap rate range. Lesser quality properties traded higher cap rates, and periodically, a trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range. As suggested previously, our development strategy leaves us to be less aggressive as we progress through the economic cycle. As a result, we expect to start 3 apartment development projects in 2015, and we will ultimately reduce our annual development deliveries to between $300 million and $400 million per year. The primary reason for this is risk reward, that is, at this point in the cycle, there is a good chance that construction and capital cost can increase faster than NOI, making development less attractive. Please join me in congratulating John Eudy and his team for being recognized as the Residential Developer of the Year by the Silicon Valley Business Journal. Fourth topic is our market outlook for 2015. Page S-15 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply-demand and economic assumptions, supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2015. The forecasted 5.6% overall growth rate per S-15 is likely less than the 2015 same-property revenue growth expectations for the Essex portfolio due to our healthy loss to lease and other factors that will be discussed in early 2015 as part of our guidance. Thank you for joining us. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. We continued to be impressed with the focus of the operations team and are very appreciative of the results that have been delivered since the merger. We were able to build on a solid second quarter and deliver results beyond our initial expectations. While occupancy remained strong during the quarter, rent growth continued to accelerate above expectations. We also continued to make great progress with our goal to reduce turnover and increase occupancy within the BRE portfolio. Same-store occupancy and annualized turnover rates were nearly identical in the third quarter for the Essex and BRE portfolios. This represents a significant improvement in the BRE portfolio compared to the same period last year. Turnover is down 8% and occupancy has increased 200 basis points since that time. This performance is not possible without the dedication of the corporate teams that have pushed through integration challenges and fought off external distractions to deliver essential support services, allowing us to remain committed to our core business of creating communities people call home. Despite challenges, we have been able to reprioritize some of the system integrations and remain on track towards a single operating platform. Thank you, Essex. I am proud to be a part of your high-performance team. During the quarter, leasing activity accelerated faster than expected in almost every submarket. With respect to performance of the Essex portfolio, the strong results in July set us up for a great quarter. In fact, we achieved sequential scheduled rent growth of 2.8%. Strong revenue growth was fueled by increasing economic rent levels that were up nearly 9% year-over-year. These higher market rates helped push our renewal pricing to rate 7.4% higher than renewals achieved in the third quarter of last year. Looking forward, we expect renewal activity to continue to support strong revenue results as offered rates through December are in the 6% range. As of yesterday, physical occupancy in the Essex same-store portfolio was 96.5%, with a net-to-lease of 5.4.%. Now turning to the BRE portfolio. We've essentially eliminated the gap in financial occupancy that existed between the 2 portfolios. Earlier this week, the same-store portfolio for BRE was 96.5% occupied, with the net availability of just 4.5%. Sustaining a high occupancy profile in the fourth quarter should allow us to maintain parity between the 2 portfolios as we restart renovation activity within the BRE portfolio. For context, the Essex portfolio had an extra 20 to 30 basis points of vacancy due to renovation. Realizing these gains in occupancy and reducing turnover is a tradeoff to higher pricing, but really isn't any different than executing a new lease up. First you fill up the building in an accelerated pace, then you strategically stagger your lease expirations, stabilize your occupancy and then take advantage of the pricing power. Scheduled rent in the BRE portfolio improved by 1.9% over the second quarter. Renewals during the quarter were above 5% and are expected to be at similar levels for the fourth quarter. While we do expect BRE and Essex portfolios to achieve similar renewal rates next year, renewal pricing in the BRE portfolio will be lower than the Essex for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2015 as we work through higher expiration profile and complete the revenue management system integration. Now I'll share some thoughts and highlights of each region beginning with Seattle. Employment growth for the region remains very strong, and there are a few signs of slowing. Amazon now occupies 4 million square feet of space in the CBD, and is projected to double their footprint over the next 6 years. Such an expansion could result in over 20,000 new jobs at Amazon. Boeing continues to grow as well and beginning construction on their wing factory in Everett. This facility is expected to be completed by May 2016, and will bring 2,000 new jobs with it. We continue to monitor employment activity at Microsoft, as layoffs in the region now total approximately 2,700 jobs. But notably, there are roughly 1,400 open positions listed by Microsoft in the Seattle area. The status of contract workers is more difficult to track, but we have not experienced any unusual move-outs activity to date. Rent growth in Seattle was positive in all submarkets and, once again, was led by the East side, with year-over-year economic rent growth above 9%. The CBD, where we have less exposure, predictably posted the lowest growth in the region due to peaking deliveries. However, absorption appears to be keeping pace with supply, thanks in part to Amazon's continued growth. In Northern California, while spirits in the Bay Area have been buoyed by our San Francisco Giants Third World Series titles since the Great Recession, rent growth continues to be buoyed by job growth. Job growth continues to be at or better than expectations in the region, and notably, the information sector at San Jose was up more than 12%. That is seven consecutive months that the sector has achieved more than a 9% gain. The future remains promising as well, given the commercial leasing is keeping pace with new construction. Our San Francisco and San Jose markets have each absorbed 1.8 million square feet of office space year-to-date, with roughly 50% of the under construction space in downtown San Francisco already spoken for. In Silicon Valley, Google recently agreed to lease all 1.9 million square feet of the Moffet Place development in Sunnyvale. This is in addition to Google's purchase of a 900,000-square-foot office project in Redwood City. Economic rent levels continued to outperform in all submarkets with San Jose, San Francisco and Alameda leading the way with year-over-year growth north of 10%. These markets have had little trouble absorbing new supply thus far in 2014 despite relatively higher deliveries compared to prior years. Our Mosso and Radius projects averaged over 40 leases per month during the quarter. Therefore, we continue to believe that demand is comfortably outpacing supply. Now to Southern California. The region continues a path of steady recovery. September job gains were in line with our forecast, although Los Angeles came in a little lower than expected, while San Diego added more jobs than anticipated. We are encouraged that Los Angeles' unemployment rate has actually dropped below 8%, and there continue to be gains in the higher-paying professional and business services sector. We are optimistic that solid job growth in San Diego, coupled with our property's improving performance are signs of a sustained recovery in that market. The commercial activity remains positive with modest improvements in office leasing, and Los Angeles receives some good news with the passage of a bill that will more than triple annual state film and television tax credit. The economic incentive should have a meaningful impact on local production activity over the next 5 years. Economic rent growth improved during the quarter. And at the end of September, year-over-year economic rents were 6% higher in Southern California. The pace of leasing at our new developments is also encouraging sign for Los Angeles as Dylan and Wilshire La Brea averaged 38 and 47 units per month, respectively, during the quarter. With modest job growth and limited new supply, we should continue to get meaningful revenue contributions from Southern California. So while we must still successfully complete our systems integration, we believe that consistent strength of our markets will enable us to deliver impressive full year results for 2014, and we will enter 2015 with a lot of confidence, supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions. Thank you for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide comments on our third quarter results, the revisions to our merger and integration cost guidance and we'll close with an update on our balance sheet. As Eric and Mike mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter, in which Core FFO exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 per share or a 13% increase over the third quarter of 2013. The out performance in the quarter was primarily due to better-than-expected property operations and the strong development lease-up activity in both the Essex and legacy BRE portfolios, as the growth in new jobs minimize the impact of the new supply delivered in the quarter. The 6% sequential increase in Southern California's operating expenses was predominantly caused by utility expense increasing by $350,000 from seasonal water use and $225,000 increase in property taxes. In California, the new property tax year begins on July 1 and the sequential increase on property taxes of 4% was due to assessments in Southern California returning to their adjusted Proposition 13 valuations after benefiting from the temporary declines and valuations from the recession. These sequential increases in Q3's operating expenses were expected and included in the guidance provided on our second quarter call. As a result of the strong third quarter results, we have increased our same-property revenue growth by increasing the midpoint 30 basis points to 6.9%, and our same-property net operating income growth by 40 basis points to 8.5% at the midpoint. For the full year, we have revised down the merger and integration cost estimate by approximately $19 million at the midpoint. We expect to realize between $5 million to $8 million of savings in merger and integration cost and expect to incur the remaining integration cost in 2015. Yesterday after our earnings release, Essex received notice that our Wesco II preferred equity investment of $95 million was prepaid. The redemption fee recorded in the fourth quarter will increase our guidance for total funds from operations by $5 million. However, this prepayment penalty will be excluded from Core FFO. The loss of our preferred equity investment of yielding 10.1% and our asset management fee of 1% will largely be offset by the pipeline of new preferred equity investments and the fourth quarter real estate acquisition which Mike referred to earlier. I will now conclude with brief comments on our balance sheet. At the October -- at the end of October, we have approximately $750 million available on our unsecured line of credit. The legacy BRE Phoenix assets held for sale of approximately $108 million should close early in 2015. We have approximately $100 million of debt coming due in the next 12 months, and our share of the unfunded development commitment is approximately $300 million. Overall, Essex is in great position financially as we head into 2015. This ends my comments. And I will now return the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: [Audio Gap] conversion optionality in the portfolio. So I'm wondering if you can give kind of a percentage around where you see that in the -- both the Essex legacy and the BRE legacy portfolio.
Michael J. Schall: Nick, I missed the first part of that question, but I think you were asking about where we see the premium of condo versus apartment values. Is that right?
Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's part of it, and then kind of what percentage of your portfolio has that condo quality.
Michael J. Schall: Well, in California, I think the key issue is whether we have the entitlements to sell these condos. Most California cities are very protective of the rental stock. And as a result of that, they do not allow convergence of apartments into condos. The numbers that we had in our Investor Day about a year ago were somewhere in the 6,000 to 7,000 units of apartments that our condo convertible not all of immediately, but there's a process that we think that we can convert into condos and sell. In terms of the premium of condo values over apartment values, it varies very widely by market. And Southern California, for the most part, I'd say, at 0. And in Northern California, really specifically San Francisco, it's in the 10% to 15% range.
Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just in terms of operations. Are you running into your self-composed cap at any of the assets right now in terms of the rental rate growth?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. Rental rate growth, yes. We have a self-impose on renewals. We have a self-imposed 10% cap on our renewal rates. And again, it goes back to -- it's not in a vacuum that can sound like a limiting factor. The purpose of the cap is really twofold. It's, one, to give existing residents a little bit more favorable transaction relative to people coming in through the front door, and 2, to increase the renewal percentage so we turn fewer units. So there's -- we believe that there's a payback in how we manage that part of the equation. And, I guess, there's a third potential benefit, which is I think the local government entities would consider that a reasonable approach as it relates to the need for rent control type ordinances.
Operator: The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: So first question goes to BRE. And I'm trying not to do a multi-part to squash my second question. So let me just ask it this way. You guys have done a phenomenal job at bringing up the BRE portfolio to the Essex standard in 2 quarters. So you also spoke about the same point of maybe restarting the redevelopments. So just sort of curious, Mike D, not asking for 2015 guidance, but as far as more upside out of BRE, is it -- should we think about it more from integration, which it doesn't sound like it sounds like you guys have maxed at all or is it more from the external stuff like redevelopment? Where do you think that we'll see more of the upside of the BRE portfolio?
Michael T. Dance: I think it both looks good. I think there's still integration opportunities and the renovations, I think, will put up impressive returns.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. So is there -- but, I mean, if you guys are already 140, if you guys have already gotten it up to the Essex's occupancy and it sounds like the rents are similar or the rent increase are similar, where's the other operational stuff that we can look towards?
Michael J. Schall: Alex, it's Mike here. Let me take a shot at that, and Erik may want to chime in here at the end. I think that we've got the let's call it the low hanging fruit and that we have normalized the occupancy and taken some of the immediate steps that we can take. But in our experience, revenue management is a process. And it will take a couple of years to get all of that dialed in. And by that, I mean, for example, we amenity-price every single units. And so I think that we still need to work through the amenity pricing that was done on the BRE portfolio. There's a lot of, I think, opportunity there just because they didn't have enough time to fully implement LRO. And we've done it now a few times and those of you that go back far enough with us will remember that it wasn't always so perfect on our case either. So it takes time to fully dial that in. There's some opportunity and expiration management as well. We took on the expiration that we had in place on April 1. In general, BRE had shorter lease terms, somewhere around 10 months. And Essex was a little bit longer than that. And so we think there are some opportunity there. On the redevelopment side or the value add part of the portfolio, again, we approached it differently. And so we stopped the -- we have of the BRE -- on the BRE side, and are going to reimplement it. I think there are some unique opportunities here because their properties are somewhat newer than the Essex portfolio, and therefore, there's less of the basic infrastructure, we have plumbing and roofs and that type of thing and more things that the customers see, which are kitchens and baths and that type of improvements. So I think there's good opportunity in both areas. And we're excited about the opportunity. We think we'll be able to unlock some additional value there.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And the second is on the office conference calls for San Francisco, a lot of talk about the impact of Prop M on limiting new office development. Is there any inhibitor on your ability to develop in San Francisco that would impact multifamily? Or there basically are no restrictions on the ability to continue to build new product in San Francisco as long as it pencils?
Michael J. Schall: San Francisco is a difficult place to do business, and as you can imagine and there are always challenges on the entitlement side. So there's no Prop M equivalent to worry about, but there are other challenges to get deals approved, which always limits supply in general.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: So we've covered a lot as it relates to the BRE topline synergies, but can we talk about the expenses? It looks like you have a 69% operating margin on the Essex same-store portfolio. That's about 400 basis points better than the BRE legacy portfolio. We understand that maybe some of these can't be closed due to property taxes. What is that opportunity though?
Erik J. Alexander: Dave, it's Erik. Again, the focus has been on the revenue side. And we've tried to consolidate some of the expense activities. But there's definitely more opportunity there as we reorganize procurements, as we take advantage of some of these synergies where we have these now bigger clusters of properties. We've started some of the job sharing. But again, that won't be fully implemented until probably late next year as we utilize some scheduling tools and so forth. So I think we still have a fair amount of opportunity there.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Would you care to try to compare a same-store expense growth rate for the Essex legacy portfolio versus that of the BRE portfolio? How much difference would there be between the 2 going forward?
Michael J. Schall: David, it's Mike Schall. We're in the middle of the budgeting process, and that process ends this December when we present our business plan to the Board in early December. So I think you've caught us sort of mid-cycle on that. But as a general statement, I don't think there's -- other than the things Erik said, there is some things in the BRE portfolio that, over the longer term, I think falling to the merger synergy of things. If you have, as I mentioned on one of the other calls we've got 10 properties within a couple of miles of one another. So what are the synergies resulting from that? We have not -- we don't have a number for that. And I don't think that they fallen to the low hanging fruit category. They fallen to the reorganized and become more efficient. And I think it probably benefits both sides. I think the key difference here is that you have the proper team revaluation as you alluded to on the BRE portfolio, and it's a fairly large number on the Essex portfolio. So I wouldn't see, other than those comments that I made, a significant difference between the expense growth rate overall. And I think, again, our focus is going to be on the combined synergies lowering the overall growth rate of expenses of the combined portfolio. And we're not going to be all that sensitive to which side it comes from.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: And as it relates to the JV of the BRE assets, can you talk about how those operations at that pool the BRE properties is just fairing ?
Michael T. Dance: In terms of...
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Well, you took out, I think, some of the lower quality BRE assets were put into a joint venture. And the results that you're seeing at remaining BRE same-store properties are wonderful. But how -- as we think about the old BRE portfolio, it would be helpful to hear how the revenue growth is trending at the JV property, too.
Michael T. Dance: David, this a Mike Dance. They're doing very well. We had about 7% rent growth in that portfolio. So it did as well as the rest of the portfolio.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Great. And last question for Mike. You suggested that development activity on year end should slow going forward. Are your JV partners on the same page there? Is this potentially indicative of less new start activity in your markets? Or are your partners, just as example of other capital interest and West Coast development, do they retain an interest in doing more?
Michael J. Schall: I think, David, there's plenty of capital out there. I don't think that's the limiting factor. And if you look at our multifamily supply, '15 versus '14, it's up a couple of thousand units, 36,500 for '14, 38,350 for '15. So we expect about the same amount of supply overall within the areas that we operate. I think the limiting factor is a couple of things. In certain areas, I think you have pressure on labor cost. There is some other cost increases that are part of that, and they're putting pressure on cap rates. So getting cap rates to that, that clearing price of somewhere above a 5%, 5.25%, 5.5% type cap rates measure today, and stabilizes somewhere in to 6% to 6.25%. So it's hard to make those numbers work when you're fighting against increased cost. And I think of this -- the cities are somewhat less excited about a lot of development. I think that there's a factor there, I note San Francisco, there's some pressure to increase the low income component to up to 30%, whether or not that actually happens on all future deals, I don't know. But that will have a very significant impact on apartment construction in San Francisco. So our expectation is that the multifamily supply remains about the same, and we'll see what happens. But I think that's probably good for the next year or so. Everyone's asking us when we expect supplies to peak, and the answer is we don't exactly know. It seems like there's plenty of apartment supply in Seattle that's a concern. But in California, we think we're overall -- we remain limited supply level for the next couple of years.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just following up on your comments on development. Curious where do you see stabilized yields for the current projects? And what are you projecting for the forward starts next year?
Michael J. Schall: We're projecting 3 starts next year, 3, maybe 4 starts next year. All of them in the underwritten today, based on the rents today between 5 and 5.25, and that means a stabilizing somewhere around 6 to 6.25, something like that. Did that answer your question?
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes.
John D. Eudy: Just 1 clarification on the units being delivered this year and next year that are already under construction. They're in the 6 to 6.5 range on today's numbers going to a 7.
Michael J. Schall: Exactly, on the deliveries.
John D. Eudy: On the delivery.
Michael J. Schall: Maybe I misunderstood.
John D. Eudy: She asked both, I think.
Michael J. Schall: Did she -- okay. Well, I was answering starts, John was answering deliveries. So just to clarify.
Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Schall for closing comments.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator. In closing, we appreciate your participation on the call, and happy Halloween to all of you. We are obviously very pleased with the results last quarter and the outlook ahead. And we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT. Good day.
Operator: This conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you. I'd like to start by welcoming you to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are also in attendance for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, second quarter results; second, an update on the merger with BRE; and third, the status of key priorities. So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report an exceptional quarter driven by an undersupplied housing environment emanating from the robust economies on the West Coast. Our reported 7.2% same-property revenue growth matched Q3 2012 and Q1 2014 for the highest revenue growth rate achieved since the Great Recession. Southern California continued the expected steady-but-slow improvement in its revenue growth rate, which exceeded 5% quarter-over-quarter for the first time since the Great Recession. Northern California and Seattle continued to perform at the expected high level. Our market update on Page S-15 of the supplement reflects a nominal increase in total housing supply from last quarter, still representing about 0.7% of the total stock of rental and for-sale housing in our target market. It is notable that the for-sale housing construction remains at very muted levels, while apartment supplies continue to gradually increase. Our 2014 job forecast improved from last quarter, with an increase of 35,100 jobs in 2014, moving our job growth forecast to 2.6%. While all areas continue to perform well, Microsoft's recently announced layoffs and growing apartment supply in Seattle will cause us to be more cautious in the Puget Sound region. Overall, the forecasted 2.6% job growth, with total 2014 housing supply increasing by 0.7%, indicates a shortage of housing that is apparent in our results. Now on to the second topic, the merger update. It has now been 4 months since the closing of the BRE merger, and I can report that much has been accomplished, and that we still have plenty of heavy lifting ahead of us. To the E-team members listening today, please accept my sincere thanks and appreciation for your incredible efforts, dedication and skill as we become a stronger and more capable organization. I am pleased to report that the management transition at the properties has proceeded well, and included a recent realignment of portfolio assignments based on geography rather than premerger ownership. Major systems integration to one platform is underway, beginning with HRIS and other systems. The conversion of the property operations and accounting platforms is the most important part of the systems integration, and it has been the subject of extensive planning and coordination. While both BRE and Essex use Yardi for property management and accounting, a host of specialized subsystems support the Yardi platform. At this point, we expect Yardi and related subsystems to be merged on a phased basis, beginning in Q4. Considerable effort has been invested in our long-term strategic vision. We are truly a unique company, with clusters of properties located in or near the best apartment markets on the West Coast. In Downtown LA and North San Jose, for example, we have more than 14 properties within 5 miles of each other, requiring new approaches to service delivery, while providing opportunities for improvements in leasing, pricing, staff effectiveness, customer relations and marketing. This part of the integration planning will be a multiyear phased effort that we're excited to pursue. And finally, third topic, update on near-term priorities. Last quarter, I commented on the need to remain focused on our most important priorities. Following is a brief update on the short-term, mid-term priorities outlined last quarter. The first priority was to reduce the growth differential between the BRE and Essex portfolios, while taking advantage of the strength of the 2014 peak leasing season. In Q1 2014, Essex generated quarter-over-quarter revenue growth to 7.2% versus 5.6% for BRE, for a 1.6% differential. In the second quarter, that differential was reduced to about 0.5%, comprised mostly of 1.2% higher scheduled rent for Essex compared to BRE, offset by BRE's approximately 0.7% improvement in occupancy relative to Essex. BRE's higher turnover, shorter lease durations and lower financial occupancy make us believe that further improvements will be achieved in the coming quarters. The second priority was to vigorously pursue integration of systems and processes, which remains a key management focus. My previous comments have already addressed this topic. And finally, the third priority was to ramp up investment activity, given relatively stable apartment cap rates at a time of declining capital costs, with debt rates declining and Essex stock hitting all-time highs. To avoid resource problems, our senior executive team meets every Monday morning, discussing issues and opportunities, including how investment activity might impact other priorities, especially merger integration. We came to the conclusion that we have capacity for a few larger acquisitions, mostly focused on Northern California. So far this year, we have acquired $217 million in apartments. We currently have $385 million in non-contingent acquisitions in process, which we expect to close in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect to exceed our acquisition guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2014. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to Erik.
Erik J. Alexander: Okay, thank you, Mike. We're very pleased with our results this quarter, especially when coupled with the progress Essex has made in integration items. The focus on property fundamentals by operations in the corporate teams has been superb, and we applaud those efforts. The changes in management that Mike was talking about provided us with some important insights on integration items. Our regional leadership team has been able to share a fresh perspective on existing systems and processes from both companies. This has led to valuable recommendations on system strengths and challenges, and as a result, we have been able to accelerate some of those decisions. We've not changed our overall timeline for integration, but we have been able to better organize some of the components because of feedback provided by our internal customers. Most notably, we will be migrating to a single revenue management system ahead of schedule, which will allow us to better attack opportunities to lower turnover, increase occupancy and improve our daily pricing review. These changes will also allow us to enhance our customer experience and improve satisfaction and retention. So as expected, leasing activity continued to accelerate throughout the second quarter for the entire portfolio. With respect to performance of the Essex portfolio, strong occupancy positions reported in May allowed for solid scheduled rent growth beyond our initial expectations for the second quarter. In fact, the sequential growth in scheduled rent for the second quarter was 2.1%, which is the largest second quarter gain since before the Great Recession. July's scheduled rent gains were also impressive and should set us up for a solid third quarter. Strong markets certainly fueled our revenue growth, as economic rent levels in the Essex portfolio were up 8.3% year-over-year. Higher market rents helped push our renewal pricing, which contributed to our stronger-than-expected revenue growth, as residents renewed their leases at a rate 6.3% higher than their old rate. Looking forward, we expect renewal activity to continue to support strong revenue results, as offered rates for August and September are in the mid-6% range. As of yesterday, physical occupancy in the Essex same-store portfolio was 96%, with a net-to-lease of 6.3%. We expect to lower our net availability to 6% by the end of the third quarter, and sustain occupancy above 96%. Turning now to the BRE portfolio. The real story has been the rapid gain that we made in occupancy during the quarter, having increased physical occupancy by nearly 100 basis points by the end of May, and holding that level through June. This translates to a 76 basis point gain in financial occupancy compared to the first quarter of this year, and a 92% improvement -- 92 basis point gain over the second quarter of last year. I'm confident that we are in the right path, as the BRE portfolio was occupied at 96.1%, with a net availability of just 5.5% earlier this week. However, given BRE's higher turnover during the second and third quarter, we expect it will take a couple more quarters to truly close the gap in financial occupancy with the Essex portfolio, and a full year to bring turnover rates more in line with our expectations. We also have evidence that we are making meaningful strides in this area, as the annualized turnover for the second quarter was slightly lower than the turnover ratio recorded last year. This, despite facing 7% more expirations. Furthermore, through a modified renewal strategy, we have been able to extend the lease terms residents are willing to accept to 11.5 months in June and July. This is about 5 weeks longer than historical average over the past 18 months, and should represent a structural change in the expiration profile and turnover results next year. Reducing turnover is an important part of our goal for achieving parity in occupancy with the Essex portfolio, and gaining pricing power to drive better revenue results. So now a quick rundown of the new development lease-up activity, which continues to demonstrate strength of demand in both Northern and Southern California. Epic continued to lease apartments at a rapid pace during the second quarter, and stabilized in June, nearly 2 months ahead of plan. We accelerated leasing activity at Solstice, occupied an average of 38 apartments per month during the period, and stabilized the property. Radius opened at the beginning of June with very limited pre-leasing activity, and has already achieved an absorption rate greater than 40 leases per month. Mosso, which many of you have seen, is leasing very well, despite its under-construction condition, and has inked 111 leases to date. This result is a testament to the strength of the San Francisco market, and things should only improve for us as we begin to deliver a very nice complement of amenities. In Southern California, Avery stabilized according to plan, and is nearly 100% leased, while Wilshire La Brea continues to lease at a rate of 35 to 40 apartments per month. And the collaboration with a half a dozen of our nearby communities, including Huxley and Dylan, has proven to be beneficial. Huxley is now stabilized. And Dylan will officially open next week, and we expect this property to lease as well, if not better, than Huxley given its preferred location. I'll provide leasing results next quarter, along with comments about Park 20 and Emming [ph]. Now for some highlights of each region, starting with Seattle. June unemployment growth at 3% and unemployment below 5%, Seattle continues to perform well above the national average. Amazon continues to grow, by adding over 700,000 square feet of office space in the CBD. Boeing Commercial Airplanes captured $17 billion of net orders during the quarter, and the backlog has now reached a new record high of $377 billion. This represents 5,200 aircraft, and equates to approximately 7 years of production. Rent growth in Seattle is again led by the east side, with year-over-year rent growth above 9%. Seattle CBD, at 5%, is underperforming the rest of Seattle, as supply continues to impact our properties operating in this market, particularly the A product. Given the concentration of expected deliveries in CBD this year, and a similar number next year, we don't expect to see additional rent growth in this submarket in the near term. However, please keep in mind that the CBD market comprises less than 20% of our total same-store portfolio in Seattle, and less than 4% of the total Essex same-store portfolio. Now looking at Northern California. Job growth in Northern California was 3.2% for June, with San Jose leading the way at 3.4%. Google recently announced an addition of 300 -- sorry, 336,000-square-foot office in San Francisco. And the Silicon Valley has a year-to-date absorption of 1.3 million square feet of commercial space, with another 3.5 million under construction. Levi's Stadium, home of our San Francisco 49ers, opened this past weekend, and development around the stadium is currently planned for up to 8 million square feet of commercial, retail, hospitality and housing. And in the East Bay, Amazon announced plans for a 574,000-square-foot distribution center. So all of this activity continues to fuel the jobs in the greater Bay Area. Economic rent levels continue to outperform in all submarkets, with San Jose, San Francisco and Alameda leading the way, with year-over-year growth north of 10%. These markets have had little trouble absorbing new supply thus far in 2014, despite relatively higher deliveries in San Francisco and San Jose than we've seen in prior years. We continue to believe that the demand is comfortably outpacing the supply. Now finally, in Southern California. Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego all posted year-over-year job growth in June above 2%, and LA's jobless rate has dropped to 8.1%, compared to 8.7% in March. Orange County's employment growth was tempered somewhat by layoff announcements from Allergan and Broadcom, while job additions in Los Angeles are coming from education and health, professional business service sectors, with the information sector growing 6%, which is the highest growth post recession. Commercial activity improved during the quarter, as Orange County absorbed 1.1 million square feet of office, and another 500,000 square feet of office projects are under construction within just a few miles of our Hollywood and Mid Wilshire assets. We saw rent growth accelerate in all of our Southern California properties, beginning in April and continuing through July. As of the end of July, year-over-year economic rents were at least 6% higher in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and Ventura counties. Modest deliveries and steadily improving jobs picture should help to continue respectable economic rent growth in the broader region. So beyond the strong markets and healthy outlooks across the entire portfolio, I'm encouraged even more now that I have seen the new Essex team work together to achieve excellent results during a demanding and anxious transition period. I'm eager to work through the balance of the integration in order to realize true team unity and put Essex in a position to deliver top-tier results again next year. Thank you for your time and support. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide commentary on our second quarter results, the revisions to our guidance to core funds from operations, review changes to the income statement presentation in the supplement and will close with a few remarks on the balance sheet. The second quarter exceeded by $0.08 the midpoint of our guidance range for Core FFO per share. This outperformance was predominantly from better-than-forecasted property operations, as we saw strong net operating income growth in all 3 regions and have revised the midpoint of same-property NOI growth to approximately 8%. Our revised full year forecast for revenue growth of 6.6% at the midpoint does not represent decelerating rent growth. It simply reflects the seasonality of our business, with the highest rent growth occurring during the months beginning in March through July. Please recall that, in 2014, we also have a very difficult second half comparison to the second half of 2013. In the second half of 2013, we achieved greater than 6.5% rent growth compared to the second half of '12. For the second half of '14, the year-over-year rent growth for the same-property BRE legacy portfolio is expected to be slightly better than the year-over-year same-property rent -- revenue growth in Essex portfolio, as a result of the forecasted gains in occupancy at the legacy BRE communities. We expect to achieve similar financial occupancy in the 2 portfolios by the end of the year. The midpoint of our same-property operating expenses increase remains unchanged at 3.5% for 2014. On our last conference call, we actually forecasted second quarter same-property expenses to increase by 5%, compared to the actual results of 3.1%. This $0.02 per share savings in expenses was due to timing, and we are now forecasting these expenses to occur in the second half of the year. Moving on to our guidance change. We have increased the full year Core FFO per diluted share by $0.09, to a midpoint of $8.39 per share, resulting in Core FFO growth of nearly 11% for the full year. The guidance change was limited to $0.09, as our original estimate -- as our original guidance, first, we already assumed robust revenue expectations for the second half of the year; second, our expectations for the timing of operating expenses previously noted; and lastly, general and administrative costs should increase over the Q2 run rate based on anticipated increases to headcount, and incentive compensation tied to achieving the forecasted results. Now I want to review the changes to accounting that impacted the financial information included in our supplemental presentation this quarter. First, we reduced general and administrative costs by approximately $1.4 million for the development and redevelopment fees paid to Essex from our co-investment partners. In Q1, we had approximately $1 million in development and redevelopment fees, which were accounted for as revenues in Q1. But in Q2, we have reclassified the prior quarter's expense -- or revenues as an offset to general and administrative expenses, to be consistent with this quarter's presentation. This accounting change has no impact on FFO, and will reduce the fluctuation in management fee income and G&A expenses that occurs solely based on whether the development communities are owned on balance sheet or partially owned with partners. By accounting for these fees as an offset to G&A, our overhead costs will be more comparable between quarters. This accounting treatment depicts the economic reality that these fees are principally reimbursement for the costs of providing these services to our partners. The second change is that we have temporarily discontinued the allocation of the costs of G&A activities related to property and asset management fees as a separate expense line item on the income statement. Again, this accounting change has no impact on FFO results, and the allocations will be revisited after we merge the Essex and BRE accounting systems in the fourth quarter. The third accounting change was noted in our press release, and relates to the accrual of the utility reimbursements from residents. This receivable was becoming material, and is considered a preferred accounting method than the accounting for the revenues on a cash basis. This change resulted in a onetime increase to revenue and FFO of $1.8 million, which has been excluded from the same-property revenue, and excluded from Core FFO. The last change was mentioned on our Q1 Conference Call, and was contemplated in our revised guidance provided in Q1. Essex has adopted the BRE's accounting, which follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the amortization of leased concessions over the initial lease term. This accounting only applies at Essex when it is offered to new residents at a development community. This change increased FFO by $0.01 in the second quarter, and reduced the dilution from the development pipeline. The accounting change will also better reflect the effective rent growth from these communities when the assets enter the same property portfolio. I will now wrap up with a few comments on the balance sheet. As a result of the merger, five of the six debt metrics presented in our supplement on S-6 have improved over the same metrics prior to the merger. As we successfully lease up the development communities and grow the net operating income in the same-property portfolio, we are on plan to reduce the total debt-to-annualized EBITDA to below 7x before the end of March 2015. Year-to-date, we have issued $366 million on equity to match-fund our external growth opportunities. And we are committed to a strong balance sheet, as demonstrated by reducing our line balance in April by issuing $400 million of unsecured bonds with a 10-year maturity. This ends my comments. And I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Turning first to BRE, a couple questions. Should we assume that the second half BRE same-store numbers and growth looks similar to what you achieved in the first half of the year, since you mentioned you still had some of the occupancy benefit coming?
Michael T. Dance: Yes, this is Mike Dance. Yes, we're looking at about 6.6% revenue growth year-over-year for the second half of '14 compared to '13, primarily, as you mentioned, due to the occupancy gains that we can achieve in that portfolio that we've already achieved in the Essex portfolio.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then if I turn to Page S-7 in the supplemental. You give the legacy BRE property revenue, NOI, et cetera. If I do the math, it looks like the margin on the BRE portfolio is like 64.5%, and your same-store margin 69%. How should we think about that gap? And how much do you think you could close there?
Michael T. Dance: That's predominantly Proposition 13 write-ups in their portfolio. So those were basically estimating Prop. 13 at this time, based on advice we're getting from consultants, but that's to be determined. We think we're doing a good job estimating those, but more to tell as we get supplemental tax bills from the county assessors.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, on the development pipeline, can you remind us where you think expected yields are on the pipeline underway today; and then separately, what was just completed in the second quarter? And I was also hoping to get an updated thoughts on Wilshire La Brea, that's a bigger asset, how you think about the stabilized yield there and what the NOI contribution might be for 2014 since you saw some lease-up.
Michael T. Dance: Yes, this is Mike Dance. Let me just comment briefly on the BRE portfolio, and then I'll hand it back to John or Mike on the Essex portfolio. On the BRE portfolio, as part of business combination accounting, we're required to assign fair values to all of the assets. And then we looked at the state of completion there relative to cost to complete. The assets that are delivering in 2014, we pretty much brought in at a low 4 cap rate. So those will be stabilized in the low 4 rate, plus the rent growth we're achieving in those markets. I'll let John or Mike now talk about the Essex portfolio.
John D. Eudy: This is John Eudy. On the existing portfolio on the Essex side, the cap rates we have estimated on our stabilization is in the mid- to high-6 range. And the ones that we've turned over to operations fully this quarter were actually slightly on the high side of that range.
Michael J. Schall: Nice work, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: When do you expect the same-store revenue growth gap between the legacy Essex and legacy BRE portfolios to only reflect the different submarket allocation, not redevelopment contribution, the occupancy gains you talked about and other income differentials?
Michael J. Schall: Nick, this is Mike Schall. I'm not sure there's a real easy answer to that, because we approached each part of the businesses separately. I think we've reported on -- in prior calls that we have discontinued the -- a lot of the redevelopment activity on the BRE side, pending transferring it over to the Essex way of looking at things. And just to give you an idea of what differences there are. We take an asset-by-asset approach on redevelopment. We look at each asset separately within its market, try to determine what things we get paid for and what things we just want to turn. We don't use a cookie-cutter approach. We use a customized asset plan for each one. And so we expect to start layering in redevelopment activity back into the BRE portfolio sometime in the third quarter. And actually, there's one large asset in Emeryville that there was some significant damage that was subject to an insurance claim, where BRE got $20 million back. So we're going to do an extensive rebuild, or a reconstruction on that, and pull it out of the same property pool, for example. But I guess, to answer the question, it'll probably take a year before there's a full redevelopment plan on the BRE side. It'll start right away, but it will be building up over the next year. Does that answer your question?
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That does. And then just going to the acquisitions you mentioned, primarily in Northern California. Is that a result of more assets on the market there, or a strategic decision to grow that market, or a shorter-term opportunity you see?
Michael J. Schall: It's really all of the above. I mean we try to find the best markets, obviously. We try to measure growth rates, cap rates; try to look for the best opportunities within our portfolio. I'd say, as a general rule, the lowest-risk and highest-return opportunity is still in redevelopment. However, moving large dollars in redevelopment is difficult, because of what I just said, which is a specific asset-by-asset planning process, and it is difficult to deploy redevelopment dollars in a high-quality manner without trying to have just basically a systematic reduce of many things. So we're going to continue to be focused on redevelopment. We think that, that is our highest total return, but we're not going to be able to move huge amounts of money in that area. Within the development side, we want to continue to be a developer, an active developer. We got up as about as high as 10% of enterprise value in our development pipeline at the bottom of the cycle. And we think, at this point in the cycle, we're unable to exactly figure out what's going to go grow faster: NOIs or construction costs. And therefore, we're going to be more conservative at this point in the cycle, and we may reduce our development exposure to somewhere around 5% of enterprise value, just to give you some idea. And so we'll find opportunities within that spectrum. And we continue to see some pretty interesting development deals that we're working on. And then so finally, on the acquisition side, we still think Northern California. And we're comparing a lot of deals back and forth. We have passed on some deals in Southern California. We have gravitated to, rather than, let's say, the super A market within Northern California, finding opportunities that might be in a B+ city near a transit-oriented site, a transit-oriented district, where someone can get on, for example, BART or light rail and commute into town, because we believe that given how expensive it's getting in some of the core areas, that there's a logical transition to still good locations that have good transit options as being the best total return in the acquisition area. Does that make sense?
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It does. And then, I guess, just between kind of those A locations and the B+ locations, what kind of growth differential are you underwriting?
Michael J. Schall: Well, again, this is the important distinction. I mean, typically, as you come out of a recession, the A areas are going to grow the fastest, and the B areas are going to essentially get the benefit of the second wave. And so we think we're in that second part of things. We're actually -- if you look at our own results, you'll see Alameda County, for example, which is mainly the B assets growing actually better than some of the A areas. So we're starting to see the transition from really expensive areas, people being forced to move out of the really expensive areas, and that is benefiting, again, the still good areas, but not Downtown San Francisco, for example.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just quickly, just some questions here. The turnover difference between BRE and Essex, if you could just comment a little bit more on this. Was this more of the way like the way that the BRE tenants were managed from corporate? Or was there a more active approach to try and, I don't know, I guess, not retain people? If you could just give some color. And just because that seems rather glaring. And then also maybe a little bit on what the duration difference was. If you guys are going for 11.5 -- I think you said you're going for 11.5, or maybe it's now 11.5, but if you could just give some color on the difference of the duration strategy.
Erik J. Alexander: Yes. Alex, it's Erik. I think one of the biggest drivers was not so much the focus. I think BRE, like everybody, wants to retain people as much as they can. I think the strategy of how -- what you offer the residents, in terms of their length of stay. And so what we saw is Essex is in the 11.5 average term range on the renewals. And for the past 18 months, the BRE portfolio had seen closer to 10 month renewals. And that was really based on the offers. The offers favored a 10-month renewal, where typically, the renewals in the Essex portfolio favored a 12- or a 13-month lease, from a pricing perspective. So what we saw in June and July was a result of changing that, trying to push the longer-term lease, with an eye on managing our lease expirations so we set ourselves up good for next year, and just get in a better position for pricing.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. So there wasn't like an active part on BRE to get people to move out. It was more just how they did their duration of the lease renewal.
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I don't believe there was an active plan to try to move them out.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then on the operations side, if we just use EQR-Archstone as a sort of a template, it seems like there are 2 stages to getting synergies. There's, one, the initial, which you guys have outlined and sounds like may take a year. And then there's the next stages, which is as you operate the portfolio, the properties in close proximity, there are efficiencies that you get above and beyond. So can you just give us a sense for sort of, if you take a sort of on a 1-to-10 scale and say 10 is full integration, everything going, how much do you think you will integrate over the next year for efficiency improvement; and then how much -- and then by default, what you think is then left over the longer term?
Michael J. Schall: Alex, it's Mike Schall. That's an interesting question. I would say that this first year is going to be picking the low-hanging fruit oriented, which means lowering the turnover ratio, focusing on occupancy, building pricing power, training the people so we all think alike and approach the business the same way, implement all the systems and the integration so that we are one company. Interesting note during the quarter was it took us a couple months to reconcile the definition of financial occupancy, because they were different between the 2 companies, for example. And so there's a tremendous amount of detail, and we're trying to work through that. I think that's going to take a good year. We are, at the same time, accumulating lists. And Mr. Burkart has a lot of this, and he may want to comment, creating lists of opportunities that we see that we want to pursue at some point in time down the road, when we get back to the scenario I referred to in my comments, the sort of a re-visioning of how we provide the service. And again, given the proximity of properties in certain clusters, notably in my call, North San Jose and Downtown LA, we know that, in certain cases, for example, price optimizers compete with, from property to property, without considering that the same owner may own both, for example. And situations like that have got to be resolved. I think we get to none of that during this first year. We may want leasing offices that are open till 9:00 at night within the main clusters, for example. We may want more specialized maintenance, so that you have sort of a cluster maintenance group, some which are highly skilled in plumbing and other -- a variety of other tasks. Essentially, all that stuff is out there. That is the broader how we are going to provide the service in the future, we will not get to in this first year. And we are, as a general statement, really busy trying to keep our eyes focused on the things ahead of us. We all recognize that these are not annuities. They are businesses. The world changes quickly, as we saw in our mea culpa moment in Q3 2011, which lives in infamy around here. And we remain vigilant in trying to make sure that we react appropriately to changing conditions, that the communication up and down the organization is appropriate, that we're monitoring things appropriately with reports, and that we are prepared to react if conditions change.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was wondering if you could provide an update on condo conversion activity in your markets this summer?
John F. Burkart: Sure. This is John Burkart. As it relates to -- let me talk about condos in general. So clearly, when we look at the markets, in all of the markets, the condo pricing is moving, as it is in most of for-sale housing. The hottest market, no doubt, is San Francisco. San Francisco Bosa is actually building a couple of towers, one in San Francisco and a couple in Seattle. And to put it in some context, the San Francisco tower of 267 units, about 200 of them have sold out in a very short period of time. Compare that to, say, Seattle, where they're selling about 15 a month for a 700-unit tower. So all of the markets it's moving forward. San Francisco is at its closest point. However, we're still not at the point where it's, you might say, frothy, at the point where we would say it makes sense to convert because, at the same time as we have the condo price moving, we also have rents and apartment values moving. And so again, it's not a just condo price issue. It's a, where is the arbitrage opportunity where we can find the chance that someone will pay perhaps a half to a cap more for our apartments and valued as a condo? So we're not quite there yet. We're monitoring it very closely. We're engaged in numerous conversations. And we'll react, as Mike says, to the market when it -- as it gets there. But it's definitely moving forward.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And Erik, I'm sorry if I missed this in your comments. Could you provide move-outs to homeownership this quarter and maybe an update on rent-to-income?
Erik J. Alexander: No I haven't provided that. It hasn't materially changed since the last quarter. It stands around 11% for the portfolio overall, highest in the Pacific Northwest, and lowest in Southern California.
Michael J. Schall: And then, this is Mike. Let's see, rent-to-median incomes, not a whole lot of change there. We track the current rent-to-median income against the long term average from 1990 to 2013, and those relationships look pretty healthy. I'll go through a couple of them for the sake of discussion. In Seattle, for example, rent-to-median income, because incomes are doing very well in Seattle, 16.9% versus the long-term average 1990 to 2013 of 17.4%. So that looks good. San Francisco, currently at 25.1% against a long-term average of 24.4%. San Jose, 20.8% versus 20.3% long-term average. Let me do one more, LA, 20.4% currently against 22.4% long-term average. Again, I think the thing that is different about the West Coast is we are adding so many jobs that are professional in nature, that have high income levels. And it has the effect of pushing income levels up, and therefore, the affordabilities are not becoming stretched.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I just have 2 simple questions, and I might have missed this, but the portfolio metrics were a little odd in that turnover declined, occupancy was relatively stable but concessions rose, which I was a little surprised. I would think that, that number would follow turnover. Can you just provide a little bit of detail on that dynamic?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I might not be clear on the concession part, the -- If you're referring to the...
Michael J. Schall: It rose nominally, yes. I mean they didn't rise a lot. And I think most of it was one asset that is competing against a new community -- or actually, several new communities. I think it was the 5600 Wilshire asset. So I think that accounts for almost all of the concession number. Right, Erik?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, that was the big concession number. [indiscernible] asset specific.
Michael J. Schall: And then I'd also comment that, again, the turnover number where BRE's was in the, what, 63% range. I mean that's a function of a high-turnover, high-lease-expiration period during -- intentionally, during the peak leasing season. And it takes time for us to bring that number down. It will -- we have to be there for a full cycle of implementing our view of how you do renewals; and a little bit longer lease terms, as Erik mentioned; and a variety of things. So again, some of these things just take time to implement.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. I was just curious on the mechanics. My other question, and this is maybe for Mike Dance. I would have thought we'd see greater levels of dispositions, given asset pricing. How are you guys thinking about asset sales relative to other costs of capital in terms of sort of a funding source? And why aren't you -- sort of why aren't you maybe disposing more at this point in the cycle?
Michael J. Schall: David, it's Mike Schall. It's a topic that we are talking about a lot these days, but I would suggest to you that we have done the calculations, and we have concluded that using a combination of stock and debt on a -- essentially balance sheet -- near balance sheet neutral type of basis, is better than using recycled asset proceeds. And there's a couple of caveats to that. One is that we, all things being equal, don't want to operate in Phoenix, and so there is a pretty good likelihood that we will sell out of that market. And the other caveat is keep in mind that, because of Prop. 13, the buyer and seller essentially have different cap rates, because the buyer is going to have a reassessment, and therefore, his NOI is going to be lower than it is on our books. And therefore, that acts as an impediment, in effect, to sell. Not -- and again, not that we won't sell, we're just going to be careful about time. But in our view right now, with debt costs rallying 50 basis points or so, and the stock hitting all-time highs, we are better off issuing stock to fund new acquisitions than using dispo proceeds.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: So just a couple of questions on BRE. What is the difference between their second and third quarter lease expiration schedule now versus yours?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, so the -- this is Erik. So this, the third quarter has a higher turnover expiration than Essex. So we were -- they were 63% in the second quarter, and we were in the low 50s. The last couple of years, that profile was 70% for BRE and kind of mid 50s for Essex. And so we're seeing basically the same thing. And we're doing -- like you said, we're offering the longer-term leases, and we're doing some advanced renewals to try to bring that all under control. And I think that the physical occupancies so far are evidence that it's working. The fourth quarter is more similar to ours, and we don't expect a big issue there.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: That's actually good information, but not quite the question I was asking. When it comes to, like, the percentage of your leases expiring in the second and third quarter, I'm sure it's more than 50% of the total, right? You try to target that. What is that number for Essex, not turnover, but just the raw expiration? And what is that number for BRE?
Erik J. Alexander: I'm sorry, Rich. I'll have to get back to you with the specific number for both those portfolios.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. Mike Schall or whomever, when you think about the combination of BRE, they bring more Southern California to the mix at the margin than you had originally. Do you think that, that's a particular opportunity given that Southern California hasn't started that ramp-up yet? Or is that kind of just splitting hairs?
Michael J. Schall: That's another good question. In a normal world, I would think that we would expect Southern California to have that ramp-up, but I think this is a very unique recovery period. This recovery period is really being dominated by tech, life sciences and energy. And that, we think, is going to continue to favor the North, Seattle and Northern California, and whereas Southern California is more of a diversified economy, and we think it will still do well, but unless the recovery broadens out or, let's say, until the recovery broadens out, we think that we have a distinct advantage in Northern California and Seattle. Obviously, we don't know, and we're trying to make decisions that are going to benefit the company over the long haul. I still think Southern California is a very, very strong market, very limited supply. We still think good things are going to happen in Southern California. And actually, I'd also mention, because of the tech and life science influence in Northern California, it can be -- and Seattle, it can be a little more volatile than Southern California overall. So I think having a balanced portfolio, as we have -- and as you know, we -- of the 4,175 units that were used to form the joint venture, they were predominantly Southern California focused, so that we maintain more of the Northern California, Seattle flavor to the overall portfolio. And we think that, that's about the right balance at this point in time. Again, could change in the future depending upon what happens in the broader economy.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the topic of synergies, last quarter, you had operating G&A synergies ranging from $24 million to $27 million for a full year run rate. You beat on the BRE side, in the second quarter, you mentioned $0.02 better than expected. How come you didn't adjust the synergy target? Or did you and you're just kind of waiting for somebody to ask?
Michael T. Dance: Rich, it's Mike Dance. There are a number of vacant positions in G&A that we're going to be filling here in the second half of the year. So I believe it was some of the turnover that wasn't expected. We're going to be filling those positions. So that, and I think I mentioned in my remarks that we're having a great year, and we're hoping that we get rewarded for that in compensation levels. So that is going to also be adding to the second half of the year's G&A.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: All right.. So the operating is outperforming. G&A might be a little bit higher, and the net is no change at this point.
Michael T. Dance: That's right.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the last question, Mike, for you then. Did you give any consideration to the accounting change, in particular the amortization of concessions over the life of the lease, and moving in that direction? Did you have -- did you give any consideration to taking it all upfront? And just curious what your thought process for -- was for not doing it that way.
Michael T. Dance: We are doing lease concessions on GAAP for the development communities. That's where it's material, where it -- again, it's a lot of work. We're not doing it for the same-property portfolio. We make -- we decided to make that change when we looked at all the BRE assets that are being delivered in 2014. So we are -- we did change our policy to recognize concessions upfront, and amortize that over the life -- the initial term of the lease. And that did benefit Q2 by about $700,000 in FFO. So that was all contemplated in Q1's guidance. So I think -- did that answer your question?
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Yes, that's fine. All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Erik, I guess I wanted to get some color from you on the Essex same-store revenue growth in Southern California, well above your peers'. So I'm just curious how much of that, would you say, is location, price-point driven versus upside in the BRE portfolio.
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I think it's some of all of that. We had good results in Ventura County, where we moved occupancy in the first quarter. So we got some price gains there. Los Angeles, I think, fundamentally, has been better. I think evidenced by some of the lease-up activity that I mentioned. So that's carrying over into our stabilized assets where we're seeing some better pricing. And then we have made occupancy gains, I think, particularly not just in the BRE portfolio, but also in Essex San Diego. So all of those things have contributed.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And one or two more for you while you're there. Overall turnover in your portfolio was relatively unchanged year-over-year, but we did see almost a 10-percentage-point year-over-year decline in Seattle. Is that you guys being more cautious today given the ramping supply you referenced earlier in the call in the Seattle metro area? And then given the near-term outlook for Seattle you provided also earlier, can we perhaps see SoCal revenue growth exceed Seattle's by perhaps next year this time?
Erik J. Alexander: So the first part, the turnover was a little higher in Seattle last year due to some renovation activities that are not the same this year. And then we also see a higher conversion this year on renewal offers in Seattle. Part of that related to our renewal strategy and some of the self-limiting increases that we've set. And then with respect to Southern California beating Seattle next year, did you say?
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Well, maybe. You tell me. You tell me.
Erik J. Alexander: I don't know. I'm -- what I'm hoping for is it ties the same level that Seattle is this year. We're both enjoying that kind of growth. But I do think that you're seeing maybe a little more consistency in the growth in Southern California. Very anxious to see how the third quarter turns out, and hope that this is less bumpy and more sustainable, and that it moves towards those levels.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And last one now, speaking of renewals. Maybe I missed it, but could you give us the new and renewals perhaps by region, if you could, for 2Q; and then also the early reads, well, July actuals and early August, what you're asking for?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, the early -- sorry, the August and the September is 6.5 for the Essex portfolio, and 5.7 for the BRE portfolio. And I think I'd commented in the -- in my comments about the second quarter being 6.3% overall for Essex. That number for BRE was 5%. And again, that's probably a little bit lower than it would have been, but again, we're pushing a renewal strategy to extend leases, to reduce turnover, to bring that occupancy up, and get into a better position later.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Did you -- or could you perhaps give those by region, the renewal and new for the -- during the quarter?
Erik J. Alexander: I don't have it right in front of me, Haendel.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies.
George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess, one thing: I'm looking at your preferred equity investments. Is there the chance that any of those might turn into acquisition opportunities over the next 12 months?
Michael J. Schall: George, it's Mike Schall here. I don't know what the opportunity to do that. We -- it's obviously on our mind and part of the reason that we are in that business, not just for the return, but to be part of a discussion at the term of the preferred equity investments. But at this point in time, there are no discussions ongoing about taking any of them out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Erik, you gave a whole bunch of leasing statistics just at quarter end, where is the loss-to-lease there? I mean I didn't talk about moderation, but are you seeing that gap actually widen as you're capturing a lot this trend?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, we are. It's getting pretty big. I mean July has been a good month. And for Essex, it's around 8%, and for BRE, it's just shy of 6%. And it's a double-digit number in the Bay Area. So yes, it's growing.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Impressive. Second question. I believe you talked a little bit about redevelopment, but now that you've got the portfolio for 4 months, you know the properties a little bit better, you got a handle on the lease-up, what's kind of the scope or scale you see of redevelopment opportunities across the BRE portfolio? Is it greater than that of the Essex portfolio?
John F. Burkart: Mike, this is John speaking. It's actually pretty similar to the Essex portfolio overall. However, the BRE assets are a little bit newer. So Essex, we tend to have a little bit more infrastructure, plus the outside finishes. And for BRE, it's a little bit more of the outside finishes, but the opportunity is pretty significant. As Mike said, we're -- we've had teams of people go through each and every asset. We've had multiple offsite meetings. And we're really rolling it into our portfolio plan that we expect to come out in -- over the next year. And it'll be at about the same level as what we're doing at the Essex portfolio right now.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Third question, possibly for Mike Schall. The $385 million you referenced, I mean how should we think about that? Is that mostly B property? Is that A properties? What's kind of the acquisition strategy right now? Is there a focus on A versus B? Or is it really more submarket driven, no differential between A versus B right now?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, it's actually a little bit more submarket driven at this point in time. There were assets that traded that we dropped out of the bidding process when the cap rates for, I would say these are A assets and A locations, went sub 4. We're really not all that interested in participating in some of those transactions. And again, we would rather play this, what typically happens when you have a very tight apartment condition where people are forced to move out to the next area. So we're trying to go to transit-oriented areas in still good cities that are still near the jobs, and where rents are lower and cap rates are higher, and try to anticipate that trend of people that will be moving out or will not be able to find a apartment in the best areas and they're willing to get on a BART train or whatever and commute in.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so this is more suburban type product that you're acquiring here...
Michael J. Schall: I'll give you an example. A couple of these buildings are within 10 miles of North San Jose, where all the jobs are, for example. We're not talking about going to the hinterlands. We're talking about going to good cities, Fremont, for example. Again, with transit options, given that the traffic in the Bay Area is becoming more problematic over time. And again, we're trying to find those places where people want to live, offer a good quality of life, can access their -- the employment nodes and provide the appropriate return to us.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Then finally, at your Investor Day last year, you provided a 3-year outlook that assumed pretty healthy growth there. The growth that we're seeing obviously is tracking above that. Are you seeing growth in addition to what you had expected, or are you seeing a compression of the cycle?
Michael J. Schall: That's -- I think that they can work together. I don't -- I'm not sure that you're seeing compression in the cycle. We would expect a longer cycle, as we suggested there. We went back and looked at all of the recovery periods for the last 50 years, and we concluded that, when you have major financial recession type periods, the recovery periods tend to be longer. And we certainly think that, that's a key part of this. The other part of it, though, is what's going on with incomes. I mean, as long as incomes continue to grow, and the overall affordability equation is tolerable to the consumer, we think that this can go on longer than we might otherwise have expected. But I think the difference between this cycle and several of the previous cycles are the number of high-quality, high-paying jobs is different. The amount of wealth that is being created is also different in that you have companies that are very profitable, as opposed to if you go back to, for example, the late '90s where you had companies with no operating history whatsoever, that you were able to raise $1 billion in the market and operate a "to be formed" type of company. It's a much different scenario to that. I mean we see, at this point in time, real jobs, income levels doing very well, the -- for example, the Microsoft announcement of 18,000 jobs essentially being let go, and of somewhere around 1,500 of them in the Seattle area is what we're expecting. A lot of those people are highly skilled. And again, there's a number of companies that are looking for those skill sets. So we're not sure exactly what impact that's going to have, but I feel like it might be more muted than what you might otherwise think given the magnitude of the losses.
Operator: Our final question today will come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Final, wow, that's a high hurdle. It's Michael Bilerman. So I noticed your marketable securities balance went up about $6 million to $106 million. And I wasn't sure if that was a purchase of additional stocks, if that was increases in market value. I know there's a bunch of bonds in there, but there is, like, I don't know, $22 million, $23 million of common stocks, and I didn't know if that was something of a strategic opportunity on the tongue [ph] that we need to be mindful of.
Michael T. Dance: Michael, this is Mike Dance. I assure you it is not a strategic opportunity. It -- we do have a captive insurance company that continues to have no losses, but continues to collect premiums. That's some of it. Some of it's increases in market values, but no strategic investments.
Michael J. Schall: And then just to be clear, Mike. The captive insurance entity, I think it has around $40 million in it?
Michael T. Dance: $45 million.
Michael J. Schall: $45 million in it. So the -- we have a tiered investment scheme which has -- the first couple of tiers are very safe, and then it becomes a little bit more discretionary and/or more like ETFs and that type of investment in those layers. But it's really a function of that, wanting to remain liquid and have those reserves set aside in case there is a self-insurance type loss.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then we spent a lot of time on this call talking about how you've been able to influence the BRE portfolio in processes and things like that, but I'm curious if there's been any influence at all on the Essex portfolio from anything that you've been able to garner either out of operations or any other sort of discipline that, like, came from looking at BRE, that's had some influence on the Essex properties?
Erik J. Alexander: Sure. There have been. I mean, I think the information has gone both ways. I think we see a lot of it in the integration stuff. In the systems that we're changing, we've adopted some of those things that serve our internal customers. On the customer side, we're -- we'll be adopting a customer care platform that was used by BRE in a process we think works well. And we'll adapt some ideas we have on that. Some things related to utility bill-back, we're looking at. We've had some just great collaboration on stuff. I met with a manager in Seattle, who said -- who transferred from a BRE community to an Essex community, and she said, "I just love the way you do this simple renewal." She said but, "Gosh, there's like 12 steps to get to the price. I have some ideas on how you can fix that." And I'm like, "All right. Let's get together and talk about that with the right people." And so again, people are really, I think, being encouraged and sharing ideas. And I think that's been a big part of the integration is it -- constantly encourage that, and don't pretend that we have all the answers. So yes, we're differently getting ideas from all the people that are involved.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to return the floor back over to management for closing remarks.
Michael J. Schall: Okay, thank you, operator. In closing, we thank you for joining the call. This is truly an exciting time, if not exhausting time, at Essex. We appreciate your interest in the company and look forward to updating you again next quarter. Good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure for introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin. 
Mike J. Schall: Thank you, Rob. I would like to start by welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are also in attendance. On the call, I'd like to cover the following three topics, our first quarter results, an update on the merger with BRE, and our future priorities. On to the first topic, yesterday we were pleased to report continued strong operating results, consistent with the robust housing environment on the West Coast. We reported 7.2% revenue growth, which matched our Q3 2012 for the highest same-property revenue growth achieved since the great recession, and represents a reacceleration of rental growth that began a year ago. The recovery from our seasonally weakest fourth quarter occurred faster than normal this year, allowing us to exceed the midpoint of the guidance range in each region and the high end of the guidance range in Northern California and Seattle. The greatest outperformance was in Northern California, where our combination of factors has led to a substantial shortage of housing. Northern California has among the best job growth in America, recently reported at about 3.3% for the three primary metro areas surrounding the San Francisco Bay, with only 0.7% of existing housing stock expected to be delivered in 2014.  Further evidence of the housing shortage is reflected in the sales prices of medium-priced homes in the Bay area, which have increased by 13% to 27% year-over-year. Accordingly, although apartment rents are up about 9% year-over-year, the cost of housing alternatives has increased even more to the benefit of apartments. A key management objective is converting same-property NOI into recurring cash flow or core FFO growth. Timing of financing transactions, repayments of preferred equity investments and net dispositions in Q1 created drag on core FFO per share reported at 8% growth for the quarter. As you know, we formed three joint ventures in connection with the BRE merger detailed on page S14 of the supplement. These joint ventures have a Southern California focus, with 2,900 of the 4,175 apartments in these ventures located in Southern California. As a result, our ownership weighted portfolio allocations changed less than previously expected from the merger, with Northern California declining from 37% for Essex standalone to 34% post-merger and Southern California increasing from 45% Essex standalone to 47% post merger. Recent regional job growth reports are more robust than currently reflected in our market forecasts included on page S15 of the supplement, which did not change from last quarter. Notably, our thesis for slow and steady improvement in Southern California appears to be on track. Now to my second topic, a merger update. We are very pleased that the merger with BRE was consummated materially as planned. Throughout the process, many people at both companies, now one E team contributed a relentless, focused and dedicated effort to make the merger a reality. To those E team members listening today, please accept my warmest appreciation and thanks for a job well done. As a result of the merger, 523 BRE employees have joined the Essex team, including three executives, with two of the three accepting temporary assignments, 82 joining a corporate department and 438 representing property staff and their management. Our baseline financial assumptions noted previously remain mostly intact and Mike Dance will update guidance in a moment. Most of the expense savings were accomplished by reductions in staff at the closing. Going forward, we will continue to incur merger integration costs, as systems and processes are consolidated over the next 12 to 15 months. Through this process, additional synergies will be realized attributable to consultants employees hired with temporary contracts, excess office space, and duplicate license fees on a variety of systems and processes. In just a few years, Essex has grown from $6 billion to $16 billion in enterprise value. As a result, we view the integration process as an opportunity to completely reexamine how we provide our basic service while carefully selecting the best practices from Essex, BRE and others. And finally, my third topic, which is our future priorities. You all probably know that we run a relatively flat organization, and clearly this is an incredibly busy time for the Essex team, requiring us to be careful -- requiring us to carefully prioritize our activities, which I would like to quickly summarize as follows. In the short to midterm, three key priorities. First, reduce the growth differential between Essex and BRE portfolios while taking advantage of current conditions as we navigate our peak leasing season. Already, we made significant progress in reconciling pricing practices and have implemented changes to reduce turnover, increasing pricing power and occupancy. Erik will comment further on the progress made in pricing. A reconciliation of the 1.6% revenue growth differential between Essex and BRE in Q1 has the following components. 25% of the 1.6% growth rate differential is due to sub-market portfolio allocations. 25% is due to redevelopment contribution and other management-related factors. 19% is due to declining quarter-over-quarter occupancy within the BRE portfolio, and 31% is due to increases in other income. Our second priority, short midterm, is to vigorously pursue the integration of systems and processes for BRE and Essex. And our third priority is to ramp-up investment activity for the combined companies. In the first quarter, as you know, we were a net seller of property. The substantial improvement in cost of capital since year end now allows us to add significant value through acquisitions and other external growth to continue for the foreseeable future. And then, the priorities in the mid to long term are, again there are three of them. Number one, look for opportunities to improve the financial structure of the combined companies from the perspective of risk, reward, cost of capital, NAV and core FFO accretion. This could include co-investments on future development opportunities, for example. Number two; rethink how we provide our basic service given significant market concentrations within our portfolio. This could include a different management structure for our greatest concentrations of property, regional leasing centers with evening hours, and investments in our technology platform to improve marketing, customer relationship management, resident experience and efficiency. And finally, third, continue to improve the E team by focusing on career paths that develop skills and create career opportunities and leaders, improve our hiring practices, provide greater regional coordination of staff and related topics. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander. Thank you. 
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you. As Mike has already highlighted, we are off to a very good start in 2014 and the next chapter of Essex's story looks promising. Both Essex and BRE turned in great quarters, and I wanted to take a moment to thank the property teams for maintaining focus during the merger. With the whirlwind of merger activity last quarter, it would be easy to lose sight of the customer and property needs. Not only did they maintain their focus, they exceeded expectations and really helped Essex set up for a strong year. We have a lot of integration work ahead of us, but I am very encouraged how the regional leadership has brought the property teams together and concentrated on the fundamentals of property management. Thank you, E team. Senior Management and the shareholders sincerely appreciate your efforts. So, five weeks into the integration, property operations is thriving. Culturally, the BRE and Essex teams have really come together to support the common Essex goals. I believe our early success can be attributed to purposeful outreach to BRE associates in January and February, and the fact that 90% of the regional management team from BRE has joined Essex. This group has been instrumental in leading their teams, encouraging important communications and delivering strong results. One of the early objectives was to share our core philosophy of balancing the three-legged stool by fairly serving the representative legs, residents, employees and the shareholders. As some of you know, this philosophy includes very open atmosphere, where truth trumps title. We cannot improve as an organization, if we do not know where the challenges and opportunities are hidden. There are some inconveniences with running parallel systems at this point, but we are making progress on our program evaluations. The positive aspect of this review is that we have the good fortune of choosing between excellent options. There are really no bad choices and we firmly believe that our commitment to review these alternatives will make Essex a better operating Company. Make no mistake we are committed to unifying the organization under a single platform. And to the extent we can accelerate decisions that lead us to that direction. We will take action to do so. One of the most vital components is revenue management. While we continue to operate two revenue management programs, we’ve taken important steps towards integrating Essex's pricing philosophy and our proven strategy of maintaining higher occupancy. Through the combined efforts of the revenue management team and the property operations group, we have increased occupancy among the BRE portfolio by 43 basis points in April alone. We will remain focused on refining our pricing practices and stay true to our collaborative process. We expect to make further gains in occupancy with the BRE portfolio throughout the year, with the goal of having the entire portfolio operating at the same high level by the first quarter of next year. Now, as for the Essex portfolio during the first quarter, leasing activity met or exceeded expectations in all of our markets, highlighted by better than expected occupancy, strong market rent growth, consistent renewal activity and scheduled rent growth ahead of budget. Renewal rates grew at 5.7% during -- over expiring rates during the period, while April renewals improved to 6%. May and June renewals are expected to achieve rent growth around 6% as well. Market rents continue to grow throughout the quarter and have accelerated in recent weeks to a level 6.2% higher than where we began the year. Given our low availability and improving demand, we should see strong, sustainable rent growth for new lease activity in all markets. However, the two areas in our portfolio that we will watch closely are CBD Seattle and the A product in Orange County, as both have shown some pricing resistance due to competitive options. Turnover has remained within expectations during the quarter, and with rising home prices across our West Coast markets, move outs due to home purchases during the period were less than 10%, the lowest level in three years. Heading into the peak leasing season, the portfolio's positioned right where we would like it to be, ending April at 96.2% occupancy with a net availability of less than 6%. Leasing activity at our new developments remained strong during the quarter and Dublin station stabilizing ahead of schedule and currently is 99% occupied. Epic leased apartment homes at a rate of 45 per month during the first four months of this year and we are now more likely to stabilize this project ahead of plan. Avery, Huxley opened in Southern California, while Mosso in San Francisco began pre leasing last month. All three projects, along with the BRE legacy project, Solstice and Wilshire La Brea have performed well and are leasing ahead of expectations. Now, I'll share some highlights for each region beginning with Seattle. Employment growth in the region remains strong and well above the national average, with a year-over-year increase of 2.8% in March and unemployment hovering around 5%. Amazon continues to consume office space in downtown Seattle, but the big news for the quarter was the announcement of a new 1 million-square foot distribution facility in Kent, which should bode well for our south end assets. Boeing also committed to building a new 1.1 million-square foot wing facility in Everett. This will translate to nearly 3000 direct jobs at peak employment in the future. Rent growth remains strong in the region, especially areas outside of the CBD, where much of the new supply continues to be delivered. However, with economic rents up 5% over the prior year, downtown isn't exactly struggling, but it is highly competitive and therefore, rents have been slower to recover from the seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. As expected, we anticipate that downtown Seattle will lag other sub markets in the region in terms of rent growth, but should enjoy some benefit from accumulated loss to lease, as scheduled rents were up 6.6% year-to-date. Improved leasing velocity in March and April, along with net availability under 6% at the end of last month, demonstrates healthy demand in the sub market. But we will have to remain vigilant, given additional deliveries throughout the year. Turning to Northern California, job growth continues to improve in the Bay area, with year-over-year increase of 3.3% in March and 4.3% in San Jose. We have yet to see any signs of slowdown, as Salesforce, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Twitter all announced significant expansions or lease transactions totaling more than 1.7 million square feet in San Francisco, including hiring plans for 2014. San Jose is equally strong with 59% of Silicon Valley companies surveyed planning to hire people for new local jobs during 2014. Office absorption in Silicon Valley was nearly 900,000 square feet during the quarter. Additionally Western Digital subsidiary HGST announced plans for a new 335,000-square foot expansion in San Jose, while Google plans to lease the Moffett Airfield to develop robotic, aviation and aerospace projects. Furthermore, much talked about mystery Tech Company has committed to occupy a recently approved 2 million-square foot office project near the San Jose airport. This would be the single largest office project in San Jose and is scheduled to begin construction later this year. The East Bay also continues to build for future job growth with software firm Workday announcing plans to build a new 430,000-square foot facility in Pleasanton. Economic rents levels continue to outperform in all sub markets and consistent with expectations, San Francisco and Oakland are leading the way with year-over-year growth north of 10%. Finally, turning to Southern California. Employment continues to grow at a more moderate pace compared to Seattle and the Bay area, but is improving, with Orange County, Los Angeles and San Diego all posting year-over-year job growth rates above 2%. Unemployment continues to decline in Los Angeles and now stands at 8.7%. This is down from 10.1% last year and is improved 50 basis points since December. Not only is this overall employment picture continuing to improve in Los Angeles, the professional business service sector posted a 4.7% gain in March, so the quality of jobs is improving as well. The year-over-year economic rent growth for Essex Southern California portfolio was 6.2%. The Los Angeles sub market posted encouraging results with a 6% year-over-year growth in economic rent and a 4.7% gain since the beginning of the year. Orange County and San Diego are performing as expected, but Ventura is ahead of projections through the first four months of the year and may represent a favorable surprise for Essex, if job growth projections match our forecasts. So overall, economic and rental market conditions remain strong across the portfolio, and solid performance through the first four months of the year gives us confidence heading into the peak leasing season. I am encouraged by the early integration efforts and look forward to completing many of the fundamental system changes this year that will allow us to take advantage of the operational efficiencies that we believe are available with our more concentrated footprint. Thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Mike Dance. 
Mike T. Dance:   Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide comments on our first quarter results, followed by highlights on the recent balance sheet activity and close with new guidance for the full year, which includes BRE. First, I’ll start with the same-property expense growth in the quarter, which grew at 4.6%. While the growth was above the high end of our guidance range, it was consistent with our plan for the year. The cause of the above average growth was due to higher taxes in Seattle, the timing of scheduled repairs in maintenance and higher utility rates relative to last year. For the second quarter, we expect our same-property expense growth to be around 5%. And in the second half of the year we expect the growth rate to moderate to approximately 2%. For the full year, we expect same-property expense growth to be within the 3.5% at the midpoint. Merger expenses incurred in the first quarter total approximately $16 million and was comprised of local transfer taxes on the BRE assets transferred on March 31, professional fees incurred, and the cost of the commitment for the bridge loan, which was canceled on March 31. In total, we expect to incur approximately $70 million of merger expenses in 2014, which will reduce reported FFO, but be excluded from core FFO. Next, I will comment on the capital markets transactions and provide a post merger update to the financial metrics of our combined balance sheet. Through the end of April, we issued $191 million in equity to fund our acquisitions and development pipeline. In April, we went to the bond market and issued 10 year unsecured notes at 3 7/8% or 128 basis points over the 10 year treasury rate. Given the outsized demand for our notes, we upsized the offering relative to our original expectations. These capital market events, while very attractive long-term costs of capital, will have a short-term negative impact to our 2014 earnings of approximately $0.05 per share due to the timing and the magnitude relative to our original plan. We have now waived the long-term debt, the equity and the joint venture capital originally planned as part of the BRE transaction, enabling us to avoid the extra costs of funding the bridge loan announced with the merger. We believe these post merger capital markets activity clearly demonstrates the cost of capital benefits we envisioned as part of the BRE transactions. The Essex post merger pro forma April balance sheet continues to strengthen. While the debt to total market capitalization of 31% is relatively unchanged from the end of the first quarter, the unencumbered net operating income to total net operating income has increased to 63% and our secured debt to total assets has decreased to 18%. While the net debt to EBITDA ratio has increased by approximately 1 turn, the forecasted growth and net operating income from the stabilized portfolio and the delivery of the development pipeline will improve this ratio to approximately 7 times by March 2015. I will now highlight the changes to our new 2014 guidance. On page 6 of the press release, you will find the key assumptions regarding BRE, and on F13 of the supplement, we have provided the line item details for the original Essex guidance with the changes from the mergers' key assumptions. We have increased the midpoint of our core FFO per diluted share estimate by $0.05. The $0.05 per share updates the Essex guidance for the capital markets activity I noted earlier, and includes the expected contributions from the BRE portfolio and the combined synergies from eliminating redundant public company costs and corporate positions. To date, the achieved savings exceed our initial plan for 2014. However, the greater savings are offset by the negative impact from the Mission Bay 360 fire. We now expect to achieve the high end of our prior range for accretion from the merger on a full year run rate basis, as we are more confident than we -- that we will be able to exceed the synergies we originally underwrote. In closing, I wanted to provide a quick explanation as to how the fire at Mission Bay 360 impacts our 2014 FFO guidance. Properties acquired in the business combination are assigned fair values as of the merger close date. Our original forecast assigned a fair value to the Mission Bay 360 development based on the assumption that leasing activities would begin in the second half of the year. After the loss from the fire, the value of the damaged property is significantly below the historical cost basis and results in less capitalized interest beginning on April 1 and continuing through reconstruction. If the fire had not occurred, our 2014 guidance range would have increased by another $0.03 to $0.05. That ends my comments and I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Joseph - Citigroup: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk about the decision of which properties actually contribute to the JVs.
Mike J. Schall: Sure, Nick, this is Mike Schall. We do a pretty good ranking of each property. We looked at every property, underwrote each one of them and we tried to find properties that were consistent. In other words, we wanted to own over the long haul, but we tended toward the higher cap rate type of properties and tried to match that with the right investor. We think that that leaves us with a very, very strong portfolio, well diversified within the different marketplaces. And I guess it's a little bit like painting a picture, in that you move through it piece by piece, trying to match the investor with the assets and coming up with something that you think is fundamentally attractive and appropriate, given our business plan going forward. That's how we approached it. So there's not a simple answer to that. It was an evolutionary process, and but I think the outcome worked out very well for us.
Nick Joseph - Citigroup: Thanks. And you mentioned one of your priorities going forward is the acquisition opportunities. Can you talk about the acquisition pipeline today?
Mike J. Schall: Sure. We just closed our first transaction post merger, Piedmont in Bellevue in the Pacific Northwest. And we are accumulating transactions. Actually, the deal flow going into the summer appears to be picking up and as you know, principally because John Eudy who's here with me today and Craig Zimmerman have so much credibility in the marketplace, we tend to get a look at virtually everything. So I'm hopeful. As it stands today, we're looking at several transactions. We've committed to none of them. And -- but again, the deal -- within a deal flow volume that is picking up. I would say going back to our guidance would be our first step this year, which was $300 million to $400 million. We expect to achieve that level and whether we can go above that remains to be seen. We're working on it.
Nick Joseph - Citigroup: Great, thanks.
Mike J. Schall: Thank you
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Schaffer with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Schaffer - Sandler O'Neill: Thanks. Continuing on the topic of investment activity, given the continued strength in Northern California, should we expect to see more acquisition dollars spent in this region rather than Southern California?
Mike J. Schall: That's a good question. And we like both right now. Northern California still has a lot of room to run, when Erik read through his script, every time I hear it, I marvel at how much positive news there is out there. And the economy once it starts clicking, it's a momentum thing and momentum does not generally change real quickly unless there's an asset bubble or something else materially changes to changes scenario. So that's what we like about Northern California. Having said that, Northern California, if you look at price per unit, look at rent per square foot, appears to be becoming more pricey, although the rent to median income statistics are still well within the desirable range and that causes us to look to Southern California. So I'm going to say about the same thing that I said last quarter, which is, we like -- we like all of the markets. We would have a slight preference for Southern California, given lower valuation metrics.
Andrew Schaffer - Sandler O'Neill: All right. Thanks. That's it for me.
Mike J. Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg, Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Bragg, please go ahead with your question.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: I am here. Can you hear me?
Mike J. Schall: Yeah. We catch you Dave.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Okay. Sorry about that. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. The first relates to the operational synergies in the BRE portfolio. You -- it's -- I just want to confirm that in terms of narrowing the revenue growth gap between the Essex and BRE portfolios, it sounds as though you think you can get 75% of the way there and you can't really do anything about the 25% that you attributed to sub market positioning, is that correct?
Mike J. Schall: Dave, its Mike Schall and Erik may want to chime in here as well. Yes, I think that's what is achievable. I think that the Essex versus BRE scenario included they have about 10% more turnover of units and the way they price their renewals is fundamentally different from Essex. And what they view as the sweet spot with respect to occupancy and availability are different from Essex. And so what Erik has done is he has consolidated the revenue management function. Actually, the person that's leading that is a BRE executive under John (indiscernible) leadership, or under his guidance. And so we're running both LRO and yield start. But we view both of those as being essentially tools and really the strategy is what's important. And so we've changed the strategy. It's consistent going forward. And the only thing that you would think that we could not pick up would be, I agree, the sub market allocation, which will change over time obviously as the slow, steady recovery in Southern California continues to get better and we go through periods of time. So even -- I'd say even that the 1.6%, 25% of the 1.6% was attributable to sub market allocation. Obviously, that'll change over time as the relationships between the sub market rent growth vary from market-to-market.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: That's helpful, thank you. And the second question relates to the full year run rate range of $24 million to $27 million that you provided for operating and G&A synergies. Of course BRE's G&A last year was $23 million. So can you please break that out between G&A and other operating synergies and talk a little bit about what those operating synergies are?
Mike T. Dance: Well, what you see on the $25 million, that is net of cost that they capitalize or allocated to property management. So it is not a simple exercise and rather than getting into the details, we can probably do that offline.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Okay. All right. That's fine. Thanks.
Mike T. Dance:  Thanks, Dave. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Hi, Good morning. You mentioned ultra low move out rates due to home purchasing. But could you comment on turnover and move outs around price and potential renter fatigue and is that some of the increase in activity in Seattle?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. So the reason for move out due to call it costs, or whether some people describe it as they got a rent increase or it's too expensive or they've -- it's passed them up, has remained basically the same over the last four quarters. We're not seeing that in Seattle at this point. Seattle does have the highest rate of move out due to home purchases in that average that's below 10%. That region's around 13%, but still well under where it has been in the past. So we still feel very comfortable with the relationship between the applicants that are coming in and what they make and where the rent levels are.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, that's helpful. My second question has to do with the BRE integration. And I don't know if you've mentioned this, but is there -- have you defined the scope of potential redevelopment opportunities within the BRE portfolio, or is it too early? And if not too early, is there any kind of expectation for scale and time line and return?
John F. Burkart: Yes, this is John Burkart. We haven't defined that and released that, but the size of the opportunities we think are pretty significant. There is a slight difference in the portfolios between Essex and BRE in that their portfolio is a little bit younger than ours. And therefore, as we look at the renovation opportunities, there's a little bit less infrastructure work that we will be doing and a little bit higher return of finished work that will be doing in that portfolio. But we are aggressively putting together a plan, similar to what we did to the Essex portfolio. We'll probably have a lot more of that information available at the November NAREIT. At this point in time, we're working through, trying to make good decisions. We'd like to understand the marketplace and put a lot of time into that. It's not as simple as just looking at what we perceive as issues from a physical plan. It's getting in and really understanding what the residents will value and making that the right decisions there.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Yeah. Hi, everyone. We're frequently told in the aftermath of a merger that everything exceeded expectations. I'm just wondering if I can pose the question, what's been the least positive development as we've gone through this process.
Mike J. Schall: Hi, David, it's Mike. Wow, way to put me on the spot on that one.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: We don't do soft questions in this department.
Mike J. Schall: As someone noted, one of the research pieces noted that we didn't have to deal with the polar vortex. Although we did have to deal with droughts, fires, earthquakes and other random events. The worst thing, I think that a number of people that are knowledgeable and have been through this process, including one of our Board members that was involved in several bank M&A transactions, said watch out for the cultures and integrating the cultures and integrating across different offices and a variety of things, is the most challenging event. And I'd have to say that I think that is, that proved accurate. I think that we did a really good job of getting out ahead of that. I sent Mr. Burkart and Mr. Alexander on a mission to go to attend the BRE company meetings and annual awards ceremony and they answered questions for an hour plus at the BRE meetings before the merger. And so we tried to work that together so that the teams can come together. But as you can imagine, there are fears. They're human beings with concerns about their job and what it means and how it could be different and who are the new leaders of the Company and how will they treat us, and so overcoming that I think was -- is challenging. It's not done by any means, but it's an ongoing process, and I think we've done well with it.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Are you over the hump with that, Mike? You seem to be talking a bit in the past tense.
Mike J. Schall: Well, I don't think that we're exactly over the hump, no. I think that there is still plenty of issues to be overcome. People, for example, they -- all things being equal, people want to utilize the system. We talked about integrating systems. Well all things being equal, people want to utilize the systems they're most used to, and that obviously can't happen. We need to become one company, and we need to merge these together. And so people need to work with us to both make the right decision, which sounds simple, but it's somewhat threatening to the people. My view is we're going to continue growing as a Company. There's going to be plenty of opportunity out there for those that buy into the culture and love the company like I do and so that it shouldn't -- it won't be an issue. However, when you get into the nitty-gritty of that, what that looks like, it is a little bit problematic.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay. If I can have a second bite, now we're with the big boys in the S&P, isn't it time to split the shares and make Essex a little affordable for grandma to own more than two shares?
Mike J. Schall: Well, I think as soon as Warren Buffett splits Berkshire Hathaway we'll consider that.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay.
Mike J. Schall: No, I'm just kidding. The issue there is the cost of splitting the shares when you are in the high, what 90% institutionally held and typically you're charged are per share cost to sell stock. So it just seems to fit our profile and it seems to make sense to us so we probably will not split the shares.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Mike J. Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon, guys. Mike, you talked about investment, I think you addressed a couple questions about how that's picking up. Can you talk about -- a little bit about what you see are the opportunities on the development side, whether development still makes sense at this point of the cycle? And then also, BRE had been going through a fairly extensive cleanup. How much of that's left to do on the BRE portfolio?
John D. Eudy: Hi, Michael, this is John Eudy. We probably hit our peak on April 1, the day of the merger in terms of the development exposure that we anticipate having, a little over 2,800 units, plus or minus $1.75 billion after we add the BRE assets to the Essex. Most of those deals were contemplated, underwritten and done two and three years ago, so we have the benefit of both the cost side, as well as the land basis side and fees to -- wind to our back. On a go forward basis, we are and we've said this previously, lessening our development exposure in total. However, there are still a few deals that we are going to be doing over the next year that have some legacy advantages cost wise. It's very difficult on the ground to buy at expectation prices that sellers are willing to sell at and at costs where they are today. So that's mainly the reason why I'm going to most likely see our portfolio average exposure go down. We have probably three more starts this year. By the end of this year, just for some color of our -- the 2700, 2800 units that we have in development, we will have stabilized about a third of them by the end of the year. They'll come off. Another third will basically be done, delivered to operations and be fundamentally well on their way to stabilization, so you can see the bell curve on exposure is going to go down dramatically, even with the three additions.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: And then in terms of the cleanup on the BRE portfolio, I know they had been talking about selling assets. They sold three before the merger. How much cleanup's left to go on that?
Mike J. Schall: Hi, Mike, it's Mike Schall. There were two assets in Phoenix, plus a joint venture on a third asset in Phoenix that were being marketed by BRE in Q4 and Q1. Ultimately did not sell and we will look to sell those assets at the appropriate time? So we still have some cleanup with respect to those assets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then Mike, this is my follow-up question; you talked about the occupancy and renewal strategy. I'm assuming that's going to generate accelerating revenue growth on BRE. Is it an expectation that in 2014 you could see by the fourth quarter the growth rate in the BRE portfolio we've seen that of Essex, given the low hanging fruit there?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. I think it's very possible that we could accelerate the occupancy and the rent growth faster than originally anticipated. Going back to Mike's comments about the culture I think that's the key and do the teams that have to execute this, you know buy into the plan and so far, so good from revenue management standpoint and property operations. So we're encouraged by what we see. Some of the things we can't change with respect to lease expiration profile. That'll have to happen over time and renewals that have already been sent out. But that's a short term issue and, again, I think we're set up to take advantage of the peak leasing season.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company: Hi, yes. Good morning, over there. Fantastic quarter. Just quick question, with Northern California doing even better than I think most of us expected. Are we any closer to condo conversions at this point?
Mike J. Schall: Tayo, yes, this is Mike Schall. We are ever closer I think as time goes on. The key metric there I think is the year-over-year increase in housing prices. And if you look at -- if you look at some of the specific metros, the closer you are to downtown San Francisco, for example, and really down the peninsula, some very interesting things are happening. And condo prices for well located properties are moving up pretty significantly. And in fact, one of the Senior Executives here is listing his condo because he got an eye-popping number. And so I think we're getting closer and with respect to a couple of metros. But as a general statement, we have somewhere around 7,000 apartments that could be converted to condos. We're talking about a relatively small subset of the portfolio at this point in time and really focused on San Francisco and some of the other Northern California cities.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our question is a follow-up from the line of Dave Bragg, Green Street. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Thank you. When will we receive the BRE first quarter financials?
Mike J. Schall: We're filing a Q hopefully Friday that'll show pro forma at a very high level. There is no requirement for them to file a Q, so there will be limited disclosure on those statements other than what we are required to produce for 8-K or pro forma going forward.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: So no actuals from BRE from the first quarter?
Mike J. Schall: There's no requirement to do so. So there's no -- again, what would be required for us you'll purposes, you'll see some net income on a pro forma basis in the Q that we file on Friday.
Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Thank you.
Mike J. Schall: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Hey, good morning out there.
Mike J. Schall: Welcome Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Hey, just one for me here. It's been a long call. Question on the Essex Management psychology going forward, Mike, Essex has historically been what a lot of people would deem an opportunistic investor, not only on the direct asset side, but also doing things that some of us would call non-core, some of your mezzanine type of investments. Given your larger size, your S&P inclusion, do you expect that to change? Will you perhaps become a bit more conservative, more core in your investment approach going forward?
Mike J. Schall: Hi, Haendel. That's a great question, thank you for that. Not as long as I lead the Company. So I mean my view is you can add -- we've added a zero or two to the Company over time and it doesn't fundamentally change anything. It doesn't fundamentally change my job or how we have learned to make money in this business and do the things that we do. So it is actually the opposite of that. I would expect us to continue to be opportunistic to try to understand markets and I think that we will have greater resources to do so. And I think that if there's been one limitation that we've had as a Company, it's been because we're flat and G&A-constrained, let's say. We have a few more resources than we've had in the past. I'll give you an example. BRE had a business intelligence unit that had several people and we've taken over that. We believe strongly in it. And we think that given, or having the ability to have that type of entity within the Company will help us make better decisions, help us understand the portfolio better, and so I think it's actually the opposite. I think that the reason why we thought that BRE transaction made sense was, number one, because the real state made sense on a per share basis. But number two, we think that this business is -- there is an element to this business that is scalable and part of that is how we deal with problems and opportunities and having the required resources in order to maximize the ultimate outcome. So long winded, but I think that's what we're focused on and that's why we're very excited about both the short term and the long term of the BRE transaction.
Handel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Well, it's worked for you so far. Good luck and congratulations again.
Mike J. Schall: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Harris, Imperial Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Yeah. Hi, again. I'm looking for a little clarification on the merger-related expenses. You've expensed $16 million in the first quarter. And I'm looking at the guidance, and Mike Dance I think you made reference to $17 for the year.
Mike T. Dance: Yes.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: So million $70 million minus $16 million is the outstanding balance?
Mike T. Dance: Correct.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay. What -- there's a footnote here saying excludes BRE merger costs of $35 million on the right-hand side of that -- these numbers on the S13 page.
Mike T. Dance: Yes. You're on a roll. You're correct, three for three.
Mike J. Schall: Right, exactly. The BRE went through the BRE books and records and they-- 
David Harris - Imperial Capital: I see.
Mike J. Schall: History, so it's not on -- it won't be on the Essex books, there were -- all the BRE related merger costs that have been incurred prior to the merger were expensed by BRE in the past. And the other component that doesn't show up there is the diluted share count, the impact of the change of control on option and RSU vestings, both the share count.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay. So I've got a question with regard to the timing of this, then. Is it reasonable to think that most of that additional -- what was -- $70 million minus $16 million, that $54 million is going to be front end loaded, or is it going to be spread evenly?
Mike J. Schall: Yes.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: And then is it reasonable at this point in time to assume that we're then done or do you think there will be some run on it into 2015 of merger-related costs?
Mike J. Schall: I suspect that the vast majority of it will fall into 2014. And most of it, the attorneys, the investment bankers, the -- all those related costs have been incurred and will be part of the second quarter and that it will drop off. The merger integration expenses will be ongoing. We've made some comments about what those categories are and they will -- again, we're not going to be in a huge hurry to try to integrate the systems because from our perspective, we've grown from $6 billion to $16 billion in enterprise value and essentially taken our time to work through how we deliver the service and what the best options are with respect to the structure of the Company, are very important decisions and we're not going to feel like we have a gun to our head in order to make those decisions quickly.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay. And then an additional question, sorry to take so much time up. But we're looking for the capitalized cost of disclosure. As you know, I think this is a rather important issue and I'm wondering whether I've not seen it or whether it's not been included for whatever reason?
Mike T. Dance: Yes, with the merger integration costs, there's a lot of noise going through that schedule. So starting in 2015, we'll continue to provide that, but we want to get the merger and integration costs through the system to make that disclosure more meaningful.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: So we're not going to have it for the rest of this year, Mike?
Mike T. Dance: That's the plan.
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Okay. When you bring it back, can you bring a new and improved version including G&A capitalized costs?
Mike T. Dance: That was in the old version. So that we would continue, not to say it can't be improved on, but your input will be valued. 
David Harris - Imperial Capital: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Karin Ford, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi. Good morning. Just a technical question. Will the BRE same-store pool be in Essex's same-store pool starting next quarter?
Mike T. Dance: Good question. This is Mike Dance. We have not yet decided, so we are kind of working through the options and we'll come up with what we think is the best presentation.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And when you give revised guidance, presumably you'll give us revised core on both in the second quarter?
Mike T. Dance: Depending on which will partially take, that would be if we do the pro forma as if we bought BRE out of a pooling of interest, we would show the combined. But that's -- again that will part of the decision making process.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Mike J. Schall: And Karen, can I add one other thing?
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes.
Mike J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. Mike's comment is from an accounting standpoint. From a Managerial perspective, we are very focused on trying to close that gap between our growth rate and BRE's growth rate. That is one of our primary internal metrics, so we're going to be looking at it primarily from that perspective. But what Mike said about the accounting side also very relevant. So, wanted to give you pieces of both. 
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's helpful. And my last question is just on the fire at MB 360. Do you expect that to have any material impact on the long term viability of that project or the neighborhood or do you think once you get it cleaned up and rebuilt that that project's going to be as good as you expected it to be before the fire?
Mike J. Schall: It's Mike Schall and if you drive out there in that Mission Bay Area, San Francisco, it is truly an amazing place. And so we think the long-term viability of the asset is every bit as good, if not better, than it ever has been. And so we're very excited about the project and obviously disappointed with the fire and all the outcome. And by the way, there's a longer process there with respect to testing the podium strength and the PT cables and a variety of other things. So that's an ongoing process and it's still way too early to comment about exactly what's going to happen there. 
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And the second phase that's going to start leasing in the fourth quarter of 2014?
Mike J. Schall: Yes, yes.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time for closing comments, I'll turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Schall.
Mike J. Schall:   Thank you, everyone, really appreciate your participation on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June. And we also look forward to doing this all over again next quarter. So good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Results and 2014 Guidance Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Barb Pak, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.
Barb Pak: Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference Call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that certain matters discussed on this conference call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to several assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section of the earnings release issued yesterday. Today, management will be making some prepared comments related to the proposed merger of Essex and BRE properties. At the advice of counsel, management will not be taking questions related to the proposed merger, given that the merger is subject to approval of both Essex and BRE's stockholders. Comments related to possible financing sources such as property sales and joint ventures are in a preliminary stage, and we cannot assure you that they will be consummated. Essex has filed a joint proxy statement/prospectus with regards to the proposed merger with the SEC on January 29. We refer investors to the information in the joint proxy statement regarding the merger and related transactions and any other relevant information that we may file with the SEC. The question-and-answer session at the end of the call will be limited to matters related to the fourth quarter earnings results and the 2014 guidance, assumptions and outlook provided for Essex on a standalone basis. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Schall.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, Barb. I would like to start by welcoming you to our fourth quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I'll cover the following 2 topics on the call: fourth quarter and annual results and our outlook for 2014; and secondly, the update on the merger integration process. So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2013. The core FFO per share result for 2013 represents a 11% growth from the prior year and is $0.05 per share above the midpoint of the initial 2013 guidance range. In the 3-year period from 2010 -- from the 2010 recessionary trough, we've grown core FFO per share by 51%. We ended 2013 with 6.3% same-property revenue growth near the high-end of the initial guidance range, led by our Northern California region. Southern California was the only region that performed below the midpoint of our original 2013 revenue guidance range missing by 15 basis points. With respect to Southern California, our expectation of slow but steady improvement in revenue growth proved accurate in 2013, as each of the 4 quarters generated slightly higher sequential growth, with Q4 achieving a respectable 4.7% revenue growth rate. Looking back over the past several years, however, Southern California has fallen short of our higher expectation for rental revenue. With respect to job growth, 2013 remains strong. And at 2.1% in our target markets was just above our initial forecast, with each MSA, except Oakland and Los Angeles, beating our estimate. Turning to 2014. Our overall market outlook is reflected on Page S-16 of the supplement and is based on U.S. job growth of 1.8% and 2.8% U.S. GDP growth. Both of which are near the middle of the range estimated by our economics data vendors. This information is materially consistent with our 3-year outlook at our Investor Day presentation in November. Our 2014 revenue guidance is very similar to our original 2013 estimates. Overall, the midpoint of our revenue guidance range of 5.6% is only 15 basis points below the comparable estimate for 2013. And each of our 3 primary regions are assumed to generate rental growth within 50 basis points of the comparable 2013 estimate. Overall, 2014 supply is estimated to be -- multi-family supply is estimated to be 1.1% of stock, up from our estimate of 0.8% for 2013. The higher level of supply in 2014 is offset by higher job growth, consistent with an improved U.S. economy, leading us to expect that the overall demand-supply relationship remains favorable to landlords. Apartment demand continues to be anchored by job growth, demographic factors and limited and expensable [ph] alternative to rental [ph] housing. Medium priced homes are expensive on the West Coast with median prices ranging from $389,000 in King County, Washington to $813,000 in San Francisco County. In addition, for-sale housing values are increasing substantially faster than apartment rents, making apartments a more affordable -- making apartments more affordable relative to homes. We believe that Southern California will continue to report good job growth and solid results. The dilemma of Southern California jobs versus rent growth is depicted in an AXIOMetrics chart for Los Angeles that we've reproduced with permission as Page S-17 of the supplement. While we believe that Southern California has the potential for higher rental growth, we don't see the catalyst for that to incur in 2014, and thus, it assumes the continuation of solid, but relatively flat revenue growth rates. We completed approximately $462 million in acquisitions in 2013, down from nearly $800,000 2012. Overall, we expect to acquire approximately $400 million again in 2014, with emphasis on well located B property, and on Southern California, but adds in a way that maximizes accretion. We have 11 development communities that are under construction or in the initial leasing phase. Going forward, we will continue to be selective for new apartment development opportunities. There are many development deals being discussed and most of the merchant builders need equity to satisfy lender requirements. Other impediments to new apartment construction include concerns about the economy, future rent growth expectations, construction cost increases and the need for concessions from reluctant local governments. With this in mind, we continue to believe that new apartment deliveries will peak in late 2014 to early 2015 in Seattle and in Northern California. Now to my second topic, the merger integration update. Since signing the agreement to merge Essex and BRE on December 19, 2013, both companies have worked with great focus and effort to make the transition as smooth as possible. Earlier this week, we filed Form S-4 with the SEC, in connection with the proposed merger and necessary shareholder votes from both Essex and BRE shareholders. If the process proceeds without delay, we could close the merger in March. We have enjoyed working with Connie Moore and her team as we seek our common objective of forming a preeminent West Coast apartment REIT. We appreciate the incredible effort of both the Essex and BRE employees in realizing this vision and offer them our continued thanks. Merger integration planning remains in full swing and significant progress has been made. The merger agreement provides for a cash component of $12.33 per BRE share or roughly $1 billion. The financing of the cash component is supported by $1 billion financing commitment from UBS and Citigroup, which can be relied upon if our preferred funding sources, which are a combination of institutional joint ventures, property sales and borrowings does not occur. We currently have nonbinding term sheets related to the formation of institutional joint ventures, involving properties valued at -- between $800 million and $900 million. In addition, we believe that $100 million to $200 million in property sales could occur before or shortly after the merger, and that most of the cash required to close the merger can be generated by these activities. We realize that the market desires greater visibility into our long-term expectations for the merger and has asked for additional information. As noted on the call following the announcement of the merger, we cannot provide the details of our underwriting and assumption, as advised by our attorneys. We refer everyone to the investor presentation, previously filed with the SEC and posted on our website, and to the Form S-4 recently filed for details of the transaction. We recognize the importance of articulating our vision with respect to the merger. Recall from the conference call announcing the merger that our baseline financial assumptions were that the merger would be NAV neutral, accretive to core FFO in the range of $0.05 to $0.08 per share in the year following the merger closing, and that the annual synergies will approximately equal the impact of Prop 13. In the Q&A, we noted that the vast majorities of the assumed synergies are on the expense side of which property and corporate level expense reductions were roughly similar amounts. We continue to believe these assumptions are achievable. A key question is what opportunities are available over and above the baseline scenario outlined above. As previously noted, we are in the midst of evaluating these opportunities and so conclusions have not been reached. However, we'd like to share with you our list of priorities related to synergies and efficiencies to be pursued following merger consummation as follows: First, we will reconcile pricing philosophies which are materially different despite our geographic and portfolio similarities. Based on that reconciliation, we will adopt one company-wide standard best practice to include the renewal process, targeted turnover rates and costs, traffic and traffic sources, amenity charges and occupancy/availability ranges. Second, we will look for opportunities to improve the financial structure of the combined companies from the perspective of risk, reward, cost to capital and core FFO accretion. This could, for example, involve new institutional co-investment relationships for development communities and, possibly, existing properties. Third, we will implement best practices identified during the merger integration process. Detailed recommendations and opportunities have been compiled as we evaluate each functional area to be the basis for action plans. For example, we expect to implement BRE's RUBS [ph] reimbursement methodology, website and procurement practices at Essex communities. Similarly, we expect to implement Essex's approach to Craigslist promotion, resource management, redevelopment and asset management plans at BRE communities. Fourth, we will use our larger footprint and community proximity to negotiate lower cost relationships with vendors, create on-site operating savings and revenue management synergies. And fifth, we will kickoff a major human resource initiative focused on creating career paths that will develop talent from within the company, improve hiring practices, provide greater regional coordination staff and related topics. We believe that these areas will significantly improve the overall efficiency and results of the combined entity. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining in the call today. I'll now turn the call over to Erik.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. The strong fourth quarter in operations helped Essex cap off another good year and set us up for continued growth in 2014. The Bay Area and Seattle continued to record strong economic growth, which resulted in healthy demand throughout the period. Leasing activity met or exceeded expectations in all of our markets, highlighted by strong renewal activity, improving occupancy and better than expected scheduled rent growth. For the quarter, renewal rates grew at 5.5% over expiring rates, while January renewals improved to 6%. With higher expiring rate comps ahead, February and March renewals are expected to achieve rent growth around 5.5% for the portfolio. Given our low availability and improving demand, we should see strong, sustainable rent growth for new lease activity in all markets. Turnover remained low and within expectations during the quarter. But we did see a seasonal pickup in move-outs due to home purchases during the quarter as this metric hit 12.2%. However, this is consistent with the last 2 years. Solid fundamentals helped sequential scheduled rent growth improve, and we believe our tempered focus on occupancy during the period allowed us to realize scheduled rent growth double that of December 2012. We are off to a good start in the new year and scheduled rent in January outpaced December's growth and occupancy stands at 96.6% with a 5.4% net availability for all stabilized assets. Activity at our lease-up projects, Epic in San Jose and Connolly Station in Dublin, reflects strong market conditions. Both projects are leasing ahead of expectations and are expected to be stabilized in September and March, respectively. Leasing activity at the new developments in the broader market also demonstrates strong demand as the average monthly absorption for all projects north [ph] San Jose was 38 units per month for 2013. Next quarter, I will comment on Avery, Dylan, Huxley and Mosso, as we begin pre-leasing activities for all 4 projects over the next several weeks. Now I'll share some highlights from each region beginning with Seattle. While new buildings continue to come to market in the region, we believe that slower absorption and moderating rents are more a function of seasonality than too much supply. Deliveries are largely concentrated downtown and we remain vigilant in our strategy to maximize revenues by meeting market expectations and proactively managing lease explorations. Economic rents on the east side, the north end and the south end of Seattle, where the majority of our portfolio is located, held up better than downtown during the fourth quarter, and we expect these submarkets to outperform the downtown in 2014. Employment growth in the region improved to a year-over-year rate of 3% in December with unemployment below 5%. The most important employment news of the quarter was the labor resolution between the machinists and Boeing that will then allow the world's largest airplane manufacturers to keep 20,000 direct and indirect jobs in Seattle working on the 777 Dreamliners for the next decade. Office absorption moderated during the fourth quarter with 313,000 square feet lease, but 2.9% of total stock was leased for the full year. Office vacancy remained low and deal flow continues to be brisk, including Amazon's purchase of yet another significant property in downtown. Turning to Northern California. With the year-over-year job growth of 3.4% in San Jose, and 2.2% for the broader regions, the Bay Area continues to lead the way for Essex, with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. Office leasing and development continues to be strong in virtually all parts of the Bay Area with another 1.5 million square feet absorbed during the quarter. Additionally, other significant build-to-suit projects like Apple's 2.8 million square foot headquarters and Netflix expansion began construction during the quarter. Investment in transportation and infrastructure also continued to grow. The new eastern span of the Bay Bridge and the fourth floor of the Caldecott Tunnel opened in the latter part of 2013. BART's Oakland Airport Connector is set to open later this year and the first phase of the Transbay Terminal (sic) [Transbay Transit Center] remains on schedule to open in 2017. All of these projects and others will continue to help fuel economic growth in the Bay Area. Finally, in Southern California. Southern California continues to grow at a more moderate pace compared to Seattle and the Bay Area, but Orange County and Ventura have shown signs of accelerating. All overall job growth in Los Angeles was 1.2% during December. Orange County job growth was 2.4% and Ventura hit 2%. Orange County boasts the lowest unemployment in Southern California at 5.2%, but Los Angeles has dropped below 9% for the first time since November 2008. Encouraging news is that the 1.4% year-over-year decline in employment in Los Angeles -- unemployment in Los Angeles was due to employment growth and not shrinkage in labor force. The impact of the military in San Diego essentially remains unchanged with our resident exposure hovering around 13%. However, with federal funds flowing again, there has been an increase in shipyard activity and military contract work. Commercial leasing activity in the region was positive during the fourth quarter with another 850,000 square feet absorbed mostly in Los Angeles. Orange County was flat, however, Hyundai and PEMCO delivered their headquarters facilities during the period. So overall, economic and rental market conditions remain strong across the portfolio and a solid December and January give us good reason to be confident about 2014. Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide some color to the assumptions behind our 2014 guidance. Then provide a brief update on the proposed merger with BRE. For more details on our guidance assumptions, please read Page 6 of the press release. And on S-14 of the supplemental package, we have provided a detailed roadmap, how these assumptions are expected to impact our 2014 financial results. The assumptions and projections are for Essex on a stand-alone basis and exclude any impact from the proposed BRE transaction and the merger-related costs associated with the deal. For 2014, we expect consolidated same-property net operating income to grow by 6.5% at the mid-point, driven by a 5.6% increase in same-property revenues. The 2014 same-property portfolio will increase by over 2,000 apartment homes and will exclude the 6 properties that were acquired in 2013 and those undergoing major redevelopments. We expect our same-property operating expenses to increase 3.5% at the midpoint. The biggest factor driving our expense growth is higher property taxes. Our budget assumes property tax increases by $3.7 million or 7%. This tax increase relates to higher assessed values in Seattle, which are 18% higher than last year's assessed value. In California, we still had favorable Prop 8 adjustments in 2013, totaling $1.2 million in tax savings. And we expect $600,000 of additional California property taxes in the second half of 2014 as a result of losing these Prop 8 savings on July 1. The controllable expenses for the same-property portfolio are expected to grow by less than 2%. Now, I'll provide an update on the proposed BRE merger. Assuming the merger closes in March, we expect a benefit from the operating efficiencies of adopting the best practices that Mike outlined in his prepared remarks after a 6-month integration period. The operating platform accretion will begin to add accretion to our 2014 core FFO guidance in Q4, and continuing in to 2015. In connection with our financing plans for the cash component of the proposed merger, we expanded our unsecured credit facility from $600 million to $1 billion at the end of January, and added an accordion feature pursuant to which we have the flexibility to expand to $1.5 billion. We reduced the pricing on the expanded facility by 12.5 basis points to 95 basis points over LIBOR. In addition, we renegotiated the pricing on our $350 million term loan reducing the spread over LIBOR by 15 basis points. We believe, this demonstrates some of the initial costs of capital advantages we can achieve with the larger platform. At the closing of the merger, the net debt-to-EBITDA of the combined company will increase by one turn as the result of creating a joint venture which will form the cash component of the deal. At this time, we do not expect to use the $1 billion bridge loan to close the merger. We expect the debt-to-EBITDA ratio will return to approximately 7x in the first half of 2015 to grow the net operating income and stabilizing the development pipelines of both companies. As a result, after the merger, we will maintain the strength of our balance sheet and will be opportunistic when considering alternative sources of capital, including asset sales, additional joint ventures, unsecured debt and common equity to finance the buildout of the development pipeline. As disclosed in our press release, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $1.21 per share to shareholders of record on March 14. The timing of the first quarter dividend is coordinated with BRE's first quarter dividend pursuant to the merger agreement. The board will review any increase to the annual dividend during its February board meeting, and an increase, if any, approved by the board will be effective for the second quarter dividend payment. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I just have -- [indiscernible], I just have one question with regard to kind of the company's philosophy on dispositions, and the forecast for the year looked relatively light compared to volumes that some of your peers have been disclosing of. And if we think about your capital needs broadly and where we are in the pricing cycle on apartment assets, especially in your market, why not dispose of more? What's the rationale for keeping that relatively limited?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. The main rationale is just trying to find the right source for putting capital to work. We tend to be very focused in terms of what we buy or what we build. Therefore, we don't have a large portfolio of assets that we want to dispose of as a general statement. And so we're looking for arbitrage. We're looking for, if we sell these assets, what we do with the money, what's the best source of funding the development pipeline and a variety of things. And we will be become more aggressive at selling assets when that becomes the most favorable source of capital to fund other future activities.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: So effectively, it sounds like the cost of that capital is still too high in your mind?
Michael J. Schall: Exactly.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then I just have one follow-up question for -- maybe, for Erik, and I might have missed this, but what's the occupancy assumption embedded in the revenue forecast for the year?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. It's a range across the portfolio similar to what we experienced in 2013. So I would say, then that goes from the high 95s to the mid 96.5 depending on submarket.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: So am I hearing sort of flattish for the year?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: In aggregate. Okay.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: First question is, as you guys look at the -- as you guys laid out the strategy for this year in integrating BRE, it seems like the core business is sort of business as usual. There is a lot of activity, a lot of investment activity and such. Do you feel like what we're going to see on the core is what we would normally see from core Essex or have you guys sort of -- is your intention to dial it back to make sure that more of the resources are focused on the integration. Just -- and the angle that we are coming at is over the past year or 2, we've seen 1 or 2 situations of company mergers where a part of the operation was dropped as a company acquired or integrated various platforms. So just want to get your take on that.
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. Certainly, we expect to continue with business as usual throughout our portfolio. So we don't expect a drop off. Obviously, we haven't been through this process before. And so there's a certain amount of uncertainty there. But all of us are confident that we will be able to work together to basically continue the business as it's run now. I think, one key factor here is that we are so similar as to geography, as to staffing ratios, as to a lot of the systems and processes that I think it's going to perhaps make this a little bit easier to integrate relative to some of other transactions you are referring to.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And the second question is on Southern California, assuming the other apartment folks that we've heard from were more bullish on Southern California than previously throughout last year. You guys obviously spoke about Orange County and Ventura picking up. Has something occurred more recently in the past few months that people are a little more positive on Southern California? Or it's pretty much consistent with what you guys expected, but the fact that it's now sort of seeming to pickup is just a positive refreshment that everyone is focused on?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. I think there has been some pickup in Southern California in areas, and I didn't comment on San Diego. But we've seen some improvements there as well and spots in Los Angeles. I think it's -- we've always done is tied this to what our economic forecast is or the jobs picture and so, until we see that sustain in the meaningful way. I think it's hard to be too bullish, so we have seen that before where we've have had spurts of -- we think that it has taken off and then it sort of flattens out. So we will see, but right now, we're feeling pretty good.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: So what you've described is sort of broad-based throughout the region. It's not just one industry or one geography. I mean, it seems pretty positive that it should continue, right? Or is your fear that there is something that could derail it?
Erik J. Alexander: That's right. I think it's our view -- across Southern California is positive.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So I don't know to what degree you can respond, but I'll just ask and you can say shut up if you want, but when you kind of started this process and when it became known to everybody in November, December timeframe, a lot of moving -- a lot of things were going on at that time -- didn't envy you with all the moving parts inside and outside of the transaction. But when you look at it now, having a couple of months under your belt, can you say if the merger analysis looks even better to you now or maybe about the same or you're feeling more -- even more confident about the opportunity here?
Michael T. Dance: It's Mike. I think I need to steer clear of that question. I was expecting that someone would ask hypothetical, just general merger related questions, how do we look at things, et cetera, et cetera, which we maybe can venture down that road, but I think anything is related to this merger, we've been told by our attorneys that we are not allowed to discuss [indiscernible].
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I apologize, I won't take it any further then. I guess, maybe, if you could, when you look at the kind of the 3 markets, is there anything specific about Essex or BRE that is a standout in Northern California, Southern California or Seattle, or is it like you said so similar that it's just kind of doubling down on those 3 areas?
Michael J. Schall: Once again it's Mike Schall commenting. I think it's very similar. We made that comment before, that more than half of BRE's communities are located within 2 miles of an Essex community. And so we think that there are a number of positive things that can happen as a result of that, which I outlined on my comments.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, and then when you think about that issue about being so close to one another, the assets, how do you manage situations where one asset wants to do well from a bonus comp perspective and I assume that it's better to have this kind of synergy situation, but there could also be some in-fighting amongst folks, do you -- how do you manage that process, so that it actually is a win-win for everybody? In other words, if one asset is doing well and the other...
Michael J. Schall: It's tough for me to talk about any Essex/BRE type of activity because again our advice is that if it is in the S-4, it's important to put it in the S-4 and everything in the S-4, basically represents the bounds of which we can talk about. So if you want to talk more generically, just talk more generically about the competition in the marketplace between us and someone else [indiscernible].
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, then let's take it there. I don't mean to push too hard on this. I just wanted to see if there could be anything about a general view about how the 2 companies would look once it's all said and done, but...
Michael J. Schall: Okay, let me take a step back because I think, the point -- one of the points in my prepared remarks was intended to address this, that every competitor within the marketplace has a different view of the world. The price optimizer software is a generic statement, approaches it in a number of ways, but there's 100 switches or 1000 switches within that, that allow you to customize how you look at things. Different companies pursue marketing in a variety of different ways and a lot of that is becoming much more sophisticated over time. I think back of 20 years ago when it was a mom-and-a-pop that we're operating a lot of these buildings and it is really very sophisticated set of circumstances now. So everyone is different. And really what our objective is, and I think that the -- yes, this is both generic and very real within the marketplace, is to try to find the right balance of different marketing programs. I know that we excel, for example, at Craigslist. Others excel at other things. Mobile is becoming more important as time goes on and the technology surrounding the web and drawing traffic through the web is changing dramatically. And so our view is that you need to have some scale here to make the investments that you need to make, in order to maximize that marketing effort and the traffic to your buildings. So going back to the original premise, if you are larger organization and you can make the right investments, I think you can draw traffic that some of the smaller organizations that can't afford to make the investments might have. And I think that the other piece of this is, what impact does that have on future investments? Well, our hope here is that the -- on the merger-related call I talked about a 30 basis point sort of average accretion number over our cost of funds. Well, the hope is that if we can drive down our cost that -- between the cost reduction and cost to capital reductions that we can be more competitive with respect to transactions and actually generate more accretion from the investments that we make going forward. So that's the big picture philosophy.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That's perfect. And then just quickly on the joint venture, would you say, I think you probably said this some place, but would you say that the nature of the assets might be on the older, kind of, redevelopment variety or core or some combination?
Michael J. Schall: I can't -- let's see, how do I answer this? You may want to look at some of the 8-K filings that the BRE has made and that will give you some idea.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to narrow in on Seattle for a little bit, again, I think your assets -- BRE's assets are in slightly different markets in Seattle, I'm just kind of giving you comments about supply in Downtown, I was just kind of curious how your kind of thinking about both portfolios and synergies between both going forward, especially in that market?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. Actually, we think that we are very similarly located in Seattle as well. I would agree with you that the downtown has most of the development, and therefore, it has most of the supply coming onto the market, and it will be most affected by that new supply. So in another words, our belief is that the east side and the area surrounding Seattle, the suburban markets will outperform for the next couple of years the downtown. Overall, I think that everything I said earlier about the physical locations, they are very similar. We have significant exposure in the downtown urban market. We also have a significant exposure in the suburban markets. We don't view it as much different.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I was under the impression that BRE had a little bit more downtown exposure, but I might be wrong.
Michael J. Schall: Maybe a little bit more, but again, looking at the broader portfolios, we think they are pretty similar.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just in the guidance for '14, can you talk about what's your development assumption and CapEx, assumption with regard to '14? And also does that change materially with BRE introduced? I'm not asking for specific guidance, but is there -- does that BRE make a significant impact on that, adding that into the portfolio?
Michael T. Dance: Very slightly, but not much. This is Mike Dance. Good question on the CapEx. They are spending very similar amounts for door. So I don't -- of the recurring CapEx, I don't see that changing. And then on a combined basis, the timing of it is a little bit different. Some of their properties are in front of ours and some are behind. So we're not seeing a major change in our results as -- from bringing that on. They do, do some things like straight-lining concessions. We'll probably adopt that accounting policy, that's GAAP. There'll be things like that, that -- we look at accounting practices about companies and pick the practices that are mostly corporate or aligned to GAAP as a part of this process.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, just a clarification there. So you are talking about changing accounting policies to move to a straight-lining as opposed to expensing of concessions upfront, do that -- did I hear that correctly?
Michael T. Dance: Yes, that's correct. So we'll start adopting, that's GAAP, we have that on our list of things that we monitor from a GAAP versus a non-GAAP compliance standpoint. So that is something that we're likely to adopt. As part of the processes that Mike reviewed, we're also going to be reviewing your best practices in accounting policies.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That was -- I also asked about development strategy, I don't think you addressed that for '14, what's on the docket?
John D. Eudy: I didn't understand the question. This is John Eudy, Mike.
Unknown Executive: Development starts for '14.
John D. Eudy: For 2014? Right now, what you see in the S-9 [ph] is, is it. We don't have anything anticipated beyond it. And their portfolio as well. It's possible a couple of their deals -- that I don't want to get into -- we could start, but we can't comment at this time.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. Just Mike, as my follow-up question is right on the [indiscernible] looking at raising JV capital, any change in IRR targets from your joint venture partners at this point?
Michael J. Schall: Mike, this is Mike Schall again. No, I don't think so. In fact, I think, cap rates for the most part have remained within a pretty narrow band over the last year. And I'd say that maybe there is -- there are fewer institutions than maybe there were a year ago that are interested in JV activity, but I don't think the thresholds have changed materially.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brian (sic) [Ryan] Bennett with Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I just wanted to drill down just on the acquisitions of $300 million to $400 million that you mentioned in the release. In turn, I think last call you had talked about some opportunities with developers in your regions for potential acquisitions, I was wondering how that was tracking, whether there are more deals kind of like Slater 116 in pipeline?
Michael J. Schall: Brian, this is Mike Schall. There are deals that are similar to that. I'm not sure that those will be the ones that we are able to do this year. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we will have a Southern California bias this year, and we will try to pick the best funding mechanism for the deal, but I'd say, if anything, it's a Southern California focus and we do run across transactions that were recently developed by someone and they need to be -- they need liquidity and it becomes a great opportunity for us. And in fact, in San Diego, we announced the acquisition of Domain, which is exactly that -- a brand new property, condo-mapped, solid market and a price that we thought was attractive to us. So we continue to see that. I'm not sure how much of that will be -- will represent our $400 million plus or minus in acquisitions this year. I hope it's a lot.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: All right and then in terms of the disposition assets that you might be targeting. Just how does it look in terms of your expectations for NOI growth for those assets and the potential pricing that you get in [ph] transaction markets today versus where your stock is trading at, given, I guess, that you sold some stock around $162 last quarter?
Michael T. Dance: I missed that. I'm sorry, could you repeat one more time, Ryan, sorry about that.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Sure. So I was just wondering how you weighted the acquisition opportunities versus the cost of capital, specifically the assets that you have, potentially lined up for dispositions, how do they look on an NOI growth basis and potential cap rate you could get for those assets versus where your stock is trading at today?
Michael T. Dance: Yes, in terms of where the stock is trading at today, we believe that the co-investment joint venture capital is more attractive. And so we would gravitate there as opposed to issuing more stock and you're right, the stock issuances were at a higher price, which -- that's what we're trying to do. We believe that tracking the different sources of capital, which would include dispositions, JV capital or on balance sheet capital, is sort of fundamental to making money in the business, and those relationships are constantly changing. And so our model for how to acquire is constantly changing depending upon those variables.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. And then last question. I'm not sure, if you'll be able to address this, but in the S-4 filing, I guess, they put out estimates that you guys had had for BRE -- now on 2015 basis, so they look fairly bullish, and I guess, basically, I'm more curious what that kind of a incorporates for your overall view for Southern California in 2015 and what sort of acceleration you guys are thinking about right now. It's, obviously, early, but it looks like you do have some sort of view on the acceleration in those markets?
Michael J. Schall: Again, this is Mike Schall commenting. Our belief is, if you look at the relative relationships from this point going forward, that Southern California is still attractive. If you look at the cost per unit, their relationship between rents in those marketplaces versus the pretty incredible rents that we've seen in the north, we think that there will be an opportunity over the next couple of years to -- for Southern California to do better. We think that Northern California and Seattle, depending upon what happens with the tech world, there will be some deceleration and -- but we also recognize that if tech continues to be as robust as it has been, it still -- we still don't want to discount the possibility that the boom in Northern California and Seattle will continue for several more years. So we're trying to play the best of both worlds. Our overall belief is from a -- just a pure value basis, Southern California represents a better value. And therefore, we will likely focus more of our acquisition time and effort and, ultimately, development on Southern California, all things being equal.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just one question on a totally separate topic. The national press, obviously, has been covering the severe weather in various parts of the country, including the severe drought that you all are experiencing out there. Is that causing you to manage the properties differently or even, perhaps, dictating or adjusting how you think about where to invest in certain submarkets or greater markets?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. I don't know that it changes the way that we manage, other than using the tools that we have developed through resource management, which focuses on consumption. So where we have opportunities to reduce irrigation, for example, we're going to continue to do that. Something like a drought, if there were things put in place that made it more difficult to use or access water, or it costs more, maybe we would do some improvements, capital improvements, consistent with what we've done before. As to investment, I don't think it plays a role in what we are looking at.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Here's an old favorite: any view or any update on where we stand with the rent control across California?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall commenting on this. Really, it's been quiet on the rent control front. And we've done, as I've reported in the past, some things to work with some of the local government entities, the California Apartment Association and a variety of other groups, to try to mediate issues that may come up from time to time. So all is quiet on the rent control front at this point.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Yes, just a point of detail on that. Is that been more of an issue historically in Northern California than Southern California?
Michael J. Schall: No, I would say that it's an issue everywhere in California. Wherever rents are high and housing values are high, and therefore, choice of housing with respect to housing is limited, I think that the political environment is to be -- something that we should be concerned about.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: And then this is a question related to opportunity cost and your time around the BRE transaction. My question is this, is it -- how many times, if at all, have you said, "Come back and see me in 2 or 3 months' time" to your development or redevelopment colleagues?
Michael J. Schall: You mean the one sitting right across to me, Mr. Eudy, for example?
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Yes. I mean, can you -- I mean, I guess, another way of asking the question is, is how much can you continue to run business as usual whilst you're putting all the time and effort you are into moving forward with the BRE merger?
Michael J. Schall: Actually, I will answer that. This is Mike Schall again. We've actually been able to continue, I think, business as usual on the investment side reasonably well through this period of time. I know that we, even though we are -- our 2014 starts will be limited, we have been active in terms of looking at future development sites. And in fact, during the last couple of months, we have committed to pretty significant development on the Peninsula. So we have not abandoned our existing external activities at all from my perspective. Practically speaking, we're all working a lot harder and a lot more hours, I'll give you that. But I think that we're -- yes, we're pretty excited about the opportunities both because this gives us a variety of other portfolio management opportunities, but at the same time, I think with can still remain active in the marketplaces looking at new opportunities. So I don't think it's been a big cost at this point.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So, Erik, I guess for you. Can you talk a bit more about your outlook for San Diego? The market where we've seen, I guess, few head picks there in recent years, and any compare/contrast comments that you can drive for San Diego versus, say, Orange County, and maybe LA too?
Erik J. Alexander: I wouldn't be at all shocked if there are head picks again in San Diego. I think I've ranked the -- those areas in Southern California before about expectations for growth and San Diego was either third or fourth in the comparison. I still like Orange County and Los Angeles the best. Ventura seems to be more stable and growing as of late. We've had good results in the last couple of months in San Diego. But we're going to need continued job growth there that is helpful to maintaining occupancies and lowering availability and driving price. So again, we like San Diego. We've seen some good months. But I'm going to wait to see some more months before I get too excited.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Fair enough. One more. As -- A-property assets tend to underperform; Bs later in the cycle -- something we've seen supported in recent AXIO data. So if you look at your portfolio in the revenue growth outlook for 2014, how are you thinking about the relative performance of your As versus Bs, and where do you think that gap can be most meaningful or most wide? How does that potentially play into your thoughts on [indiscernible] activity?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. Our belief has not changed from many years. And our belief is that when the economy goes south, people make a more conservative choice which -- and as things pick up, they decide to be less conservative and they rent more A-quality-type units. So we think that, that has mostly played itself out, and we think that the Bs represent the value proposition within the apartment space, and ultimately will -- they have a strong position in all markets. So we still believe that well-located B property is -- will represent most of what the company will focus on, and it will from time to time focus on As, principally through development, and we think that, that's an attractive mix.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. And one last one on that, if I may. Have you talked about... Maybe I missed it. I joined a bit late. But spot cap rates in your core markets for As and Bs today or during -- in recent weeks?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike again, Haendel. We have not -- we did not discuss that. I don't think cap rates have changed materially over the last year. I think that A quality product in very solid markets is still in the 4 to 4.25 cap rate range. And B, well-located B quality property are in the 4.75-plus or minus cap rate range, and then lesser quality, lesser locations are above that.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: To what extent does this merger process cause you to reevaluate your existing portfolio? I was unclear on the points made earlier on JV conversations if you're considering including your existing assets in those conversations as well?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. At the Investor Day discussion, we talked about looking at the portfolio really in 3 components. The -- sort of the irreplaceable component, others call that gold. We have variety of different ways to refer to this. Then we have the middle category, which is we call it tradable at a price. And we have then the final piece, which is, we need to sell these assets eventually. It doesn't mean we are necessarily going to sell them any time in the near future. And we continue to look at the company the same way, whether or not we're a bigger portfolio. And so we're going to look at those components. Roughly, say, 40% to 45% we think is irreplaceable and around 40% is tradable. So we will look at the portfolio irrespective of whether it was an Essex asset or a BRE asset or any other asset with the one difference that Prop 13 is a material consideration in all transactions that we look at. So I don't think it changes how we'd look at world at all. We've talked about -- and again, at the Investor Day, we talked about the possibility of additional joint ventures as it relates to the well-located properties that are maybe a little bit higher cap rate assets. And we'll continue to look at that. But I wouldn't expect any dramatic change. We're not going to go out and joint venture a huge part of the company by any means. And we're just trying to look at what the right portfolio of management is. It will be applied to both companies.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And the second question is: Although we have seen some M&A over the last year, I believe that portfolios have been on the same revenue management platforms. Can you talk in general terms, if you'd like, about transitioning a large portfolio on the LRO to YieldStar?
Michael J. Schall: I don't think that the technology provider is really the key to that. I think the key is, what I refer to in the first of the 5 points that become priorities going forward, is reconciling the entire process from what is the desired availability level at different points throughout the year; what are -- what's the relation between traffic and the number of units that you have net to lease; and therefore, what is the right renewal process. So it's really a holistic approach to all the components. And I think that the technology is more the delivery mechanism than it is the strategy. Again, there's 1,000 switches within both and you can customize whatever you want out of them. So I don't think -- I think the technology organizes the data and allows a good conversation between the price-optimizing people and the people that are active in the local marketplace and the people that are meeting with the customer. But it don't think it's in and of itself that's where the key is.
Operator: We will take one additional question from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: At your Investor Day in November, you guided to annual same-store revenue growth of 4% to 6% for the next 3 years. How should we think about that relative to 2014 guidance of 5% to 6.2% with the top-end range above that initial range?
Michael J. Schall: It's Mike Schall. I think we'll both agree that we have greater confidence in the year that's right before us than we do in the out year. So if you get further away from those numbers, that -- some changes could happen, and we're not sure what to expect. We presented a scenario at the Investor Day that if we end up getting decent but not great GDP growth and decent but not great job growth, that we could sustain somewhere in that 4% to 6% range throughout that period of time. Part of that belief is based on the relatively good recent outcome and information with respect to income growth and rent to median income, which we view as a core metric. So I think that if we get the same growth that we had in 2013, that we believe continues into 2014, if we continue to see those same relationships, I don't see anything on the supply side that's going to interrupt that. I would expect a similar year in 2015, if that all happens. But remember, I mean, we have less confidence as we get further out from 2014.
Operator: We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to move floor back over to management for any concluding comments.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator. In closing, we'd like to thank you for joining the call and appreciate your interest in the company. We expect to have a busy and yet rewarding 2014. And we look forward to the closing of the merger in our call with you next quarter. Thanks again. Good day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may now begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. We wish you all a safe and pleasant Halloween. As usual, Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I'll cover 3 topics on the call: First, brief comments on our Q3 results; second, notable items related to development; and third, preliminary market expectations for 2014. So onto the first topic, our Q3 results. We are very pleased to announce another strong quarter, where which we reported core FFO of $1.91 per share. That result was $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range that was provided in connection with our second quarter call. Growth in Northern California and Seattle and improvement in Southern California were obvious contributors to the results. Erik will comment further about these operating trends. Onto the second topic, notes on development. We are also pleased with the results at our lease-up communities. Since the June opening of our Epic community in North San Jose, we have leased 265 of the 280 apartments in Phase I, an average pace of 66 apartments per month, roughly double our plan. In August, Connolly Station, which is located adjacent to the West Dublin BART station was available for initial occupancy. We have now leased 166 apartment homes or a pace of 83 apartments per month, roughly twice as fast as planned. We formed a new co-investment entity and started construction at our Village community in Downtown Walnut Creek. The Village includes 49 luxury condo-mapped apartments averaging over 1,600 square feet and 35,000 square feet of retail space in the Downtown retail core of Walnut Creek. This property is adjacent to the Broadway Plaza Mall, which is the premier shopping destination in the East Bay. At our recently completed Expo community in Seattle, we received LEED Gold Certification and we're selected as the national finalist for Best Green Building by the National Homebuilders Association in its Pillars of the Industry Awards. In contrast to these recent results, our development strategy causes us to be less aggressive as we progress through the economic cycle. As a result, we continue to lower our development exposure as a target, which is subject to change, we believe that our pro rata share of annual development deliveries will range from $150 million to $250 million going forward. That is beyond the pipeline that's shown in the supplement. Then onto my third topic, which is market outlook for 2014. Page S-16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply demand assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2014. This is not necessarily the rent growth estimated for the Essex portfolio, but rather represents the primary economic input into our 2014 budgeting process. I have a few comments related to the information on Page S-16 as follows. Number one, Seattle multifamily supply is expected to be up about 20% from 2013 and should peak in 2014. Even considering the expected strong job growth, we expect market rent growth to slow to about 5.4% in 2014. Given greater concentration of supply in the Downtown, we believe that the East Side will produce the best rent growth. Second comment. We expect the continued limited supply of for-sale housing in the coastal California markets, which means that overall housing supply, that is both apartments and for-sale, will average about 0.7% of housing stock in Northern California and about 0.5% in Southern California. Thus, we believe the aggregate housing demand will continue to exceed supply in coastal California. And third comment. We expect Southern California to continue its slow improvement, slightly outperforming the nation in terms of job growth, but with limited supply. Our average market rent growth of 4.7% in Southern California compares to the actual revenue growth in the same property portfolio for the 9 months ended September 30 of 4.2%. Thank you for joining us. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. Essex enjoyed another solid quarter in operations as the Bay Area and Seattle continued to record strong economic growth, which resulted in healthy demand throughout the period. Leasing activity met or exceeded expectations in all of our markets, highlighted by strong renewal activity, low turnover and solid schedule rent growth. For the quarter, renewal rates grew 5.8% over expiring rates and continued that trend into October. With lower volume we expect in November and December renewal rates to be similar given the offers extended to residents. Turnover for the quarter and through October continues to be in line with expectations, and we project the annual rate of turn to be just over 50%. We have seen limited impact from move outs due to home purchase as this metric fell to 10% of all move outs during the quarter. These factors, along with economic rent growth, led to a sequential gain in scheduled rent of 2.4% for the quarter. This is the highest sequential growth since 2008. We are also poised for a good fourth quarter as occupancy stands at 96.3%, with only 5.4% net availability. However, we do not expect to reach the highs that were achieved last year due to a planned increase in interior renovation activity. Now I'll share some highlights for each region, beginning with Seattle. As more new buildings come to market in the region, everyone has a watchful eye on supply. Many of these deliveries are in the downtown submarket, and we have witnessed a decline in competitor absorption rate. Concessions also increased downtown during the quarter, consistent with rapid lease-up strategies. We expect this trend to continue into the first part of 2014 when demand traditionally rebounds. There have been expected seasonal declines in economic rent outside of the CBD, but no additional pressure on pricing due to concessions on the east side, north or south end, where 80% of our portfolio is located. We still expect these submarkets to perform better than the Downtown next year. Employment growth in the region improved to 2.8% during the quarter, well above the national average. And office absorption remained strong with 630,000 square feet leased during the quarter and 2.6% of total stock has been leased year-to-date. In Northern California, it continues to lead the way for Essex with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. In fact, new lease transactions in the division have averaged more than $2,000 every month since May, and average renewal increases reached 8% during September. August year-over-year job growth was over 2% in the region and once again was led by the San Jose submarket, which posted 3.1% growth. Office leasing and development continues to be brisk in all parts of the Bay Area, which creates job now and allows for continued employment expansions in the future. One of the more significant projects in the region, the $2 billion Transbay Terminal, continues on schedule and remains a catalyst for development in the vicinity, with approximately 3 million square feet of office space under construction, including the 1.3 million square foot Transbay Tower. So in Seattle and San Jose, our big brothers, it's hard to impress, but Southern California continues to enjoy steady growth. Market rates inched up during the period, and we made modest gains in occupancy. However, renewal activity remained healthy and has been above 4% since May. Overall job growth in Los Angeles improved to 1.4% during August. In Orange County, job growth remains above 2%. It is also worth noting that unemployment in Orange County has fallen to 6.2%. San Diego and Ventura remained steady and we have not experienced any negative impacts due to military activity. In fact, our exposure to military residents in San Diego remains below 13%. Commercial development and leasing activity remained relatively low throughout the region. But leasing on the west side of Los Angeles remains very strong, and industrial vacancy in Orange County is the lowest level in the country, with less than 5% of space available for lease. Economic and rental conditions remain strong and we are in good shape to deliver year-end results consistent with our guidance. Thank you for your time, and I will now turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide color on the quarterly results, the 2013 guidance and our balance sheet position. Our same-property operating results continue to beat our expectations, and we have raised the midpoint of our guidance for revenues and net operating income by 10 basis points to 6.1% and 7.3%, respectively. During the quarter, consolidated net operating income results were offset by the $1.2 million in vacancy, which occurred during the renovation of 623 apartment homes during the quarter and from a fire that unfavorably impacted results by over $300,000. In addition, our share of the lease-up dilution during the third quarter from the Connolly and Essex development joint ventures was approximately $600,000. Moving to the change in guidance related to promote income. We have only 2 properties comprising 165 apartment units that are unsold from the Fund II portfolio. To date, we have returned all the limited partners' original capital and have distributed most of their preferred returns. Fund II promote income will be recognized in 2014 with the disposition of the 2 remaining assets. The decision to postpone the disposition was to capture some of the 7% to 9% loss to lease onto the rent roll and to reduce the prepayment penalties on the mortgages securing these assets. We will provide an update on the timing and estimates of the promote income after we begin the marketing process next year. I will conclude with comments on our financial position. As of September 30, we have over $600 million in capacity on our own secured lines of credit. Marketable securities and cash equivalents exceed $140 million. And in November, we will receive $55 million from the repayment of loans we made to our Wesco III joint venture. Our debt maturities through the end of 2015 are only $133 million and, as noted on S-9, our percentage share of development commitments are less than $300 million. At our Investor Day next month, we will share our 3-year plan for deploying our resources to achieve sector-leading shareholder returns. That ends my formal remarks, and I will now return the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Can you talk more about what you're seeing in Southern California and when you could expect to see the same-store growth actually cross over and exceed Northern California and Seattle?
Michael J. Schall: This is Mike. That is a good question and I think it, I think, has perplexed us for many years. We're originally expecting Southern California to recover more similarly to the North, and that, of course, hasn't happened for a variety reasons. Number one, just the composition of the labor markets in Southern California is different. Southern California is much more like the nation -- when you look at the components, it doesn't have the tech influence that we have in the North. And so, it's had a much more muted recovery. I think also another factor, especially in San Diego, if you look at job growth over the last year, has been a little disappointing. I think that's somewhat sequester-related and in some of the other areas. So I would say that it will be at least 2015 or 2016 before the crossover point is achieved.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: All right. I think you mentioned that you're cutting back on development strategy, becoming less aggressive at this point in this cycle. When you're actually penciling development fields today, what kind of spread do you need to see between expected initial yield and transaction cap rates?
Michael T. Dance: We measure it in a number of different ways. Essentially, we want to see about a 20% premium to the development cap rate measured with rent in place today relative to an acquisition-type cap -- or the similar quality acquisition cap rate. If we are able to minimize the development risk, which means to us trying to time the land close and start of construction within a very short period of time as opposed to holding land banking effectively for a longer period of time. So for the land bank type situations, we'd want a higher yield to compensate us for the additional risk.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And so for the new starts this quarter, what initial yields are you targeting?
Michael T. Dance: I think everything that we're targeting, everything we're looking at is -- and John Eudy is here, he may want to add to this -- is somewhere in the 5% to 5.25% cap rate range, again, measured on rents in place today. We would think that, that would stabilize somewhere in the 6% to 6.25% range. Having said that, the other thing that we're all looking at is the permit data and there's a lot of permits being pulled. It's our belief that they're not all going to immediately go into the construction pipeline because a lot of them fail to meet the criteria that the investors require and the lenders require. And so, I think that it's going to be, even though you're seeing quite a few permits being pulled, I think that they're to be delivered over several years. I don't think that they're all going to get started, which is possibly one moderating factor as it relates to Seattle, because it's got a lot of for-sale and apartment permits being pulled and a pretty robust development pipeline through '14.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: The first question I have has to do with your sort of market forecast that you provided in the back of the supplemental. And I'm just wondering, I know you guys produce this from some third-party sources, is there a specific relationship in your mind between supply forecast and then the rent forecast? In other words, if we see multifamily supply go up by 1% in your markets and jobs go up by 0.5% from where they are, do you calculate a specific rent impact or is that sort of separate from those functions in some way?
Michael J. Schall: No, we absolutely do. I mean, again, this is the input into our budgeting process and we try to estimate really forward 3 to 5 years what we expect rent growth to be based on these variety of inputs. And it really starts with the U.S. economic assumptions of GDP growth, 2.8% for '14 is what we are assuming and job growth at 1.8%, and we'd look at historical trends. If the U.S. is going to 1.8%, what will typically happen, what do we expect to happen within each of these MSAs with respect to job growth. And then internally, we take job growth, try to predict what that means for household formations, subtract out effectively the for-sale component because we know that for-sale is going to essentially all be occupied. And whatever is left over is the rental demand and we compare that against the rental supply, and that's how we do it. And we have a -- I mean, it's more sophisticated than that, and we're not going to share our methodology as it relates to rent forecast. But absolutely, it's what we try to do, and that's why we present this. We had a discussion about whether we should drop it this quarter or this year given the actual metrics and others do a pretty good job at this stuff. We decided to leave it in because it's the -- it is effectively trying to define the scenario that we think is going to happen for 2014, because -- let's say, if we're completely wrong, let's say, job growth goes from -- the U.S. goes from 1.8% to minus 5%, then we will miss these numbers, I can assure you, but the scenario changed. So we're trying to create a consistent scenario, try to communicate what that is to the investment community. And then if we hit these numbers as to the U.S. assumptions, we would expect to be pretty darn close as it relates to the market forecast.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: So I hope you keep it in because it's quite useful for us. And without getting too specific on formulas, relative to the market forecast, what's the most sensitive of variables? Is it supply or employment or the GDP underpinning [ph] guidance?
Michael J. Schall: Well, as it relates to the U.S. economic assumptions, it's all very sensitive. I mean, the whole thing rolls together. If the U.S. does much better, I would expect it to -- essentially, all arising tide lifts all boats in effect, and I would expect that to happen. The same is true on the downside. So again, it would be almost impossible for apartments, and it's not just us, it's everyone, for apartments to do really well in a rotten economy, you've all seen that a bunch of times. So we're trying to demonstrate the relativity of how these numbers relate to one another. Our -- what we're ultimately looking for are inflection points of rents, both -- in each direction. And we're trying to predict -- we know that pricing power increases as market occupancy increases. So at 95%, you have x amount of pricing power at 96%, 97%, you build that and it has a pretty significant effect on rents. So using historical relationships, using our experience in these marketplaces, we're trying to understand those variables and then predict what's going to happen to this inflection point as it relates, certainly, to Southern California and try to predict when that's going to happen and invest accordingly.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then just one last detail question, and forgive me if I missed it earlier. Turnover ticked down, which was sort of counterintuitive compared to some other reports we've seen from the space. And in particular, Seattle was down quite a bit. Is that really a function of the widening affordability gap to housing? Is it perhaps that rent increases were more modest than they could have been? What's your sense for that turnover rate change?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes. This is Erik. I mean, they're essentially flat. And again, I think we attributed it to a couple of things that you mentioned. One is the location or composition of the portfolio, but also, the renewable strategy as we've talked about before, and Mike has advocated for smart profits. We restrain ourselves when it comes to sending out the increases and voluntarily cap those at 10%. And I think that's appreciated by our customers, and we see a good conversion rate.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Mike, lowering the development exposure going forward, is it due to lack of opportunity, falling returns on the stuff that you're seeing, higher construction costs, some sort of view of increasing risk? Can you sort of help handicap the sort of components there that are sort of driving a bit of a pullback?
Michael J. Schall: Sure, of course. All the above would be the answer. Deals, I think, are having trouble hitting the market acceptance point as it relates to cap rate, that's partially because construction costs have increased somewhere around 10% in the last year. Rents in Northern California, for example, are now 45% plus or minus higher than the low in the Great Recession. And so you've had a huge amount of rent growth already that have been booked. It would be, I think, erroneous to assume you're going to see that from this point forward over the next several years. So the return element is part of it, and part of it is its cost of capital as well. So I think every component has worked against us as it relates to the development side, and it just made deals more difficult to pencil. And again, John's here. John, you could talk about all the number of deals you look at, which -- John is looking at a ton of stuff. He was -- it wasn't that long ago, John was talking about triage, setting up a triage process for deals because there were so many coming in, in the door, so -- but not very many of them hit our thresholds. And so I think it's partially the market and partially our view of the opportunity and partially what's happened with the stock, which essentially we're at the same price now that we were at 18 months ago, yet we -- what our FFO core -- FFO per share was 20% growth last year and pretty healthy this year. So it's really all of those factors. We're looking for the spread between what we're buying or building and what is embedded in the stock, and we got to see a positive impact as a result of that as our core objective. And we become more aggressive when we see that being very exciting and less aggressive when we see it being less exciting. John, do you want to comment on the deals still out there? I know you're looking at a lot of stuff.
John D. Eudy: There's a -- continue to be a number of opportunities, but we've gone to the phase of the cycle where it goes from the wholesale side to the retail side and it's much harder to justify, I think, given the risk that development does bring to the table. That said, there are opportunistic deals that will pop in once in a while, but if you were to state today's land price and the increased cost of construction relative to future rent growth, it's more difficult for us to justify it. We're now probably predicting that we have our portfolio exposure that we are at now, a year from now, if you were to make an educated guess. As far as the pipeline we have currently, the 11 deals that we have under construction, most of those were formulated and decided on in 2010 and '11. And that's basically the answer. And I can say that the delivery execution on the cap rates of everything that will be stabilized during the next 12 months is in the 6% to 6.5% range. So hopefully, that answers your question.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. I mean, given those comments, what's the redevelopment opportunity left in the portfolio today in terms of dollars that you guys figure that you want to spend over the next couple of years? And do you accelerate some of that to replace some of the external growth from development?
Michael J. Schall: I have John Burkart to answer that. But to create a little context, you may all recall that we didn't do very much redevelopment prior to the Great Recession. And then during the Great Recession, we pretty much ceased that activity altogether, which means that we've got a pretty significant opportunity, which I'll have Mr. Burkart talk about. John?
John F. Burkart: Yes, absolutely. This is John. We'll go into it in a little more depth in the Investor Day. But as you can see, we've increased our unit turns dramatically. We're up over 75% year-over-year. It will increase them more into 2014. We're also increasing a number of larger full renovation or revitalizations that we're working on. The opportunity is pretty substantial across the portfolio. We'll probably be doing somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,200 unit turns next year, up from maybe 1,200 a year ago. And we'll keep it -- it will continue at that level for many years across the portfolio.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: What does that represent? What is 2,200 units roughly ballpark on a dollar value, of incremental capital out the door?
John F. Burkart: The average unit turns, what we're doing is somewhere around $22,000 a unit. We're doing a little different than most of our peers. Most of our peers kind of do a fluff and buff with the apartment with appliances and carpets. We tend do a more full-unit turn where we're scraping the ceilings, doing the counters, hard counters, new cabinets, opening up walls, et cetera. So we're near around $22,000 a unit.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. Mike Dance, core versus NAREIT FFO in the fourth quarter, is there anything that you guys have already identified that's going to call the gap there?
Michael T. Dance: NAREIT, meaning the First Call consensus?
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Yes, the reported. I mean, the difference between core and reported. Is there anything that's already impacted or is going to impact that you guys know about that's driving a gap there?
Michael T. Dance: No. Just acquisition cost is the only recurring difference.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then lastly, Mike, given your comments about capital, et cetera, any tolerance or desire at this point for a Fund III?
Michael J. Schall: We -- it is something that we are considering and working on, and we haven't made a final decision at this point in time. Up to this point, we've chosen to go into smaller commitments of equity capital with a couple of specific partners. And we like that format because we can take a chunk of money at $50 million, $100 million in equity and we can dedicate our -- the next couple of deals to that equity and then make another decision about whether we're better off growing on balance sheet or in the fund format. Having said that, Fund III has some advantages as well and we are considering it, and there's a reasonable possibility that, that will come to fruition.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Just -- my question was just related to development. You're coming a little bit less aggressive on -- just given the headwinds there. Do you foresee more opportunities like the Slater 116 or the preferred investment that you made during the quarter as some of these developers look to exit deals instead of more attractive return opportunity for you?
Michael J. Schall: That's a good question, and we're looking at everything. We have seen opportunities to buy new buildings that were produced by merchant builders throughout our marketplace. And it all depends on cap rate and cost of capital and risk associated with the development deal, and so we continue to do both. We are working on preferred equity deals that have a development component. We completed one last quarter, and it provides very interesting financing solution for a developer that has permitted deal ready to go that works for us and works for them. So yes, we're -- I think we've covered the gamut as it relates to how we approach the development process. We will do presales. We will do direct development. We will do preferred equity transactions on apartments, but only those that we want to own at the end of the day.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. And I know it would differ developer by developer, but any sense on -- generally, what kind of bogey they're looking for in terms of a profit margin from their development yields, what they would sell it at?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, and it runs the gamut. We have a deal. The Avery in the Valley Village district of L.A., that was -- they wanted to take out and so that was priced at a little bit higher cap rate because we were -- we went through effectively the development of the construction process with them. Slater was a situation. We bought it effectively empty and are going through the lease-up ourselves, some preferred equity transactions that are -- will close typically around the time that we have everything lined up and ready to go. And they're all priced a little bit differently. In our view, we don't look at the development world as, "Hey, this is our cap rate threshold." It's really a cap rate or really a spread over an acquisition cap rate and risk discussion, what risks are we taking on and then how are we going to price that risk appropriately in the portfolio. So as I can't tell you that there's 1 or 2 formats that we're using. It really gets into a negotiation where we're trying to come to a thoughtful approach to risk and reward.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Understood, appreciate the color. And last question for me, just specifically in terms of your Epic project. Is it your sense that other lease-ups in that Northern San Jose submarkets that are going on right now have been as successful? Or was it primarily specific to Epic in terms of the location within the submarket or the price points?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. All of the competitors have reported successful lease-up activity. So again, I think this is a function, the 3% plus job growth, a quality location, accessibility to jobs. And all of the competitors have very nice products with amenity packages. So again, we're very pleased with the -- the overall submarket is strong and we continue to see it going that way.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jeffrey Pehl with Goldman Sachs.
Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering if -- to get a sense on how much of your portfolio could potentially be converted to condos.
John F. Burkart: Yes. This is John Burkart speaking. We've got -- I'll kind of break it up into Pacific Northwest and California but California is a little bit different. It's somewhere between impossible. It's very, very, very hard to actually take an apartment property that was built apartments with -- without legal condo rights to convert it. And so the value of that conversion is pretty significant and the -- or the value of going condo is pretty significant, has a map on it and it's just not very easy to do. So we have probably in the neighborhood of 6,000 units in California. That's our -- condo maps on them, they have a legal right to sell those condos. In the Pacific Northwest, it's not that way. It's more like the rest of the U.S., where the opportunity, if the property is well-located, it fits the economic interest, you could convert it into condo. So that really impacts the whole portfolio out there. But the value is much greater in California for the 6,000 units.
Michael J. Schall: And I believe John is going to spend some time at the Investor Day talking about that subject.
John F. Burkart: Yes, absolutely.
Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then also, I believe, in the beginning of the call, you mentioned that the Village was condo mapped in your development projects. Are there any development projects in California that are condo mapped?
Unknown Executive: [indiscernible]
Michael J. Schall: In our development pipeline?
Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Michael J. Schall: Basically, all of them, except -- all of them, excuse me. I thought I had one exception. We've got maps on everyone. The Hudson and Dylan have a map, but they're going to be restricted because of the affordability requirement for several years. I would exclude them for that reason. If having a map is one of the pieces of the development equation. If we are -- we pretty much map everything that we...
Unknown Executive: Yes, exactly.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, it's an important consideration at the development process. So, yes.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Can you comment on the transaction market and if you've noticed any change in the third quarter?
Michael J. Schall: Transaction market is evolving. I think that in Q3, you saw interest rates spike, and the stock prices, certainly, the REITs were affected and -- but I still believe, as I said in the last call, that the institutional bid was pretty significant. You may not have had as many institutions participating in the acquisition program. And they were pretty focused on A locations, A properties, let's say. But you had enough of them that I think cap rates were relatively unaffected. Where you saw a little bit of an increase in cap rates was as you got away from the A product and A location, where you were dealing with a more of an entrepreneurial buyer. And you had the situation where Fannie and Freddie not only were -- that we had interest rate increase, you also had margin increases on Fannie and Freddie debt. So I think that those forces have moderated as we have gone through September and October and are less so. Although there is just a little bit of uncertainty about what's happening, because there haven't been that many transactions, and so we don't really know exactly what's happening. We know that we are -- on our own activities, we've had to fight harder for deals just because cost of capital has become a much bigger issue of late than it has been over the last 3 or so years. So we've had to try to pick our spots and find good opportunities where we can. It is -- but as a general statement, it's much more difficult than it has been in prior years. And I think that probably continues unless interest rates continue to go down, which we don't expect, and when the stock price rallies, which we don't really expect either. So hopefully, that answers your question.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then maybe specifically on the last 2 assets in Fund II, did you market those and feel that potential buyers weren't giving credit for the loss to lease? Or was that just something internally you decided to wait before putting them on the market?
John F. Burkart: Yes. This is John speaking. We had those assets on the market and during the turbulence of the interest rate move and the sellers did -- what the buyers did was one would expect -- try to come up back for prices and we didn't think that was justified. So we pulled them off the market to take advantage of the continued strength of the market and decided to remarket them into '14.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just some quick questions here. First, let me start with Mr. Dance. Just on expenses, year-to-date, yes, they're up 4.3%, which is really driven by taxes being up 6.8%. On the last call, you guys spoke about how even with Prop 13, when property values decline, you get to move those taxes down. But as property values recover, then that -- the taxes get bought -- brought back to trend. So given year-to-date, the taxes for you guys are up 6.8%. Do you feel like you're back to trend and -- well, you're not providing '14 guidance. Should we think about -- now that we're this much closer to next year, should we think about sort of a similar increase? Or are -- basically, the tax is back to trend, in which case, that should moderate?
Michael T. Dance: Seattle, we are actually getting higher assessed values. Year-over-year, they're coming in kind of mid-teens again. So we're still waiting to hear what the levy rates are going to be in Seattle. So we are seeing continued property tax pressure in Seattle. We do have some properties in California that are still below their Prop 13 values, so we are expecting some increases. So yes, I think expense -- we're expecting expenses about 3.5% this year. We're still working on the budget. I hope we can bring it under that, but we're still working on that. So it's a little bit early to tell. We'll have that number ready for you at the Investor Day.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. But Mike, as far as the California goes, is it just a very few assets that are still below Prop 13?
Michael T. Dance: Yes, California will probably be closer to 2%.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay, okay. The next question, and George is not in the phone, so I guess Mike, you'll have to take it. You guys have done the stock buyback thing before, although you guys seem to -- historically, when you've done it, it's more targeted, meaning that you'll buy the stock one quarter and then a few quarters later, you may dribble back out with the ATM, depending on how the stock has performed. Right now, you're one of the few apartment -- well, you're one of the few REITs in general that's still trading above NAV, which is -- kudos to you guys. But just a question. When you guys historically look back and evaluate where you have bought back stock, do you feel and does George feel that it's been a good use of capital versus your other opportunities, whether it's development, acquisitions, mezz [ph] or preferred equity investments?
Michael J. Schall: Every scenario is a little bit different. As a general rule, we felt that given the weakness in the stock through the summer and into the fall that we wanted to essentially reset the share buybacks. So we took it to the Board in September. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about what prices we talked about. But we want to have that ability out there. And I think that everyone from the Board, from the Chairman of the Board, George, on down, believes in the same concept, which is we have a stock that is representative, a fractional interest in 160-some-odd properties and we can invest in a number of different ways, and we're looking for a net spread. And where we see that, whether it's running the machine in forward or reverse, it doesn't really much matter to us. Although, share buybacks get into leveraging issues as you're going to double leverage if you're using your line and/or some other balance sheet considerations. So I don't want to talk specifically about our exact criteria. But we absolutely believe that there's a price at which the best opportunity would be buying the stock back.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, you guys extended one of your preferred investments but reduced the rates from 13% to 9%. Just sort of curious, was there an opportunity to get this property? Or do you just figure that you had excess capital and therefore, extending it an extra year, you still were able to pick up a pretty healthy spread to your cost of capital?
Michael J. Schall: I mean, it was more related to when it was originally -- it originated, the markets were different for that type of investment and the market was highly illiquid. This is -- I don't remember exactly when it was. Mike, do you remember? Was it 2009, '10? Somewhere in that timeframe. And essentially, the transaction had the ability to refinance us out. And so, I look at it more like a restructure. We look at the market in place today. The asset has appreciated significantly in value. So we're in a different part of the capital stack. And the market for that type of investment has compressed relative to what it was when the original deal was originated. So essentially, we were going to lose a deal and we decided that we're better off essentially restructuring the deal as opposed to letting it pay off.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Going back to the renewal rate growth, you mentioned, I think, it was 5.8% this quarter. And that was higher than what you're getting earlier this year when it was closer to 5%. How should we think about your ability to push renewal notices even higher going forward since you're not facing increased turnover, you've been capping rent increases at 10%, as you mentioned earlier. It seems like that -- the ability to push renewals higher going forward could be a possibility here?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes. This is Erik. I think there are select opportunities maybe to push a little bit further, certainly not at this point in the year. As I said, our expectations are kind of being in that 5.5% to 5.8% for the next 3 months. We do expect economic rent growth. We expect the loss to lease to grow, so there will be opportunities in some of these submarkets to move that up a little bit. We are cautious. We're delivering new supply. The last thing we want to do is get people thinking about moving down the street and taking advantage of somebody's 1-month or 6-week free offer. So we look at these case by case and handle the strategy accordingly.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And can we get the new lease rate growth for the quarter?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, you can. Let me get back to you in a second there.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then I guess just the one last question is, I mean, at what point do you -- I mean, do you ever revisit that policy of capping rate increases at 10%? Or are you at the point now where you're getting more notices out that are closer to 10% than you have in the past year?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes. I mean, I think we're constantly monitoring it. But again, given people's individual agendas and their move out and our opportunity to mark markets in many cases, we still feel like we're being responsible and getting the results overall that we would like to see and leave opportunity on the table. So right now, we're satisfied with the policy.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So curious on, I guess, on the asset acquired in Seattle, the one of 40% occupied. Was there an operational issue behind the developer's decision to sell and is there a greater opportunity with that specific developer?
Michael J. Schall: There are some other opportunities with that developer, and we have certainly met with them and told them that we would love to have some kind of relationship with them, so it's not just a single one-off deal. Having said that, those concepts are difficult because every deal is different and everything changes and there's no assurance that we're going to necessarily be interested in the next deal, nor that we're going to be the high bidder. So as a REIT, remember your -- that our cost of capital is the key consideration and so if our cost of capital is out of whack, we could get outbid by someone else fairly easily and we accept that. And we acknowledge that as being just something that happens. As to whether there were some unique condition that caused us to get this deal, I don't think so. I think it was -- we would rather go through the lease-up ourselves as a general statement because then we can control the quality of the people that we bring in. We can control their credit statistics and we can make sure that it's populated with the right people for the long-term benefit of the company. So as a general statement, we have a fairly strong preference to do our own lease-up. But beyond that, I don't think there was anything unique about the situation.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you. Can you help us understand how you underwrote that acquisition, both in terms of in-place and stabilized NOI, and what type of, say, IRR are you expecting there?
Michael J. Schall: I don't have those numbers in front of me. We typically capitalize the expense of a lease-up as a deal cost, so we're going to look at the stabilized yield on the deal. And so again, assuming the lease-up cost is a capitalized addition to the purchase price, and we'll look at the economic stabilization and then we will want to be paid for something, I don't remember exactly how much, for the -- for doing the lease-up, since that's probably the riskiest component of one of these transactions. So that's how we approach it. And again, we're risk reward-driven and we actually like adding value. If we can get a little bit higher cap rate and we add some value and some of our staffing capabilities to a transaction, we think that's a good thing. We will generally like to do that. And I think it's kind of win-win. We get a better tenant base as a result of doing a lease-up and the developer is not faced with doing something that they may not be incredibly good at.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And so as far as the underwritten -- or the yield that you were expecting, any range you can provide there?
Michael J. Schall: I think [ph] we want to go -- I think that the typical IRR -- unlevered IRR for that type of transaction is somewhere in the 8% to 8.5% range. I don't remember the specifics for this deal, but it's somewhere in that range.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. One more, if I may. I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but the third quarter acquisitions were done on a wholly-owned basis and not through the JV. And I think last quarter, you mentioned that acquisitions near-term would be mostly through your Wesco JV. So I guess the question is, are you precluded from acquiring non-stabilized assets through that JV or there was [ph] not interest in -- from a partner or some other REIT?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. No. As I said before, we are committing relatively small chunks of capital. And when we commit capital with -- in a co-investment format, then we're going to dedicate our deal flow to the co-investment program. And so in these cases, I don't remember specifically why, but I think that we were outside that commitment period. And for whatever reason, the deals didn't work. I think one of them was under 100 units. So small unit size is one of the criteria that might cause us to do something on the balance sheet, which I think was actually the case in this situation.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Mike, if I recall correctly, you also look at the other markets throughout the U.S. when you're looking at your market forecast and everything else. Just curious as to what you would expect across the U.S. as a whole in terms of market rent growth at '14, how the West Coast markets compare to that?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. We do have been relying on AXIOMetrics in a lot of these cases since we don't have direct knowledge. I mean, I would say that our interest in tracking other markets is defensive in nature. In other words, if another market is going to dramatically beat the West Coast and we certainly want to know it and would want to consider it at some level. So acknowledging -- notwithstanding the fact that it will be incredibly challenging to enter a new market. So as a general statement, we think that the West Coast lags the national recovery by a couple of years and our recession was worse, as a general statement, than both the nation. And so we still believe that the West Coast is the place to be. Having said that, there are markets out there that are doing quite well. And we're not going to go to the energy market, let's say, just because we are concerned about the cost of for-sale housing alternatives. Cheaper for-sale housing is a concern to us. So that eliminates a number of the energy market that have strong job growth that will have an inexpensive for-sale housing option, and home builders will do what they do pretty effectively, we think. I mean, obviously, Boston is a great market. It's in the AXIO top 10 and there are other good markets around. But as a general statement, if you look at our geography and you look at our -- the position of our portfolio, we think we're well-positioned for the future and of course, this is where -- we know every corner and every neighborhood and so we've got a certain value-add here that we wouldn't have somewhere else.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Well, that's encouraging. Second question. You talked a little bit about asset pricing, but I'm more curious to get your expectations over the next 12 months as to where asset pricing goes, given the boom we've seen in the 10 year and some of the pent-up growth, this -- the recovery has already occurred. And then also, in light of that, how does that impact your decision on asset recycling now that you've wrapped up Fund II [ph] partially?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, just a couple of comments. Our view is we're looking for, again, arbitrage between the return on something that we're -- on property we're going to invest in relative to the value of the stock. And so we're looking for situations where there is a net differential, the private, public arbitrage situation will work in our favor. And so it's not just about asset pricing. And in fact, you saw in coming out of the Great Recession that we were pretty aggressive as to the property that we wanted. And I would say, that was notwithstanding pretty pricey assets on a cap rate basis, but with stock and debt that was very attractively priced. So we look at the relationship between the 2 to try to drive our results. So we have to predict both is basically what I'm saying. I would say there seems to be plenty of demand for apartments and cap rates tend to be pretty sticky, and so I don't expect a lot of change there. The real question for us is what about the cost of funds, and we have a choice there between on balance sheet where we're using our stock on sort of leverage neutral basis or we're using the fund co-investment format. And so we try to look at a number of different ways and again, try to focus on how do we add value to the portfolio.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Apologies if I missed this in your prepared remarks. What is the rent-to-income ratio? How's that trending across your markets?
Michael J. Schall: Paula, it was not part of our prepared remarks and -- but I do have it here. So in Seattle, the Seattle is actually -- under the long-term average, it's 16.5% rent [indiscernible] income. The way that we calculate it, and everyone calculates it a little differently, we look at this as a broad-based market average. We're not really interested on a property-by-property basis, calculating the income -- rent to income or a property because it sort of misses the point, the broader point, which is what's going on in the marketplace as it relates to rental affordability. So Seattle, a little bit under the long-term average. San Francisco, almost exactly at the long-term average, same with Oakland. San Jose is actually about 1% ahead of the long-term average, 21%, they're around 21% versus the 20% long-term average. And Southern California, as a general statement, under the long-term average, but approaching the long-term average.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And I'm sorry, can you give me the exact numbers for the San Francisco and Oakland?
Michael J. Schall: Sure. So San Francisco, 24.9% versus 24.4% long-term average. Oakland, 20.2% versus 20.1% long-term average. San Jose, 21.3% versus 20.3% long-term average. Ventura 18% versus 18.7%. L.A., 20.5% versus 22.5%. Orange County, 20.9% versus 20.7%. And San Diego, 20.2% versus 21.2%.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And just a follow-up on the question earlier about condo conversions, are you seeing the pace of condo accelerations -- condo conversions accelerate in your markets?
John F. Burkart: Yes. This is John again. What we're seeing is the housing prices increased pretty dramatically over the last year and feel very strong it's increasing. And so we're starting to see some of the developments that went out in condos and then ultimately were converted to apartments temporarily. Those are going back into the market as condos, and we're starting to see the very beginning that people actually starts and beginning ground up and build condos. But we're early in the process. There's still some room to run on this condo execution plan.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: I have to ask a question as a Brit about Bunker Hill. Now this must be the biggest, longest-lasting redevelopment that I can recall Essex ever undertaking.
Michael J. Schall: I think it's up there. It's a very unique asset, yes.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: This is probably something I might have to discuss with Mike Dance on a separate -- on another occasion, but is there an issue on really the accounting? I mean, you're going to lose tenants and income for periods here. And does it go into cost basis, and how are you going to capitalize things? I mean, is there an easy summary to this because it seems like it's a lot if this is a kind of sizable kind of development sum, if it was standing on the toe and we know how you treat out of it if it were a development?
Michael T. Dance: Yes. Big picture is, as we're spending money, we capitalize it as if we are doing a development on the money we're spending. And then when we take units offline and as the -- these are going to be much more than the $22,000 because we're doing new windows and a lot. And the floor plans are pretty big here. So while we take the unit offline, we actually take the historical net book value and capitalize interest on that plus the spend. So there is capitalized interest and we can put together a model that summarizes the impact over that 4- to 5-year expected period of time. But yes, it's not easier.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Right. Yes. Now given the size of this project and the singular risk attached to one asset, how much of an extra return are you generating out of this project compared to your others?
John F. Burkart: This is John. Why don't I give kind of just an overview of the asset itself, just to start kind of on the beginning. So the asset -- these are obviously 2 towers in Downtown L.A. We bought it in 1998. They were built in 1968, it's a little bit old. When we bought them, we bought them for $86,000 a unit. Today, they're probably worth about $204,000 a unit, somewhere in that area. So our unleveraged return, somewhere in the 12% range, has done very well in these assets, obviously, anticipating the Downtown renewal. Now at this point, going forward, we're looking at this revitalization opportunity, put about $165,000 a unit into these assets to completely redo this with new -- with actually [indiscernible] balconies, all new windows, all new infrastructure, all new unit turns, et cetera. We're building a very large amenity building with a 10,000 square foot gym, a rooftop pool and deck, et cetera. Quite a wonderful asset. So in the end, we'll be in there somewhere around $370,000 a unit for an asset that would sell for somewhere around $500,000 plus a unit or $455,000 a unit. So we're probably roughly, say, 80% on the dollar for this asset from a post [indiscernible] standpoint. So when you look at the value creation, it's pretty dramatic in these assets. Does that give a bigger picture opportunity to you?
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Yes. I mean...
John F. Burkart: The other thing that I did bring up is another piece to it, which is interrelated to the amenity building and just a general upgrade, which is we have development rights for another tower, a third tower. And so doing these work better positions us for that opportunity somewhere down the line, probably toward the end of this entire project, effectively through the neighborhood and taking advantage of the renewal in Downtown L.A.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Okay, good. Mike Schall, I think this one's for you. You fought very well at the bottom of the cycle. We're now looking at property markets, which if you will just look from 30,000 feet, Case-Shiller would suggest that we've seen some very substantial residential price appreciation over the last few years, particularly in Southern California. Any of those buildings getting close to sale, and particularly the condo quality assets that you bought?
Michael J. Schall: David, I think John was alluding to this. It's interesting because the apartment values have done really well as well. So you have a race between the for-sale homes, home values and the apartment values. And I'd say the market that is closest to tipping over toward the condo being the appropriate exit is San Francisco. Southern California has really not had that much rent growth and therefore -- and it hasn't have -- the condo side hasn't appreciated as much as well. So I think we're further behind in Southern California than we are up here in the North. But having said that, and we have some apartments that are worth $800,000 a unit, and that means San Francisco, and that means that condo values have to be north of $1 million before that makes any sense at all. And there -- certainly condo values are going in that direction, they're just not quite there. So I would rank San Francisco #1, and I don't want to take away John's thunder at the Investor Day if he's going to be talking about this topic, but San Francisco, Northern California, #1 and Southern California, which has -- as you point out, we bought a lot of very high-end, beautiful buildings that are better condos than they are apartments candidly, and so there's some great opportunities in Southern Cal.
Operator: Our final question is coming from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: On the rehab activity done on the turns, I think you mentioned $22,000 per unit. What returns are you targeting on those?
John F. Burkart: We tend to be getting IRRs of somewhere in the mid-teens, which also works out to cash-on-cash of, say 11%, somewhere in that zone.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And what was the impact of that activity on the same-store revenue growth in 2013?
John F. Burkart: Because we're ramping it up, it actually is somewhat offset by the vacancy we have. So we -- you have to do it pretty early in the year to recapture the downtime. So until we kind of levelize -- level off the amount we're doing this year compared to last year, you don't really see that much benefit because of the ramp-up.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: So we'll see it next year?
John F. Burkart: Yes.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay, got it. And then...
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Dave, yes. Make sure you hear that last one, he [ph] won't say it again. John [ph] said...
John F. Burkart: Yes. We're also increasing unit turns next year. I think Mike will give out more clear guidance in the future, but the increase in unit turns were pretty significant from '13 over '12 and will continue that way '14 over '13.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: All right. Maybe we can get into it more on the next call when it's a little more relevant. And then the returns that you gave on the rehab activity, can you please provide those targets for the full-scale redevelopment activity, too?
John F. Burkart: Well, the full-scale redevelopment activity, as a general rule, the IRRs are going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10s, 11s, somewhere in that zone. They typically include all the new infrastructure, so we're going through and redo the HVAC, the plumbing, et cetera. So those returns are a little bit lower in that zone.
Operator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Schall for any concluding comments.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, Stephie. In closing, we appreciate your participation on the call as always, and we are obviously pleased with the results in the quarter and the positive outlook for 2014. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month in San Francisco. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, Christian. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. As usual, Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I'll cover 2 topics on the call: first, second quarter results and commentary; and second, cap rates and investment markets. So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we reported another strong quarter with core FFO per share of $1.88, an increase of nearly 13% over the prior year and above the high end of the guidance range that was presented on our last earnings call. Operations were better than expected in the second quarter, which includes the results of our peak leasing season, leading us to increase midpoint of the core FFO guidance range by $0.03 per share. Mike Dance will discuss the guidance range further in a few minutes. Rents in the Essex portfolio are now approximately 10% higher than in the third quarter of 2008, which approximates the prior peak in rents, and 29% above the trough in rents experienced amid the Great Recession in Q4 2009. Our review of economic data suggests a continuation of the strong housing markets on the West Coast with rents in the Essex submarkets expected to grow at an average of between 4% to 6% in 2014 and 2015, absent significant change in the U.S. economy. Factors supporting this expectation include: Number one, loss to lease was approximately 6% of scheduled rent at June 30. Number two, personal income growth is well above the national average in the West Coast market. The national average personal income growth is 2.3% compared to Seattle at 3.8%, Northern California at 4% and Southern California at approximately 3%. Number three, given strong personal income growth, rent to median income, a proxy for rental affordability, remains at sustainable levels. And number four, with the exception of Seattle, production of for-sale housing continues at a muted level and for-sale housing is becoming less affordable given rapid increases in housing values and increasing interest rates. Limited for-sale construction mutes the impact of higher levels of apartment development. Overall, we continue to believe that household formation will be significantly greater than the total of for-sale and rental housing deliveries. Economic data remained strong during the second quarter, supporting our expectation for a continued favorable apartment environment. Beyond the data, there's a certain vibrancy and confidence in the West Coast market, especially Northern California and Seattle. As usual, we have summarized our 2013 forecast of residential supply, jobs and market growth on page S-16 of the supplement. We lowered the job growth projections for Los Angeles because June was weaker than expected, mostly due to the loss of 24,000 jobs in the entertainment industry. Although jobs in the entertainment industry are often volatile, this decline is unusually large. Several firms, including Walt Disney and DreamWorks Animation have reduced staff ahead of the normal industry seasonality. As a result, our estimated market rent growth for Los Angeles on Page S-16 was reduced from 6.5% to 6%. However, this does not change our conclusion that Southern California will continue its gradual recovery. On to my second topic, which is cap rates and investment markets. The investment markets are adjusting to higher interest rates and better-than-expected apartment fundamentals. Although apartment transactions are only down about 10% from last year, there are fewer properties on the market that meet our criteria. We guided to $400 million in acquisitions in 2013 and have closed $290 million thus far this year. We remain on track to hit or possibly exceed the guidance with respect to acquisitions. We've also been an active seller given the previously announced liquidation of Fund II and the potential sale of 3 portfolio properties. From our recent transaction experience, we draw the following conclusions: Number one, cap rates for institutional quality property in A quality locations have not changed significantly and remain in the low 4% range. The combination of scarce availability of these properties and significant institutional apartment demand have held pricing constant. Second, for smaller properties and lesser locations, which often involve an individual or group of smaller buyers, cap rates have increased about 10 to 25 basis points to approximately 5% for B quality property and B quality locations. Buyers are pushing back, citing higher financing costs, which are countered by sellers pointing to better economic conditions that will result in stronger rent growth going forward. And then third, in the case of Fannie Mae, increased interest rates have been accompanied by higher spreads. A 10-year Fannie Mae loan at 65% loan-to-value is now priced at around 4.75%, which is about 75 basis points lower than in 2007, but up from about 3.3% earlier this year. Shorter terms, Freddie Mac and swap bank loans are generally more competitive financing options. And number four, our overall expectation for the next 6 months is for transaction volumes to remain at essentially muted levels. On the development side, we believe that the supply of apartments will peak in 2014 to 2015 and approximate 10% increase in construction costs over the past year, higher interest rates and overall conservative underwriting by construction lenders will continue to slow the number of apartments that are started. We're beginning to see a few lower density condo developments in San Francisco for the first time since the Great Recession. We expect more condo activity if the median-priced home continues to increase rapidly. The median home price increased year-over-year by 13% in Seattle and from 20% to 35% in Coast of California. The combination of strong market price increases at higher mortgage rate makes the transition from renting to homeownership more difficult, which benefits apartments. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to Erik.
Erik J. Alexander: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Property operations turned in another solid quarter, highlighted by continued strength in Seattle and Northern California. And while Southern California has yet to accelerate the way that we had hoped for, the region does continue to deliver improving results and we remain optimistic about future growth. Leasing activity during the period continued to strengthen following a good first quarter. Average new lease rates continue to post new highs for Essex, and on portfolio-wide basis, reached $1,756 in July. Renewal activity was also strong and slightly ahead of expectations. For the quarter, renewal rates grew 5.2% over expiring rates and were 5.7% higher in July. This compares favorably with last July when renewals were 5.2%. We expect August and September renewals to be in the mid 5% range, given the offers extended to residents, which include our voluntary 10% cap on rent increases for existing residents. Even at these higher rental rates, turnover remains in line with our plan for the year. Portfolio occupancy ended lower for the quarter compared to last year as we took advantage of economic rent growth and increased our profitable redevelopment activity. For context, our portfolio occupancy was actually 10 basis points higher this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012 when you net out the renovation activity for both periods. Even in Southern California where rent growth isn't as strong as the rest of the portfolio, we saw increases in scheduled rent and took advantage of renovation opportunities at several properties in the region. We believe the modest reduction in occupancy is a worthwhile trade-off for higher scheduled rent in the second half of the year and will continue to reward us in 2014. Following our pre-leasing efforts, we opened Phase I of the Epic development on June 21 and are off to a very impressive start. So in the 6 weeks since opening, we have leased 145 apartment homes and already have 83 of those units occupied. We expect to stabilize Phase I in October and deliver the second phase by November. Rent levels are near pro forma with concessions ranging from 2 to 6 weeks, but we are well ahead of our absorption schedule. Beyond our own success, we are very pleased that competitors are also enjoying strong absorption. In fact, our research provider reported that average absorption in the submarket for the 5 active lease-up projects was a whopping 60 units per property per month during the second quarter. So while this pace is not likely to continue, demand is more than sufficient to absorb the 30 to 35 units we need each month to execute our plan at Epic. Therefore, we believe this robust leasing activity supports the strong fundamentals in San Jose and gives us reason to continue to be bullish on the region. We also began pre-leasing efforts at Connolly Station in Dublin at the end of the quarter and are looking forward to receiving our certificate of occupancy later this month. We've leased a dozen apartment homes sight unseen and we'll begin conducting our first model tours this week. With an interest list of more than 500 people, we hope to achieve absorption ahead of plan at this project as well. Now I'll share some highlights for each region, beginning with Seattle. Seattle continues to perform above our expectations. Rent growth continue to be strong in all submarkets and the 12 active lease-up projects in downtown averaged 26 units per building per month for the second quarter. Strong rent growth is also extended to the south end of the region, with actual achieved rents growing by 7% since the beginning of the year. Employment growth remained strong in the region with year-over-year increase at 2.4%. And year-to-date, commercial office absorption totaled 1.9 million square feet, and overall vacancy is hovering around 13%. Of note, Vulcan announced last month that it will begin construction on Phases 7 and 8 of Amazon's headquarters, adding over 600,000 square feet to their South Lake Union location. Once all the projects under construction are completed, Amazon can occupy more than 7 million square feet in Downtown Seattle. While Amazon is clearly one of the most important employers in the Metro, Disney, Expedia and Zulily all announced expansions during the quarter as well. Moving to Northern California. As expected, Northern California continues to lead the way for Essex with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. In fact, new lease transaction in the division has averaged over $2,000 for 3 months in a row. Consistent with rising rents, the median price of a home in San Francisco has now topped $1 million with condominiums not far behind at $850,000. Equally impressive is the fact that inventory-for-sale products is a mere 1 month. June's year-over-year job growth was over 2.2%, led by San Jose submarket at 2.7% growth. Office absorption in the region was modest during the quarter, leasing just over 400,000 square feet. However, Facebook and Samsung have both broken ground on more than 1 million square feet of development for their companies, and Netflix received approval for their 0.5 million square foot project in Los Gatos. Turning to Southern California. Rent growth continues to be steady in the region. Average new rents have increased every month since January and renewals reached 4.4% in July, the highest rate of increase in 2 years. Additionally, renovated apartments, like our project, Highridge, in Palos Verdes are achieving average rent gains of $400, yielding 15% returns on our costs. We will continue to take advantage of these opportunities and still see Los Angeles and Orange County as our top markets in Southern California this year. Overall job growth in June slowed in Los Angeles, but Orange County, San Diego and Ventura met our growth expectations. In San Diego, we are keeping an eye on the potential impact of sequestration. The positive impact is the troop deployments have been delayed, keeping service men and women home longer. However, roughly 25,000 of the civilian workers of the Defense Department were furloughed in July. This budget reduction measure is scheduled through September but could be extended. Office absorption in Southern California was positive in all counties for the quarter and totaled 1.1 million square feet. But results in Los Angeles are still negative from a year-to-date perspective. However, the most significant commercial news coming out of the region for the quarter is the fact that Mercedes-Benz signed a 1.1 million-square foot industrial lease in Long Beach. Combined with Boeing's transfer of 300 to 400 engineering jobs in the second half of this year to the Long Beach facility, Hyundai's headquarter project, the Ford expansion and other large projects in the region, we still believe Southern California is poised for more meaningful growth in the coming quarters. The majority of the economic indicators and leasing metrics are positive and signify continued revenue growth for us. Therefore, we remain confident in all of our markets and our ability to deliver results consistent with our increased guidance for 2013. I thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I'll provide commentary on our second quarter results and changes to the full year guidance, as well as an update on a select balance sheet item. This quarter's operating results for revenues and expenses outperformed our guidance. These results are consistent with the first quarter, in which results surpassed expectations. As such, we are raising our same property revenue forecast 20 basis points at the midpoint to 6% and same property NOI growth of 20 basis points to 7.2%. Our expense growth remains unchanged at 3% to 4%. Expense growth in the first 6 months of the year was 4.8%, slightly better than our expectation. Expense growth in the second half of the year should be below the full year guidance range since the comparative period in 2012 is more reflective of our operating expense run rate for our portfolio. Of note is that the state of California is on a June 30 fiscal year, and we received Proposition 8 reassessments that are effective as of July 1 late in the third quarter. For the year-to-date expense results, Northern California taxes are up almost 5% over the prior period in 2012 due to the significant Prop. 8 adjustments, which were effective July 1, '12. The expense guidance for '13 assumes another $500,000 increase in property taxes in California from property assessments returning to their higher Proposition 13 assessed values. I'd also like to point out that the lowering of the high end of the range for revenue and NOI guidance is due in part to the success we are achieving with our interior renovations. This year, we are planning on renovating between 1,200 and 1,400 apartment homes, which are achieving impressive returns. However, these renovations take approximately 30 days during which time these apartments are not available for rent. Accordingly, any renovations begun after July will not be able to generate enough incremental revenues in '13 to offset the additional vacancy. Our second half of the year guidance assumes we continue these interior renovations through the fourth quarter, which is expected to increase the '13 rehab vacancy by about 20 basis points for the second half of the year compared to the same period in '12. As previously reported, last year we began liquidating Fund II, which terminates in September 14. To date, 3 properties remain, which are in the midst of being marketed and we anticipate selling them within the next 3 to 6 months. Depending on the timing of these dispositions, we expect to receive promote income of approximately $4 million after all 3 remaining properties sell. From accounting perspective, the Fund II promote income is not recognizable until the last asset in the fund is sold. Accordingly, if any of the Fund II assets sales occur in '14, the '13 total FFO will be at the lower end of the guidance shown on S-14. Postponing the promote income from Fund II into '14 will have a favorable impact on our core FFO guidance, which assumes all the co-investment income from the Fund II assets will cease on September '13. We are raising the midpoint of our core FFO per diluted share by $0.03 to 5 -- to $7.58. The increase is related to higher same property net operating income of $0.06 per share, which is partially offset by $0.02 of lower interest income from the preferred equity investment that was repaid and not part of the guidance and $0.01 of dilution from the disposition of Fund II assets was sold earlier than the September 30 disposition date assumed in our original '13 guidance. On the balance sheet, the notes and other receivables at June 30 stood at $110 million, an increase of nearly $100 million from the first quarter. This increase was the result of advancing our co-investment partnerships funds, which were secured by real property at terms comparable to secured bank loans. In July, Fund II repaid $45 million with proceeds from dispositions and loans totaling $57 million to the Wesco III joint venture, which are secured by recent acquisitions of Regency and Gas Company Lofts will be repaid this month with the proceeds from the permanent secured financings. That ends my comments, and I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mike, just had a question for you and it's hypothetical. If an investor was agitating for change at another company and they had capital sources backing them and you were such a capital source, would you want to stay silent in that or would you be public?
Michael J. Schall: It's a very good question, and I think I understand the context. However, it's hypothetical and every situation is different. So let me just start by making a broader comment, which is, as a general statement, I believe it is counterproductive to discuss strategic activities on the call. It leads to, I think, lot of possible unintended outcomes. In this case, I'm going to make this one brief statement and then decline further questions. And so that statement is as follows. We are not involved in any way, including any related discussions, with the July 31 letter from Land and Buildings to BRE nor were we involved in the other reference -- the offer referenced in that letter. So hopefully, that will take care of it. Again, Michael, I think every situation is different and there are pros and cons in terms of how these things are viewed strategically and how they play out. And there's great uncertainty as well with respect to what happens because we can't see more than a couple of steps ahead. So I think I'll just leave it at that and not comment on this any further. As you may have noticed, we had a great quarter, and hopefully, we can get some questions about the company and recent activity.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So I won't ask about the $8 million increase in marketable securities and whether that was BRE. We'll leave that aside. I'll let Nick ask a really good question about the company.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You were able to buy condos that were trading at pretty large discounts to replacement costs and then convert them to rentals. So now that you've seen a larger cover in the asset prices, what are your thoughts for those assets longer term?
Michael J. Schall: Nick, it remains the same as it was before. We thought that there was a great opportunity to buy condos at apartment prices, something that I've not seen in my career, and I've been here, I think, it's 28 years or something like that. And so it was a very unusual opportunity and so now we're starting to see the median-priced home increase relatively dramatically and we are tracking the differential between condo values and apartment values. As a general statement right now, they're close to parity and that includes not only the condos that we bought in the 2009 to 2011 period, but almost everything that we're building that has a condo map as well. So we've got virtually our entire development pipeline that has condo maps as well. So we're tracking it. At this point in time, we don't see a big premium. The one market that's starting to be very close is San Francisco. But with apartments trading at very attractive cap rates, we don't see a large arbitrage even in that market at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I was wondering if you guys are potentially bidding on the Empire State building as well?
Michael J. Schall: You're going to make me go back to my comment about counterproductive to discuss strategic items. I think I can deny that one outright as well.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay, okay. I have a couple of detailed questions. On the CapEx spending for the Gas Company and Regency, what kind of return do you underwrite on that sort of $20 million-ish?
Michael J. Schall: Well, in this case, there's a number of different things and I don't remember specifically what it is. In general, revenue-generating CapEx is underwriting to somewhere around in the 13% to 15% range, but that's if you exclude deferred maintenance, which inevitably is part of the CapEx spend. And in this case, I think it's somewhere -- it would be all the deferred maintenance gets included in that number as well. So it's probably somewhere in the 8 to 8 plus or minus percent range, which is not dissimilar from our general approach to renovating apartments.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then ...
Michael J. Schall: It's in the cap rate, too. We underwrite it as part of the cap rate. In the case of Gas Company Lofts, there are some other opportunities like potentially a rooftop deck and some other things that we think it's an under amenitized building and so we think there's some real value in a couple of things. But I don't have the details exactly, which pieces account for what. But as a general statement, it follows our overall approach to rent -- redevelopment, which is in that 8% to 10% on everything, which includes some deferred maintenance fees.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to go back to the topic of housing affordability because it feels to me like we're sort of replaying the scenario that we saw, let's say, I don't know, 10 years ago where the affordability gap has really sort of widened out pretty quickly except at that time we had a lot of -- you saw a lot of people moving out to purchase homes. This is a little bit different. So would you say that you have significantly more pricing power today because of the inability of your tenants to purchase homes? And is there a flip side risk to really sparking churn just for people moving up because of pricing? How do you sort of -- do you think about the dynamic?
Michael J. Schall: Well, maybe I'll start with some comments on rent to median income. In San Francisco, in that period of time you're referring to, the late '90s and 2000, 2001, our rent to median income was above 30% in San Francisco, it's about 25% currently, and that's the highest in the Essex portfolio. And so, we don't think that it's at the same level that you saw in that period of time, the dotcom boom and over that period. Now rents went up 40% in 2 to 3 years during that period of time. So we really haven't seen that kind of rent growth. And then of course, it came right back down. So I don't think it's the same as that period of time. And I think that, as I said on the call, that the rent to median income, in general, look like they're in the band of plus or minus 10% from the long-term historical averages. So we don't see that as much of a problem at this point in time. Then finally, the relationship between what's happening with personal income growth, which hopefully will become household incomes. When you're growing those numbers in the 3% to 4% range, which we are and a little bit more in some of the submarkets, it's not going to push that rent-to-median income ratio that quickly. And therefore, I see more sustainability there as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Let me ask a question of you Mike that I asked David Simon on his call a little earlier in the week. Let's assume over the next 3 to 5 years we are in a rising rate environment. Today, you're allocating capital with the hope that some of that capital will produce nice returns over that time frame. You're making decisions actually today in that context. What do you think you might be doing differently if we suppose that perhaps we go to a more normalized longer-term rate environment?
Michael J. Schall: David, yes. Good question. It's a question that is being debated by our board, but I think we've taken several steps toward answering that. And the primary step is to extend maturities and in effect lock in some very favorable rates for as long as we can. And the significance of that is that, that allows us time to transition from the market that we're in into markets that may be not as favorable as the current one. I would also say or suggest that if that happens, if interest rates go up, we would certainly hope that we would have a more positive economic backdrop in terms of higher GDP growth rates, higher job growth and less unemployment. And so I'm not sure that even increasing interest rates at some not too extreme level would be beneficial, net-net, for the company. But I think in terms of our planning, it really leads to longer maturities and less debt ultimately. And I think you've started to see over the last couple of years us move in that direction. Our last bond deal was a 10-year deal and we're going to try to focus on that going forward, which, again, provides plenty of opportunity to transition into a different type of market.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Would you be more cautious today about underwriting a development than you would have been 3 months ago, say, or 2 months ago before we saw the move in long-term rates?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, I think I made comments on the prior calls that, in general, we're going to try to hit the bottom end of the cycle very aggressively on the development side and then tail off as we get into mid-cycle. And clearly, I think that we've done that as well. And so, development is something that we're essentially committing to a cap rate today and matching it with funds that we're going to generate or raise a couple of years down the road. And so we want to make sure that we have plenty of room for markets that change in that case as well. We had -- we'd announced in the quarter the Downtown San Jose 1 South Market development deal, which we're very excited about and it's interesting that some people look at downtown San Jose and say that's a less desirable area. From our perspective, we see this movement toward urbanization really and throughout the United States, but certainly here on the West Coast, as being something that's important to us. And we think that, the right urban hubs are going to generate higher rents ultimately. And so we look at it much like we did Los Angeles, Downtown Los Angeles where in the worst case scenario kind of continues down the same path, which is a market performed in a scenario where it transitions to something more like a 24-hour city, certainly as L.A. has, it becomes much more exciting than that. And so that was the thought process behind 1 South market.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then finally, a question on the ATM. There was no issuance in the second quarter?
Michael T. Dance: That's correct.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just remind me -- I know we discussed this numerous times before. You're kind of hovering around where my NAV is. It may be below yours or whatever. But I mean, generally speaking, you would be -- I mean, unless you've got specific use of proceeds or were trading at or above your estimate of NAV, you wouldn't be using the ATM?
Michael T. Dance: We'll see. We had only used it to match fund investments that are accretive to NAV per share, improve the growth rate of the portfolio and improve the cash flows of the company. So we are not going to be issuing equities on cash.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: And you'd be very sensitive to the stock price relative to your own estimate of NAV?
Michael T. Dance: Yes. In the situation you described, when NAV drops below -- or the share price drops below NAV, we're much more likely to want to do our external growth with joint venture partners. And we have a platform that is very successful at changing to that platform at times, so that we're issuing less equity and typically using more leverage and a joint venture partner's equity as well.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: And no share buyback program in place at the moment?
Michael T. Dance: That is correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Can you talk a little bit about the San Jose and Seattle markets in terms of supply and what you're seeing there and what sort of broken ground over the last couple of quarters and what you guys think is likely to break ground over the remainder of '13?
Michael J. Schall: Sure. I mean, the general comment that we expect deliveries to peak in '14 and '15. And it's interesting, I think someone has the planned units in one of our vendor data, which appears to be pretty substantial, but -- and John Eudy is here, so he's dealing with this on a daily basis. So even though there's a lot of planned units out there, and this is part of my comments, a lot of those are having trouble -- a lot of those deals, development deals, are struggling to become financed. And so even though there's a lot of planned deals out there, we still see a drop-off, not dramatic, in the '14, '15 period. In Seattle, I think we have about the same amount of multi-family supply in '14 as in '13. So -- and then it drops off in '15. I don't have that number right in front of me. In San Jose, because of the 5 development deals in North San Jose, they were all approved by the city at the same time, we think that North San Jose submarket, essentially those transactions, I think, is about 3,000 units, John?
John D. Eudy: 3,500.
Michael J. Schall: 3,500 units get delivered and then it drops off significantly in that submarket. But I think that the move will be toward about a 20% reduction in '14, '15 in Northern California. And then Southern California, we see -- we just don't see supply being a huge issue there. And again, we see Southern California essentially staying at a very muted level for the next several years, although there are some pockets where supply can be an issue. So I'm making a broader statement. Even though within a local pocket, there could be some issue and what -- Woodland Hills comes to mind. The Warner Center area has a couple of lease-ups that are essentially changing. And San Diego has something similar. But -- so that's the multi-family side. On the single-family side, again, Seattle continuing to produce pretty significant amounts of single-family for-sale housing but muted throughout the rest of the West Coast. And the discussion that I just had about condos and the relationship between apartment values and condo values and the absence of a premium on that condo value side is, I think, what is the limiting factor when it comes to the for-sale development. Again, if you -- I mentioned there was somewhere in the 20% to 35% median household or median priced home growth. Obviously, if that happens again, then I think we're going to start seeing condo development because that will create that premium that we're referring to, that is necessary for condo development. And John -- I just asked John this question yesterday and again he can comment if he wants to, to what extent are you seeing condos compete with our apartment sites? And his answer was just on a very limited basis, but we're really not seeing some lower density types of transactions in San Francisco there to be able to build those condos. We are not seeing that strong competition yield for our apartment sites by the condo developers. We view that as a good thing. So I think that there's a number of factors that are causing this limitation in supply. And we don't see it changing or we don't see it certainly going against us over the next couple of years.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And how much has material and labor sort of changed between the Emeryville and the San Mateo development starts about 1 year ago and 1 South Market this year?
John D. Eudy: This is John Eudy. On a percentage basis, is that the. . .
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Yes, it's just a feel for an addition to interest rates moving up and land costs moving up, what's the change in construction costs.
John D. Eudy: To reference what Mike indicated, around 10%. Both of those starts last August, I believe, and then obviously we just announced the San Jose deal and if you were to mark it to market in that 10% range, plus or minus.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just lastly, what are you guys currently expecting from a stabilized yield on the current development pipeline?
Michael J. Schall: We have not really changed our underwriting standards. So we measured on stabilization somewhere in the 6.5% range, again depending upon market rent growths. And underwritten today based on rents in place today is somewhere in the mid-5s.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: It didn't take long for the county questions to come up, just -- but listen at least, you guys talked about it, which is good. Just a few questions for Mr. Dance. Mike, you went over the California property tax. In the same-store, Seattle looked to be up strong year-to-date on property tax, like 23%. Can you just provide a little more color on what's going up and what's going on in Seattle?
Michael T. Dance: Seattle, they tend to do this every 2 or 3 years. So some of this is a catch-up from prior years. And we're appealing them, but until we're successful on the appeal, we pay the property taxes and accrue them accordingly. I think one thing to note, our accounting policy may differ from some of our peers in that when we do have an appeal that relates to prior years, we run that through a non-same-store, so we don't get the lumpiness in our NOI results. So basically, Seattle has a cap on what they can raise in revenue in any one year. So what that means is, apartments have recovered before the other real estate sectors. So we're taking the brunt of it this year. We would expect over time, Seattle would see recovery in the industrial and office space and we would just be paying our fair share rather than more of our fair share of property taxes in King County.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. So basically you guys are the 1%-ers up there?
Michael J. Schall: Seems like it. Alex, we were surprised as well because we had assumed that we knew we had big valuation increases, but we were surprised that they increased 1 milligrade in Seattle and, yes, 20-something percent increase in property tax is a tough hit.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. Next is if we look at your rent growth this year, San Mateo has been outpacing -- has been the strongest and it's been outpacing San Francisco, yet when you go out to San Francisco, you see a lot of the surge of people who want to live in San Francisco, they bus down to the peninsula. So sort of curious why San Francisco is lagging rental growth versus San Mateo? Is that rent control policy? Or is there's some other dynamic going on there?
Michael T. Dance: I think it's part rent control policy and then on the total rent side are capitalized into that on the non-rent-control building.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, on the condo side, you mentioned that condos are sort of coming back in San Francisco. Given that the biggest threat to rentals -- to rental apartments is really condos, not for-sale homes, do you guys foresee that there's potentially an issue where rents have gone up meaningfully where people say, I can still live in the same infill urban neighborhood, but instead of renting, I can now own and try and keep money rather than throwing money away every month. Do you see that as a potential threat in San Francisco?
Michael J. Schall: We see any housing development as a threat. I mean, we believe that we take, on the one hand, household formation; on the other hand, total number of units that are being built, whether they are condos or single family or apartments, and we try to look for where the greatest imbalance is. And the other piece of it is that we are located in areas with very expensive for-sale housing. In San Francisco, I think the median priced home is somewhere -- median priced condo is about $850,000. And therefore, that transition from a apartment renter to a homeowner is just not an easy one. Especially on the condo side, you certainly have monthly dues that are pretty significant, which take away some of that perceived benefit that you're talking about given low interest rates.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just had a question on the Peninsula, San Jose. If you look at that mark and you look at your rent stats for your kind of renter profile and you talked about some of the new development and the absorption there, I'm curious if you could -- do you have any stats or commentary on how much of the demand over the past year or so has been from kind of people within the area moving there or whether they got job transfer within the Bay Area to that market versus, say, new entrants to the entire area who got a job from out-of-state perhaps.
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. I don't have the breakdown for people coming in and out. I would tell you that, anecdotally -- I can get back to you with that, but anecdotally, both Seattle and the Bay Area definitely include people that are relocating out of the area whether they're going to work for Google or Amazon, what have you. But that's definitely a piece of the demand. But more of it is related to the folks that already live in the region.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up on that would be if you look at that then, how does that affect an area like the East Bay, which presumably, I mean, I don't think it's had a strong job growth. Maybe some people have moved from the East Bay to the Peninsula for jobs. Longer term, how do you guys think about the East Bay in relation to San Francisco or the Peninsula?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. This is Mike. I think that if the rental pool is very dynamic and depending upon who you are within the rental pool, you're going to have a set of decisions about where you're going to invest in housing. And so those relationships change every single day. And let's take the world as it is today, which is there are more have than have-nots in the, I'd say, in the economy that we've had before. Therefore, there's a growing disparity. There are some tech workers that are getting very high increases in compensation and then there is a group of people that are getting 2% to 4% if they're lucky. And obviously, those 2 groups are going to act -- react much differently. One of the group, the first group, is going to be the renters in the South of Market Street in San Francisco, the very expensive areas, the areas that are -- that everyone would desire, let's say. It would be their first choice in housing and where the greatest demand rests. However, people that can afford that have to make another choice and if we've given them now 3 10% rent bumps, that -- if we give them 3 10% rent bumps to someone that's gotten 2% to 3% compensation increases, which I guarantee has happened out there at some level, they're really forced to make another housing decision, which is exactly what we would expect to happen. And the East Bay will be a logical place to go because it's -- there are still very good markets within the East Bay and they're not as expensive as some of the better locations. And so, again, I think you have sort of a bifurcation between the people that can afford, the best locations and the best properties and those that cannot. And as rents go higher, there are going to be more and more people to fall into that latter category and are going to be forced into other locations and other housing decisions. I go back to -- we're talking earlier about the 1999 to 2001 period, essentially, the entire Bay Area, the interesting part was the entire Bay Area was 98% occupied. So that led the job growth and demand for housing outstripped supply by such a large amount that essentially the whole Bay Area filled up. So we're not at that point, but we're certainly going down that road.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: I think you're flagging a modest increase for Class B cap rates, but can you provide a little color on this including whether or not you think it's broad based across your footprint or more isolated in one of the regions?
Michael J. Schall: Good question, Dave. I think it's pretty broad based. And again, I think it's driven more by who your buyer is than the category, which I think the institutional quality property is going to be generally focused on the better areas. So no, I think it's actually pretty broad based. This is within our footprint. And again, we've got a fair -- pretty significant amount of property that we've marketed in the last 90 to 180 days. And therefore, it's essentially drawing conclusions from that experience.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just to follow up on Los Angeles, a comment made earlier. Do you believe that the significant job losses in the entertainment industry are they're just a seasonal issue, nothing structural?
Michael J. Schall: Again, we think mostly it's seasonal, but again, it was bigger than is normally part of that seasonal adjustment. So we're concerned that some part of it is structural and we're concerned that some part of the entertainment industry goes to another state or another area. We just don't know.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Apologize if I don't quite understand this, but is it accurate to say that a part of your portfolio qualifies for Prop. 8 and part qualifies for Prop. 13?
Michael J. Schall: No, it's not accurate. I mean, they're both California propositions affecting property taxes. And what happens is everyone is subject to Prop. 13, which locks in...
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That much I know.
Michael J. Schall: Okay. And then so what happens is, you will create a line for property tax that starts with 1% of assessed value plus a couple of add-ons and gross of 2%. If the value of the property goes down in value, you will get a onetime only adjustment under Prop. 8, give you some relief in property taxes. And when that recovers, which is what's happening now, you'll go back to the Prop. 13 trend line.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I got you. I just wanted to make sure I understood those nuances. When you talked about you're being 10% above the prior peak rent, which I think you said was the third quarter of '08, is that really -- is that an apples-to-apples type of comparison? Or is there more to it than that? Is there like a change in the portfolio function that's creating that 10% increase over the prior peak?
Michael J. Schall: No, really not. That's what we're trying to do, is give you some idea of where we've come from and so we're doing that on essentially the same property-type of basis. So yes, there's quite a bit variation within that, yes, because certain areas are up more than others. But no, it's intended to be same property.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then my last question is on the cap rates that you were quoting. Do you factor in the Prop. 13 issue and change of control issue when you come up with those numbers or is that sort of before that?
Michael J. Schall: Always. The buyer always considers Prop. 13. If this is going back to a merger context, then you have the Avalon and Bay situation where they merged into Bay to avoid the Prop. 13 adjustments on the Bay portfolio.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So it really leads to the bigger question for you and that is do you have an estimate of what Prop. 13 does to your net asset value?
Michael T. Dance: We have it on an annual basis [indiscernible]. You can apply whatever cap rate you want to it, but it's roughly $30 million.
Michael J. Schall: And Rich, just so you know, for our internal NAV calculation, we make the adjustment.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And what is that internal NAV analysis?
Michael J. Schall: That is something that we aren't sharing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: First question, I think, Mike, in your prepared comments, I think you mentioned 3 wholly owned dispositions. What's the size we're kind of talking there? And as you wrap up Fund II, actively in marketing, you're getting a sense of price, what's the IRR you expect on Fund II at this point?
Michael T. Dance: On the dispositions, it's roughly $50 million to $55 million. The IRR really on the dispositions for Fund II ranges from 10% to 15%, that's levered.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Do you have the unlevered IRR, per chance?
Michael T. Dance: I do not. We can look it off and get back to you on it.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I appreciate that. Second of all, just given the move we've seen in interest rates over the last 90 days, are you seeing more opportunities in the preferred equity front? I know that had been kind of reserved for the last couple of quarters as rates were very low.
Michael J. Schall: Mike, I think it's too early to tell exactly what's going to happen. There's this -- whenever conditions change in the marketplace, there's this period of time where things just need to settle out. So I'm not sure that cap rates have settled out nor am I sure that other opportunities have necessarily presented themselves. We're continuing to look for preferred equity-type of transactions and I think we'll have some success. It's hard to tell whether that's attributable to the rate environment or just other things.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And finally, Mike, a bigger picture question for you. I mean, if you look at the supply numbers, they tend to be a bit more urban. One of your peers in terms of adding new development starts talked about focusing a little bit more on suburban markets. As you look across the portfolio today, given your track record for asset location, where do you see the better growth opportunities? I mean, urban is typically outperformed, but it's also facing a decent amount of supply pressure.
Michael J. Schall: I think I have 2 answers. One is long term and the other one is short term. And for the long term, I would pick the more urban locations. Again, you're having cities that are incentivizing the more urban locations relative to planned transit improvements and other infrastructure. And so there's a whole part of how the West Coast is developing, that it's going to, I think, urbanize or continue to urbanize the West Coast. Throughout of, an example, BART is now expanding into San Jose, and well, BART has gone as far south as on the east side as Fremont. And so, that represents really a major accomplishment and will intimately connect to the Caltrain, which goes back up to San Francisco. So trying to understand where the opportunities are going to be and where the best growth is. I think it's going to be urban. Having said that, in the short term, because of the phenomena that I was mentioning earlier where people are getting priced out of the best locations, you may see the secondary areas actually outperform the core areas and we're starting to see that, to some extent, with respect to the East Bay relative to San Francisco and other areas because again some people are getting priced out of the better markets and they're going to find other good, still good, apartment or homes in other locations that are not considered quite as attractive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Mike, as you look out over the next kind of 10 years and you kind of assess the growth in your portfolio, how do you see that NOI growth compares to kind of what you've put up the last 15 years, which has been just shy of about 4.5% then. Do you think your portfolio grows slower, faster or kind of about the same?
Michael J. Schall: Wow, that's a great big picture question. I would say about the same. I think you had a period of hyper growth in the '90s and then you had a decade of fairly tough conditions from 2001 to '11, let's say. So I think if you were going to handicap it, it would be somewhere in that same result, which means that because you have affordability is probably the key consideration and other housing choices, those would be the 2 key considerations, I think that, that means that we expect personal income and household incomes to grow at about the same rate because you can't push it too far. And we expect also that housing scarcity or we're going to continue to essentially not produce enough housing in these markets pretty consistent with the last 15 years with the exception of that, that notable exception, of the 2006, 2008 period, where we were producing lots of housing.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And how have you -- I guess I'm trying to understand kind of your unlevered IRR hurdles when you're looking at new investments today. One, what is that figure? And two, how was that changed over the last maybe 60, 90, 120 days?
Michael J. Schall: Well, it's interesting because as a fund investor, we are pretty focused on IRR, and specifically levered IRR, so we're I think most of our acquisitions are in the 8% to 9% unlevered. And if we can find a value-add piece that will push us a little higher, all the better, which takes us to about somewhere in the 12% to 13% levered IRR range. On balance sheet, we really don't pay that much attention to IRRs because we're really trying to benchmark, improving the company on a per-share basis, so it's very tied to how we view the stock. So if I go back to Q2, we didn't issue stock and we used the JV because, A, we think we can generate a little bit higher levered return, but B, we just didn't want to issue the stock at that price. So we're really trying to look at whether we can -- how we add value on a per-share basis, we're using the stock we're using our co-investment partnerships.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And then I guess I'm just trying to tie this, so if class A assets are trading in the low 4s on presumably sort of Prop. 13 adjusted figure and you can maybe grow cash flow at 4.5% per annum, I guess I'm trying to figure out how you get to an 8% to 9% unlevered unless you assume that you exit that transaction at a 4% cap 10 years from now. Is that what you'd need to assume or...
Michael J. Schall: Exactly. I agree with you. But I think we haven't bought -- we're building those A properties in A locations. We can't buy them. I agree with you. We would struggle with buying A properties in A locations. Again, we try to find -- I think the average cap rate of what we bought over the last couple of years as somewhere, and I don't think cap rates have changed all that much, but it's somewhere in the plus or minus 4.75% range. And then the reversionary cap rate, we have not -- I mean, I understand from an IRR standpoint you have to use that. But again, if you're using your own stock, you're going to have the same reversionary issue whether or not you buy a building because it's going to ultimately affect the value of the company. So hopefully -- does that help? Does that answer the question? We haven't bought -- we don't buy at full cap. Deals can't make them work.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I just have a local question. You mentioned the BART system earlier, Mike. Was there -- did your employees or your tenants have any significant disruption on the short-lived BART strike earlier in July, and what's the risk of significant disruption if they strike again?
Michael J. Schall: Good question, Paula. I can't -- I don't know. I don't have the sense that we were significantly affected by the BART strike here, primarily because Palo Alto is on the Peninsula and the Peninsula is not -- BART says it goes as far as south as SFO. So the significance is really on the other side of the bay for Fremont, going into downtown San Jose and connecting with the Caltrain that would make it possible to get to Palo Alto from Fremont. But at this point in time on, it's not possible. So I think that the impact was muted and as it relates to the Essex personnel. And I think as a general statement, given the congestion on the roads out here that as a general statement, the BART strike makes things a lot more difficult to get to places. I think as a broader statement, it has a big impact.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial capital.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: I got a question about the size of your development program. If I'm doing the math right, it looks like you’re the -- if I add your contribution to the development program and the redevelopment program, it looks like you're about 8% of total enterprise value and about 12% of equity. Is that sort of pushing the outer limits of where this program you feel comfortable about this size of this program relative to size of the company or do you think there's still room to -- for that number to go up?
Michael J. Schall: A couple of things. I think the risk associated with the redevelopment program is entirely different. So we do not look at that as being significantly -- we don't view it as being the same. So we've talked about development in the up to 10% of capital, our share, most of the development is in a co-investment type of vehicle. And -- but even with respect to development, once we're in the ground with a good contractor and a G-Max type of contract, I mean, our risk goes way down at that point in time. We have the capital risk, which is probably our principal risk that we're concerned about because again development is committing to a cap rate today but not having the certainty of your cost of capital locked down unless you want to pre-fund it, which is expensive. So if that's the key risk that we're focused on and the closer we get to delivery of existing deals and other things happening, the more willing we are to look at new transactions. So it's not just simply how much, it's really where are things, looking at the transactions individually and trying to make good risk-reward decisions as it relates to development.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So if I knock out the redevelopment, it may be 1 point less, sorry?
Michael J. Schall: Redevelopment, in my view, since it's so short term in nature in terms of most of the impacts, I just -- I don't view it as -- we can fund it easily off of our line. We only spend $30 million to $40 million a year in total in the redevelopment process. The returns are the highest as it relates to, again, as I said earlier, cash and cash returns on invested dollars is somewhere in the 8% to 10% range net-net. So we just don't see the risk associated with the redevelopment as being significant. And therefore, we're going to do as much as we can as long as the demand for upgraded units and better amenities and that type of thing are there.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: All right. Well, let's just take the redevelopment out of the equation. I mean, does your board talk to you about sort of having a limit of -- as to where they would feel comfortable about the size of the program, not in dollar terms, but relative to total enterprise value or equity value, whichever metric you want to look at?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. The board is comfortable with 10% as the enterprise value, which is again, that's their part of the decision.
David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And that's their max, is it?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, max.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So a couple of more questions on development. First, we're triangulating to a mid-5 current yield for your new 1 South Market project. Does that sound right? And what's the IRR you're underwriting for that project?
Michael J. Schall: Say that again?
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I said I guess we're triangulating to a current mid-5 yield for your new San Jose project, 1 South Market. Does that sound right? And what's the IRR you're underwriting for that project?
John D. Eudy: This is John Eudy. The 5.5% math is correct. The IRR is in the range of 9% unlevered; in the 12%, 13% levered.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Can you also discuss development opportunities that you're seeing today in your core markets? [indiscernible] the challenge is on sourcing new deals at pencil, just kind of get a sense as to what you're seeing out there, how are you able to source this particular deal given the context of -- the challenge of these deals being more difficult to source and underwrite?
Michael J. Schall: It is more difficult, we've said that for the last for several quarters. And if you look at our current pipeline, all but one -- the 1 South Market deal were announced basically 1 year or more ago, in 2011, early '12. So you can see the amount of volume has gone down significantly. And the timing of it, we're in the somewhere between second and third base on deliveries. So we're not at the early -- at the late stage of jumping in. We're kind of at the late stage of completing the pipeline. And what we see in general is it's harder and harder to find deals that we like that make sense in pencil and we think the volume is going to go down over the next several quarters. I don't know if that answers your question, but timing-wise, we were early in, it's harder and harder to make deals at the current prices.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: One more. I think you guys mentioned earlier in the call that you noticed that certain developers are having trouble lining up financing for some of their deals. Wondering to what degree you'd be interested in stepping as a source of capital for these developers? And if so, what type of returns or type of structures would you seek?
Michael J. Schall: Haendel, we actually have considered that and we are looking at a couple of different programs. One is a preferred equity-type of program focused on development and that would be priced in the -- around 10% type of range. And we look at a couple of other options, including JVs and even JVs that involve a preferred equity piece. So we have a number of different approaches to it. But I think the point John was making is that even with those things, we're further along in the cycle and so we are cautious with respect to the development commitments. And I think that, that is going to be the way it is for the next couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: My question is actually a little bit more broad based. You've heard some of your peers make kind of very public comments about their views on the single-family for-rent business. I'm just kind of curious what you think about that business?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, we've made comments on that business as well. We looked at it pretty hard. We've actually -- and Mr. Eudy led this charge in the early '90s were we've got a portfolio of homes as part of RTC days. And we think it's difficult to execute in a REIT-type of format, but there's certainly money to be made as house prices go up fairly dramatically. So in our view, the real question is, the disciplined question of if there's opportunity to take a significant gain, will these entities take that gain or will they try to perpetuate something that might be more challenging to execute?
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And your viewpoint on it being difficult to have it in a REIT format is based on what challenges you see in the business?
Michael J. Schall: The challenges are having assets scattered in lots of different places. And just the asset management challenges. It's really a CapEx and a maintenance and repair type of issue, I think, from our perspective.
Michael T. Dance: There's also complicated REIT laws about -- whether real estate laws is inventory or not and if you sell too many, the IRS may deem it as inventory or not, real estate held for investment.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you, all, for any closing comments or remarks you may have.
Michael J. Schall: Great. Thank you. In closing, we just want to thank you once again for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in the company, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks, again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you, all, for your participation. Good day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you. I would like to start by welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call. First, Q1 results and commentary; second, cap rates and investment markets; and third, an update on the State of California. So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we reported another strong quarter with core FFO per share of $1.87, an increase of 14% over the prior year and equal to the high end of the guidance range that was presented on our last earnings call. Our operating results should be viewed within the context of our recent activity in the capital markets that was not fully considered in our original guidance. The result of these efforts is an improved balance sheet, with longer debt maturities, less variable-rate exposure, increased common equity, greater liquidity and a lower debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is now below 7.0. Our Q1 results and most of the economic data give us confidence in our 2013 guidance. We acknowledged concerns about the level of housing supply, especially apartments, that are scheduled for delivery in 2013 and 2014 in selected submarkets, notably North San Jose and downtown Seattle. At the same time, there are several important factors that support our optimistic outlook and favorably differentiate the West Coast from other parts of the country. These factors are as follows. First, although March was a disappointing month from the perspective of national job growth, California continued to perform quite well. According to the BLS forecast, California is estimated to produce 30% of the nation's jobs in 2013 and is, therefore, expected to significantly outpace the national average in job growth. Second, production of for-sale housing continues at a muted pace, although its pace will likely increase later this year. This expectation is driven by the exceptional increase in year-over-year housing prices, up from 15% to 35% in the coastal markets. While the median priced homes still lag the high set in 2007 and 2008, they have recovered sufficiently to allow for-sale housing development. Our experience is that apartments benefit from high cost for-sale housing alternatives. Third point, the health of the apartment rental market depends both on job growth and job quality and the quality of jobs continues to be high in the coastal regions of California and Washington. High income jobs have a greater multiplier effect, more disposable income and greater wealth creation. A good indication of job quality is estimated personal income growth, which for 2013, is up 5.1% for Seattle; 4.9% for San Jose; and from 3% to 3.4% for Southern California, as compared to the national average of 3.1% . And finally, fourth factor. We look to the office market, H1B Visas and venture-capital investment activity for confirmation of jobs and economic trends. While the national office recovery has been modest since the Great Recession, we have seen significant improvements in several of the West Coast office markets. For example, since the Great Recession, San Francisco's office rent growth has led the nation, increasing approximately 30%. In the coastal markets, office absorption has outpaced the U.S. and is accelerating, major expansions of corporate campuses have been announced by Google, Apple, Amazon and several other companies. Another confirming data point is the demand for H1B Visas, which are used to admit foreign skilled workers into the U.S. A lottery-style approach was used to distribute 85,000 H1B Visas allotted in 2013, with all committed in less than a week. Finally, venture capital is another confirming data point. California received 47% or $2.8 billion of the nation's first quarter 2013 total D.C. investment. As a result of these factors, we continue to see a favorable ratio of housing demand to supply based on our job and supply estimates indicated on Page S16 of the earnings supplement. We estimate that housing demand, including both apartments and for-sale housing will, on average, exceed supply by a 2.5:1 ratio for the Essex portfolio. We conclude that the apartment markets will continue to report strong rental growth. While lease-ups will soften rents in a few places and create some level of volatility, we expect new apartments to be absorbed without major difficulty. My second topic, cap rates and investment markets. Cap rates are generally unchanged from last quarter and are currently in the 4% to 4.25% for A property and A locations, and in the mid-4% to low 5% range for B quality property in A locations. Cap rates increased from there to lesser locations and property quality. In the first quarter, deal flow that satisfies our criteria was relatively light, however, we still believe that we will achieve the $400 million in acquisitions contemplated in our 2013 guidance. We will likely start 2 additional apartment developments in 2013, aggregating approximately 500 units. We have become more selective for new apartment development opportunities and are looking for locations that we expect to improve, with rents that have strong growth potential. And finally, my third topic, concerns the State of California. We believe that significant progress has been made in California. While there is an ongoing discussion about future fiscal issues and the need for higher taxes, including modification of Prop. 13, the current condition has dramatically improved from just a few years ago. An improving California economy generates more tax revenue. A combination of an improving economy, reduction in cost and tax increases has eliminated the state's fiscal deficit in this fiscal year. According to media sources, general fund spending in the state has declined by approximately $10 billion or 9.7% since the 2007-2008 fiscal year. Prop. 30 will raise an estimated $6 billion in new taxes. As a result, the state expects to take in an estimated $2.4 billion more in revenue than it will spend this fiscal year, which ends June 30. That's exceptional progress relative to the $27 billion deficit that the state experienced just a few years ago. I would like to thank you for joining the call today. Now I'll turn the call over to Erik. Thank you.
Erik J. Alexander: Thanks, Mike. Essex enjoyed another strong quarter of property operations, and we are pleased with our results. Demand was strong and improved throughout the period. Turnover was lower than forecasted and we are poised to take advantage of what is expected to be a solid peak leasing season. New lease and renewal activity maintained strength, following a good fourth quarter, and not since before the recession have we started off the year with economic rent increasing every week for 4 straight months. As of April, loss to lease for the portfolio was 4.2%. As projected, average renewal rate increased 5% during the quarter and are expected to continue at that level through July. Furthermore, the average rents achieved on all new lease transactions in April reached their highest point ever and are $70 higher than renewals recorded in the same month. So with portfolio occupancy at 96.4 at the end of April, and our net availability less than 6%, we feel confident about the strength of our market and our ability to achieve our plan for 2013. Bolstering that confidence, the preliminary revenue results for April were at the top end of our revenue guidance for the year. But if there was any surprise during the first quarter, it was lower turnover than planned. Despite strong rent growth and higher renewal rates, turnover for the portfolio decreased 2% compared to the first quarter of last year, with the lowest turnover actually in Seattle. Turnover due to home purchase decreased from the fourth quarter and remains in check across the portfolio at less than 12%. We do expect an increase in moveouts due to homes purchased in the upcoming quarters and anticipate that it will remain well manageable levels. Overall, lower turnover, coupled with rising economic rents, high occupancy and increasing demand should help us maintain pricing power across most of the portfolio throughout the summer. Expo was the only active lease sector in the quarter. As forecasted, we stabilized this community in April. Congratulations to the Expo team for averaging 37 leases per month during the slowest time of the year. I think this is another testament to the strength of the Seattle market. Demand in leasing volume have remained strong in the downtown despite new product deliveries. Next quarter, I will provide initial leasing results for Essex as we begin pre-leasing activities this month. Now I'll share some highlights for each of our regions beginning with Seattle. Properties in the region have met or exceeded expectations so far this year and enjoyed collective rent growth second only to parts of the Bay Area. We have posted company leasing rent growth for new leases in April and we remain confident that this market will meet growth expectations for the year, especially on the East Side. Employment growth remains strong in the region, with a year-over-year increase of 2.5%. Job growth details for all of our markets can be found on S-16 of the supplements. Given the robust hiring that continues at Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Intel, Cisco and Visa, we believe job creation will match or exceed our forecast for the year. Of equal importance, the Seattle metropolitan division posted the highest personal income growth at any of our markets, with expected gains over 5% for 2012 and 2013. Office absorption showed continued strength with 1.6 million square feet of space absorbed during the quarter, or nearly 2% of total stock. I think it is safe to conclude that Seattle remains a hot job market and our portfolio should benefit from these commercial activities throughout 2013. In Northern California, continue to lead the way for Essex with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. The primary reason is the job growth continues to be strong in the Bay Area and the current rate of formation is outpacing our forecast on a year-over-year basis. All submarkets are ahead of schedule and are led by growth in professional and business services. San Francisco and San Jose job exploits are well-known, but the East Bay continues to make meaningful strides in employment, adding 21,000 jobs in the last 12 months. First quarter office absorption in the Bay Area was positive in all submarkets, but it is interesting to note that East Bay led the region with 600,000 square feet of net absorption during the period. Multifamily deliveries in North San Jose continue as expected. The demand appears to be sufficient to occupy all of these new offerings. Pricing in the submarket increased 3% during the first quarter and concession activity remained normal for the communities looking to achieve a high rate of absorption. Turning to Southern California. Los Angeles leads the result, followed closely by Orange County. We expect the relative submarket rankings to remain the same throughout 2013, but do look for Los Angeles and Orange County to increase momentum this summer. San Diego has not been very exciting so far this year, but given that unemployment has dropped below 8% and our job forecast is ahead of schedule, we do expect San Diego would have a better second half of the year. Current occupancies in the county are above 96% and rents moved up in April. Ventura is ahead of San Diego in terms of rent growth and should perform in line with expectations on modest job growth, high occupancy and low new supply. The jobs picture in Southern California continues to improve in all submarkets, again led by professional and business services. Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties have all seen job growth rise from below the national average last spring to well above the national average in March, and all post rates of job growth above 2%. The West side of Los Angeles continues to be the strongest, with creative and tech companies like Amazon and Beats by Dre. seeking additional space, while PEMCO, Hyundai and Google expand in Orange County. Office absorption in Southern California remains positive and large projects like the expansion of Universal Studios, approval of USC Village, and groundbreaking of Runway imply this is a signal of continued economic recovery in Los Angeles. Therefore, we remain confident in all of our markets and our ability to execute our plan in 2013. Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide commentary on our recent capital markets activity and provide details on the second quarter's and full year's guidance. In April, Essex issued $300 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at an effective rate of 3.35%. That proceeds from the offering we used to pay off the balance on our lines of credit. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of the proceeds, we felt it was an opportune time to enter the market and prefund some of our future debt needs. At the end of April, our cash balance was approximately $100 million, with no balance on our bank revolving credit line. By reducing our variable rate exposure with 10-year bonds and prefunding the debt component of the 2013 development expenditures, we estimate that the additional interest cost will reduce FFO in Q2 by $0.04 per share compared to the Q1 2013 results. Also in Q1, we see -- we received approximately $40 million from the early payment of indirect real estate investments, which were yielding over 9%. These prepayments will reduce interest income by $0.02 per share in Q2 and subsequent quarters. The $0.06 loss with sequential FFO will be offset by a sequential increase in net operating income for our midpoint in Q2 core FFO guidance of $1.83 per share. For the first quarter, we achieved 5.9% year-over-year rent growth of the same property revenues and 5.3% increase in same property expenses. Both metrics were better than our internal projection. Our same property expense growth in Q1 was higher than our full year guidance of 3% to 4%, as we have tough operating expense comparisons for the first half of the year. Operating expenses during the quarter were negatively impacted by 25% higher property taxes in Seattle, with increases of both the assessed values and levy rates. For 2013, we are affirming the guidance for FFO and same property operating results provided in January. If the new lease and renewal results that Erik just reported for April continues through the next 2 months of the quarter, we are well-positioned to achieve close to the high end of our revenue growth guidance in the second quarter. Year-over-year same property operating expenses for the second quarter are forecasted to be similar to the first quarter. Operating expenses for the second half of the year are forecasted to be below the full year guidance range, as the comparative periods in the second half of 2012 are more reflective of the operating expense run rate for the portfolio. The improvements in our gross operating margins are expected in the second half of 2013. With the strong operations meeting our internal expectations, we are maintaining 2013 FFO guidance despite having issued, in April, $300 million of unsecured bonds, which was not anticipated in our January guidance. To be clear, had we not issued the bond and received the early payment on high yielding investments, we would have been able to increase our FFO guidance. That ends my comments, and I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. You mentioned that first quarter's same-store revenue growth of 5.9 was maybe a little ahead of your expectations. So just looking at the full year guidance of 5 to 6.5, are you expecting revenue growth to kind of trend towards that 5.9? You're not expecting really a deceleration going forward?
Michael J. Schall: We haven't seen it in April. And based on where renewals are going out, and what we're seeing, nothing shows deceleration for the portfolio.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Then in terms of the development, are you seeing any construction cost pressures?
John D. Eudy: This is John Eudy. Of course we are. Fortunately, our portfolio under construction is 95% bought out. But in the future for the next 6 to 12 months, there's going to be high single-digit increases is our thought.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: All right. And then finally, Erik, can you talk about your thoughts on the ATM program, how you balance the desire to match fund and continue to improve the balance sheet with where your current stock price is today relative to NAV?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I think that was one of the reasons we looked at the bond market. Obviously, we are very pleased with the pricing of our 10-year bond and relative to our stock price right now, we basically, intentionally deferred some of our equity raise and prefunded some of our debt raise. And we hope with continued strong results that we are expecting, the cost of the common equity will go down. But we need to continue to deliver the results we're seeing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg, Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: A little bit in detail about your underwriting of Fox Plaza, your going-in yield and your expected IRR?
Michael T. Dance: Sure. Fox Plaza is our acquisition on Market Street, in San Francisco. It's across the street from the brand new Twitter Headquarters. And it's a very vibrant, changing, improving area. So that is the first very important point in that acquisition. It is a rent-controlled building. And as a result, you could expect our going-in yield to be lower than comparable transactions, given rent control. And that was certainly the case. There was a low 4 type going-in yield. But a much higher cap rate on market rents. In other words, there was a very large loss to lease there. The cap rate on market rents was approaching 6%. And so in the short-term, as you're turning units, you don't benefit as much obviously because of the going-in yield is lower. But over time, we hope to capture that large loss to lease and get closer to the economic cap rate given rent control. Does that help, Dave?
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Yes, that's helpful. And my next question is just about Southern California. Last quarter, you spoke about the region having underperformed your expectations so far on this recovery. In the first quarter, your revenue growth was at the low end of full year guidance. So after 4 months of this year, are you disappointed again with the region or are you optimistic that it will accelerate, putting you at the top half of your guidance range for that region for the year?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Dave. This is Mike, and Erik may want to follow up as well. Keep in mind that we just came out of our seasonal period. Our peak leasing season begins in effectively March 1, and we see most of our growth during that period of time. So as it relates to guidance revision, other types of things, keep in mind that we just came out of a seasonal period. And so the first quarter may or may not be as relevant as some of the other quarters. In fact, I would say Q2 is the most relevant quarter. We go effectively from having near 0 loss to lease at December 31, given seasonality, primarily, and we see how strong the markets bounce back as we enter into the peak leasing season. And where as Erik said, we are favorably impressed by what we see out there, and I think that we're on track for a strong peak leasing season. Having said that, relatively new and a couple of months does not make a year. And so we are erring maybe a little bit more on the cautious side.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: So just specifically, Mike or Erik, you said you expect 5% renewal gains April through July for the portfolio? Where would you put those for Southern California?
Erik J. Alexander: There's going to be a range in SoCal on the lower end. Maybe the 3s in San Diego or Ventura again. They could be higher depending on that specific address, too. 5s and 6s in parts of Los Angeles, certainly the West side and Downtown. We see strength and we have a good demand and higher occupancy. So we're hopeful and optimistic about the upcoming summer. But as Mike said, we'll know a lot more in the next few months.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Can you talk a little bit about San Jose, Seattle, when the biggest percentage of the development comes online and sort of how you sort of -- when you see that despite robust job growth, what do you do to sort of prepare for that for your existing assets in those markets to avoid the sort of cycle where 1 month, 2 months starts becoming 3 and people start moving out?
Michael J. Schall: Sure. In San Jose, it's really a unique situation in that, a couple of years ago, the city was trying to incentivize new development of apartments before we saw any of the rent increase activity and they granted waivers of the BMR requirements and some other things to help developers start construction. That was granted to 5 -- on 5 transactions, aggregating somewhere around 3,000 units. All those units are going to hit, at some point in time, in '13, the '13 to '14 period and, therefore, that is where the sluggish supply is coming in San Jose. And again, it's right there before us. Irvine was the first to deliver and a couple of others long station and there's a series of transactions that are coming in for the rest of 2013 and into 2014. In Seattle, we see just a continued amount of supply. Our estimates, if you look at multifamily deliveries in '13, we have 6,900 units. In 2014, we think it's probably 8,000, so we'll see continued supply of multifamily units in Seattle, maybe even a few more than we see in 2013. In Northern California, it was in San Jose, specifically, we think it will, given what I said, it will be reduced. It will go from 4,100 deliveries of apartments in 2013 to 3,500 in 2014. Again, those numbers can change, especially in the 2014 numbers. We track this pretty carefully and so it's pretty sensitive, obviously to our overall results. Having said all those things, given job growth, we think that we can absorb these levels of supply and still have very strong rent growth and so we don't expect, based on what we see in front of us today, for a significant amount of deceleration in rents in 2014.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. Given what you guys had said earlier in the call about high single-digit increase in construction costs, meaning, I would imagine that, at this point, rental rates are still keeping up with that to an extent where yields haven't -- on developments haven't just fallen off a cliff. But how much higher do construction costs really have to go in your markets before it starts really choking off yields to the point where you are seeing a real decrease of supply?
Michael J. Schall: That's already happening, Dave or Rob, excuse me. The potential deals today compared to when we were underwriting and doing the funding of our deals that we have in our pipeline now 2 years ago, is very, very minimal on what hits the radar, from our perspective as far as potential deals. I think the market's recognizing that as well. There's a lot of deals out there being chatted about and talked about amongst various folks from merchant builders on up. But on a go-forward basis, I see, the supply starts -- starting to taper off considerably, just for that reason.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just lastly, what's the -- you've got a few redevelopment projects on the books these days. What's the outside of those projects, what's the incremental opportunity from a redevelopment standpoint that makes sense from a returns perspective today?
John F. Burkart: This is John Burkart. There's actually a variety of opportunities in the portfolio. One of them that we're starting to embark upon is the reamenitization of the assets. Just basically updating the amenities to modern standards. Another one of course we're continuing is the unit turns. We have a substantially increased our unit turns this year from last year, and we'll continue to do so. Obviously, the major renovations are still part of the opportunity to grow some limited inflow opportunity. And then, of course the condo auctionality on many of the assets that we have. So we're pretty excited about the value of the portfolio right now.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Can you help us quantify what that, in terms of units, in terms of dollars, that you could put out over the next couple of years in that type of project?
John F. Burkart: Yes, the units -- we're probably going to hit about 1,200 renovated units this year. There's a range of, say, 1,000 to 1,500 and Erik's team and my team work very closely together to make a lot of good decision based on market conditions, et cetera. So it may vary, but the targets around $1,200. We're typically investing around $20,000 per property -- per unit and our returns are averaging 10% to 15% on that. Additional renovation opportunities funds, we're in the $10 million to $20 million range on the assets overall. That's in addition to unit terms. Does that help?
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Yes, I just want to quantify as to how big of a growth driver. It sounds like there's opportunity but it's still in terms of [indiscernible] at this point. Over the next couple of years it's not going to be a material sort of tailwind from a growth perspective.
Michael J. Schall: Rob, I think part of that is philosophical in nature, and that rather than throwing a chunk of money at a renovation program, we try to be purposeful. We try to look for low hanging fruit. We try to not have a one-size-fits-all type of approach. And I think that we end up with a better overall result doing that. The reality is, we have most the housing stock in the West Coast and certainly within our portfolio is 20 to 30 to 40 years old, and there's a lot of redevelopment potential within it. In terms of how to actually execute a redevelopment program, that's where there's, I think, very significant strategic differences among the apartment companies. And we tend to take the maybe a little bit more conservative approach, which is try to be very purposeful with respect to how we invest that money.
Operator: Our next question comes from in line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Just one quick one. Mike, this one is kind of for you. You guys have obviously taken the opportunity to sort of laterally invest opportunistically over the past couple of years. But it's been somewhat quiet the last few quarters. Is that partially because of the deal flow or do you think that pricing, even in the lateral investment opportunities, is a bit beyond your hurdle rates?
Michael T. Dance: Yes, it's really the deal flow. There are 2 things I think that are happening. Number one, there are more deals that are not within what we define as our core markets. A lot of sales are on the periphery. And property that we really don't want to own. So there actually have been transactions, but really not transactions that we -- that fit our criteria. So I think that's number one. And number two, I think there's just been a slowdown in overall deal activity. And, I guess, the third piece is, it's harder for us to make the numbers work, given that last year we grow through core FFO 21%. We're starting the year with very solid growth rates, which makes our equity more expensive and, therefore, more difficult to invest at a positive spread, in terms of what we're looking at. So it's really all of those factors. Having said that, we have more modest expectations this year. Last year, we did about $800 million in acquisition. This year, we expect to do about $400 million. So I think we're still on track to hit that number.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then my second question just has to do with the asset you are planning to sell from the fund. I might have missed this earlier. If you guys are hesitant on the acquisition side, what is the buyer profile on the other side of those potential deals? What kind of buyers are looking at those assets and finding it meets their hurdle?
Michael J. Schall: There is a lot of activity in those transactions. And most of those properties are very well located. And they will fall within the cap rates that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And so for well located property there's still plenty of buyers out there that are very interested in those properties. So I don't see that changing. I mean, I think that you would start seeing cap rates change if you started seeing investor activity pull back. Cap rates are probably more a function of how many dollars, investor dollars, are chasing how many deals than they are expected growth rates in IRRs and that type of thing. So we still see plenty of money out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Erik, first question. What was the sequential rent growth in the first quarter and also, if you look at the blended rents for the quarter signed, how does that compare versus the first quarter of 2012?
Erik J. Alexander: The sequential rents are .08%, and over last year, on the -- let me look that up for you, but I think it's -- well, I don't want to guess at it. I'll get back to you on that.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. I appreciate that. And second question. Mike, just to go back to David's question about the acquisition pricing in the market, how far off are you missing on the deals? How much is pricing outside? And on your numbers and your gross expectations, where is the market pricing coastal multi-family assets today on an IRR basis?
Erik J. Alexander: I don't really think that's the issue, Mike, because we're just kind of underwriting the same quantity of deals that we underwrote over the last couple of years, which surprises me a bit because even last year, I think was -- the transaction volume was somewhere around 70% of what it was in 2007, 2008. So we had, even last year, we had less transaction volume. We're seeing even less this year. I think a lot of that has to do with what has happened with rents over the last past several years. If you go back to 20 to 30 years, there was not this peak leasing season concept nearly to the extent that it exists today. Rent increased more ratably throughout the year. Now you have a 4-month period that your entire year is essentially predicated on, from March to July or August, let's say. And so all things being equal, I think sellers and owners would rather wait a little bit longer and see how good the peak leasing season is before listing their building it because obviously, if the NOI goes up, they can justify higher NOI, they're going to get the higher price. So I think it's probably more that, but we'll tell you next quarter.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I don't have the quarterly information that you asked about, but the most recent information which would be the complete month of April compared to last year is 7% higher on the new lease -- on all new lease transactions.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's encouraging. And just a final question. I think previously, you've mentioned 2014 is kind of the year you expected Southern California to outperform Northern California. Is that still a reasonable expectation?
Michael J. Schall: Well, we've been expecting Southern California to improve faster than it has. So I think that's the one area that we've been a little bit off. The magnitude in Northern California and Seattle of rent growth and the pace were much better than we thought. But the pace in Southern California offset the benefit we saw up here. So we're going to make a similar guess. I'm not sure that, and Erik may have a different opinion, but I'm not sure that they're going to crossover in 2014. Part of that is due to, if you look at personal income growth is so strong in the North. When you're at 4% to 5% personal income growth and 2x to 2.5x ratio of demand to supply, which were the numbers that we were quoting actually and even more strong in the North, we are starting to think that Northern California and Seattle can remain stronger, longer than we thought. And so we feel good about that and at the same time, I think our expectation for Southern California is the continued slow, methodical improvement that we've had thus far, recognizing, however, that pricing power is a function of availability in the marketplace. And there's a big difference if you add -- 95% to 96% market occupancy, we get quite a bit more pricing power over that 1%. So it's more like an exponential impact, if you go from 96% to 97%, you start picking up more pricing power. So we could be wrong, we think that things will go in the right direction. It's just been painfully slow in Southern California. So I'm not so sure that they -- I see them as more equitable than probably one outpacing other at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Are there any other industries in your markets that you think will have accelerating significant job growth outside of technology?
Michael J. Schall: I mean, life sciences is the other obvious one. In Southern California, we're seeing these are not as good as quality jobs, but certainly leisure, hospitality seems to be doing really well in Southern California. So I'd say anything having to do with tech, energy, life sciences are really the top of the radar screen in terms of the types of jobs that we're looking for. And then of course professional services are always good as well. So I'd say all 3: professional services, life sciences, tech and energy, which we don't have so much of.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just want to clarify, when you said that in April, the new leases were up 7%, is that over the expiring leases?
Michael J. Schall: No. So that's all new leases executed in April versus all new leases executed last April.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So effectively, sort of market-asking or -taking rents are up 7% year-over-year?
Michael J. Schall: There's quite a bit of noise in this over expiring because our expiring includes, if someone goes from a -- goes into a month-to-month premium, it's picked up in the denominator of that calculation. So there's been over the last couple of years more and more the disconnect between the expiring lease rate. And, in fact, I've encouraged our people to either create a new metric or deemphasize that one because it's not relevant. I mean, we were talking about in Q1 somewhere around 5% renewals and 5% new lease rates, yet we were better than that. And so I think that there's -- some part of this is a disconnect in how that metric is calculated and I think it's becoming a little bit less relevant than it was a couple of years ago.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, that's sort of where I was trying to go, because I was looking at the back of your supplement in terms of the 6.1% market rent growth forecast you had for this year and I was just sort of trying to tie that back to the 5% renewals, 7% new leases. And I mean, they are all in the same ballpark, I guess, I mean it gives us a sense that, that's roughly what you are achieving.
Michael J. Schall: Yes.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I thought it was notable that you didn't change your estimated market rent growth forecast from last quarter. You didn't just simply paste the page in to this supplemental. You continue to believe that the market is as strong today as it was the last time you put out your supplemental.
John F. Burkart: Yes, that's absolutely the case. This is John. We continue to get great job data, which is actually better than what we had in our supplemental. And we're seeing a great experience out of operations because [indiscernible]
Michael J. Schall: [indiscernible] There's one more factor, which is I'm sort of philosophically opposed to raising guidance 2 months after we give it originally. So I was a -- I weighed in against the guidance change candidly, because we just gave it to you in February and it's only April, and I want to see a little bit more about what happened. So perhaps, I'm part of the problem there.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The last question, you guys have been opportunistic in the past, and I'm curious, when you look at the stock prices of virtually all of your peers in the multi-family REIT sector and you look at them and say, most of them might be trading at discounts to the cap rates that you're seeing in the market, do you have any inclination to go out and buy a few shares of public companies rather than direct assets?
Michael J. Schall: You are so smooth, Ross.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm not saying -- I'm not bringing up BRE. I mean, this is a whole different... I'm not going down that -- I'm not saying that you want to buy the company, I'm just sitting here, saying you've done these kinds of things in the past. And I'm curious if that's still something you spend time thinking about.
Michael J. Schall: I mean, we do try to understand the environment that we're in, but at this point in time, it's really not worth spending our time. There's a lot of other things that I think may be more interesting to us. So we are working on some transactions that are similar, but maybe a little bit unique. So no, that's not where we're spending our time right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Do you have any properties in Camarillo?
Michael J. Schall: We do.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: There's a big fire there right now, just FYI.
Michael J. Schall: Okay.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So that's, that. So...
Michael J. Schall: [indiscernible] We have several properties in Camarillo.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. So take a look. I guess, I just want to ask a bigger picture question. I mean, we talk about granular detail, cap rates and renewal increases and all that sort of stuff and yet the sector still underperformed NAV discount average of 7%. Nothing is really working when we get on these calls. And I'm curious if you could think, Mike or anybody, of big picture, what do you think has to happen for the sector to start performing better as a group or even you, yourself? I mean, do you think that there is a catalyst out there in a positive way? Do you think 2014 might do better than people are expecting? Do you have a big picture comment about how we can get the sector moving and acknowledging what is a good value and also good growth?
Michael J. Schall: That is a great question. And I wish I had the answer. I will make the comment that I made to Mike D., which is this was the first year in his 8 years here that he wasn't accused of sandbagging with respect to our guidance this year. So I thought that goods from quarterly results, which we consider these results to be pretty strong, especially coming out of the first quarter, which has an element of seasonality. And that comment, that we still saw the West Coast as being a great place to own property and then confirming that with actual results would be a positive thing. But as I look to the stock over the last day, that doesn't seem to be the case. So I think it's more of the same. I think it's proving it out and I think the expectation of investors or the concerns of investors are maybe too large, relative to the reality. So again, I don't know how to -- if I could say it any differently. I tried to bring up the points in the script that supports the reasons why you should own properties on the West Coast. I hope that resonated.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Do you think that 2014 -- not to give guidance, of course, but do you think 2014 could be a bit better than what people are kind of dialing in to their numbers right now?
Michael J. Schall: I think implied in my comments, which again, when you see personal income growth in the 3% to 5% range and you see ratio of housing demand to housing supply at 2% plus, those would be bullish indicators and they would mean that you would not expect to see any meaningful deceleration going forward. So yes, I expect a very good 2014. And candidly, we could be maybe surprised by Southern California that it has continues its slow but steady recovery. So I think 2014 will be another good year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT and we will look forward to the next quarter's call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you. I’d like to start by welcoming you to our fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments; John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I'll cover the following two topics on the call, fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2013 and cap rates and the investment market. So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we reported core FFO per share of $1.81, an increase of 20% over the prior year and near the high end of the guidance range that we presented last quarter. For the year, we exceeded the high end of our initial 2012 guidance range for core FFO by $0.02 per share. We’re very pleased with these results which require the relentless and disciplined execution from the entire Essex team. I both congratulate and thank the E-team for this accomplishment.  Our economic research discipline is designed to creating investment thesis that we utilize to guide our acquisition, development and disposition activities. We backed half our conclusions when we later received the actual data to evaluate the process and look for insights that can improve future investments. We believe the success in the real estate business requires timing and execution, which are aided by the research effort.  A significant accomplishment over the past couple of years was predicting the surge in tech employment, which precipitated a greater portfolio rating in Northern California and Seattle. We've been rewarded for that insight.  However, there was room for improvement with respect to our forecast for Southern California, which lagged behind our recovery forecast largely because of the implicit assumption that the recovery from the great recession would be similar to prior recoveries, that is the trajectory of the recovery period would resemble the rate of decline. That clearly didn't happen. The recovery was slow and lumpy with muted growth from a few sectors including tech. As a result, Southern California, which is a more diversified economy without an abundance of tech, has underperformed to our expectation. However, as I will discuss in a moment, that appears to be changing. What does this mean for 2013 and beyond? Our overall market outlook is on the page S16 of the supplement and is based on U.S. job growth of 1.6% and 2.3% U.S. GDP growth, both of which are at the high end of the range provided by our data vendors. This information updates the same document that was part of our Q3 2012 supplement, although it generally assumes greater job growth consistent with that reported over the last six months and more apartment deliveries.  We continue to see tech, life sciences, energy as leading sectors in 2013. Throughout 2012, we saw the breadth of the jobs recovery increasing as more economic sectors contributed to job growth. Private-sector job growth is now broad-based with jobs being added in trade, business services, leisure and hospitality. The consumer, especially those at higher income levels are rebuilding their balance sheets, are gaining confidence. We are in a world with a growing disparity between workers with skills at education and those without, and that will affect the types of jobs being created and the potential income. That’s the good news. Lagging sectors in the recovery have been manufacturing and government, both of which will continue to have less employment in 2013 as compared to the pre-recession period. Many economists believe in the resurgence of manufacturing in the U.S. following huge losses suffered during the great recession. While that may occur, we believe that the impact for manufacturing will be muted in the Coastal California and Washington markets with perhaps a few exceptions like Boeing near Seattle. There are other factors that have a bearing on our market forecast such as benefit from demographic factors including an aging population that requires housing without necessarily having a job, the estimated 23 million young adults living with parents they would like to become renters, and the trend of postponing marriage in children. Finally, we are not seeing the strong resurgence for for-sale construction in the Essex investment market although the medium priced home has increased 21% in San Francisco, 25% in San Jose, 13% in Seattle, and 15% in Los Angeles. Large increases in housing prices will lead to more for-sale housing down the road, but it also makes the transition from a renter to a homeowner more difficult. Apartments and home building can coexist without major problems absent artificial demand created by lax mortgage lending standards and other anomalies. We conclude that new apartment deliveries will be absorbed with moderating but still strong rental growth. Once again, we expect the best job growth to be at North California and Seattle. New jobs and supply deliveries may not align perfectly throughout the year leading to some volatility in rents in areas with the greatest apartment supply principally downtown Seattle and North San Jose. Our outlook for Southern California continues to improve. This expectation is supported by the continued acceleration in job growth. In the second half of 2012, the Los Angeles MSA produced twice the number of jobs as compared to the first half of the year, the best since 2009 and outpaced the U.S. with 1.8% job growth. Again, the growth was broad-based led by business services, leisure hospitality, education and health services. Los Angeles also has the least amount of new supply of housing compared to all of the ethics MSAs projected to be only 0.2% of stock in 2013. San Diego also reported a significant improvement in job growth. The remaining Southern California MSAs have less job growth and more supply and that's lower expectations for rent growth. Erik will comment further on each of these submarkets. While we remain confident in our outlook, it should be noted that economic and political uncertainty has greatly widened the range of outcomes that are possible for all businesses and the U.S. economy. A shock from the Middle East or a new chapter in the euro debt crisis could derail the scenario that we just outlined. Now on to my second topic, which is cap rates and investment markets. Cap rates ranged from 4% to 4.25% for A quality property in A quality locations and in the mid 4% to low 5% range for B quality property in A quality locations. Cap rates increased from there for lesser locations and property quality. To add value, we have become more targeted with our acquisitions looking for submarkets with rental growth rates that exceed the average growth rate of our portfolio. Our preference is finding value add opportunities. As always, market selection and timing is critical to accretive investment. We completed approximately 800 million in acquisitions in 2012 and expect solid transaction volumes in 2013. With cap rates increasing, we hope to find sellers desiring OP trade transaction. As we enter 2013, we expect around 400 million in acquisitions with greater emphasis on well located B property and on Southern California.  Our development pipeline is now mostly under construction. We will likely start two additional development projects in 2013 aggregating from 200 to 300 apartment units. We have become more selective for new apartment development opportunities and are looking for locations that we expect to improve with rent that have strong growth potential. There are many deals being discussed although many of the merchant builders need equity to satisfy vendor requirements.  Other impediments to new apartment construction include concerns about the economy, future rent growth expectations, construction cost increases, and concessions from reluctant local governments that are needed for projects to achieve financial hurdles. With this in my mind, we believe that new apartment deliveries will peak in 2014 and return to muted levels thereafter. Development cap rates based on current market rents continue to be in the 5% to 5.5% range or around 6.25% upon stabilization.  Before turning the call over to Eric, I want to note that the press release summarizes the sale of $74.4 million in marketable securities represented the strategic investment that I referred to on the Q3 2012 earnings call. The decision to sell followed communications with the company that enabled us to conclude that we could not expect to achieve our strategic objectives. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to Erik.
Erik Alexander: Thank you, Mike. Operations performance during the quarter was solid as expected. We enjoyed strong demand in all of our markets, continued to grow scheduled rent on robust renewal activity and we finished the period in a favorable occupancy position and are poised for another year of strong performance.  New lease of renewal activity remained strong during the seasonally slow fourth quarter. 2013 is off to a good start with rents in occupancy improving each week throughout the month of January. Combined rents in January generated 7.8% growth over January 2011. Renewal rates in January were 5% above expiring rates while expectations for February, March and April, are anticipated nearby 5% as well.  We also expect pricing on new leases to continue to rise on strong demand and limited availability. As of yesterday, the portfolio was 96.9% occupied. So while we expect the overall rent growth to moderate this year, we see acceleration in Southern California and expect strong job growth in all of our markets to drive revenue gains for Essex throughout 2013. Turnover was within expectations and we ended the year with a portfolio wide ratio of 52%. The reasons given for move out by residents were consistent with last quarter’s results, with affordability accounting for 13% of our move outs and home purchases representing 12% of move outs. Home purchases were slightly up for the quarter, but flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect these rates of move out to increase modestly in 2013, but manageable and well within historical levels.  With several submarkets introducing new products, we do expect to see turnover rates increase to the mid 50% range for 2013. Some of this turnover will be related to expanding our interior renovation program in an effort to meet market demand for fresh product and new features. Expo remain our only active lease up during the quarter. Our early delivery continue to pay dividend as leasing remained strong throughout the period. Leasing activity remain ahead of plan and Expo now stands at 55% occupied and 64% lease. We are also pleased to see that many new competitors in this lively submarket are leasing apartments at a brisk pace as well. As called out in our economic forecast, we anticipate strong job growth to continue in Seattle and be more than sufficient to absorb the increase in new supply this year. We look to stabilize our occupancy at Expo at 95% during the second quarter. Now I'll share some highlights for each region beginning with Seattle. We are calling for an overall market rent growth of 6.5% in 2013. However, our expectations are segmented. We expect growth of 2% to 4% in downtown Seattle and 7% to 9% in Bellevue in the Eastside. This is important distinction given that 70% of the new supply will be delivered in the city of Seattle, while 80% of our portfolio lies outside the Seattle CBD including more than 50% on the Eastside.  The jobs picture in the region continues to be strong and shows no signs to learning up. We increased our outlook for 2013 from 2.3% to 2.8% job growth. Amazon continues to hire new employees at a furious pace, Boeing is ramping up production in an effort to reduce their backlog and Microsoft currently has 3,400 job openings for computer scientists and engineers.  Office construction in the region continues to be about 1% of total inventory, but the pipeline is very large in major projects that we previously commented on including Amazon’s expansion downtown remain on track. Turning to Northern California, we believe that this region will again lead the way in rent growth for Essex in 2013. The primarily reason is the job growth expectations continue to be strong in the Silicon Valley with 2.7% projected at 2013 and a healthy 2.4% for the broader Bay Area. Office absorption in Silicon Valley also remained strong as 800,000 square feet was absorbed during the quarter with another 850,000 square feet leased in San Francisco, Oakland and on the peninsula. So all total more than 6 million square feet of office space was absorbed during 2012 or nearly 3% of inventory. Vacancy for the region is below 15% and nearly 4 million square feet of office is under construction or renovation.  Partly due to timing, our multifamily supply projection for San Jose has increased slightly for 2013, but the total new housing supply for this submarket and the region remain below 1% of total stock. As we continue to make timely progress on the development of Epic in North San Jose, competing new projects are reporting strong absorption, stable pricing, and normal concession activity for lease-ups. We continue to believe that a impressive job growth in the region will support the delivery of all of these projects and thereby there is a sell as the property continues to perform well. In Southern California, we expect Los Angeles to lead the results for the region. Already in January, we are occupied above 96.5% in new lease rates or 6.5% higher than last January. The jobs picture in Southern California continues to improve in all submarkets as new employment accelerated during the second half of the year; hospitality, professional, business and health services led the way. So there were also gains in entertainment during the past year with total jobs for this sector nearly returning to 2008 levels.  Additionally, unemployment in Orange County fell below 7% for the first time in five years, while personal income growth in Los Angeles and San Diego reached nearly 4% during 2012. Job growth expectations for the region are ahead of the national average with Los Angeles and Orange County approaching 2% rate of growth for 2013. Office space absorption for Southern California remains modestly positive with nearly 400,000 square feet leased during the fourth quarter. The West Side and Tri City areas continue to see the most activity. Office vacancy is hovering around 17% for the entire region and there is nearly 2 million square feet of space under construction or under renovation, mostly split between Orange County and San Diego.  The region continues to plan for further growth as both the Los Angels International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles have advanced their expansion plans. Both transportation hubs saw increased traffic during 2012 and are expecting further growth in volume in 2013. Downtown Los Angeles and the West Side remain the best locations for us in Southern California; but Orange County continues to show improving rent levels. So consistent with our view last quarter, we remain confident about growth and performance for 2013. Seattle and the Bay Area will still lead the way for Essex, but Southern California will be a more significant contributor to our overall results this year. Thank you for your time. And I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will highlight some of the key assumptions for our 2013 forecast. Our detailed assumptions are on page five of the press release and S14 of the supplement. For 2013, we expect consolidated same-property NOI to grow by 7% at the mid-point. For 2013, same-property portfolio will include the five properties we acquired in 2010 which require substantial lease up activity, as great properties acquired in 2011 and the Via development in Sunnyvale.  Our acquisition strategy focuses on allocating capital to the markets we believe will have the highest rental growth. The acquisition property is being added to the 13 of same-property portfolio are forecasted to grow net operating income by 8% compared to the average of 7% for the entire same-property portfolio. Operating expenses during the fourth quarter and for the year ended were at the low end of our guidance. Over the last four years, the same-property operating expenses have not grown by more than 2%. Clearly our portfolio benefits from the 2% limits on property tax increases in California. However, for the 2013 midpoint, the same-property operating expenses. We are estimating property taxes will increase by $2.2 million or a 5% increase. This estimate is based on new assessed values in Seattle and in California we’ve assumed the temporary Proposition 8 benefits will lapse and property taxes will revert back to their Proposition 13 valuation. 
 : We expect we will receive between $3 million and $6 million of promote income in the fourth quarter. During 2013, we plan to begin leasing at Epic and the Dublin, California development and complete the lease up of Expo. The net increase in dilution from the developments in 2013 compared to 2012 will be $1.8 million related to these projects. This dilution is the result of expensing all operating expenses once we begin operation and the cessation of capitalizing interest as apartments become available for rent, and down to the extent our lease-up incentives include free rent, it is our accounting policy to start recognizing rental income after the free rent period is complete. Expo is expected to contribute to FFO in the second half of 2013 when it yields approximately 7% in Q4. We are forecasting a 5% increase in general and administrative expenses including acquisition costs due to general wage increases and additional hiring as a result of the growth of the company over the past few years. That ends my comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Good morning guys. I have a couple of just – couple of small detailed questions. Looking at the metrics for Santa Barbara in the quarter, it appears you had pretty good occupancy gain and rent growth was pretty flat. Was that a deliberate effort to build up occupancy and if so, why so aggressive in that particular market?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. Yes, it was. Basically that building is a student dominated building and so the leases that you see in the fourth quarter are essentially the leftover from the pre-leasing done during the summer. So the sooner we get those, the better we are for the rest of the year.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. So that just depends on the specifics to that market, not an overall expectation for the portfolio in general?
Erik J. Alexander: No, no, absolutely.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay.
Erik J. Alexander: The total specific to University of Santa Barbara.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. Going back to NAREIT, you guys were talking about capping or potentially capping rent increases in Northern California. That doesn’t seem to have happened. Are things continue to improve above expectation (inaudible)?
Erik J. Alexander: Yeah, this is Erik. We actually do cap the rents at the majority of the properties to stabilize the assets including Northern California.
Michael J. Schall: On renewals.
Erik J. Alexander: Yeah, thank you. On the renewals and so but again depending on what the resident chooses for a term, we’ll dictate what the rent increase for the rate is.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. And then I suspect you are not going to give us too much detail on the investment that was made. But can we expect more of those going forward. Is there something we will see this year?
Michael J. Schall: This is Mike. I assuming that you are referring to the strategic investment and yes, I really want to prevent this from being a discussion, a lengthy discussion about strategic investments. We do not expect many of them through over time. We've not had many of them over our history. And but I do maybe want to add one additional thought, which is that we promised the investment community that we would be disciplined throughout that process, starting from the accumulation of the position, and essentially the decision and execution of the sale, when these strategic objectives were not considered possible. So from our view that closes the chapter on that discussion, and again I’m not going to make a lot of comments about what happened and the blow-by-blow type of stuff, because I just think it would be inappropriate to do so.  So I'd like to move on. We have a lot of great things happening, internally, we need to focus our effort on the things that we can control and that what's we are doing internally and we'd like the call to sort of follow that same pattern. 
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Okay great. Just one last quick one. The land parcel that you sold in Palo Alto; what was the thought process there given the ramp up in development overall?
Michael J. Schall: I didn't hear the last part of your question, I'm sorry?
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: In the context of rising development agenda, what was the rationale behind them selling that (inaudible) parcel?
Michael J. Schall: It was a great location obviously, but it was very small. It was only 50 units, and we were offered a price that made sense and we executed on it.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Self storage, operator, potentially. Thanks guys, I appreciate the detail.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: Good morning out there. Mike, I appreciate your comments not want to make the investment a big part of the call, but just one question, because it's something that you have constantly came up with investors. If you guys were to do this again, how would you weigh just putting out to public, like a public bid? Do you think that would be helpful? Do you think that would accelerate a process or as you look at what happened, you guys are pleased with how it went, its sort of a Monday morning quarter-back thing, if you will?
Michael J. Schall: Alex, I think that every situation is a little different, and to make any generalized comments about what we might do differently, will depend, I think, on the situation, these things happen once every five years, let's say, and each scenario is a little bit different. They all have periods of activity perceiving them and then the activity itself, and it really depends. Your strategy is going to depend on that whole sequence of activity. So, I think it would be really difficult to make a generic statement about what might be different in the future.  And again, what I'm hoping we don’t do is turn this discussion into about the strategic investments, because – again from our perspective we need to focus our efforts on the things that are really important to us and we have a lot going on and we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. So rather than talk about something that is closed chapter in the book, we’d really rather focus this forward on the things that we are doing and the results and 2013 all the stuff that's happening out here.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: Okay, and that segues well into my second question then. You guys have made a number of recent deals including Pacific Electric. Were any of these deals sourced through your [mezz] portfolio and then as you guys look at making new mezz or financing investments at this stage in the cycle, is your view that those are more loan to own, the hope that you do get the property or at this point in the cycle most of those are more just getting attractive financing where you assume that you will probably just be paid off in the end?
Michael J. Schall: We did not source that through the mezz portfolio and the purpose of the mezz portfolio was legally and practically is to get the rate of return that we expect on the loan or whatever form it might take. Having said that, it does lead to the discussion, I mean you have relationship with the owner and that could lead to a transaction down the road and in a number of cases, it has at least led to a negotiation about whether we wanted to acquire the property.  In all of those cases, part of the sort of strategic aspect of that is to make loans on things that we would like to own that satisfy our broader criteria and therefore we have had some situations where we’ve been engaged in a discussion about buying a property. But up to this point, we’ve not been able to actually make that acquisition.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: Okay. And just last thing is, as you guys ramp up the renovation program, are there any changes, are there any differences in tenant taste, this time maybe more price sensitive now versus pre-credit crisis or are the renovations sort of what we were seeing pre-credit crisis as far as like the granite and stainless and all that stuff.
Erik J. Alexander: Yeah, I mean I think people want nice new modern finishes and in a number of these communities, we are also adding the washer and dryer which I think is important, is an enduring feature. So again, modest changes and taste, but there doesn't seem to be any pricing pressure. People want to pay for the nice units in the nice locations.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: Great. Thanks a lot.
Erik J. Alexander: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Hi guys, good morning out there.
Michael J. Schall: Hey, Ross.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: I'm going to ask one quick one on the strategy front.
Michael J. Schall: I knew you would. I remember what happened last call, go ahead.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Now that the whole thing is over, can you actually tell us what company was in?
Michael J. Schall: No.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Is that because you are subject to a configure an NDA or you are just choosing not to?
Michael J. Schall : This is to go a slippery slope, isn't it Ross? Just no comment.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Okay, I’ll move on.
Michael J. Schall : Sorry.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Prop 13, on Camden’s call an hour ago, Rick decided to throw Prop 13 on the table as a risk if the State of California can’t get its together. What’s your view at this point?
Michael J. Schall: I’m little surprised that Rick had that position. California given Prop 13, just got what was estimated is $6 billion in additional revenue and there have been recent statements that the State of California actually may have a surplus, which I tend to discount personally, but that's what's out there. Now, also with respect to the political reality, I go back to some of the conversations we've had with California Apartment Association and others who – they have a process that traced upon moderate Democrats that are concerned about business, as far as their endorsement, the candidates that they support. And there are actually several or many moderate Democrats and so the presumption that just because there is exactly two-thirds Democratic control of both parts of the government, it doesn't necessarily mean that the moderate Democrats are going to vote in favor of a Prop 13 overhaul.  So, I guess I wouldn't agree with Rick on that. I think that there'll be there will be less support for that than you can imagine, given the number of moderate Democrats that are out there. And I also think that the voters sort of given the politicians (inaudible), which is fix the state budget problems and they've given $6 billion to do so.  And I think that they expect that to be sufficient for the time being, not that there won't be some other proposals for tax increases and other things, but that go back to Prop 13 has been here for 13 years, and it's been challenged in a number of different ways, all the different ways you could imagine from judicial to legislative and other, and has pretty much survived that period of time. So I think that there will be more resistant than you might think.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Yeah, to be fair to Erik. I think his point was that if the surplus goes away, that there is increased risk to Prop 13 gets revisited?
Michael J. Schall: Yeah, I guess I would agree with that. But there is other discussions about vehicle license fees going up. There is a variety of discussions that are candidly easier to accomplish perhaps than a Prop 13 overhaul. 
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Next question is San Francisco related and I think your comments on the office construction and the jobs picture is particularly relevant. I'm curious we are certainly a resurgence in the South of market area and we've certainly seen more tech companies going downtown than really we saw in the last tech cycle, if you will. How does that influence your view of where you want to be invested over the next five to 10 years within San Francisco? Does it push you to say we want to put more dollars downtown?
Michael J. Schall: It does. We think San Francisco is a place that we need to be. We, for many years, had a very small presence there given the difficulty of finding property there that satisfied our broader criteria. But we have been more active. We bought a couple of deals in the SOMA District and actually other parts of San Francisco and our interest continues there. So, over the 20 year horizon the CAGR of rent growth in San Francisco is highest in our portfolio and so the difficult has been trying to find transactions that hit our yield thresholds than our overall return thresholds while recognizing it's a very strong rent growth market.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And last question from me. Are you able to give us some sense of what the IRR on Fund II is going to end up there both to you as well as your partners and as I recognize those would be different numbers?
John F. Burkart: Yeah. This is John Burkart. We are in the 10% down on that, this 2004 through 2013 overall.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: To Essex?
John F. Burkart: Overall for the fund.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Overall, so your numbers would be a little higher than with decent amount?
John F. Burkart: Yeah, of course.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So 10%, okay, got it. Thank you.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Harris with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.
David Harris – Imperial Capital, LLC : Hi. If I look at the year-end balance sheet, it is got $93 million of marketable securities. $20 million went out after the year-end. So, if I am doing the math right, $73 million left on the balance sheet today, plus or minus. Could you cut the comment as to what those marketable securities are today if the strategic stake is going?
Michael T. Dance: Hi, David. This is Mike Dance.
David Harris – Imperial Capital, LLC : Hi, Mike.
Michael T. Dance: After Katrina, we started a captive insurance company. That insurance company has over $30 million in marketable securities. That has worked out very well for us. And then back in 2009/2010, we made some investments in the Freddie Mac type of a mortgage back securities and that are also in those numbers. So that’s the bulk of it.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. Is that number likely to stay fairly stable now as we go forward?
Michael T. Dance: There is some accrual of interest on the trade securities, so that will grow just as we accrue interest on it. But and we get about $4 million a year in payments that the operating properties pay for the captive insurance, so that grows $4 million to $5 million a year with premiums and investment returns, so probably growth on the magnitude of $10 million a year.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. If I look back this time last year, we are a couple of weeks away from you declaring what your dividend is. Seems to be you've said it for the year on your first quarter. I mean you are one of the few REITs that did not cut in the downturn, so your dividend record is obviously quite outstanding. But could you give an indication as to what the level of growth we might look for this year or you might be recommending to the Board shall I say?
Michael T. Dance: Sure, David. It’s Mike. We do our dividend increase as part of the next upcoming Board meeting and so that will be a topic for discussion. We expect that we will make a recommendation in the 8% to 12% range. I’m sure there will be a discussion, but we are confident that it will lie somewhere within that range.
David Harris – Imperial Capital:  How much of that is discretionary and how much of that is being driven by rising net taxable income, Mike?
Michael T. Dance: It's pretty much – I would say, most of its discretionary. We had a return of capital this last year, so most of it will be discretionary based on cash flows. 
David Harris – Imperial Capital:  Okay. 
Michael T. Dance: Apartment REITs get a much shorter life on depreciation, but we have much more of our income sheltered by depreciation expense.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. I think you’ve got one of the heaviest stock prices in this sector, and I know this is a subject that’s come up before. But any thought as to splitting the stock to make it a little bit more manageable for [folk]?
Michael T. Dance: Yeah, David, again it’s Mike. We’ve evaluated that several times over the last couple of years and we conclude that with the very high institutional ownership that and typically the Southern stock is on a per share basis, the commissions or whatever are on a per share basis. And the listing fees and ongoing fees at the New York Stock Exchange make it unlikely that we are going to split the stock.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: This is (inaudible).
Michael T. Dance: Not exactly.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: All right. Thank you guys.
Michael T. Dance: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup:  Hey guys.
Michael T. Dance:  Hey Eric.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: So forgetting about the strategic investment for a little while and I guess maybe thinking about M&A more broadly, most of the multifamily stocks really haven’t performed very well over the last year, so your stock has obviously been one of the bright spots. But wondering if you think the fact that your peers are trading at sizable discounts NAV makes public-to-public M&A more likely or maybe less likely or public-to-private M&A, just wanted to get your thoughts on that?
Erik J. Alexander:  Yeah. Broadly speaking, I think the sector has an issue with M&A because there is just very little that you can do to make transactions work. You have I think a combination of impediments with respect to the tax rules that affect M&A. You have relatively similar pricing, some premium – small premium or discount to NAV, all the stocks trading within a band that really doesn’t allow large premiums and you don’t have – I don’t think you have motivation in some cases with the management teams and boards. So I think you have a variety of impediments that really prevent M&A transactions from happening. So, I don’t see anything changing that in the near term and thus I would say our appetite for M&A is pretty limited, because it seems like a bit of a feudal effort.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Right. So it doesn’t really I mean, I guess the answer then is, it really doesn’t matter what the stocks are trading, because the same issues are going to be there, no matter what.
Michael J. Schall: Those are pretty much generic issues from our perspective. Yeah.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay. And then just changing topics, one of your strategies over the last couple of years has been to buy condos that were trading before at least at big discounts, replacement costs (inaudible) under rental, now that you have seen condo prices increase pretty significantly in a number of your markets, people sort of kind of clamoring to buy in certain areas. Could you see yourself selling any of these assets or are you better up holding in this multifamily?
Michael J. Schall: Yeah, Eric, it's Mike. No, the intent was to acquire condo properties at apartment prices and when a condo premium, which throughout my career, I would say is close to 40% over a comparable apartment property that we would intent to try to realize that benefit in the case of Skyline, which is probably the largest and most notable example. It's really a lot better condo than it is an apartment building. And when you have wine lockers and snake-skinned couches, it's just really not an apartment building.  So we would definitely seek to try and realize the gain on that from that investment activity when time is right and when you have, it's amazing how quickly the median price home has moved on the coast. When you have 20 plus or minus percent increases in the median-priced house, you become, it get you closer to that day, I don’t think we are quite there yet, but I think it gets you closer.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Got you. I mean would you could you venture a guess as to how long away you are from that or is that not, sort of not worth [the effort]?
Michael J. Schall: I think we are in a position that is, we have two good outcomes in life. If you have scenarios where you have a choice, both of which are good for you, that’s – it gets no better than that right? And so I think in this case, it’s exactly that and we have two good outcomes and we’re just going to wait for the right moment. And it could vary from property-to-property or situation-to-situation because they are not all alike in the case of Skyline for example I think there is great potential. And actually it’s optionality because we have the ability to convert one tower and not necessarily the other tower in a variety of choices along the way. So I think it’s just a great business problem to have and we will look to realize or maximize the proceeds and on those transactions and we are very excited about them.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jana Galan – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning. 
Michael J. Schall: Hi, Jana.
Jana Galan – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I was wondering if you could comment on your expectations for your development yields and the Expo project came in nicely under budget or if there is opportunity for some of the other projects to have some construction savings.
Michael J. Schall: On Expo, I think Mike mentioned the stabilize will be in the 7% range in the fourth quarter this year. And in the balance of the pipeline, as you know we built over the last two years before we did spike in the land cost and before construction cost started moving up, we expect the entire thing to stabilize in that 7% range, $930 million that we have on our construction currently.
Jana Galan – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And when I look at your same-store revenue guidance midpoint at 5.75% and compare that with your estimated rent growth forecast for the markets overall at 6.1%. I am just curious are you expecting occupancy declines or are these numbers not really comparable? 
Michael J. Schall: Actually this is Mike speaking. I think our loss-to-lease was somewhere in the 4% range when we are going through that final budgeting process. So, you start with the loss-to-lease back then, and effectively F-16 is a market forecast, so these are market rents. And obviously for a market rent to be converted into a scheduled rental or into cash flow, we need to sign a new lease in effect or renew someone or sign a new lease. So there is a lagging part of the process there as we convert what happens at the market and to what is going on in the portfolio and so it's really just recognizing that lag.
Jana Galan – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: Yes, good afternoon. My question is focused really on Southern California, LA and Orange County. You did make some very positive comments about that market turning around, but I think you also kind of mentioned that taken while for this to kind of happen in LA much longer than anticipated. I am just curious how confident you feel about LA really turning around or whether this is just a temporary thing and later on in the year there may be some downside risk to some of those forecasts?
Erik J. Alexander:  Yeah, this is Erik. I think we are more confident this year than last and the year before that, and I think the reasons are because the acceleration of job growth in the second half, as Mike had mentioned is one factor. The stability of occupancies and the rent levels, both on the renewal and the new lease side, is also a factor and over the last several weeks including part of December, we see improvements maybe a little stronger given the slow time of the year than we normally expect. I mean that’s not massive but again we are in a good spot. I mean, we are almost 97% and so we have a lot of pricing power. We expect to be able to grow scheduled rent, particularly on the new side over the next couple of months and so I do have confidence and we are looking forward to hold up this year.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: Good. So what’s the key risk to LA slowing down again?
Erik J. Alexander: I think key risk is always jobs number one and supply number two, and since you have visibility or longer visibility on the supply given the numbers that we are looking at, we don’t see that as a big risk and so it would take some bigger decline in jobs for – to hurt us there.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Could you give us an update on your rent to income measures across the different kind of the three big markets there and relative to what’s normal or typical cyclical peak. And then I guess also are you seeing continued increases in terms of – are you seeing rising incomes in your new tenants versus the ones that are moving out, is the average income of the tenant base still increasing?
Erik J. Alexander: Yeah, this is Erik, and the answer to the second part of your question is, yes, we have seen incomes go up. It’s hard to measure the ones that are moving out, because I don’t know what they make up to move in, and they don’t share that with us. However, the ones coming in, obviously we will have on the application data and those levels are higher in all three of our markets. As to the percentage of income relative to the rents, the relationships with all remain the same in Seattle, the exact number in front of me. So I can't tell you that it is below 20%. It's like in the 17% to 19% range and in Northern California closer to that 24% range and then Southern California in between those two.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Okay. And just for context – so how much further do you think that could be – could you go comfortably on some of those ranges in terms of your pricing power?
Erik J. Alexander: My opinion is, it can go a long way, particularly if we are doing our job and people like where they live. I think it's one of the more important decisions folks make about their life and where they spend their time, and when you look at some of the other markets in the United States where that ratio is much greater, that people choose to continue to be in those locations. And I think we see that the most in San Francisco.  So I gave you the feedback on the three major markets, but obviously, if you separate that out by sub-market, you're going to have people spending less percentage of their income in the East Bay compared to some of the people in downtown San Francisco, all things being equal on average. I mean, again, you get some of these applications that come in and they have pretty phenomenal incomes and they could be spent than less than 10% on their rent. But I think there is – the point of your question, I think there is a lot of room to grow.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi. Good morning. Just remind me, on Prop 13, to make a modification to that, does that require a general election or is that just a legislature that can make changes to it?
Michael J. Schall: You can change it with a two-thirds vote of both parts of legislature, which is why the concern is out there now that the democrats control both legislatures by the two-thirds majority.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Got it. Okay, so no general election needed.
Michael J. Schall: No.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Second question is just on your expectations for rent growth in 2013. It looks like renewal rates are continuing to stay relatively constant between 5% and 6%. New lease increases sort of peaked at like 8.7% last July. Is your expectation that those new lease rates will peak back up around the same level, go higher and then do you also expect renewal rates to continue to stay in that same range?
Erik J. Alexander: Yeah. So this is Eric. I expect it to follow the same pattern. We will see increases in those renewals and new leases as we go into the second and the third quarter. I am pleased with where the renewals are now and as I mentioned earlier with the strong occupancy and limited availability we have helped pricing power in – for the foreseeable future that we are at March for certain. And so when we start sending out those increases for the next groups which would be the back half of April and May, those are likely to go up as the new lease or the offered pricing goes up.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Great. Final question is just on Seattle. It looked like you lowered your rent growth forecast for the market from 3Q to 4Q, but Erik your comments were relatively bullish today on the call. Do you see potential downside to the forecast in Seattle? 
Michael T. Dance: Actually this is Mike. Let me just make a couple of comments, because we on the third quarter call we had fewer units in 2013, fewer delivery units. I talked on the call about 10,000 units under construction in Seattle, but we thought we had I think somewhere around 4,000 to 4,500 in 2013. We ended up pulling a bunch of the 2014 deliveries into 2013 and that softened the rent growth expectations for the downtown and that's why you saw that change.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. That makes sense. Last question is just on San Diego, seems like we've gotten a couple of positive momentum trends out of that market from the public company reports recently. Do you feel like San Diego may have turned the corner?
Michael J. Schall:  Hard to say, I mean I am not scared about it, but unlike Los Angeles or Orange County where you’ve seen some sustained momentum, it is probably early to call that for us. So I mean we are optimistic about it, but as the forecast shows we are looking for modest rent growth there.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  Hey thanks. Good morning out there. Sorry to keep you on, right. I do have a question Mike about the commentary you had on the earlier question about public to public merger. It is a quite different tone from you when I asked the question first quarter 2012, same question, how would I thought – what you thought about M&A in the space and you’d say it is sounding interesting now. That was about nine months ago. So what happened, what changed your tune to today?
Michael J. Schall: I think we both know, Rich.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  I was trying not to laugh when I was asking that question. 
Michael J. Schall:  I think it’s really troubling me to use my own words against me. How dare you? This has been a little bit of an evolution in terms of thought process, like, I still think that there are some things that make sense from a broader perspective. But actually realizing them and if we can – we can negotiate with ourselves all we want, but the real world comes into play. So, I think you got me on that one Rich.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. I’m sorry, I know you wouldn’t mind. Back to some more relevant quick questions here. You talked about spending more time from an acquisition standpoint Southern California versus Northern California; did you provide a cap rate differential between those two markets if you had similar assets in similar location, in the north and the south what the difference would be?
Michael J. Schall: We haven’t, but we run essentially a model that price to look at the relationships between growth rate, our portfolio versus what we are acquiring cap rate or cash flow portfolio average versus what we are acquiring and our view on NAV, and that's what really drives our expectations. In this case, the really controlling factor typically has to do with the growth rate. So for one of the top growth rate markets, we shared with you what we think they are.  So you kind of know we will be pretty much weighted into those markets as it relates to opportunity. We don't see a big difference in cap rate from Seattle to San Diego, and actually we see pretty significant differences in growth rate over that period of time. I think Seattle maybe has the lowest cap rate, just because there is some very wealthy people up there that like apartments.  So I think that the determining factor is typically and will be no different in 2013 is going to be where can we get the best growth rates projected out from few years.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Noticing that you’re going to do $400 million of acquisitions or whatever the number is and your acquisition cost line item says, call it $1.6 million. It seems like people are getting a lower number on that line item lately, have you been able to manage acquisition costs down from what I think as rule some being 1% of total cost, is that a process underway or am I just imaging things?
Michael J. Schall: Yeah, you know, it’s a little artificial to a certain extent because in that case, there was an – we agreed to pay a brokerage fee on a specific acquisition. Normally brokerage fees are paid by the sellers. If it’s paid by the seller, it doesn’t show up in there. It shows up in cost, right, somewhere. So, it’s really geography on the financial statement and yeah, we try to make it so doesn’t go in that line item. But in this case, we were unable to do that. It won’t typically happen again.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, last question. You said development returns starting at 5.25% and stabilizing at 6.25%. What is the 100 basis point increase? Is that just trending rents once they stabilize or is that something else?
Michael J. Schall: That's comparing. You got it exactly right. It is the – the 5.25% is based on rents today. The 6.25% is rents a couple of years from now. So, it’s just the normal trend in a rent.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Does the 5.25% apply any concession?
Michael J. Schall: No, because the concessions, we think are pretty artificial. I mean the concession is really to get the volume during a lease-up.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay.
Michael J. Schall: To be two times the normal turn that you would have on a stabilized apartment building. So, we view that as essentially a cost of development.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. That's all I have. Thanks.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets:  Good morning guys. Just going back to Prop 13, what is the Prop 13 exposure and the portfolio estimate today?
Michael T. Dance: It’s probably in the ballpark of $30 million to $32 million.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets:  $32 million, okay, helpful. Second of all, Mike, you talked about cap rates in the transaction market. I just haven’t been so active right now. What are you seeing more in the Coastal California markets? What kind of core or value-add type property and what is the buyer pool look like? I mean, has the competition increased in the last 12 months or you are seeing some people start to back off because of low cap rate?
Michael J. Schall: Mike, it’s a good question. These markets are big enough that you pretty much see a little bit of everything. In the case of the Fund II sales, our Studio City asset had 50 something confidentiality agreements than other assets had. We had to actually mark it to get 10, so not that they were poorly located or anything else, it just varies by market. The institutional investments and the REITs tend to be very focused on that. Super high-end location at the corner of Main and Broadway let’s say figuratively, and are willing to pay the price to get that. And so we see the greatest competition there. I’d say as a general statement, cap rate spreads are pretty wide right now. In other words, a very aggressive cap rate in the let’s call Main and Broadway type location.  And then as you get further out in the periphery, it’s a pretty significant spread and the interesting part is when you look at it relative to the cost of debt for example, there is still positive leverage even that for cap relative to a ten-year loan or seven-year loan. As you get out into the peripheral areas, you can have an enormous amount of cash and you can have a cash-on-cash return assuming interest only debt of somewhere in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. So, it’s a very unique period of time I think, but I’d say a lot of money is driven by the institutions. The institutions are very focused on location and typically pretty willing to pay for it.  So, our acquisition approach and development approach is to try to find the locations that you get appropriate balance between cap rate and growth. We want most of the growth, but we want a little bit higher cap rate, and so we’re probably not going to be competitive at Main and Broadway; we’re going to be competitive somewhere else. We’ve used the example of Fremont in Northern California, for example, because you have so much rent growth in the North San Jose area, Fremont is five miles away, haven’t really experienced quite the same rent growth, and therefore, we target that as an acquisition opportunity. That’s how we think of the world. That’s how we try to implement our acquisition strategy.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets:  That's very helpful. Final question, a little bit bigger picture. When you think about JVs at this point, many of your peers have been reducing their JV exposure. You are in the process of unwinding one and you also I believe started at Wesco III there as well. How do you think about JV allocation at this point? Is it more a function of where returns are versus where your cost of capital is today, or is it just at this point of the cycle, or just how do you look at that today?  
Michael J. Schall: Yeah, exactly what you mentioned. We like having diversity of capital. It’s not like if you decide you want to have JVs after not having any JVs, you can just go out and quickly raise some money, and therefore having the relationship are important. We’ve been able to balance them with some other activities that are beneficial to the Company.  So, for example, as we’re trying to build our unencumbered pool on balance sheet, if we need to assume a loan we can do so in some of the JV formats which keeps our secured debt on balance sheet at a relatively low level. But the broader point is to have different types of capital so that as conditions in the economy change and we see opportunities we can react to it with different types of capital and which hopefully will help us create accretive investments.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Fair enough. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Over last question comes from Paula Poskon in with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks very much. Two strategy questions also. One, if outmigration accelerates, how inclined would you be to follow those folks to new markets outside California?
Michael J. Schall: Paula probably not real excited about following them principally because we are looking for a couple of things. The broader strategy of the Company and I think the success over time has been going to areas that have relatively expensive single-family housing, not a lot of housing production. Over long periods of time, we like the constraints represented by mountains and waterways and difficult political structures and that type of thing. I think that that is what really creates the opportunity in California.  We like really expensive single-family homes so that the transition from a renter to home owner is a difficult one. And we ultimately like job bases. I talked in my comments about the highly educated and highly skilled are doing very well in this economy and those that don't have those skills and education are not doing well. I think that the tendency is going to be to be the areas with the highly skilled jobs are going to continue to draw highly skilled people and high income people into those locations. I don't think you are going to see for example a math executive, engineers leaving Silicon Valley because this is kind of the hub in collaboration among engineers and talent pools are so important in this world.  So, I think that there are certain pieces of what we have here that are not easily replicated elsewhere, and so we're happy in these types of markets. Now, if you ask me, are there some other markets that have the same price, same conditions or the same attributes as the coastal markets in California and Seattle, so I would yeah, there are some and they are typically on the East Coast.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks. And then, I guess that [ketch up] a segue to my second question, which is, given your comment in your prepared remarks about the growing income disparity, would you be more inclined to broaden or focused your product offering across price points?
Michael J. Schall:  We are pretty open to broadening price points. I mean, we've become more active in As. Again, if we get the location right, we want to earn from E or even B minus, so we can make into a B, to an A product. We have been pretty active developers to try, which will almost by definition, all be A in very high quality location. And so, we have broadened a little bit on, again, the B versus the A side, again trying to get location right. The Cs are just tough because the issue there is you are dealing with, a variety of tenant issues and occupancy issues that we really want to avoid.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks very much Mike.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks.
Operator: One last question from David Bragg with Zelman Associates. Please proceed with your question.
David Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on an earlier topic. I think over 2011 and 2012, during the peak leasing season, your new move-in gains were about 150 basis points 200 basis points above that of renewals. But as this cycle matures should this continue or should that spread narrow as you start to work through new supply?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. It can continue, I would expect again depending on the rate of growth that, you see some narrowing, as we capture that loss-to-lease, but clearly in areas where we expect higher growth like in the east side of Seattle and San Jose, and so forth. I still think that you could have a decent spread there.
David Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Erik, one other one, just on your earlier comments on Seattle with the supply pressure downtown, and relative to East side, how competitive would that supply be with the East side over a longer time horizon? I think many of us have been to the market and the distance itself is not that significant.
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, maybe it’s a little hard to say, but I can tell you that we are tracking it all last year, and we track it from where the people are coming from at Expo, and we have nobody that we have put in a category of moving from the east side so far, yet not one person, they're all coming from out of the area to take their job at the Gates Foundation or Amazon or Nordstrom or any number of those places. Could that change I suppose. Stuff became super attractive. But again I think there is a lifestyle issue that people want in downtown and there is a lifestyle situation that people want on the east side and they are different. You are right. I mean, it’s short distance. It’s not necessarily a short commute in the morning given the congestion. So, I think that plays a factor as well.
David Bragg – Zelman & Associates: That's interesting. Thank you.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: One last follow-up comes from Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Yeah, it's Bilerman speaking. So, I guess, you didn't get to the 5% threshold, did you?
Michael J. Schall: No, Michael, we didn't use derivatives either.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: All right. Just going back to just thinking about privatizations rather than public M&A. If you go back to 2006 and even 2005, 2006, or 2007 timeframe, when you have the stocks trading at bigger discounts to NAV, so I can sort of appreciate your comment that, look, if two apartments are actually about trading at the same discount to NAV or one is a couple of percent higher than the other, it’s hard to negotiate that from a public-to-public perspective. But I would imagine that when you look across the spring at the apartment stocks given how they have performed combined with the increases in same store, isn’t that a recipe for privatizations in this environment?
Michael J. Schall: I think it could be and I think that might make sense. But I also think we had recent transaction here, the Archstone transaction. I imagine that that was considered at some source. So, I think as these companies become larger and larger, I think you have a capacity issue to extent in terms of the transactions just require an enormous amount of money. So, I think that it's probably difficult in that case, and I think that some of the other transactions would be difficult just because of their share size.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  I think the majority of the companies are in that $5 billion to $8 billion zip code and even some below versus…
Erik J. Alexander:  Yes.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: A $17 billion company just it would seem as though the private market is still extraordinarily active, the debt financing market has only gotten better. Rates are extraordinarily low, and fundamentals continue to get better. You have the publicly traded apartment sector trading almost to 6% implied cap rate. Something doesn't feel right about that.
Erik J. Alexander: Yeah no, I’ve totally agree with you. I think you are under something there for that more right size companies. Yes.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks.
Operator: At this time I will like to turn the call over to management for closing comments.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator. So in closing we want to thank you for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in the company. And you will really excited about 2013 and finally we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, Dan. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the tragic impact of Hurricane Sandy, our hearts and prayers go to our friends and colleagues that have been affected by the storm. With that said, I'll begin by noting that Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments, John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: number one, Q3 results and market commentary; number two, investment markets; and number three, an and update on what's happening in the State of California. So the first topic, Q3 results and market commentary. We are very pleased to announce another strong quarter in which we reported core FFO of $1.71 per share for Q3 2012. That result was $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range announced in connection with our Q2 call. This positive variance would have been $0.02 per share higher if we did not accelerate the timing of our $300 million debut public unsecured bond deal, which led to higher interest costs versus forecast. We continue to see strong growth in Northern California and Seattle, and improving conditions with pockets of strength in Southern California. Same property revenues improved once again, to a 7.2% increase over Q3 2011, which was the best year-over-year growth in the last 20 quarters. These results lead us to reiterate our expectation for strong conditions for the remainder of 2012 and continuing in 2013, driven by growing, but still limited supplies of housing, and job growth that exceeds national averages in Northern California and Seattle, and continues to improve in Southern California. With have provided our preliminary market forecast for 2013 on Page S-16 of the supplemental package. The weighted average estimated rent growth for our primary metro markets is 6.5% for 2013. The primary macro assumptions, which are integral to the rent growth estimates, are indicated on S-16 and are not materially different from the estimates of our economic data providers. However, some of the expected 2013 supply and job growth estimates, and consequently, the projected economic rent growth, are significantly different from the data providers. As an example, there are around 10,000 apartment homes under construction in the Seattle Metro, for which we estimate that 1,100, 4,100 and 4,800 will be delivered in Q4 '12, all of '13 and all of 2014, respectively. Accordingly, the timing of these deliveries can vary significantly based on a variety of factors. We believe that this overview of housing supply and demand information provides the appropriate [indiscernible] in our 2013 market rent growth assumptions for each MSA. We will update these numbers in connection with our formal 2013 guidance, which will occur in conjunction with our Q4 earnings conference call. We also recognize the inherent uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, which could lead to significant changes. We view job growth as the key to the estimates, and as you know, that is dependent upon forces that can change rapidly and are not easily predicted. I'd like to make 2 additional points about the 2013 preliminary market forecast on Page S-16. First, construction of for-sale housing remains muted on the West Coast, partially due to the hard landing it experienced in 2008, relatively high cost for-sale housing and mortgage qualification issues. However, median home prices are spiking dramatically and have experienced year-over-year increases as of September, of 17% in Northern California, 7% in Seattle and 6% to 12% in the various Southern California metros. If those median price increases continue, we would expect for-sale housing supply to accelerate. Second, the relationship between jobs and supply is at the core of our economic research effort, and John Lopez attempts to quantify housing demand and supply on a submarket basis. From a broader perspective, it takes, on average, about 2 jobs to create a household in the coastal markets. In 2013, our forecast indicates the addition of the total of 192,500 jobs, which should produce around 96,000 households. This is sufficient to cover 2.8x the 33,800 combined expected deliveries of for-sale and rental homes in 2013. Our 10-Q will indicate that the investment in common stock, at cost, increased to $72.7 million from $42.9 million last quarter. Nearly all of that increase related to purchases of common stock of one company that we consider strategic in nature. As such, we will not provide additional information about this investment. My second topic, the investment markets. Cap rates continue to be aggressive in the coastal markets and have not changed materially since last quarter. Cap rates range from 4% to 4.5% for A quality property in A locations, and from 4.5% to near 5% for B quality property in A locations. Page S-15 of the supplement summarizes the closed acquisitions through last Wednesday, which aggregate $515 million, including the buyout of our partner's interest on Skyline. These deals include properties acquired both by the company and in the Wesco co-investment. We also have 3 transactions aggregating $186 million, in contract with contingencies removed, most of which should close by year end. You can expect a greater focus on Southern California from an acquisitions perspective in 2013. By the end of 2012, we expect to complete the sale of 7 properties representing roughly 1/2 of our Fund II portfolio, for an aggregate contract price of approximately $413 million. Essex owns the 28% limited partnership interest in Fund II, and up to 20% of profits as it's general partner promoted interest. The remaining properties are expected to be sold in 2013 in anticipation of the Fund II term date of September 2013, which is extendable to September 2014. The trailing 12-month cap rate on these sales was less than 4.1%. Development deals in the West Coast markets, underwritten based on today's rents, generate development cap rates ranging from 5% to 5.5% or 6.25% to 6.75% upon stabilization. Our development pipeline did not change materially during the quarter, and at estimated cost, we have approximately $1 billion under construction. We estimate that the average cap rate of the development deals is about 6% based on current market rents and approximately 7% at stabilization. And finally, my third topic. Dealing with the State of California. We'll be paying close attention to the election results this coming Tuesday, as California goes to the polls to vote on 2 ballot measures that propose to raise state taxes in support of education and other needs. Prop. 30 which is being championed by Governor Brown, would increase the California sales tax by 0.25% for 4 years, and the state income tax, based on a sliding scale for those that earn over $250,000, for a period of 7 years. Prop. 38 seeks to raise income taxes on those making over $7,300, based on a sliding scale that begins with an increase of 0.7% and has a maximum increase of 2.2%, and is for a 12-year period. If both measures pass, the one with the greatest number of yes votes will supersede the other. Important to note that none of the ballot measures impact Prop. 13. So I'd like to thank you for joining us, once again. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. Operations performance during the quarter was better than expected. We continue to have strong demand in most of our markets. Rental rates grew throughout the quarter. We finished the period in a strong occupancy position and are poised for a solid fourth quarter. Once again, rent growth reached its highest point in July but remained strong into October. During the quarter, we completed more than 4,100 new lease transactions and signed nearly 4,300 renewals. Portfolio-wide, renewal rates for the period were up 5.3% and were steady throughout the quarter. New lease rates were 6.4% higher than expiring rates during the quarter, peaking at 8.7% in July. October leasing activity has been good, and we now have seen an average coupon rates for new leases and renewals above $1,500 for the past 4 months. So on a combined basis, achieved rents in October are 11% higher than last year. So while we expect overall rent growth to moderate at some point next year, strong job growth in all of our markets should continue to produce solid revenue gains throughout 2013. Looking ahead, renewal offers for November and December averaged 5% to 6% portfolio-wide. At the end of October, our loss-to-lease for the portfolio was 4%. Turnover remains within expectations, and for the quarter, was within 1% of last year's move out rate. Given our low availability and expiration profile, the turnover expectation for the year remains in the low 50% range. The reasons given for move-out were consistent with last quarter's results, and we saw declines reported in home purchases and affordability. These factors represented 10.5% and 13% of all move-outs, respectively. I think these numbers remain low due to persistent high occupancy in our markets, a steady demand for rental housing, and the affordability and qualifying hurdles facing home purchasers. We do expect these reasons for move-out to increase in 2013, but should be well within manageable ranges. Expo was our only active lease-up during the quarter. This community is in the very popular lower Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, and is less than 1 mile from Amazon's world headquarters. These apartment homes, average nearly 700 square feet and rent for almost $3 per square foot. Again, this project was delivered 6 months ahead of schedule and we had our first move-ins during October. Thanks to strong pre-leasing efforts, Expo is already 25% occupied and 38% leased. We expect to stabilize this asset during the second quarter next year. Operating expenses continued to be within expectations, and year-to-date are up 1.1% compared to 2011. Turnover and onetime service items drove the typical sequential growth, but there's nothing unusual to note. Next quarter's expenses could be slightly higher as we continue to improve property presentation and enhanced services for our residents. Operating expenses for the year should end up 2% higher than 2011, and within our guidance. Now, I will share some highlights for each region, beginning with Seattle. Essex's market rents are up 10.6% year-to-date and the job picture in the region continues to be robust, and we're seeing more tech applicants, including employees from Microsoft and Amazon. Our outlook through 2013 is 2.3% job growth. Job growth projections for all of our markets are detailed on Page S-16 of the supplement. Office absorption slowed during the quarter to about 200,000 square feet. However, Zillow, eBay and Intel are all expanding operations in the region. Additionally, Amazon Phase 5 is slated to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year, and a nearly 400,000 square-foot expansion will commence next year. Other large projects are scheduled to start in 2013, including Amazons' 3.3 million square-foot project in the Denny Triangle area of the city. This would be Seattle's largest commercial development in history. Turning to Northern California, Essex market rents are up 10.1% year-to-date. Job growth expectations remained strong in Silicon Valley, with the highest forecast for any of our markets, at 2.4% through 2013. Commercial absorption in Silicon Valley also remains strong, as another 1 million square feet were absorbed during the quarter, including the balance of Amazon's research unit in Sunnyvale, which is expected to add 2,000 jobs. The balance of the region accounted for another 600,000 square feet of leasing activity, with 230,000 square feet in the open MSA. Commercial leasing activity in this market is increasing, and we expect stronger absorption in the coming quarters with subsequent benefits to our East Bay portfolio. Supply expectations for the year remain unchanged and the new apartment offerings in San Jose continue to lease well. We have yet to see an adverse affect from these projects. Next year's growth expectations include this new competition, with contingencies for possible concession activity. Again, it is our view that strong job growth in Silicon Valley and tight occupancies in the submarket, coupled with very limited single-family home deliveries, will allow for the new apartment supply to be absorbed and rents to grow as well. Finally, looking at Southern California. The jobs picture in Southern California is improving. We have experienced a year-over-year decline in unemployment of 2%. September's jobs report was up 1.8%, 40 basis points higher than the national average. Next year, we expect the region to match the national average, with Orange County leading the way. Office space absorption for Southern California was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter, as another 1.1 million square feet was absorbed during the period. Of note, Orange County accounted for 700,000 square feet of that space. Downtown Los Angeles and the West Side remain the best locations for us in Southern California, but Orange County improved in occupancy and rent growth during the quarter, and we remain optimistic that this region will continue to enjoy improved performance throughout 2013. Our performance was strong enough to increase our year end guidance, but more importantly, we feel confident about 2013. All indications are that Seattle and the Bay Area will remain strong, as Southern California continues to build steam. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Before I turn the call back to the operator for questions, I will quickly highlight the accomplishments during the quarter from 4 key activities. First, our same property operating results, from both a year-over-year increase in revenues and a year-over-year increase in net operating income, were the best quarterly results reported by the apartment REITs. We believe that these sector-leading results should continue throughout 2013. Second, the accretion from our 2011 and 2012 property acquisitions, and from our Via development, is reported in our net operating income from non-same property results on S-7. These results have far exceeded our '12 guidance and are key contributors to our leading year-over-year FFO growth. With the recently announced property acquisition and the earlier-than-expected delivery and lease up of Expo, we expect to have sector leading FFO growth continue into '13. Third, we demonstrated the strength of our balance sheet by executing a $300 million public bond offering at a 3.625% fixed coupon, which is a record low coupon for a public debut of REIT 10-year unsecured debt, and within 20 basis points of a fixed 10-year rate from Freddie or Fannie. And lastly, with the dispositions and expected sale of the Fund II assets, our co-investment activities demonstrate the capabilities of the Essex platform by attracting institutional capital, which is deployed into the best apartment markets on the West Coast, coupled with better-than-market rent growth, with value creating improvements and property operations that improve the resident experience, enables us to sell these assets and generate attractive returns that meet our investor's high expectations. I would now like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I kind of just have to ask, since you've put it out there and elaborated a little bit. But could you just set some parameters for us in terms of how would you define a strategic opportunity?
Michael J. Schall: That's an interesting question. I don't think I really have a way of defining it. I would say it is something that is -- what we're trying to indicate that we're not doing is just going out and buying common stocks and making that type of investment. We view this as something that we think there is some strategic fit for the company. But the problem is, if you go down that road and start talking about any part of it, I think it diminishes what we're trying to accomplish. And so, that's all I'm going to say at this point, Dave.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: And then just going over to the 2013 rent growth estimates. I'd be curious just to maybe get some color around the relative outlook for Class A versus B assets. When you think about the supply coming on in some of your markets, I'm sure that John would have some thoughts on that, and that would be helpful.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, actually this is Mike. I'll take that one and John can add to it if he wants. We view the A's and B's as being fairly similar. It depends on what's going on in the local market. I'll give you an example. Probably the area that has the greatest, Dave, would be the area around the Irvine Ranch, because Irvine Ranch has the ability of producing a lot of A-type product. And so what we try to do is look at the amount of A in the marketplace relative to the broader stock and try to judge whether that's the appropriate amount of A product, again, relative to the high-end renter demand. And so, based on that, we will make a decision as to whether we think the As are going to outperform the Bs or vice versa. So that's how we approach it. We do it on a submarket-by-submarket basis. We don't believe these broad statements about As doing better than Bs or Bs doing better than As, really has a lot of merit overall. As, obviously, we're producing more apartments going forward, and as that happens, we are going -- almost all of the apartment deliveries are going to be in the A category. We are going to become more sensitive to how much A product is in the market relative to the overall housing stock.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. That's helpful. Mike, one other just big picture question for you. Shortly after you took over as CEO, you kind of set forth some thoughts, and one of them was keeping the size of the Essex portfolio in the total capitalization range of $7 billion to $10 billion. Do you continue to think that way or has that changed?
Michael J. Schall: The backdrop for that comment was trying to balance the external growth component with the internal growth component. And we -- and Essex, I think, has a reputation for being a very savvy investor, and clearly, I don't want to lose that. And we want the impact of being a savvy investor to show up in the numbers, right? By not having the base so large that it doesn't matter what we buy or build because there's so many shares outstanding that it gets diluted in that effort. So what we're trying to do is have a balanced program of internal and external, and still, we are still comfortable within the $7 billion to $10 billion range at this point in time And we'll look to that. But I will also make a comment that we are spending, really, considerable time and effort, now that the size of the portfolio is $8.5 billion, roughly, in terms of value, more time and effort as it relates to the asset management and operations in automating the operating process, re-thinking the platform. Because when you get to a certain size, the relationships between what you spend on new systems and processes and that type of thing, are easy to allocate over a broader portfolio. So I think there's some real opportunity in that area as well. But for now, still comfortable in the $7 billion to $10 billion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stevenson of Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Sitting with a $925 million development pipeline, with your share roughly $550 million or so, how are you guys thinking about incremental starts over the next 6 to 9 month? Especially given that most of your deliveries right now are '14, and so, starting anything in the near term would probably accentuate that.
John D. Eudy: This is John Eudy. Everything that we have in the pipeline now, the 9 deals, the $940 million you referenced, are under construction. Behind that, we don't have a lot in our shadow pipeline, quite frankly. So I think what you're going to see is most of our product delivers in the second and third quarter next year, going into first and second of '14. And from there it's just a matter of whether or not we decide to pull the trigger on future deals.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. How aggressively are you guys pursuing land for future development today?
John D. Eudy: Well, it's hard. As you know, the genesis of our portfolio that were developing and under construction now were started 2 years ago, and if you mark the land basis that we're in at, to market, we're about half of market today. And as Mike noted, our current cap rate on the pipeline is in the low 6 range. The same with current land values would be in the low 5 range, and that's a harder thing for us to make an easy decision on. Really good location would get some -- a deal that we can't pass up or some accommodation from the city on fee waivers, there could be a deal that pops up, but it's going to be difficult.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then, Mike Dance, where are you seeing the greatest upward pressure, today, on the expense side?
Michael T. Dance: Not really anywhere. I mean, we continue to manage expenses. They're more timing when they come. That happened to be -- last year our expenses were really low in the fourth quarter, as we tried to make some stretch NOI goals for fourth quarter last year. So we have a hard comp on expenses for next year. We do -- I've mentioned in the past, property taxes in California. We do have some Prop. 8 adjustments. We'll be seeing those in our 2013 numbers, likely to start coming in. They were muted for the second half of this year. So my concerns were not -- have been alleviated, and for Prop. 8 adjustments for the second half of this year, but it should show up in the second half of '13. And then probably, one area where we don't have as much cap on or being able to predict property taxes would be in the Seattle area. And in Seattle, set values have increased significantly. We haven't gotten the levy rates yet. But depending on where those levy rates are, that could be an area in '13 that could be an area beyond our control.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just last question. When you guys look back over the last 5, 7, 10 years, how have you guys historically done versus the overall market and submarkets from a rent growth standpoint?
Michael J. Schall: How have we done relative to our expectations? Is that what you're...
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: No. I mean, is it -- so if I tell you that San Jose is a 4% rental rate growth market over the last 10 years, I mean, where are you guys normally in those...
Michael J. Schall: I see, relative to the broader market. We are somewhere within the broader market, and I think that the opportunities to outperform the market are really -- from the perspective of rehab, certainly there is some incremental growth over the market. A number of buildings that we bought have been bought from owners that have owned property for long periods of time. They haven't spent a nickel on them for 30 years, the old syndicators and that type of thing. And the opportunity to both put some money in the building and improve the quality of management, I think adds some incremental value as well. And so I think that those are the main opportunities out there. Those are things that we're looking for when we are buying properties in the marketplaces, where we have an information advantage and our information advantage can lead to a little bit better performing acquisition, which I think we've pretty clearly demonstrated over the last couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo Securities.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I'm just considering your forecast for 2013, specifically for the Bay Area. It looks like you’re expecting rent growth to decelerate about 250 to 300 basis points from what you've realized year-to-date. Just trying to understand your assumptions, because with an expectation of what I think is increased net absorption, and pluses [ph] in the forecast, you should have the same or better pricing power. So, I guess, I'm curious. Is that a degree of conservatism in your forecast or on your rent growth prospects or are you expecting to hit some degree of, I guess I'll call it, a ceiling on affordability?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, I think. This is Mike. Clearly, when you look at the jobs that we are assuming and the broader economic recovery, which we think benefits probably the left Coast over other parts of the nation, that would -- I totally agree with you. That looks like we have another undersupplied housing scenario. But I guess the other thing that concerns us, and tempers that a bit, is how much of income is being -- how much of people's income is being consumed by rent. And so, we think -- we use the metric of rents-to-median-income as an indicator of the point at which people choose to move farther out into the hinter lands, let's say, or double up more and/or other things that change the world. And in fact, if I go back into our history bank, we hit the all-time high rent-to-median-income around year 2000, in San Francisco. And if you just look at what happens in that scenario, you will find employers moving people to Denver and Phoenix, and a lot of things that have a muting impact on what's going on in the local marketplace. So, our view is to try to keep our expectations within the range of sustainable, let's say, rent-to-median-income levels. I guess, the other related point is that median incomes, their personal income growth has been very substantial over the last couple of years. So, obviously, that could add fuel to the ability to get very large increases over a longer period of time. But it's more difficult to predict and so we're assuming that we're going to hit some resistance is, in effect, what's happening. And that's what's causing us to lower our expectations relative to what we have in 2012.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Where do you think is the ratio is today, and can you remind us what the peak was?
John Lopez: Yes, this is John Lopez. We're a little bit ahead in San Francisco, in the low 20s. The peak was 30-plus percent in Silicon Valley. In Oakland we're a little bit below. In Seattle, we still have a ways to go to get there, so it's the ones with the most gaps that build up. So San Francisco is our only market where we're a little bit above. But I think if you historically, that, in expansion [ph] period, it gets very high.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess I had the same question for Southern California, but there I would say that it's a similar dynamic of net absorption, but you're expecting revenue growth to accelerate. Is that because you think it's a little bit more affordable down there, if you will, you have a little bit more leeway to push?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Southern California is, in our view, much different position. We've had very limited rent growth in Southern California. It's the last major metro in the country to recover. Whereas in Northern California, we've had 25% rent growth over the last couple of years, we've had a fraction of that in Southern California. And at the same time, Southern California has not had nearly the job growth that the tech markets in Northern California and Seattle have benefited from. So it's actually a much different dynamic and so we just think it's a couple of years behind Northern California in terms of its recovery. If you look at rents now to the prior peak, in many places it's still below prior peak rents, where we are well above prior peak rents in Seattle and Northern California. So all those factors combined lead us to believe that Southern California accelerates, Northern California and Seattle are modestly lower.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And just a last question. Could you tell us what the move-outs to home purchase and home rental were?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. It was 10.5% for the most recent quarter, down from about 11.5% in the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on that conversation about Southern California accelerating, and it sounded like in your comments, Mike, that you guys are really going to be focused there on the acquisition front in the coming quarters. Can you just talk about how much of your portfolio you'd like to potentially position in Southern Cal in an ideal world, today? And which markets specifically you'd be targeting?
Michael J. Schall: Sure. Well, our Southern California portfolio has been high as 60%, and we've made efforts to invest more in Northern California and Seattle over the last couple of years. Because we predicted, I think correctly, that those markets would experience the strongest growth and it would happen sooner than Southern California. And so, again, with 25% rent growth up north over the last couple of years, the natural inclination is to shift more of the acquisition focus in Southern California. Not to say, though, that we won't buy in Northern California. I don't want to create that image at all. Over the long haul, if you look at this 20-year compounded annual growth rates of rents, Northern California has been the strongest market in our portfolio. So we have sort of the long-term in the back of our minds, and in the shorter-term, obviously, I think it has to decelerate to some extent. I think it'll still remain a very good market, but it's not possible, in my opinion, to produce 7% to 8% rent growth over a prolonged period of time. So we'll move to Southern California. To get to your -- the specific relationships, I think that Southern California could go to maybe up 10% from where it is now. So it could get in the high 50% range. But, again, I think that we are -- Northern California is the area that has the best longer-term growth and we're going to be protective of our allocation here because of that factor.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And are you equally interested in L.A., Orange County, San Diego or is there one particular area that you're more focused on in Southern Cal?
Michael J. Schall: No, we definitely have submarkets that we like more than others. And, in this case, we like to the CBD L.A. We like the West side, the Marina. We like, really, the tri-cities area, Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank. The coastal markets through Orange County would be the targets that we're focused on.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. Next question, just on development and it sounds like you're not planning to add much new to that pipeline in the near term. Is that -- I guess the part of it is that, as you said, yields on -- if you bought new land today, yields would be relatively low. Is it also that you're starting to see some maturation in the cycle? And given the long lead time to get something done that you're maybe expecting slower growth for new starts if you started anything new today?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, the thought process really goes back to how do you deal with uncertainty as it relates to the broader markets and the broader economy. And the decision early on to match fund all of our acquisitions, i.e. not increased leverage on the balance sheet, the decision to use a institutional partner, with respect to a lot of our development transactions, and the decision to -- essentially the day that we commit, very shortly after that, start construction. So not have a long delay period where construction costs can increase and you're subjected to other risks that can pretty dramatically change your expected results, which is exactly what happened in the last cycle, by the way. And so the combination of uncertainty in the -- as to the general economy, and our preference to try and have a more risk adverse view of our external growth platform, is really where we've come, and how our portfolio and our development deals have evolved. So, going forward, that uncertainty certainly hasn't abated, and we're still looking at a lot of deals. In fact, John, a year ago, set up triage because we had so many deals to go through. And most of them didn't qualify for what we were looking for. We continue to look at a lot of deals and there's certainly no shortage there. But in terms of actually hitting what we consider the sweet spot of the development program is something that we're struggling with. So not to say we aren't looking at a lot of deals, we are looking at a lot of deals, and we may do some. And we do have a couple of deals that are land banked that we could start in the next couple of years. But it's just finding the deals that we think fit our profile and fit our parameters, is a struggle.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. Last question. I think there was some talk on the last call about rent control concerns in Northern California. Is there anything new, positive or negative, on that front?
Michael J. Schall: No, nothing new on that front. It continues to be an issue just because of the magnitude of the rent increases and the politicians in terms of an issue that they can get their arms around, that is certainly one, but nothing recently has happened. I did talk to the President of CAA the other day, and he was -- he acknowledged that we've been pretty helpful in some of the efforts to mediate between cities and residents, some of the rent increases. So yes, I think it's more of the same. I think it's -- I haven't heard anything new at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: The first question, Mike, just goes to the stock investment. When you guys bought the unsecured bonds, clearly, there's an ability to underwrite what the cash flows are. When you're doing a stock investment, it's based on sort of how the market interprets the story, which is obviously different than how bonds are priced. So while I understand that you want to keep quiet on the strategic part of it, how do you guys gain comfort, the same comfort that you have on that downside protection?
Michael J. Schall: Alex, the problem with this whole topic is, without revealing the nature of what we're doing and how we're going to do it, yes, I can't answer you, I can't answer the question. I mean, to answer that question, I would have to be able to talk freely about the nature of the investment and why we are pursuing it. So I'm kind of in a difficult spot with respect to this question and other related questions. I understand that the market would like to understand what we're doing, but let's keep in mind that it's a relatively small investment to the size of the company, and we will disclose what we can, and we will. I mean, it's our practice, I think, to be pretty open and transparent as a company. We'll disclose information as we can, we just can't do it right now because who knows how that could impact what we're trying to accomplish. So I can't add anymore at this point.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: No, I think that's fair. Listen, you guys have clearly, as you said, demonstrated savvy and the market certainly gives you guys credit for doing this stuff. It's just -- help us gain further insight, but understand that you want to keep it close to the vest. Let me ask you a question, for Mike Dance. On the Fund II dispositions and the policies, I don't have a supplemental in front of me, I don't have working Internet. Do you -- what's the potential for any promote cert [ph] , chocolate chips, if you will, in '13 versus '14 that we should be thinking about?
Michael T. Dance: There's possibility for both in '13 and '14 depending on the timing of the last sale. So it's back-end loaded because the promote is very sensitive to how these last assets are going to sell. And if we get to the extension in the '14, that will either put them in last half of '13 or early '14.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And if you can't provide any color right now, when you guys provide fourth quarter guidance, would that include a range of potential for those promotes? Or because they're really subjective to when the sales finalize even in the fourth -- even in the '13 guidance provided in the fourth quarter, it still wouldn't been in there?
Michael T. Dance: We would provide in, as we have in the past, a range of possible other income. So I could see some wide [ph] range of possibilities there.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just the final question. In Seattle, saw a news item that you guys sold Tower 801. Just sort of curious if that's a submarket decision or if that was an asset-specific decision.
Michael T. Dance: That was a Fund II decision and -- so that was one of our Fund II assets. And as you know, there is a lot of downtown Seattle development that will be coming online, so looking at the Fund II assets to sell and the timing, we thought we're going to have to sell it eventually. If we could own it, we would have bought it from the Fund, but that's not our deal. But we just figured it was the right time to sell that, pass that this year rather than next year when some of the new deliveries will be occurring.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: First question. In the guidance that you provided, you talked about some of the acquisition upside. Can you give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like today, what could close in the fourth quarter? And also, just any change you've seen in pricing in the last 90 days would be helpful as well.
Michael J. Schall: No change in pricing in the last 90 days. It's interesting because obviously, given said efforts to keep interest rates low and lower, we're seeing some pretty amazing debt rates on 10 years from Fannie, Freddie and certainly, in the unsecured market. In my comments, I noted that we have $186 million in contract, contingencies removed. The timing of that will be mostly fourth quarter. There are some loan assumptions and some other things that could impact that timing, but most of it will close in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of product on the market as well, and so our acquisition people are busy now. Every year, there are some tax-motivated sellers that need a quick close type of scenario. We're hoping for that this year, still too early to tell, but we always like those deals because there's such strong motivation on behalf of the sellers. So $186 million, thus far, and we're looking at lots of other things. So hopefully that helps.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Second, probably a question for Erik. In the third quarter of last year, your occupancy dropped then picked up sharply towards the end. I think in October, you had a very good pickup. Can you tell us how kind of October trended versus last year and where occupancy is at this point versus the occupancy last year?
Erik J. Alexander: Better. Seriously, the -- again, it's been smoother this year. So I think our strategy on pricing, particularly renewals and on the new lease side, we paid attention to some of the relationships between net availability and pricing earlier, and again, just worked that equation a little bit differently. I think last year, I talked about how the pickup really started in September, maybe second week of September, and then ran through the middle of October, and by the time it got to the end of the month, settled in at whatever that ending rate was. As of yesterday, physical occupancy was in the 96.3% range portfolio-wide. And so that's the reason -- that's where we stand.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: How does that compare versus last year at the same point?
Erik J. Alexander: I don't have that in front of me, but I think it's about -- I don't have it in front of me. It's similar though. I mean, I can -- it's either at the same level or it might have been 10 basis points higher because we got after the leasing aggressively to make sure that we got to essentially the point that we wanted to be, which is where we are today. We like exactly where we are today in that 96.3% range with 5% availability looking out 45 days. So a very manageable supply between now and the end of the year.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Then, finally, Mike Dance, not to leave you out. On the Fund II sales, did you give what the gain on a gross book value basis was? And can you comment what the IRR on those, the 7 that were sold were, at Fund II [ph] ?
Michael T. Dance: Yes. We will have the gain -- Bryan gave me his number. I'll have to get back to you on that. I just -- it escapes my memory right now. But we do have a number that we can provide. And the IRRs today are around 10%. So we're expecting the promote to come with the second half sales, where some of our bigger gains are in the Bay Area assets we bought. And those will be sold either late '13, early '14. But given the high rent growth we continue to see in -- on the peninsula, we didn't want to sell those yet.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Can you remind us what the hurdle rate on that -- on Fund II was?
Michael T. Dance: It's 10%. So we're -- we've now paid out the hurdle rate. So everything else that we earn above the 10% will have a promote.
Operator: Next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citigroup.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I think in your opening remarks, you talked about the home prices in your markets being up, I guess, 7% to 17%, so pretty strong on a year-over-year basis. Just curious, if you look at it, if it's not your renters and other first time homebuyers that are moving out to single-family housing that's pushing up pricing. Is this just a sort of temporary short-term squeeze due to a lack of supply or do you see these gains as being stable?
Michael J. Schall: Well, that is a very good question, and I'm not sure I have the complete answer. I can tell you that as you start getting these big numbers in home prices, a couple of things happen, one good, one not so good. The good part of it is that the affordability, the ability to shift from a renter to a homeowner becomes more difficult to occur. So we like that. But at the same time, as the price goes up, you're going to start seeing more homebuilding in these markets. And our view is that apartments are essentially the shock absorber within the market. So to the extent you build a home, we assume that it's going to be bought by someone and it's going to absorb a household. So the confluence, I guess, the relationship between the 2 is, I guess, number one, for a couple of years, I think we're good because we have very muted levels of for-sale housing coming at us. But we're going to be mindful of that and we're going to track it carefully because again, our view is that to the extent they're built, they are going to be occupied and they're going to take away from the renter demand.
Erik J. Alexander: Eric, I just want to add that our affordability levels are returning to more normalized levels we'd expect to see. So I would believe that these gains are not a temporary jump, but sustainable.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess, along the same line, you talked a little bit about the supply of single-family homes maybe coming back. As a response to these gains, which I guess may not be stable, but how quickly do you think that could happen? And do you see it being more of a trickle or a flood, and is it likely to hit more of your sort of peripheral markets versus your core markets?
Michael J. Schall: I think that we don't have the ability, except in a couple of places where you have massive tracts of land that are ground zero, competing against our apartments. I guess one of the notable exceptions would be the South Orange County market, where there actually is quite a bit of open space and the ability to build homes that -- and they can be built fairly quickly. If we use the last cycle as sort of an indication of what's going to come at us, there were a lot of thousands of condo buildings that were built in the coastal markets. The timeframe for building that type of product is obviously much more like an apartment, it's going to take longer. Our ability to track it and identify it and understand its impact is much greater. So I think that in the coastal markets that we focus on, you're going to see -- you will start seeing that again, but I think it's a couple of years off. And so with respect to the product that can be generated more quickly, which is more like the single-family homes, I think that, that's going to be -- it's going to be muted, but there are a couple of areas that we're concerned will have more of that. San Diego would be the other example of an area that we'd be concerned about in terms of the ability to produce single-family housing.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. Great. And sort of a weird question here, but you talked a little bit about strategic position. You wouldn't ever consider some type of position in a homebuilder or something sort of outside your core focus. I mean, what you're talking about is something that's really more specific to Essex.
Michael J. Schall: Again, I have -- this is the problem Mike. It's almost like I can't say anything without providing a piece of information that I just -- I can't do it. It sort of handcuffs me as a question, so I just can't comment. Sorry for the frustration that might cause.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So to what extent that you mentioned the 13% of move-outs for financial reasons are -- I'm not exactly sure how you put it, affordability or whatever it was, but you indicated that might be growing in 2013 as well. To what extent is that influencing your rent growth assumption for 2013 moderating? Does it have an influence on that calculation?
Michael J. Schall: No, it doesn't. Again, I've talked about it before. It's been higher in the past. I think same period last year, it was closer to 17% or 18% of the move-outs. We're citing this as a reason. And again, basically, I'm combining people that tell us that either their apartment is too expensive or that they're specifically moving out due to a rent increase. And so again, we've seen that number stable or even come down. So at this point, it is not impacting how we are projecting 2013.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Mike, or whoever, you'd mentioned that you could see Southern California climb 10 percentage points to 50% from about 40% currently. How is that going to accomplish it? Will it be purely through acquisitions or will it also be a time to be a seller following the huge rent growth in Northern California?
Michael J. Schall: I could see, Rich, us selling some assets in Northern California and Seattle, and we would tend to look at these secondary locations. John Burkart is actually here. He is the keeper of the dispo list, and he -- there are some assets on there that are more secondary areas of the San Jose MSA and the other Northern California and Seattle markets. So it'll be that, and to the extent we can build in Southern California, we still would like to do that. We have a couple of development deals that are under construction in West Hollywood, and so that could be a component of it. But again, most of the -- there's so little production of housing in these markets that almost by default, most of it is going to be acquisition-oriented. So it will be a combination of all those.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And regarding some of your past and most recent investment activity, buying buildings that are more better-suited potentially for condominiums, Skyline for example, to what degree is that strategy something that you'll continue to pursue or is it kind of gone? Or maybe from a risk perspective, you don't want to go down that path much more. Or where are you on that strategy from an acquisition standpoint?
Michael J. Schall: We still like it. We think that the opportunities to execute it are few and far between. Most of the transactions that we did in 2010, 2011 involved a financial institution of some kind, which are great sellers because they're very motivated and you have certainty of closing, in some cases, actually in a couple of those cases, we had to underwrite the asset and remove contingencies within a week, for example, because they're so motivated. And so we don't see the motivation of the financial intermediaries to nearly that -- nearly the same extent at this point in time. There are a few transactions that we see that have condo maps and we give a little bit of extra credit, let's say, to those transactions just in recognition of the scarcity of condo maps within these markets. And so we -- contingencies, some transactions that have that. But I think most of the real opportunity has been -- has been realized on that front. I note that the increase in single-family home prices is obviously a tremendous benefit as it relates to that strategy. So it's a mixed bag for us because on the one hand, we know that if housing prices go up significantly, we're going to see more housing, more for-sale housing being delivered, but at the same time, the condo optionality becomes more meaningful on our portfolio. So again, a good and a bad.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then my last question is, first, I'm hopeful that you won't bite my head off by asking it, but I'm just going to ask it anyway. And obviously...
Michael J. Schall: It is your nature, Rich, to do that.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So, but I think it's benign enough. And I'm just curious, not on the stock investment issues specifically, but just a general rule of thumb, to what degree is this a normal course of business for Essex? How often do you make stock purchases as a general rule of thumb and is it something that isn't so far afield from what you've done in the past?
Michael J. Schall: It's a good question. Obviously, most people know that we were pursuing Town and Country several years ago. I guess the other factor that's a little different now is we self-insure. We've got an insurance captive with somewhere around $30 million in it. And so we tranche that, by giving it a very safe tranche, and then less safe tranches. So as you get more money in the captive, we're going to be buying -- we will be making investments and they will be, by their nature, liquid. Mostly bonds probably, but there is a chance for some common stock investments within that entity. But this, I would view this as being very unusual and something that we think we can add value. I think we have a reputation as being a very value-oriented company and try to be opportunistic. But at the same time, I think that we're also pretty darn risk-adverse as well. So certainly, that's the influence of George Marcus for many years, being both sides, opportunistic and sensitive to risk. So where we see opportunities that sort of fit within that box, we feel compelled to move on it. I think the other bias of our board is, let's not do things that are so large and such large bets that we undermine the good thing that we have going. I mean that comment is something that is often stated at the board level. And so within that discussion, I would expect this to be sort of within that same vein. There's an opportunistic element, there's a strategic element, there's an element that says don't make it so large that it could affect the good thing that we have, the good things that we have going, and I think that's what we're doing. It will all become clear down the road as we all know.
Operator: Our next session comes from Andrew McCulloch of Green Street Advisors.
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Just back to the common stock investment, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here, but I think one of the things that makes investors a little uneasy, in addition to the fact that you're not letting anyone know what you're investing in, is that you're also issuing common stock at the same time. When you issue common stock at a big premium to either [ph] buy apartment assets, that's arbitrage. But when you issue common stock to buy common stock in another company, unless it's another apartment REIT, that's pure speculation. And I guess my question is, why would investors want Essex issuing common stock to make purely speculative investments in other common stock?
Michael J. Schall: I mean, I don't necessarily agree with your characterization. I mean, we're issuing common stock and we've got a very robust acquisition and development pipeline. And so I don't think you really know that, that's exactly what we're doing. Having said that, I don't think you should -- you know who we are. We have a 20-year track record and I don't think we have too many crazy things that we've done over that period of time, so I would ask that you see it through with us, and in the end, I don't think that anyone will be disappointed or think that it's something that's hugely speculative or out of character. So again, I go back to what I just said, which is we have, we try to be opportunistic, I think you all want us to be opportunistic within the balance of let's not do anything that's going to undermine the great things that are happening out here, and I think this fits nicely within that. So I think if we were talking about an enormous investment, I would agree with you, Andy. But in this case, I just think we're making too -- making much out of something that just really is not all that large.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question on the development side. If you could talk somewhat about development costs and just where you see that trending?
John D. Eudy: Sure. This is John Eudy. Fortunately, the pipeline that we have, the 9 deals, $934 million, all but the last probably 10% has been bought out and we priced it for the most part, on average, about a year ago. And we don't -- we're pretty safe there and we're trending on the portfolio to come in at or better than budget. At present, there has been some moves. We have the recent Sandy event, which is going to probably give a little spike to some of the material costs. We do think that costs are increasing, not as substantial as I think the recent Wall Street Journal seemed to indicate, of anything gross, but they are going up and that's one of the risks that we're being averse to. Better have your landing from 2 year ago prices and your costs in from 1 year ago than going forward. And that's why we're moderating our forward-looking activities carefully.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to the comments about rent income ratios. I mean, I did get this idea that the rent to income ratios are nowhere close to where their historical highs have been. But I'm just curious, with everything you're seeing in regards to job trends and overall market trends, whether you actually expect rent-to-income ratios to get as high as they were, kind of in the dot com era, or in the last real estate boom of 2004, 2005, 2006?
John Lopez: Yes, this is John Lopez. Only San Francisco is above its long-run trend. And so I would say that most of our markets are still below the long-run average, not anywhere near the highs. And San Francisco, where it's at right now, is not at the level you would expect to see in a very hot market. The second thing I'd like to add is we look at Seattle as a market where it was hit pretty hard in that it's becoming more of a market like our Northern California markets, and we expect that long-run average to actually increase over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just one big picture question. Just given how strong the fundamentals have remained, are you surprised that the apartment sector has not done better, has really just underperformed year-to-date?
Michael J. Schall: Wow, that's a great set up question, thank you. Thank you, Paula. I'll send you a check within the mail. Obviously, we're disappointed in the performance of the stock. I think the multifamily REITs are the poorest performer, stock-wise, this year, which may not be -- was true about a week ago, I think, but maybe changed a little bit. So, I mean, obviously, yes, but at the same time, we view our jobs as putting numbers on the board, growing cash flows, doing just smart real estate deals and we believe that the stock price will follow that effort. So we remain optimistic and we're happy with lots of things that are going on, and we hope that the stock reacts appropriately over time. And I think it will.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Do you think that investors though are -- that the concerns, particularly around that return of homeownership, have been overdone or do you think those are warranted given what you were saying in your comments earlier around housing prices and your fear that the inventory will increase?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. The comments that we've made are in no small part, trying to put that issue into perspective because I think there is sort of a homogenization of America in terms of the data. And I think that the regional variations are very significant, and so I think that what works in the general theme may not work as to every company and every location. We recognize this as being a very local business, and relationships that may apply on a national basis will probably, ultimately apply to us, but there can be a couple of years of lag between them. So I think in this case, there's a couple of key points that really matter here. Number one is our rents fell further than most. Our prior peak to the trough was off 15% as a company. And so we expected a strong bounce and we got a strong bounce. From that though, we started at a very low point. We were about 2 years later to recover, given the fact that head [ph] Companies prove that they can restructure very quickly, and so we had very significant job losses for a period time, which led to the rent reductions, but it also set up the opportunity to add jobs quickly when conditions were better. So our view is that if you have those 2 things in context and then you also look at what happened in the for-sale area, where you had all these vacant condo buildings, really demonstrate the distress within the for-sale markets. And again, we were able to buy 8 of them over that period of time, and it just shows you how much distress there was. And again, that will recover as well, and -- but it's not happening yet. And so I think you have -- you've got to look at regionally, with respect to the different elements of supply and demand, and you'll see why we're as optimistic as we are in our comments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Really quickly in the call, you guys have done a lot of transactions both on the buy and the sell side in California. And I'm just curious, have you been able to have any kind of efficiency in terms of Prop. 13 when you're entering or disposing of assets?
Michael T. Dance: No. I mean, when you buy or sell an asset, which is different than development, they're going to use your purchase price, and whatever adjustments we do for GAAP accounting, they kind of ignore. They just use the -- what's recorded in the purchase sale agreement. Development is more of an art. They try to come in and assess us a fair value. They can't mark up the land, but they can mark up the improvements on the development. So there, we have had some success on the development side, but acquisitions and the dispositions, it's pretty black and white.
Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So even in the history of the company, like way back when, when you sold the Fund straight to UDR, even if you do an entity-level transaction, that you're still going to get a markup?
Michael T. Dance: Well, with UDR, you'll have to talk to them. But I imagine if there were assets outside the state, they would've tried to change the allocations. I can't remember all of the assets of the Fund, but there may have been some allocations because there was a purchase price, they had some flexibility and ability to allocate within or without the State of California to maximize their tax position. But you'll have to check with them on what they did.
Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. And this just one thing. This is indirect to this year purchases. You increased your interest in other income guidance by $600,000. Is that because you're carrying the additional common stock, which is producing a dividend?
Michael T. Dance: I think that falls under Mike's previous comments. We're just not going to go there, Andrew.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess, there's a lot of talk about this common stock investment. And while you've been on the phone, your stock is down $1. BRE's stock is up $1. So I don't know why everybody's beating around the bush here. Can you at least tell us what this is not as opposed to what this is? If this is BRE, can -- do you have any intent or are you buying BRE Stock? Do you have any intent of merging with BRE? Are you in discussions with BRE?
Michael J. Schall: Ross, you know I can't answer those questions. I mean...
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Well, if I asked you if you had any intent of merging with IBM, you'd answer the question. So, I guess, you guys opened the door by making a strategic investment, you've told us nothing about it, you won't tell us if you're going to be buying the entity, selling the position and I guess, maybe the question then becomes how long do you plan on keeping us all in the dark for on this?
Michael J. Schall: Well, I would argue that you're really in the dark. We have disclosures that we have made. And you know the relative size of the investment and you can judge that relative to the size of the company. And there are laws that concern other disclosures that are out there. And so again, I can't say anything more.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: All right. I mean, I hope you can understand there is a sense of frustration out there because I think people are concerned that this isn't just a small investment, that it is going to be something bigger, and they don't want to get in front of that until they know more.
Michael J. Schall: I understand.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Michael Schall, you mentioned Town and Country in your response to a question. I guess, what is your thoughts on new markets and markets outside the West Coast and your interest level?
Michael J. Schall: Michael, we continue to be interested in markets outside the West Coast. The fact pattern of Town and Country is, I think, important and maybe instructive in that, at that time, West Coast was, I'd say, marginally ahead of the East Coast in terms of overall asset pricing and cap rate and just overall attractiveness in terms of where the West Coast was in the cycle and the East Coast. We view this business as, a good strategy is great and important, but only when coupled with good decisions with respect to timing and value create -- the value creation thesis. So in this case, I would say the reverse is -- has happened, which is, at least to this point, the East Coast was ahead of the West Coast in terms of recovery and in terms of asset pricing and valuation. So hopefully, that gives you some idea of how we think about these things.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then the $73 million that's in marketable securities, so the $43 million that was there as of the second quarter and the $30 million that you added to it, the entirety of that is one single position and one single security or is there multiple positions in there?
Michael J. Schall: The vast majority of it is one position.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then has anything been added to that position during the fourth quarter or is $73 million the current standing position?
Michael J. Schall: No.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then, I guess, just from a disclosure perspective, there's obviously your own disclosure, which you've made, and I guess once you reach 5% of the entity, you would have to disclose a shareholder perspective, correct?
Michael J. Schall: We will comply with the law, correct.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So then, therefore, the target has a minimum market cap of $1.5 billion because you haven't reached 5% yet, and potentially, you could be at 4.9%. And with normal leverage, the entity would be greater than $2.5 billion. And I think that just goes to Ross' question about it's a small position relative to the current size, but clearly, as a totality, if you were to move forward on the security, this obviously is a large investment at some point.
Michael J. Schall: Can't argue with your math.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then onto the last question, in a lot of M&A type scenarios, a lot of situations, people use derivatives, puts, calls in order to get their stake up. Do you have any of that today or is your position entirely built up of shares of common stock?
Michael J. Schall: We have no derivatives.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
Michael J. Schall: Well, thank you very much for the spirited debate this morning, and we appreciate your participation on the call. Obviously, we're pleased with the results of the company during the quarter and our outlook for next year, and hey, we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in San Diego in a couple of weeks. Thanks so much for being with us today.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may now begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2012 earnings call. Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments on operations and finance, respectively; John Eudy and John Lopez are here for Q&A. I'll cover the following 3 topics on the call: number one, Q2 results and market commentary; second, the investment market; and third, an update on California, California itself and the policies and political situation. First topic, Q2 results and market commentary. Last evening, we reported core FFO of $1.66 per share for the second quarter of 2012, which was at the high end of the company's guidance range discussed on last quarter's call. We continue to see strong growth in Northern California and Seattle and an uneven recovery with pockets of strength in Southern California. Apartment conditions remain strong, demonstrated by same-store revenue and NOI growth of 6.3% and 9.2%, respectively. These results lead us to reiterate our expectation for a strong second half of 2012 and continuing into 2013, driven by limited supplies of housing and job growth that exceeds the national averages in Northern California and Seattle and is modestly below the national average in Southern California. We don't see a significant departure from this basic theme until at least 2014. Erik will discuss portfolio trends in greater detail. Our research team tracks many of the major employers in our coastal markets for insights into hiring expectations and other trends that can affect apartments. While job growth has remained quite strong, there are several companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo! and Cisco, that have reported job reductions, along with restructuring programs. Still, other tech companies have missed analyst expectations and have reported slower earnings growth. We view these announcements as typical and necessary for technology companies. Tech companies of all sizes are forced to innovate or fail, as timely product R&D, product updates and similar advancements are necessary to survive. When innovation fails, companies are quickly forced into a restructuring mode, and layoffs are a common result. Our expectation is that a relatively small number of tech companies will be in a restructuring mode nearly all the time. Despite the concerns noted above, current trends support continued job growth in technology. In Silicon Valley, for example, year-over-year job growth accelerated from 2.9% in 2011 to 3.8% in June 2012, with no slowdown in Q2. And the labor force grew by over 2.5%. Commercial activity continues to be positive and steady, and many large-scale commercial real estate projects have been started. We provide our annual job growth estimates that are part of our market forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement. This quarter, we increased our estimated job growth for 2012 in Northern California from 1.9% to 2.4%, and in Seattle from 2.0% to 2.4%. Our primary economic concerns relate to the ongoing uncertainty within the broader business environment, including the effects of public sector indebtedness, the potential impacts of the fiscal cliff and global financial issues. These issues threaten to derail the fragile U.S. recovery. We believe that these issues are best addressed by a strong balance sheet and a conservative capital structure. In development, we announced new apartment projects containing 971 apartment homes with an estimated total cost of $422 million. This brings our development pipeline outlined on Page S-9 of the supplement to almost $1 billion. I'm very pleased with the performance of our development team led by John Eudy, as the locations, designs and expected financial benefits from our apartment development activities are exceptional. As suggested on previous calls, most of our development transactions will be in a co-investment format, in which we own from 50% to 55%. We believe that the co-investment format improves our risk reward scenario and also reduces our forward funding commitments. We've commenced construction on most of our development pipeline, reducing risks of entitlement and construction costs, increases in delays and compressing the time between our funding obligation and the delivery of the community. We also moved up the opening of our Expo project to this October, approximately 6 months ahead of our original schedule, and reduced the estimated cost of construction by approximately $3 million. We now estimate that the stabilized cap rate on Expo will be in excess of 7%. Second topic, the investment markets. Cap rates continue to be aggressive in the coastal markets, and we have not -- and have not changed materially since last quarter. Cap rates range from 4% to 4.5% for A quality property in A locations and from 4.5% to near 5% for B property in A locations. As with 2011, transaction activity abated at year-end and increases throughout the spring and summer months. Through July, we closed $248 million in acquisitions, including the partner buyout at Skyline as outlined on Page S-15 of the supplement. We also have a very active pipeline of potential acquisitions that are under consideration, which makes us believe that acquisitions may exceed $500 million for 2012 versus our $400 million guidance. In fast-moving markets, we have an information advantage, given our economic research and historical data from our own portfolio. We continue to find value in acquisitions through redevelopment, anticipating market trends and value-added situations. Development deals on the West -- development deals on the West Coast, underwritten base on today's rent, generate development cap rates ranging from 5% to 5.5% or estimated to be 6.25% to 7% upon stabilization. Third topic is State of California. We remain concerned about the well-publicized fiscal issues in California, both at the state and local levels. At the state level, Governor Brown announced in May that the projected deficit has increased from approximately $9 billion to $16 billion. Governor Brown also warned that severe cuts to schools and public services would occur if the voters do not pass a tax increase proposal that he endorses. Under the plan, California would temporarily raise state sales tax by 0.25% and increase income tax on people that earn more than $250,000. Governor Brown has estimated that the tax initiative could raise up to $9 billion. Notably, the plan does not change Prop. 13. Given this situation, we continue to assume that government jobs will continue to be reduced as reflected in our market forecast. We are also concerned about growing political interest in pursuing rent control ordinances in various California cities. With rents increasing at double-digit rates in many parts of Northern California during 2011, 2012, obviously, many residents are being priced out of the local markets. This coincides with more complaints from residents and growing opposition and greater exposure to negative publicity from electronic media. I have commented before that we have provided residents with at least 1 renewal option that limits the rent increase to no more than 15%. Beginning in September, we'll reduce this renewal limitation to 10%. We believe that this will have a nominal impact on our financial results, as lower renewal rents will be partially offset by lower turnover costs, increased occupancy and increased rental rates for new leases. It will also be beneficial to our residents, which will hopefully -- who will hopefully differentiate Essex from many other landlords that impose no such limit. I believe strongly that the industry needs to impose thoughtful self-restraint with respect to renewal policy. That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to now turn the call over to Erik Alexander.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. As always, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm happy to report on another solid quarter of operations for Essex. So following the strong first quarter we executed the plan that we discussed on our last call, by trading some occupancy for rent growth in order to achieve the desired revenue gains. We actually only shed 70 basis points of occupancy during the quarter compared to the estimated 90 basis points, of which about half of that decline is attributable to increased renovation activities. As with the first quarter, demand in all of our markets remained strong, including improvement in San Diego. As expected, we experienced seasonally higher turnover during the second quarter, but our annualized rate of turnover through the first half of the year is only 50%. We still expect this ratio to be in the low 50% range for the full year. Although move-outs due to home purchases and rent increases were higher this quarter compared to the first quarter, both reasons for move-out are well within historical ranges. Less than 12% of residents moving out during the second quarter stated that they were doing so to purchase a house or condominium. This compares to 11% of responses received last quarter and 10% of move-outs during the second quarter of 2011. You may recall that this figure was north of 12% as recently as the second quarter of 2010 and as high as 18% in 2007. During the quarter, about 18% of residents moving out cited some kind of affordability issue as the primary motivation for giving us notice to vacate, including their most recent rent increase. This compares to 15% of all residents moving out last quarter and 15% in the second quarter of last year. The primary reason people give for leaving one of our communities remains moving out of the area and/or job change, with 25% of existing residents claiming 1 of these 2 factors. The bottom line is that so many qualified customers are coming in the front door where you have to be concerned about the pattern of move-out activity impacting our ability to grow revenues in our markets. Furthermore, new multifamily housing supply remained very low and largely concentrated in a few areas of the portfolio. These favorable supply conditions will allow Essex to grow rents at or beyond expectations in the coming quarters. Therefore, as long as job growth continues to meet or exceed expectations, we continue to believe that the fundamentals in our West Coast markets will help us deliver solid revenue growth into 2014. I think the rental rate growth that we continue to experience throughout the portfolio helps support that claim. During the quarter, we completed more than 3,400 new lease transactions and signed nearly 4,300 renewals. Portfolio-wide, renewal rates for the period were up 5.4% and were steady throughout the quarter. However, new lease rates continue to grow each month during the quarter and were 7.6% higher than expiring rates for the period and 8.5% better in July. Renewals recorded during July were 5.2% better than the expiring rental rates, with the expectations for August about the same. We are not concerned about a deceleration of rental rates. The fact is that we continue to see healthy rent growth throughout the portfolio and is merely being achieved in a different manner. I would note that the average expiring rate for those July renewals was $60 higher than the average expiring rate on renewed leases during the second quarter. Looking ahead, renewal offers for September and October average over 6% portfolio-wide, with a range of 3% to 5% in Southern California and 6% to 8% in Seattle and the Bay Area. At the end of July, our loss to lease for the portfolio was 5.1%. Turning our attention to new lease-up activities. We stabilized the Reveal asset during the quarter and are successfully renewing existing residents. Last month, we also began our pre-leasing activities at Expo in the Queen Anne section of downtown Seattle. As Mike commented, this development is tracking 6 months ahead of schedule, and we now expect to move our first residents in October. During the first couple of weeks of our soft opening, we've managed 16 net rentals despite not having access to the building. We expect to be conducting limited tours later this month so that we can take advantage of the persistent strong demand in Seattle. I'll provide more details about the project on our next call. Operating expenses continued to be under control with the second quarter same-store results, up less than 1% compared to last year and flat for the first half of 2012. Repairs, maintenance, administration and utilities all remained lower compared to the first half of 2011. Even with higher budgeted turnover costs related to volume, these little increases in repairs and maintenance and possible property tax adjustments related to California's Proposition 18 -- sorry, Proposition 8, we now expect total operating expenses not to increase by more than 2% for the entire year. Now I'll share some highlights to each of the regions beginning with Seattle. Year-to-date, Essex market rents were up 9.4% compared with 2011. The region as a whole is above the prior peak, and Seattle downtown in the East side remained the strongest submarket. As of July 30, occupancy was 96.2%, with a 30-day net availability of 6%. The jobs picture in the region continues to be strong, with unemployment falling to 7.2%. We have again raised our jobs forecast for the Seattle MSA and now expect 34,000 new jobs to be added in 2012 or a 2.4% growth. Tech and business services continue to lead the way for the region. The future outlook remains bright, as office leasing continues to be very strong as well. Another 850,000 square feet were absorbed during the quarter. Additionally, there is 1.2 million square feet of office space under construction, most of which is pre-leased. One of the more important factors that we see changing amidst the strong economic growth during the past 6 quarters is that we now expect rent-to-income levels to increase above the long-range average of 17%. Although still below that level today, development in Seattle is much more infill in nature, with barriers to supplier higher than in the past, home prices are rising and the region continues to evolve into a high-wage and tech-oriented economy. Therefore, the rent-to-income level will be able to push up to the 20% range like other established metros in the U.S. In Northern California, Essex market rents are up 8.1% year-over-year and 8.6% year-to-date. As of July 30, occupancy for the region was 97%, with a 30-day net availability of just 4.4%. Job growth in the Silicon Valley has been well-publicized, and similar to Seattle, this economy has outpaced our initial expectations. Led by technology expansion, we have revised our regional forecast up to 2.4% for the year. Despite the impressive job creation over the past 2 years, unemployment is falling but still above the national average and currently stands at 8.6% for the region. We view this as an indication that there's still room to grow in the Bay Area. Supply expectations for the year remain unchanged, but as the first projects in San Jose are being delivered, we're very pleased with the brisk leasing velocity being reported by others in the market. And as expected, these new offerings have not adversely affected our stabilized properties in the area. Looking to Southern California, the jobs picture remains a keen interest point as we all look for signs of growth, strength and sustainability in the region. Year-to-date, growth of the entire region is significantly better than last year, with June's year-over-year growth improving 1.7%. Specifically, Los Angeles is helping the cause, with growth in the private sector posting a 1.5% gain year-over-year. So despite losses in government jobs, we now see employment in Los Angeles growing by more than 1% in 2012. We recognize that we still need 350,000 jobs in Southern California to return to 2008 employment levels, but we are definitely headed in the right direction and I think have good reason to be optimistic about this market in the coming quarters. Office-based absorption for Southern California was positive for the fourth quarter in a row, and 1.7 million square feet was absorbed during the period. This represents the strongest commercial leasing quarter since the recession. There have not been any significant developments with the military since our last call, and we still expect troop rotations to be net positive for San Diego in 2012. Our exposure to military residents in San Diego stands at 14%. As of the end of July, occupancy for Southern California was 96%, and the 30-day net availability was 5.3%. Market rates are up nearly 4% in Southern California since the beginning of the year and have now reached levels equal to their prior peaks. All that translates to a slow and steady revenue growth, with noted strength in Downtown Los Angeles, the Wilshire Corridor in the West side. San Diego and Ventura are largely performing to expectations, but one area that has posted inspiring results for us is Orange County. Increased renovation activities have muted the results some, along with a few properties transitioning from concession-aided pricing last year to net effect of pricing this year. However, given the above average job growth for the County and low supply, we expect all properties in Orange County to realize improved rent growth in the coming quarters. So with more than half of the year in the books, we continue to be pleased with our overall results and think that we have positioned the portfolio well to maintain healthy revenue and NOI growth for the balance of 2012 and achieve our revised guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide brief commentary on our recent balance sheet activities and an update on our 2012 guidance. During the quarter, we prepay $138 million of secured mortgage debt on 8 properties, with proceeds from our private placement note offering announced earlier this year. We recorded $1.5 million of prepayment penalties during the second quarter and expect to record up to $1 million of additional prepayment penalties in the third quarter from a repayment of additional secured debt with the proceeds from the last tranche of our unsecured notes offering. We also expanded the capacity on our 5-year bank term loan by $150 million to $350 million and reduced the spread to 130 basis points over LIBOR. We entered into a $100 million of swap contracts to lock in an effective fixed interest rate for 5 years of 2.2%. With the prepayment of secured debt obligations, we have approximately 50% of the portfolio's net operating income generated from assets that are now unencumbered. This quarter's capital market activities reduce our cost of capital and our variable interest rate exposure, extend our debt maturities and strengthen our balance sheet so that we are now in a position to access the public debt market. Now turning to guidance. Our second quarter funds from operations results exceeded the guidance we provided on the first quarter call by $0.02 per diluted share, with better-than-expected net operating income results from our balance sheet portfolio and the co-investment activities, leading to the increase in the midpoint of our guidance of $0.05 per diluted share. Our same-property net operating income for the first 6 months is up 10.2% over the 6 months results ending in 2011. The new guidance for 2012 forecast net operating income increasing in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% for the entire year. The new guidance range includes an estimate for increases in property taxes of up to $400,000 per quarter, starting in the third quarter. Our second half forecast also assumes we continue to increase our renovation program to include over 700 apartment units before year-end, increasing the rehab-related vacancy by approximately $750,000 over the same period in 2011. The benefits from our renovation program will be reflected in better 2013 results. I will close my remarks with some numbers that underscore our sequential growth. The sequential same-property average rents actually increased 1.7% in the second quarter, with average rents increasing from $1,439 per month in the March quarter to $1,464 per month in the June quarter. This compares to the 1% sequential growth in average rental rates achieved in the first quarter. Based on the July 2012 preliminary results of over $1,560 per month on over 2,600 new and renewal lease transactions, we are not seeing any slowing in sequential average rental rates. This ends my comments, and I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Wolfe of Citi.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You mentioned this in your remarks, but you moved up the stabilization date on a couple of development projects. Just wondering whether that reflects a more optimistic view on your markets, in general, being able to sort of absorb supply faster, if it's something particular to those particular assets.
Michael J. Schall: Eric, it's Mike Schall. I think we just moved up this time the Expo deal, and I think it's more related to the construction labor pool. I don't -- we're not moving up the stabilization. We're moving up the date that the building is available for occupancy. And as you all know, the quality of the labor pool increases when there's not a lot going on in the development world, and so I think it's just, overall, we're able to build things faster and better and get better contractors and better subs, which ultimately leads to a faster construction period. And John Eudy is here, he probably can answer that better than I did. John, [indiscernible]?
John D. Eudy: Expo, that's pretty much it, Mike. The only other difference is we had a really light winter last year in Seattle, so we picked up probably 2.5 to 3 months just because it didn't rain until February, March, to any degree.
Michael J. Schall: I think the basic comment still -- well, also holds true to other development deals because the quality of the construction and labor force is very good, I think, right now, right?
John D. Eudy: Yes, on everything we have under contract.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Yes, I mean, I was just looking at the stabilized operations data and comparing with last quarter's supplemental, but I'm probably just reading a little wrong or something. You talked about the initial and stabilized yields you're seeing on development as well. I think you said 5% to 5.5% on initial, 6.5% to 7% maybe on stabilized. Just curious, what sort of value creation that implies relative to where you could acquire assets today. And if you think about that spread there, how that compares to the typical value creation that you've been able to achieve over time.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, it's a good question. The reality is, we can do both though, right? We can build and we can buy. We can find opportunities to, on a risk-adjusted basis, contribute meaningfully to the portfolio. And so we're pursuing both aggressively. I would say, in the development side, I think I reported last quarter that our cap rate, based on today's rents as of March 31, just mark-to-market, the cap rates, they were around 6%. I think everyone of those development deals would sell for a 4-type cap rate, if not lower than that. And so there's very significant amount of value creation. And I updated this quarter on Expo and said it was probably going to be around the 7% or higher stabilized cap rate again. I think that would sell for a 4 all day long. But we view those -- the value proposition differently between development and acquisitions. Development obviously involves more risk from a variety of perspectives. We expect to get a premium for that risk, and so we underwrite it a little bit differently. With the expectation, again, on the acquisition side of trying to get -- trying to accomplish something, improve our growth rate of the portfolio, we can move a lot more money faster in acquisitions, obviously. So if we see a change in market growth rates, we could buy into that with acquisitions, which is very difficult to do with development because you have transactions delivering several years after you start up. So I think that they're fundamentally different. I think you can add value in both of them. And so we continue to have a dual-pronged type of approach to investments, and we're still very active in both areas.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got you. That's helpful. And then just last question. On the co-investment structure, you mentioned the need, I guess, there, I guess the want to mitigate your risk in forward funding commitments. Is there any risk to giving your JV partner though too much control over asset management and operating decisions? Or do they just, at the end of the day, not have that much control based on the way you're structuring it?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, we're in control of all the major decisions on those transactions. In the case of the CPP joint ventures, they have say over major decisions, obviously. They're an important part of the overall equation. But they trust us for 55% of those -- 55% ownership in those transactions, and we're the providers of the services. And we believe in communicating very well with our partners, and we spend a lot of time and effort to make sure that, that goes right. But I think that, that partnership has worked very well up to this point, and we're excited about that relationship. So we try to maintain control, but we don't have complete control, obviously. And -- but I think in the broader scope, it makes sense from a risk reward standpoint. Again, if the world wasn't maybe as uncertain as it is and the issues weren't what they are, we might approach it differently. But I think in this world, this is a prudent strategy, and again, increasing your risk reward or improving your risk reward relationship, we think, is our objective here in what we've been able to accomplish.
Operator: The next question is from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Quickly, I want to follow up on some of Eric's questions from a more strategic perspective on the development pipeline. Clearly, you feel there's an advantage to your timing and delivering a lot of these assets in the submarkets. What are some of the signals that you would look for to make -- sort of dial back on that volume, is my first question. And the second question is, based on your outlook, what does the development pipeline look like around year-end?
Michael J. Schall: Again, this is Mike. We have pretty much concluded that we're going to be early- to mid-cycle developers, and we are going to -- and our format will change a little bit depending upon how much compensation we receive for risks that we take. And we believe in this world, we're better off trying to compress the time periods between when we commit and when we deliver a transaction. And so we've tried to focus on sort of the shovel-ready type of projects that are out there. And so as you've noticed, over the last several quarters, when we buy something and announce it, we are under construction on it the next day pretty much. And again, we're trying to squeeze that period because of the uncertainty inherent in the world. And -- but having said that, all these projects are going exceptionally well. And so we have -- clearly, we feel like maybe that we did leave something on the table, but you don't know that upfront. And I think overall, that strategy makes complete sense. We're very focused on this unfunded liability that is -- or unfunded exposure from everything but including, in particular, the development projects. So we have agreed that we're going to be early-, mid-cycle developers, and we're going to tailor off at the top of this cycle. We've done a lot of time -- spent a lot of time and -- looking at cycles and where we are in the cycle, and of course, none of us really know exactly where we are. But we certainly are going to take a shot at trying to get it right. And so I think that as time goes on, if we get another great year in Northern California, you'll probably see us decelerate on the development side there. There is a possibility that we will try to find some more transactions in Southern California. We fundamentally believe that as good as Northern California and actually Seattle have been, Southern California really hasn't caught on where rents didn't fall as far, but we haven't seen the recovery coming back the other way. And as all of us know, in a world that is 8% unemployed, if you get any change in that scenario, there could be a lot more demand for housing that would be generated by better employment scenario almost overnight in markets that are just chronically undersupplied. So I guess to answer your question, if we get another great year in Northern California, we'd probably scale back a little bit, but we could scale up a little bit in -- or maybe pretty substantially in Southern California.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, are you seeing any signs of inflationary trends either in the material side or the land side in your Shadow pipeline?
John D. Eudy: This is John Eudy. On the land side, there are a number of transactions that are out there that are really priced up that we won't be able to pursue or choose not to pursue. On materials, yes, there's been a little bit of movement at the beginning of summer. It backed off here in the last -- probably 30 days. On labor, there still seems to be where we are in our buyout sort of the last couple of announcements to be plenty of capacity even in Northern California. I do think by the middle part of next year, that will change with the pipeline that is scheduled to start in '13. But right now, as Mike said, we think that beginning in the middle part of the cycle, we're trying to catch the wave early and not be caught with runaway cost.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just on the cap offering, 10% cap on rents, can you talk a little bit more about kind of that decision to go from 15% to 10%? And maybe what's the adoption rate experienced when you have offered the 15% cap? And I mean, are these essentially economically neutral to you in a sense that the premium rent that you get roughly offsets the lack of upside at a various point of the cycle?
Michael J. Schall: It can be a little bit different. I mean, this is something that we've done before. As we all know, especially the tech markets can be very frothy when it comes to rent growth. You look at the late '90s and other periods of time, and also just the political nature of obviously California and I'm sure other places around the country. If you look at the nominal numbers, it doesn't look like it has much of an impact. If you break it down into actual property-by-property impacts, it clearly does have an impact. But again, there's also quite a bit of resistance. Certainly, the CEO website and Erik, as I'm sure 100x, that -- in his direct involvement of people that just say we just simply -- no one can afford 15% increases 3 years in a row. And some of those magnitudes are certainly out there. So we think that, overall, the cost of the company, if you ignore some of the side benefits or if you make some assumptions about side benefits, it's probably $1 million to $2 million a year in revenue. And at that, we think it's a prudent thing to do. I mean, obviously, we're not going to get a lot of Christmas cards limiting rent increases to 10% because people will still view that as being excessive, but it's something and it's something that we will likely publicize because there are companies out there that are charging much, much more and trying to go after every nickel. And again, obviously, one company cannot completely change the political situation if there's gouging by 2 companies. And if 10 companies are showing some restraint, the politicians could still act upon a rent control type of measure, but there's little we can do about that. From my perspective, it's the right thing to do, it's a prudent thing to do. There will be some other side benefits to it, and I think it's an important thing. And I'll note also that the California Apartment Association has a task force that is trying to mediate large rent control disputes between people and landlords, and they're getting more and more activity in that. And again, where that fails, where all the processes to try to mediate and come to a normal resolution fail, I think, is where you potentially have some political exposure.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: But am I correct that it's an option, it's not an automatic and it comes with a different starting rent?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes. So this is Erik. So as Mike said, there's always an option at 10%, and that option is anywhere from 10 to 13 months, depending on our lease expiration profile. And then there's an alternative that's offered at a different term, and of course, residents are always invited to let us know what's most important to them and we'll price that option for them as well. As Mike said, we're not getting very many thank you cards. However, what the sites tell us is that even though initially, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, when people realize what the market rates are for their same floor plan and when they have done their shopping in the market, they realize there really is an economic benefit to them, and I think they generally feel better about it. So we have done or have accomplished, I think, what we're setting out to do, which is to defuse the issue, take a little wind out of the sail.
Operator: I think Swaroop has one question.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, just actually following up on the development pipeline question. I noticed in S-15 San Jose, you expect 1,200 units coming online this year. My question is, what do you expect for 2013 and 2014? And how does that relate to your plans for the Cadence project, also given your decision for Phase 2 and 3. Does this impact your decision to maybe start the project earlier than expected or later?
John Lopez: Yes, this is John Lopez. We expect the buildup in North San Jose to probably peak later in the summer next year, somewhere around 2,500, 3,000 units in that range, which would put it -- there's about 225,000, 230,000 total units in the marketplace, so we're talking up potentially up to, I guess that's about 1.4%, 1.3%. And it will probably cap at that for a couple of years if you look at the -- if we look what that construction right now that can be delivered by 2014.
Michael J. Schall: And actually, the other number that you gave out, John, it is 1.4% that we talked about in the past but amid very limited single-family housing production, right? So I think if you look at total housing production relative to stock, it's still in the under 1% range.
John Lopez: Because the single-family supply in Silicon Valley, in particular, is like 0.2%. And you've got to remember that in Silicon Valley, unlike San Francisco, 60% of the homes are single-family. So when you do your 1.4% plus 0.2%, it comes out to be about 0.5%, 0.6% for the total residential area, which we think is very manageable. If you drop me into a year and say you're getting 0.5%, 0.6%, then good job. I'd be a happy economist in that market.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, so probably the issue obviously is that the job growth continues to be very strong in San Jose. So -- and as I recall, the number is now 3% projected for 2012 job growth in San Jose. So if the job growth continues, we don't think that, that supply will be an issue. It will be quickly absorbed.
John Lopez: And just one last point, Swaroop, because I think you're looking at the difference in this. If you look at previous cycles on total multi-family apartments and in condos, the only thing that's different here, this isn't going to be a peak year necessarily. It's just that a lot of it is coming into North San Jose, but that's also sort of indirectly where the jobs in the office construction in that light rail line is you just can't underestimate the impact to being on the light rail line.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So if we just add all the phases in Cadence and the Via project, how many units are we talking about that Essex will eventually build in San Jose?
Michael J. Schall: The third phase of Cadence is 192. So -- I don't have it right in front of me.
John Lopez: So you're talking about on stabilized properties?
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes.
Michael J. Schall: Yes. So it's 569.
John Lopez: 769.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, 769.
Operator: The next question is from Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess following up on the prepared remarks regarding Hewlett-Packard and Cisco and Yahoo!, can you remind us how much of your portfolio is corporate leases in Northern California and Seattle? And have you noticed any changes in demand from that segment?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. We have a very low exposure to the corporate business in our portfolio throughout. There are some properties that do more of that type of business, as you might expect, in Seattle, in San Jose and in Redmond. Overall, to answer your question specifically, the corporate exposure is 1.1% for the portfolio. And I think the most any one of the buildings have is 15%, and even that is a little deceiving because it's staggered. And we asked corporates to take some longer-term leases, and they're usually -- and they're used to taking, again, to protect our backside.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So completely under control. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question is from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: A couple of follow-up questions on this renewal policy. Mike, you mentioned the potential revenue loss, but you also mentioned potentially lower turnovers. So what's the offset on the expense line? How do you expect this to increase -- or decrease turnover? And just to put this into context for us, what percentage of your renewal notices that you have been sitting out were above 10%, anyways?
Michael J. Schall: Dave, all these numbers within the context of what our total annual revenue is are pretty meaningless, so I think it's all fairly nominal. I think we've done some estimates of what the impact is, $1 million, $2 million, using assumptions with respect to what turnover might be and what -- because you'll have less turnover, you'll have less turnover costs, you'll have less vacancy and you will put more -- you'll have more ability to push rents on the other side because you have less availability as well. Obviously, those are not numbers you can plug into a model, you have to make assumptions on them. But with the total impact of somewhere between $1 million and $2 million, we think this is nominal. And to get more specific about it, I'm not sure we'd be really all that helpful. Erik, do you have anything to add to that?
Erik J. Alexander: No, other than the timing of the 10% increases, we just started doing the first offer, 60 days out a couple of weeks ago, that impact the October 1 and beyond -- or sorry, September 15, I think it is, and beyond. So we don't have any -- or many of the results back from that yet. And as Mike said, I would -- the impact that's hard -- or the offset that's hard to estimate is the lower availability and what that does to pricing on the new lease side. For whatever reason that we're able to reduce availability, net availability, we always see it increase in pricing on the new lease side. So that will certainly help us mitigate some of that. And as I commented, we're looking to get -- continue to grow revenue and are most comfortable doing it on the new side.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Well, Erik, on that point, there seems to be a divergence between your renewal and new move-in gains in this third quarter of this year versus last year. Seems like you're doing better on new move-ins just based on your July metric and a good bit lower on renewals. Could you speak to that trend?
Erik J. Alexander: Well, I mean, I think these 2 periods, this summer and last summer, are different. As noted in the highlights, our net availability overall is lower this year than it is -- or than it was last year. And so again, I think that's helping us accelerate the pricing on the new side. So as long as those conditions hold up and as I reported on 30-day net availability, those are very much in control. I think we've said before that we're trying to manage around 6%, and only Seattle is at that level. Southern Cal and Northern California are lower.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Right. And what do you think is driving the lower renewals?
Erik J. Alexander: What I think is driving the lower renewals?
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Versus last year.
Erik J. Alexander: Well, at this specific period of time, I would say that it's part of our aggressiveness last year compared to the balanced approach going into the fourth quarter this year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just want to go back to David Toti's question on Northern California versus Southern California. You guys, in the past, have been very good about switching markets. When you tell 1 market was peaking, jumping to another market that was picking up steam, it seems like this cycle, the Northern California market seems to have longer legs than the Southern California market is taking longer. But I thought you said that there may only be 1 more year Northern California before you switch to Southern California, given the pace of new development activity starts that you guys are doing. Just sort of wanting more color on your thoughts between investing in the 2 markets.
Michael J. Schall: Alex, it's Mike. What we do operationally is rank our 30-some-odd submarkets by expected growth rate over the next 3 to 5 years. Mr. Lopez does that. And pretty clearly, the last several years, that is -- focuses more on Northern California and Seattle, not -- but that doesn't mean that we didn't like some parts of Southern California as well, it's just you can only buy so much and build so much in Northern California and Seattle. The markets are only so big, and it didn't mean that we wanted to essentially not look at Southern California. But as time has gone on, you have now a pretty significant amount of rent growth in Northern California, 20-plus percent, a similar number in Seattle. And so as we looked at the market rankings, there is greater parity. We think Northern California -- and it varies a little bit by location, but Northern California, as a general statement, is about a parity with respect to projected growth rate as Southern California. And so you will see a more balanced approach, I think, from an acquisition standpoint between North and South. As to development, development is a little different because what happens at the top of the cycle is the contractors are busy, they want bigger profit margins when they're busy, costs tend to spike a bit at the top. So as the comments I was making earlier were really more from a development standpoint, trying to keep our development earlier in the cycle to avoid the potential for costs spiking that can happen toward the top of the cycle. And so moving more of our development interest into Southern California would therefore be something, I think, will happen and will be advantageous to us.
John Lopez: And Alex, this is John Lopez. I know we made a comment last quarter that it might be sometime in the midpoint next year where -- when the crossover between rental growth rates might occur. But I think if we look at what's going on in the Northern California and Seattle economies, that is probably not going to be the case where before '14, that the rates in Southern California will greatly exceed Northern California. So although Southern California will pick up and pass Northern California, it's probably not going to be the case where the gaps are as big as they are, say, a year ago between North and South, if you get that.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And then going to your development program, the $1 billion that you outlined and met in the supplemental, that's a gross number, right? That's not your pro rata, correct?
John Lopez: Yes, that's correct. Of the deals that are under construction, worth about half, between 50% and 55% ownership of those.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. So like Avalon Bay has outlined a sort of target limit relative to their asset size and such, do you guys have a limit that you're looking to keep the development program under?
Michael J. Schall: We don't have an express limit. We've typically been in the 10% to 20% of our activities develop -- or capital, let's say, in development. So that would an imply an $8 billion -- $800 million will be 10% to $1.6 billion will be the absolute maximum we would consider.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just the final question is just going back to the rent control. Given that part of what causes the rents to spike is making it very difficult for developers to build, as you hear various politicians speak about rent control, is there -- do they give any like sort of acceptance to the need that they need to make development easier to also alleviate the burden of rents or it's the typical sort of let's limit rent growth -- I mean, let's limit rent and not talk about the other side of the equation?
Michael J. Schall: You're being way too rational, Alex. So no, we do not hear those 2 concepts being spoken about together. And in fact, I'd say that because the local governments are under so much financial pressure, that there will be more pressure with respect to city fees and other costs, not less pressure going forward. It will become more difficult to build and probably not easier.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: So as you speak to local politicians, it doesn't seem to be anyone who's amenable to hearing the development side of the picture?
Michael J. Schall: That's maybe a little bit too tough, too. No, I think that -- I think some of the politicians are very aware of the issue, and -- but unfortunately, the political will, as a general rule, I don't think is there. So I think our expectation, and as we've seen in the past, California can be very undersupplied with respect to housing from time to time. And I believe that we're going into one of those periods of time, I'm not 100% sure. But I know it's difficult and it takes a lot of time and effort, and there are a lot of obstacles to producing housing here and I don't think that changes.
Operator: The next question is from Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just building on Alex's question about market rotation, how significantly do you think you guys could shift your NOI contribution around California to reweigh your exposure? Because arguably, that was easier a few years ago when Essex was a slightly smaller company.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, that's a very good question. We don't think we're going to change -- make any huge changes to the concentrations. I think that Southern California got up to about 50% to low 60% range of our portfolio a couple of years ago. Now it's down, we've been pushing more in the north, and it's become closer to 50%. So I think that those types of magnitude are what you're going to see. So we're not talking about wholesale changes in the company. We try to find properties in locations that are solid locations for the long haul. This is a long-term business, not a short-term business. And so I think you will see us make plus or minus 5% to 10% moves in terms of our allocation over time. I don't -- I suspect it won't become larger than that.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And just a few housekeeping questions. Concerning Skyline, and I apologize if I missed this, but can you talk a little bit about how the NOI that project has performed versus your original performance? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much of the appreciation that asset stems from performance versus this cap rate compression over the last 2 years.
Michael T. Dance: Over the last couple of years, most of it was cap rate compression. So to give you a little bit of history, we bought it for $128 million, but we needed to complete a lease-up. It was 100% completed, but it was vacant. And so that lease-up cost probably took cost from $128 million to maybe $100 million -- low $130 million range. And I think that rents increased by somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% over that period of time, not great, obscured maybe a little bit by what was the impact of the concessions at the initial lease-up. But close as we can determine, it was somewhere in the 2% to 3%, and then the rest of that value was really cap rate compression. We bought it at about a 5.25% type cap rate, and the partner buyout was in the low 4% cap rate range.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. Is it fair to say though that, that project still is on pace with your original underwriting?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, I mean, operationally, we were ahead of our underwriting. I know in the first year, we've filled it up faster than we thought. And more recently, actually, it's performed better as well. So yes, I think it's achieving our estimates. We had hoped for a little bit more rent growth in Orange County, and that has lagged. So I think from the rent growth expectation, we did not hit the rents that we had hoped for. But obviously, we re-underwrote it. We still think that, that rent growth is -- that rent growth potential is still there, and we believe that we'll be able to see that in the next couple of years.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And how do you think about the timing of -- or I guess do you think about the time of selling these inevitably as condos because I think your new basis is probably about $425,000 a unit? What point does it pencil out to explore a sale of these because with interest rates probably 200 basis points lower than when you bought it, does it make it easier for consumers to get this master work? I don't know where the condo market is in that particular part of Orange County today, but...
Michael J. Schall: Yes, we track the condo market, and we believe that this is a better condo than it is an apartment building. And therefore, it's simply a matter of time that -- in terms of realizing that value. And -- but having said that, the condo market is not strong. And for a lot of different reasons, clearly, there was an overbuilding of for-sale that happened as you're giving people mortgage -- mortgages they can't afford, the homes that they're buying. And then in the process, a lot of people destroy their credit. And so now you look at it a couple of years later, you've got a normalizing homeownership rate, you have people that have -- don't have the credit that they need to get a mortgage, don't have the downpayments you need to get a mortgage and therefore, you haven't seen a big resurgence in terms of values on this type of product. And therefore, I don't think we're even close to where we think condo prices would need to be in order to lead to a sale of Skyline. I think it's still several years off.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And just a last question is, do you guys have an estimate you can share with us around what the promote could ultimately be in Fund II?
Michael J. Schall: We obviously do have estimates of that. I think it's preliminary to talk about it. I can say it's pretty comfortably in excess of $10 million, but I don't want to go farther than that.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: First question, just an update on dispositions. It seems like it's been pretty slow here the first half of the year. And also, as you look at development and acquisition, I mean, typically, you match fund. Is there any impetus given current valuations to give a little bit more pre-funding of the investment there?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Mike, it's Mike. We sold a couple of assets in San Diego, and at least at this point in time, our focus is trying to market and sell the half of the Fund II portfolio that is on the market now. So I think our disposition focus is pretty much right there. As we approach the end of the year, there may be a couple of other properties that we put on the market, and there will be a culling process over time within the company from that point on. So as of right now, we have our hands full with respect to the sale of those assets, and we don't want to dilute that. And at the same time, obviously, we had a very active quarter both in development and acquisitions, so we want to keep our time and effort focused on the things that are most important and not take on too much. So it's a balanced program as it always was. And then you had a second part to the question. Do you guys remember what that was? Mike, what was the second part?
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Second part was just talking about funding. I mean, several of your peers have moved to more kind of a pre-funding model where they started development, they're issuing the equity to fund it completely upfront as opposed to match funding.
Michael J. Schall: Right, right. Yes. Well, that number is an important number to us. The forward commitment to fund our development pipeline is somewhere around $375 million. And we have -- we're trying to reserve liquidity within our line and other places in the balance sheet to fund that if we need to. So we will -- we may look at pre-funding some of it. But the nice thing about the co-investment program is those forward funding obligations are not as large as they otherwise would be, obviously. That's why we do it. And so we don't have to, but if we can opportunistically pre-fund some of it, we will.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And related to that comment, is there any plans to cap the current development exposure?
Michael J. Schall: Other than what I said earlier, probably, we've operated at 10% to 20% of capital. We're a little -- on a net basis, we're not even at 10%, so I think we have some room to go there. But we will transition out of Northern California development at some point in time, likely in the next year. I'm expecting, again, good market rent growth that would have to happen to make that occur, and then we may transition a little bit to Southern California. We're going to start delivering some of these development deals as well. Expo obviously later this year, but after that, we'll start having some deliveries. And so we'll look to try to recycle some of the development programs going forward as well.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And Erik, just a final bookkeeping question. The renewals that you guys talked about being sent out, how much do you -- what is the actual achieved rate usually versus what's sent out? How much negotiation is in there?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, so I talked about this a little bit last quarter. And what we've sent out for the second quarter was in the 6% range, and what was achieved was 5.4%. So it ends up being pretty close to what we send out. The difference is usually end up being mostly related to people wanting different terms. There are some negotiations, if you will, again, mostly related to turn -- sorry, to term, because by giving them a limit, we already figured we've given them -- or by capping, I should say, our increase, we've already given them a best price, if you will. So what ends up happening a little bit is, I'd like to get that rate, but I'd like to have it on a 9-month basis because I'm moving after that. And so sometimes we'll split the difference with them. They don't get the same best rate. But that's our expectation.
Operator: The next question is from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Could you give us a little more color on the Valley Village project? And what do you think the opportunities [indiscernible] is for similar pre-sale-type development deals.
John Lopez: It's a small deal, 121 units. We were working on it for about 8 months with the developer. And there aren't that many out there that makes sense, and the reason is, the developer has to come to the table with a lot of cash to get his deal financed. We're the take-out basically for it because a combination of a developer with a take-out isn't going to be enough to get a deal financed. In this case, they own the land for a long time, there's a substantial amount of equity in it but not quite enough to get it over the line. And that's where our presale helped to get it financed with Wells Fargo and deliveries roughly 18 months out. And there aren't many of those opportunities. We've looked at other pre-sale opportunities. The problem is, if the developer has a deal, wants somebody to pre-sale contract to do it, it's not going to get done. Otherwise, there will be a lot more out there.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And clearly, you have a long track record of success in being opportunistic with capital deployment. Do you ever think about the friction between acting that opportunistically and trying to maintain a high level of visibility into your earnings streams for investors? Or is that just not something that enters your calculus?
Michael J. Schall: It's -- Paula, it's a good question. We're not here to manage same-store revenue. We're not here to manage same-store NOI. We would make different decisions if we were focused on those metrics exclusively. For example, you would sell more at the bottom edge of your portfolio to make those metrics look better and/or you would buy more aggressively at lower cap rates, in other words, in order to buy the higher growth assets. So those are not things that we are per se interested in. We are interested in a combination of growth impacts on net asset value and cap rate or accretion over our existing cash flow of our own portfolio, which generates positive returns. I think that's why we have been able to be as successful as we have been as we're very careful about the total picture of what we're trying to accomplish and not focused on -- not overfocused on any one metric.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then just finally, you mentioned, I know, Yahoo! in your prepared remarks. Clearly, the challenges for the new CEO have been beaten to death in the national press. What are you guys hearing out there in your proverbial backyard of what the prognosis is for Yahoo!?
Michael J. Schall: I don't know, Paula. I'm not sure that we have anything that's going to be helpful in terms of that transition of leadership, and it's a very significant company, obviously. And as I said in my comments, these restructurings are normal and necessary parts of the technology world because the product is an intellectual product. In many cases, it's not a -- well, in the case, I guess an iPhone is more than an intellectual product, it's actually a product, too. But it's some combination of intellectual assets and other types of assets. And so again, when you get into these situations where companies don't perform, this is the normal process, and they tend to evolve until they come back to a winning scenario. So whether this transition is the right one, we'll know. If it's not, there will be another transition afterwards. We've seen it a thousand times out here. And it's, I think, the healthy part of this market in that it's very dynamic. And whereas some companies that have products don't innovate, everyone out here is forced to innovate. And this is the process that forces innovation. So again, I don't know anything specific about the current situation, but the process is ongoing. And I hope it's successful at Yahoo!, but if it's not, the next one may be. So I think that's what will happen.
Operator: And our final question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So I have a suggestion. Maybe if you drop the rent cap to 9.9%, you'll start to get some thank you notices.
Michael J. Schall: Rich, we were wondering where you were, so I'm happy you joined the call. Appreciate the thought.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So just on that topic, really, can you just -- is it a public relations thing primarily? Is it something a little bit more selfish in the sense, and not in a bad way, but you want to kind of keep the engine going a little bit longer over a longer period of time? What is -- is that playing into your decision to provide this lower option?
Michael J. Schall: It really isn't to keep the engine going longer. That is not the motivation. The motivation is a -- it's partially -- look at my constituencies. I have the investment community, I have the Essex employees and I have the residents. It's trying to balance the constituencies appropriately, and this is what we think is appropriate. We think that this will give us a defensible position with respect to the local leaders as it relates to some of these -- some of the stuff that's gone on out there, which can be pretty egregious. I mean, we're talking about 15%, but there are 20% and 25% rent increases going on out there and they are not well-received. And in the world of Facebook and electronic media and the ability to publicize these types of situations that are really pretty tough to accept in the normal world, I think there's real exposure. So again, my feeling about the thing is that the apartment world should exercise some normal self-restraint, and I give California Apartment Association kudos for trying to do that with this mediation process. Or you've got to be regulated. I mean, I think that's pretty clear. I mean, we've all seen that in a hundred different ways in other areas, so I don't know why we'd expect housing and apartments to be any different. So [indiscernible] motivation.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So this isn't -- in your mind, if you owned a national portfolio, you might be doing the same thing?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, although it could be different. It's different from locale to locale. So I mean, we'll be sensitive to the local political situation. But again, I mean, if -- I'm telling you, 20%, 25% rent increases, they are not accepted. If you publicize them, we're going to look as an industry as not -- as something we don't like. So again, we're really trying to balance the 3 constituencies and make the right longer-term decision for the benefit of the company's reputation and its long-term health.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I think you're right. I mean, we've said this before that you guys have been the winner in an otherwise losing environment in terms of the economy, and I think it's the right and appropriate step to take. So I just wanted to give you a little credit for that.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, operator. Well, on closing, I just appreciate your participation on the call. Obviously, we're pleased with the progress made during the quarter and believe that our outlook remains bright. And we look forward to hearing from all of you on the next quarter call. Thank you again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may now begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call.  Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: Q1 results and market commentary; second, investment markets; and third, disposition activity. First topic, Q1 results and market commentary. Last evening, we reported FFO and core FFO of $1.63 per share for the first quarter of '12, which is ahead of our internal expectation and above consensus. We continued to see strong growth in Northern California and Seattle and a continuation of a steady recovery in Southern California, demonstrated by exceptional same-store NOI and revenue growth of 11.2% and 7.1%, respectively.  This result reinforces our expectation for a strong 2012, driven by very limited supplies of housing and job growth that exceeds national averages in Northern California and Seattle and is near the national average in Southern California. We don't see a significant departure from this basic theme until at least 2014. Erik will discuss portfolio trends in greater detail.  Our projections for rental and for-sale housing supply for 2012 are included on Page S-15 of the supplement. As expected, we see continued growth in multi-family deliveries in many of our target markets. We closely track the supply of both rental and for-sale housing and project deliveries through 2014. From now through 2014, the largest percentage addition to the existing multi-family stock occurs in San Jose, where we expect multi-family deliveries for 2012 to be 0.5% of stock or 1,100 units growing to 1.2% of stock, 2,600 units in '13, and 1.4% of stock, approximately 3,000 units, in 2014.  Seattle has the second-highest multi-family deliveries, estimated for 2012 to be 0.5% of stock, or 1,800 units, growing to 1% of stock, 3,800 units, in 2013 and 1.1% of stock, 4,400 units, in 2014. All other West Coast Metro areas are expected to average less than 1% annual rental supply growth through 2014. L.A. and Orange Counties are expected to have the least multi-family supply, averaging 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, through 2014.  The other housing supply risk relates to for-sale housing production. We continue to believe that affordable for-sale housing is a significant threat to apartment rent growth. Our for-sale supply expectations remain muted in our coastal markets, largely due to high median home prices and restrictive lending practices, which should be beneficial to Essex. Seattle single-family deliveries are estimated to approach 0.9%, or 6,300 units, in 2014. However, both Northern and Southern California have very little for-sale supply, averaging less than 0.2% of stock in 2012, growing to 0.4% in 2014. As a result, even with the growing apartment supply, we expect very tight housing conditions in each of our targeted markets through 2014.  Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the buyout of our partner's interest in Skyline apartments, located near Irvine in Orange County. I have commented previously that institutional co-investments provide an important alternative source of capital as compared to financing on Essex's balance sheet. In this case, we estimate that we issued 320,000 fewer common shares by acquiring Skyline initially with a partner and then the subsequent partner buyout as compared to the pro forma acquisition of Skyline on our balance sheet back in March of 2010. Obviously, the stock price performance was a major factor in that result.  In development, we started 5 development projects in 2011 and started the second phase of our Epic community in San Jose during the quarter, all of which are outlined on Page S-9 of the supplement. The average cap rate on these construction projects based on current market rents is approximately 6%.  Aside from these transactions, our Shadow pipeline, which is not included on S-9, consists of 3 potential developments in Northern California that could start in 2012 and have an expected cost of approximately $360 million. Thus, by the end of the year, we expect our construction pipeline to aggregate up to $870 million, of which Essex will own from 50% to 55%.  We also have 3 smaller land parcels that are held in our land inventory that could be started within the next year and an operating retail property on 12.6 acres in Santa Clara that we acquired in connection with the bankruptcy amid the great recession that we are entitling for apartments.  As suggested on the last call, the ramping of our redevelopment efforts continues as we once again are seeing residents willing to pay more for improved apartment homes. I am pleased with both the strategic direction of the redevelopment team as well as their growing impact on our overall results.  Second topic, the investment markets. Cap rates continue to be aggressive in the coastal markets. Cap rates range from 4% to 4.5% for A property in A locations and from 4.5% to near 5% for B property in A locations. As with 2011, transaction activity abated at year end and is now rebuilding. We closed on -- we closed 2 small transactions in the quarter and continue to believe that total acquisitions will equal or exceed our $400 million guidance for 2012.  In fast-moving markets, we have an information advantage given our economic research and historical data in our existing portfolio. We continue to find value in acquisitions through redevelopment, anticipating market trends and complex deals. Development deals on the West Coast underwritten based on today's rents generate development cap rates ranging from 5.25% to 5.5% or 6.25% to 7% upon stabilization.  Third topic, dispositions. We announced 2 dispositions in the greater San Diego area during the quarter, both of which were acquired in connection with the merger between Essex and John M. Sachs Inc. in 2002. Both generated unlevered IRRs of approximately 10%. As stated previously, we look for opportunities to cull parts of the portfolio that have lower growth characteristics. Fortunately, we don't have significant numbers of property that are in this category, giving us flexibility to optimize the timing of dispositions.  We will also begin marketing selected properties from our Fund II portfolio, which is scheduled to terminate in September, 2013, subject to an extension option.  I'd like to thank you for joining us. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander. Thank you again.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. It's always nice to be here, especially when there's good news to share about another strong quarter for Essex. We're coming off a high-occupancy condition at the end of the fourth quarter. Essex was poised to make gains in scheduled rent during the first quarter of this year, and that's exactly what we did.  We had solid results everywhere, but it should be no surprise that Northern California and the Pacific Northwest led the way. Los Angeles has strengthened and begun to contribute more to our results. We look for this trend to continue and are also optimistic that Orange County and Ventura County will be following suit in the coming quarters.  The first quarter was characterized by good demand in all of our markets with the exception of San Diego. The current demand is consistent with our expectations for this time of the year. We experienced healthy renewal activity throughout most of the portfolio during the quarter and have finally seen some increase in our rate of turnover.  We view this turnover activity as healthy because it provides us with more opportunity to grow rents. Additionally, we only saw a nominal increase in move-outs due to home purchases and affordability. Portfolio-wide, we increased rates on new leases by 5% during the quarter and over 6% during April. We expect turnover to rise during the second and third quarters, thereby decreasing overall occupancy. We still anticipate the annual rate of turnover to be just over 50% for 2012.  The modest decline in occupancy, coupled with these higher rent levels, will help us achieve solid revenue growth throughout the summer and give us a better chance of achieving the higher end of our guidance for the year.  As Mike pointed out, new multi-family housing supply remains very low and largely concentrated in a few areas of our portfolio. However, we have seen a few developers accelerate projects that we have been tracking and view this as yet another sign of strengthening in our markets. These favorable supply conditions will allow Essex to grow rents at or beyond expectations in the coming quarters. Again, our 2012 and '13 delivery projections are detailed on S-15.  During the quarter, we completed nearly 3,300 new lease transactions and signed almost 2,700 renewals. Renewal and new lease rates continued to grow during the quarter and were 5% higher than expiring rates for the period. Renewals recorded during April were 5.3% better than the expiring rental rates, with the expectations for May at 5.6% higher than expiring rates.  Now looking ahead, renewal offers for June and July averaged 4% to 6% in Southern California, 6% to 8% in Seattle and 7% to 9% in the Bay Area. So at the end of April, our loss to lease for the portfolio was approximately 4%. Reveal is our only active lease-up at this time, and net leasing activity remains ahead of plan. Currently, Reveal is 93% occupied and 96% leased.  Turning to operating expenses. These were down during the quarter compared to last year, as well as compared to our budgets. Repairs, maintenance, administration and utilities were all lower than the first quarter last year. We do anticipate some higher turnover costs during the second quarter. We do not see pressure on any other controllable expenses at this point, nor do we expect any significant variances with utilities to hinder our ability to manage costs.  I'll turn my comments to each region, starting with Seattle. Market rents were up 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2011. So depending on the submarket, we are now 4% below to even with our prior rent peaks. As of April 30, occupancy was 96.1% with a net availability of 5.1%.  The job picture continued to be strong in Seattle. We saw more jobs than expected added during the quarter and have raised our forecast for 2012 to 2%. Property managers continue to report strong demand from employees of Microsoft and Amazon. Office absorption remains positive as another 650,000 square feet were leased during the quarter. We also saw a surge in industrial demand at the south end of the region.  In Northern California, market rents were up 11% year-over-year. So based on submarket location, we now are above previous peaks by as much as 5.5%. As of April 30, occupancy for the region was 97.2%, with a 4.6% availability. Job growth continued to be solid in Northern California and is driving our rent growth.  We saw the biggest gains for the quarter in the San Francisco and Oakland MSAs and have increased our forecast to 1.9% job growth for 2012. This is highlighted on S-15 of the supplement, along with all of our submarket job forecasts.  Absorption of office and R&D space continues at a rapid pace and supports our belief that the region will continue to experience a healthy economy and continued job growth for the foreseeable future. During the quarter, another 1.5 million square feet of office was leased in the region, with the East Bay accounting for just over 1/2 of that absorption.  SanDisk, the global leader in flash memory, took down nearly 600,000 square feet of R&D space in Milpitas during the quarter, and vacancy for such space has dropped to 14%.  Now turning to Southern California. It's the jobs picture in SoCal that's probably the closest watched economic factor. We were disappointed by the 2011 revision, particularly in San Diego, where we have lowered our growth expectation to 1% for 2012. This also translates to a lower-than-expected rent growth for the year, which now stands at 2.5% in San Diego.  Los Angeles and Orange County, however, have fared better. The March posting of year-over-year job gains was 1.2%. These employments gains match our annual expectations for 2012.  The military obviously has some impact on the San Diego housing market. The troop rotations remain consistent with our expectations for 2012. We shared on our last call that the USS Ronald Reagan had moved to Bremerton, Washington, in January. But at least 6 other ships have returned to San Diego since then, including the USS Independence which ported yesterday.  Changes in military base housing policy have some impact on lower-ranking personnel's ability to live off-base. We will continue to monitor this item. During the first quarter, we actually saw an increase in our military leasing activity and now maintain overall exposure in San Diego of about 15%, which is within our historical range.  Market rents were up 3.2% versus the same period last year. Based on submarket location, rent levels remain equal to or 3% to 5% below prior peak. As of April 30, occupancy stood at 96% in Southern California, with a 6.3% net availability. Office-based absorption for the region was modestly positive during the quarter, with transactions in parts of the San Fernando Valley, Downtown Los Angeles, and creative office space on the Westside leading the way.  Commercial development has picked up in the region. Marriott is breaking ground on 2 hotels adjacent to LA Live, while the Glendale Galleria is expanding the regional shopping centers as part of a major renovation. RiverPark in Oxnard has resumed construction after suspending this retail development back in 2009. Developers of Plivis [ph] are proceeding with the construction of Phase 2 of their project.  All in all, we are very happy with the results of the first quarter and are optimistic about the summer leasing season. I think we are in an excellent position to take advantage of strong fundamentals, and we believe that we will enjoy solid growth well into 2014.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide a brief commentary on our first quarter results and an update to our '12 FFO guidance.  Before I begin on the quarter's results, I want to highlight a new line item we added to the income statement, which breaks out the costs we provide in the management fee income from our general and administrative expenses. This is an allocation of the direct and incremental costs of the employees and departments that are involved in providing, on behalf of our partners, the property operations, the asset management, the capital markets activity and the development oversight for the properties that are not consolidated on our balance sheet.  With a near doubling of our management fee income, we felt it was important to break out these costs separately to show the operating margin from this activity. Overall, the gross operating margin on the management fee income was 33%, and our corporate G&A as a percentage of property revenues was 4.3% in the quarter.  Subsequent to quarter end, we increased the investment capacity of our Wesco co-investment partnership, with the partners committing an additional $100 million of equity to the venture. This gives Wesco $200 million of additional buying power and is expected to increase management fee income in the second half of the year.  We continue to make progress on unencumbering our portfolio. We are on track to have 50% of our net operating income unencumbered by the end of the year as we are considering the prepayment of up to $200 million of secured debt on or near June 30. The cost of prepayment penalties and the write-off of unamortized loan fees from the early payment of secured debt is expected to result in a loss of up to $2.5 million, which will offset the $2.3 million income from the incentive partnership interest earned on the Skyline transaction.  We are also in the process of negotiating an amendment to our current bank facility, and we expect to increase the line capacity to $500 million with an accordion to $600 million. This amendment should also extend the term to December, 2015 with 2 one-year renewal options at our option. As mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the favorable variances from our internal estimates for both property revenues and expenses, resulting in the increase of the midpoint of our diluted FFO per share by $0.03 for the year. Yesterday, we also provided the second quarter FFO guidance of $1.60 to $1.66 per diluted share. For the second and third quarters, we expect financial occupancies to drop to 96% as resident turnover returns back to historical levels of approximately 55%.  The estimated 90 basis points loss in occupancy will be offset by higher scheduled rents, and our estimate of the second quarter sequential revenue growth for the same property portfolio is an increase of 75 basis points.  During the quarter, the lower level of maintenance and repairs expense is mostly timing-related, and we expect same property expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters, associated with the increase in resident turnover. For the second quarter, we expect a sequential increase of 5.5% in the same-property operating expenses or a 2.3% increase for the second quarter '12 over the second quarter in '11.  The projected increase in same-property rent growth is more than offset by the expected increase in operating expenses, and the midpoint of our second quarter guidance assumes a sequential decrease in the same-property net operating income of 1.3%, or a $1 million decrease. And the second quarter's year-over-year increase in the same-property net operating income is expected to be 8%.  As discussed on previous conference calls, our first half of the year's property operating expenses are still benefiting from the reduction in property taxes from the temporary declines in the Prop 13 assessed values. As of July 1, the new assessed values are reinstated to the maximum allowed under Proposition 13. Our property tax expenses will increase by approximately $400,000 per quarter, beginning in the third quarter of this year. Accordingly, we still expect same-property expense growth of 2% to 3% for the year.  Also, we're expecting in the fourth quarter of 2012 that Expo, formerly known as our Queen Anne development, will open 5 months ahead of our previously disclosed schedule. The earlier-than-expected lease-up of this development for its opening in November '12 will decrease our income from co-investments as we expense the operating costs and the rent concessions during the property's lease-up.  This ends my comments, and I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I just quickly want to touch on a detail on rent growth. There was double-digit rent growth in San Mateo and Santa Clara with what looks like very little occupancy damage. How sustainable do you think those rates are? And where else might we see this type of pricing power in other parts of the portfolio?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. I think you could expect to see pricing power really in all areas of the Bay Area. We've seen the strongest occupancies, as you pointed out, on the peninsula and in San Francisco, but it's also been strong on the East Bay and in San Jose. So when you look at the gains that we're making in both renewals and new lease rates, they're really happening across the board there.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Do you think these numbers are aberrational for the rest of the portfolio or are we just sort of in the first wave of double-digit rent growth?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I don't know about operational aberrational. I mean, I'm not going to be surprised to see them occur in parts of the Pacific Northwest. And again, as we have tight occupancies in all of the submarkets, again, it puts pressure on pricing and gives us that pricing power wherever those conditions occur.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then my last question is just relative to the loss to lease being about 4% for the portfolio, so nearing the prior peak. Can you tell us where you are relative to the average portfolio rent as a percentage of resident income and how that compares to the loss to lease?
Michael J. Schall: This is Mike, David, and John Lopez is here. The rent-to-income relationship we use on a market basis, we think it's a lot less appropriate or meaningful if you do it on a property-by-property basis or our portfolio, which is, I think, what you're asking. We would rather look at the overall market when it comes to rent-to-median income relationships, and we track that very, very closely. We're less concerned on a property-by-property basis primarily because the decision -- the local decision is, whether you move into Apartment A, B or C, not what your particular income is relative to the rent that you're paying. So even though people may be able to pay more rent, given their income level, it doesn't necessarily mean they will because everyone is concerned about what are the trade-offs? Where can I get the value represented and the best apartment relative to its price? So that's why the pricing dynamics within a local market are so important, and rent to median income is really the measurement of the broader market -- the affordability of the broader market, which I think is much more meaningful. And so I have John Lopez here. Why don't -- can you talk about the rent-to-median income in some of these Metro areas?
John Lopez: Yes, David. Probably the market where we're closest to our long-run norm is in San Francisco. But having said that, that's after 15% rent growth last year. In the East Bay, in the Silicon Valley in particular, in Northern California, we're still significantly below those numbers. I would say also that the same goes for Seattle as well and Los Angeles. Probably San Diego is where we're pretty close to the long-run averages, and I think why, even with job growth, we're seeing less rent growth in that marketplace. So if you look sort of from a strata, San Diego and San Francisco are pretty close to their averages. Orange County's somewhere in between and Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Seattle and Oakland significantly below.
Michael J. Schall: And David, actually, let me add one more concept which was we had talked about our expectation for 28% portfolio rent growth over 5 years, and one of the comments that came back was that our assumption in there, which was 3.5% median income growth, was too aggressive. And the reality is, I think we're seeing more like 4% to 5% or even higher in the tech markets, which is not unusual. Obviously, I've been here for a really long time. I've seen a lot of these cycles. And so when the tech markets do well, they tend to do very well. And obviously, the opposite is also true. But the point is, we're seeing, in the skilled labor, we're seeing a real dichotomy out there in terms of the tech worker with the skills that are demanded by the tech company. We're seeing great income growth rates, which are supporting higher rent levels. And then we're also seeing the other side, which is markets that don't have that tech component that are more price-sensitive and have less median income growth rates.
John Lopez: And David, I just wanted to follow up. That average, long-run average rent to income level, it's not a ceiling. And if you go back and look in the past, when we've expansion cycles, particularly in our tech sectors, that rent-to-income level typically runs well above the average. So although, as I mentioned at San Francisco, we're approaching that rent-to-income, long-run average, it doesn't give me any concern that we can't push the rents, given our expectations, because typically during expansions, it runs much higher than the long-run average.
Operator: Our next question comes from Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A question on Skyline. Do you still see a condo exit for this investment in the coming years? Or is the plan for this to be part of the core portfolio now?
Michael J. Schall: Swaroop, it's Mike Schall. Our expectation and our belief is that the highest and best use for that asset is a condo. It is a 20-something story high rise. It has Viking appliances. It has super high finishes. A number of us would like to bid on the snakeskin couch that is down in the wine locker area. And thus, and our thought about what the CapEx associated with Viking appliances might be gives us chills. So we know that its highest and best use is a condo. We look for a condo exit. But in a market that rents have not moved very much, we thought it was still a decent apartment addition in the interim.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. And then just sort of a big-picture question, Mike. Recently, we've heard the Bay Area and Southern California local governments have indicated a preference for more multi-family housing, both condos and apartments, in the coming years. How do you see that long term for your business and for your portfolio? Are you concerned with your markets getting oversupplied by this competing product?
Michael J. Schall: Swaroop, we've been here for a long time, and I don't think that, that sentiment by the local officials has changed much in the last 20 years. And I'm looking at John Eudy here, who I'm sure he has an opinion on this one as well. But yes, we know that, but at the same time, these are also markets that are very difficult to entitle properties. The entitlement process is long. It's cumbersome. It's full of potential pitfalls. I mean, we have gravitated toward a, "Let's find the deals that we can start construction soon." So we're not taking a huge amount of entitlement risk, unless we get paid a lot more for it in terms of cap rates. So if we can get -- there was actually one transaction that we did which was the -- I alluded to in my comments is the Santa Clara site that we bought out of the bankruptcy that we are going through an entitlement process. But that was underwritten at a -- what, a 6.75% cap rate. And in the midst of the great recession, and the cap rate is much, much higher now, potentially. So we try to make good value decisions. But to your point or to your question, we don't see anything that's going to fundamentally change the outlook for multi-family housing in the short term. It's just the process is too cumbersome and too difficult. And actually, I'll make another comment. Because I'm on -- I chair a nonprofit housing board, and California has essentially taken virtually all the funding away from the redevelopment agencies in many of the major cities in California, which has only gone to undermine the production of affordable housing in these marketplaces. And it's a -- that is an area that remains a dilemma and remains an issue for the nonprofit homebuilders, which are doing exactly what you're suggesting, because their primary funding mechanism has essentially been greatly reduced.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Macquarie Research.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Can you talk a little bit about where, given the strong rental rate growth in Northern California and Seattle were during the quarter, where new move-in rents were versus renewals in those 2 markets?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. I mean, as you heard, they're very close to each other. The growth rates for both new and renewals were in that 5% range. And so now, like if you look at just April for the portfolio, the new lease rates and renewal rates are within $5 or $6 of each other on average.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And what is the gap that you feel comfortable with in terms of having somebody move out versus what are you sort of want it to be to make sure that you keep somebody? I mean, if new move-in rents are X, what is an acceptable renewal rate in order sort of keep it in place and not drive that turnover cost?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I think you've obviously touched on something I think that's important to all operators, which is, you kind of want the good turnover. And the good turnover is the folks that are furthest away from market. And we've taken the position, and I think Mike has shared with everybody on several occasions, that we're not overly aggressive in trying to send renewals out above current offered rates or their forecasting months in advance. We find that to be a difficult proposition. Some people will accept that. Many people are offended by it. So again, when we're within the renewals and that being on the high end probably at the offered rate and within a couple of percent of the offered rate.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: What's your card [ph] costs on units turns today?
Erik J. Alexander: It varies greatly. I mean, you're talking about what goes as far as painting and cleaning and miscellaneous maintenance supplies, that kind of thing, it's...
Michael J. Schall: We'll throw vacancy in there too, right? So...
Michael T. Dance: Our card [ph] cost is about 400 and vacancy might be another 400.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just one last question on San Diego Main. If you assume that the troop rotations continue the way that they've been for the last decade or so, I mean, what's the attractiveness of that market at a similar IRR or cap, going-in cap rate in growth expectations versus Northern California or LA Orange County?
Michael J. Schall: Well, yes -- this is Mike. I'll answer that. Yes, this is part of our process, which I think is fundamental to the company and its success, which is ranking these submarkets -- our 27-some-odd submarkets, up and down the West Coast from Seattle to San Diego by future expected rent growth. And the person that does that is John Lopez, who's here. And it changes pretty dramatically over time. And 2 years ago, we're buying everything that we could find in Northern California and Seattle. And right now, we have a more balanced program in terms of -- we're buying in selected places in Southern California and Northern California. I think our #1 market continues to be the east side of Seattle in terms of submarket. But again, it changes over time. We go through a semiannual process of reevaluating submarkets and reranking them and use that as acquisition and disposition decisions. In terms of San Diego specifically, its long-term value is, I think, still meaningfully attractive in terms of its -- it used to be a military and entertainment tourism town, and it's become much more than that. There is real dynamic job base there, including biotech and a variety of other things, and it's improving. But the other piece of San Diego that has historically been an issue is just housing production. Housing's a little more affordable, except in the coastal areas. And there tends to have a tendency to overbuild San Diego. And so affordability concerns have been there. The other thing that has happened more recently, as you'll recall, a couple of years ago, San Diego had less reduction in rent than most of the other markets. Our average portfolio reduction in rent was 14.5%. San Diego performed the best in the downturn. But if you flip that around and you say, "Okay. Well, now you've suffered that loss in rent, who has the greatest upside?" San Diego does not appear at the top of the list. So long term, I think San Diego is a decent market. We view this business as one of timing and making good decisions and getting the value creation pieces put together in the right order. And I think that there thus will be a time when we will re-enter San Diego. It's just not now.
John Lopez: Yes. And Rob, this is John. I just want to stress, one of Mike's points was that going into this recovery cycle, San Diego was at the bottom of our expectations list, primarily and solely because of the fact that the relative rents in the marketplace versus the incomes in the marketplace were relatively high compared to other markets. And so we didn't initially forecast lower job growth. What we do -- it would be at the bottom of our rankings, hence are typically [ph] down there on the buy and sell was concentrated in other areas.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. I was just trying to figure out, like, whether or not the sales this quarter portended to additional sales there as you guys sort of cycle out, at least for the time being.
Michael J. Schall: We cycled out of Portland several years ago. We've cycled out of a variety of other markets. That's not our intent here. Our intent here is to pair a piece of the portfolio that is lower growth rate. It's interesting because I cited 10% unlevered IRRs, which is pretty good. But as Mike Dance has pointed out to me, when you started somewhere around an 8%, growing in yield, it's not that difficult to get to a 10%, which is a concept I agree with. So the reality is, it's more of the growth rate that we were concerned about in those particular assets. And again, we're going to be careful and thoughtful about the timing on exiting from the things that we consider non-core.
John Lopez: And just one last thing to add, Rob. In our core markets if you look over time, some markets are highly ranked. Some markets move up and down that ranking list. San Diego has been a good market, probably middle of our portfolio for long-run growth. So from a long-run perspective, this is not a market we would exit because of long-run low growth expectations.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jana Galan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess following up on that kind of non-core or -- and I realize this is a small part of the portfolio, but can you speak to the lower occupancies in Riverside County? And could these or maybe the Santa Barbara assets potentially be disposition candidates, or do you expect longer-term revenue growth to improve there?
Erik J. Alexander: I don't think -- this is Erik. I don't think we expect a longer-term revenue growth from the Riverside asset. The Santa Barbara assets, as you know, are heavily dependent on the student population. So we're in the middle of that first demand window right now, and what we're seeing is, I'd say average demand with good results. We've seen it in years past pick up a great deal later in the year, so again, given the challenges we had there last year, we're watching it carefully and making sure we're addressing what the students want. But ultimately, there's just not a lot in Santa Barbara, and so there very well could be -- not a lot of choices, what I mean, not a lot of supply. There very well could be upside in those assets.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And just to confirm. The 2012 guidance assumption, is that still $100 million in dispositions?
Michael T. Dance: Yes. Mike mentioned earlier, when you include our pro rata share of the fund, it will likely be higher than that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I'm not sure if you tracked this, but I'm wondering if you've tracked the percentage of tenants moving into your Northern California portfolio that are in the tech field. The reason I'm asking is because if you look at the tech news sites, you find that there's just billions upon billions going to these tech startups, many of which are pre-revenue but are still using the funds to hire pretty aggressively. So I'm curious whether you're seeing this influx of capital into the tech space in your tenant space as well.
Erik J. Alexander: Eric, this is Erik. We don't have a specific measurement on those folks coming in as it relates to industry. Again, when there are big movements, whether it's in tech or anything else, as I commented on Seattle, with all the activity that Amazon has, we see an uptick certainly in that. We've seen an uptick in the Microsoft residents, particularly in the East Side, Bellevue and Redmond and in the Bay Area, certainly a component of the people that are moving in.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then the second question is, there's a couple of announcements today in terms of funds and REITs being formed to buy and rent single-family homes, the biggest of which, I guess, would be Beazer Homes. So I'm curious what do you think is going to be biggest challenge for these REITs and what sort of yield you would need to have in order to compensate for these type of challenges?
Michael J. Schall: Eric, it's Mike. And I recognized you and I have talked about this subject a few times. So I think the biggest challenge will be the discipline of buying the right property in the right location at the right time, and the concept of buying a vast portfolio where you don't have a choice as a buyer over exactly what you're buying. You're somehow going to manage this large, geographically decentralized portfolio. We think that's the peak of inefficiency. And we actually did buy a portfolio of single-family homes in the Sacramento Valley as part of the RTC in the early '90s, so we have some experience there. And it's a challenge. It's a challenge because of the decentralized [ph] nature of what you're doing. And I think that the ones that make the most sense, as far as we're concerned, it would be one that you can somehow control that process, which is a very local business. I think it's probably more suited toward private wealthy investors that are -- have the right combination of skill sets, from the real estate side to the management and operations side, to put together a comprehensive team that can deal with these things when you can control what you own and the price that you pay and have some synergy with respect to location and product that you own and control. So I think it's just a different business. It's one that we're interested in but have not taken steps to pursue given the difficulties I just mentioned.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Michael Bilerman. I had just a question as well. Mike, I appreciate the disclosure as you broke out the management fee expenses now on the income statement so that we can better align what sort of that profitability of -- out of at least doing the fund business is. Is there a sense -- I know you're going to be selling some assets in the Fund, and you're obviously taking Skyline on. How scalable, I guess, if you were to add additional joint ventures, could that margin get, right? Because you talked it being about 33% margin. It was 25% last year. If you were to substantially increase joint [ph] ventures, could that margin grow substantially?
Michael J. Schall: Mike, it's Mike Schall. I don't know which Mike you were directing that at, but I'll take the question. The fund business is less about the margin on the fees, more about the promoted interest and the overall cost of capital. So our hope is that we will be marginally profitable, let's say, because we're not trying to skimp on the cost side of managing the -- our co-investment assets. In fact, to the contrary, we believe -- that's why we don't do fee management is because the dynamics of fee management is you're incented to keep the costs very low in order to keep your margin higher. We're not at all incentivized to do that when it comes to our co-investments because we're such a big part of them. And therefore, our focus is not on the margin on the fees. The focus is a how do we maximize the overall returns and the promoted interests, and we are -- we spend -- we need to spend on the fee side. In terms of how scalable could it be at? I think it can continue -- we can continue to grow that margin to some extent. I'm not sure that we will. For us, it's a -- we look at this as another source of capital, and we're constantly comparing, just like we compare our 27 submarkets up and down the Coast, we're doing the same thing on the capital side, trying to find the right mix of capital to buy the properties that we think are going to perform the best, having essentially no difference between what we would buy in our own portfolio versus what we would buy in these co-investment assets. So I don't want to -- and so there is some margin growth, but candidly, we're just not focused on that, more focused on how do we get the promote [ph] as high as it can be and how do we get the cost of capital as low as it can be.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And which -- how much of the assets are you selling out of the fund at the back half of the year?
Michael J. Schall: We haven't decided exactly. Again, we don't have -- we don't pressure to sell. We think it's a good environment to sell some assets. It could be approximately 1/2 of the Fund II portfolio
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then are you in the process right now of trying to raise additional capital for opportunities?
Michael J. Schall: Mike Dance commented that we have increased marginally the Wesco venture by $100 million in capital. So we have done that. So the answer is yes. The reason why we're doing a relatively small amount there is to just keep our options open with respect to what we do in the future. And that's -- part of the advantage of having Wesco is that we can decide to commit a little bit more capital to an entity, which then, of course, allows us to be open with respect to how we finance stuff 6 months from now.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. So in case something else came across in your markets, or even outside of your current core markets, you could then find another joint venture partner and raise capital on that specific opportunity if it were to come about?
Michael J. Schall: Or just buy everything on balance sheet.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And issue equity.
Michael J. Schall: Exactly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Mike Dance has been a little quiet, so I guess I'll start with him. Just -- I heard Erik Alexander's comments on the rents. It sounded like you guys are pretty bullish. But you beat strongly on the first quarter and yet you didn't raise the top end of the guidance. Sort of curious. Is it the real estate taxes or is it turn costs? What's keeping you from raising the top end of the guidance as well?
Michael T. Dance: We haven't done an in-depth analysis to justify at this point. I think we're coming into our heavier leasing season, and we'll reconsider that at the end of our second quarter.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. So it's nothing specific? It's just...
Michael T. Dance: No. If it's -- me being lazy. I have some other things to do and made that my priority for this call. Sorry.
Michael J. Schall: Alex, let me add something to that. I mean, it's our objective to not give up the 90 basis points of occupancy, obviously, in Q2 that Mike has assumed, right, in the guidance number. Our hope is that we can maintain -- we can do both. We can get good rent growth without sacrificing a tremendous amount of occupancy. We all know that this is a dynamic world and things change relatively quickly, and so it's just, we would rather wait and see, wait and have one more quarter under our belt before we commit to that. And just as a general statement, we just gave guidance in February. So I just think that it makes sense for us to take a look at it after the second quarter. I think that's just the appropriate way of doing things.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And switching to development. You guys mentioned the Queen Anne development is going to come online early. Last quarter, you had a few projects that came on early. Is there -- is this a matter of just having a conservative development time table where you're able to bring things online sooner or is it weather conditions or maybe just better contractors who are working quicker? What's the driver that's allowed you guys to bring projects on sooner than anticipated?
John D. Eudy: Alex, this is John Eudy. Most of that surrounds the fact that we committed to that in the fall of 2010. We started it last spring before any meaningful construction started in Seattle. So the best of the best contractor subs were available, able to push the limits, and we were able to take advantage of it. The typical timeframe for that would be around 22 months for that complicated of a building. And obviously, we're doing it in about 18 months. I don't expect that will be the norm going forward. Historically, 20 to 24 months for that type of building is the range to expect. So going into next year, I don't think we're going to have that advantage. We've been able to take care of -- take advantage of the labor pool. That's the reason.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And just as the final question is, as you guys stay in touch with institutional investors and you've seen cap rates compress a lot on the coast, are you seeing people who originally were interested in coast -- coastal apartments venturing to other sorts of maybe inland apartments or other asset classes? Or once the institutional investors and the consultants make the decision to go for coastal apartments, they stay in the queue until their number is called?
John F. Burkart: Yes, Alex, this is John Burkart. What we've seen is they are very interested in the West Coast apartments, and we're talking regularly with them, and we're not seeing people that have expressed an interest in investing with us looking to go elsewhere other than to the extent it's part of their normal business plan. But the focus is on the West Coast apartments. And in further, there really is a difference at this point in cap rates between the more desirable areas that we're in and the less desirable areas out there in the marketplace, whether it be Sacramento or whatnot, and the investors are pretty focused getting in the right spot, so they're willing to pay the price to get into the better locations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: What's the difference between the rent-to-median income and the rent-to-property-level-income ratio?
Erik J. Alexander: Well, I think this is the question essentially that we addressed before. As Mike said, I don't want to contradict that, but to answer your question specifically, when we do look at a broader range for our individual regions, NorCal, the Pacific Northwest and SoCal, they're a couple of percent higher maybe for some of the applicants that we see coming in. So incomes have been increasing among applicants over the last year, and obviously, so have rents. And so I think, as John said, if rent-to-median incomes are in the 18% to 22% range, ours are in the similar range, maybe plus 2%.
Michael J. Schall: Actually, Erik showed me some demographic reports last night, which are measured upon move-in. I think beyond the move-in, we don't really know. But at move-in, I think the average income of our residents was slightly above the median income. So it was not materially different from the median, if that's where you're going.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That's where I was going. The next question is, what do you think the over-under is on this Prop. 13 issue in July?
Michael J. Schall: I'm not sure what you're referring to because we reported last quarter, and I think this is not any different...
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: No, I know. I know.
Michael J. Schall: Okay.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes, I know it's not new, but I'm just curious, like, from a profitability standpoint, what do you think the likelihood is you'd be paying higher property taxes next year?
Michael J. Schall: Oh, I'm sorry; you're going back to Mike's comments.
Michael T. Dance: I think it's unlikely that we pay increases above [ph] $400,000. We have a cadre of experts that help us negotiate and appeal the assessed values. So they will definitely go up. The $400,000 per quarter is the worst case. I'm hoping we do better than that, but who knows? That's subject to appeals and negotiations ultimately.
Michael J. Schall: So chalk another one up to Dance conservativeness.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So last -- yesterday, the other day or whatever, BRE said they had a weather benefit in the first quarter. Did you have anything like that?
Michael J. Schall: I don't think that the weather was a material factor. Erik, do you?
Erik J. Alexander: No.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Continuing on with my [indiscernible] of questions here. The rent peak number, I know people talked about this or that above or below peak. Is there any relevance to the peak rent? I mean, you have different people. The situation's completely different than it was back when you had that other peak rent. Isn't that just another number that doesn't really have any relevance to where things will go or not go in the future?
Michael J. Schall: I totally agree with you. I think the relevance of that is pretty much in the history books now. I think it was highly relevant when you were in 2009, 2010 timeframe, to know that Seattle rents had gone down 20%. I think that was very important at that moment because it was a key part of our -- the way we look at our ranking process, we look at, "Hey, these rents are really low relative to what the income levels are and what people can pay." And so it becomes relevant at that point. Now that a lot of that has been erased, I think it's much less relevant and we get back into the more traditional measures of rent: rent to median income, the affordability trade-offs between the medium price home and rental rates and those type of things. I think they're much more relevant than prior peak.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then...
John Lopez: This is John Lopez. I'll just add to one thing. When we were looking at these numbers, as Mike said, they were very relevant because we weren't sure what direction incomes were going and things like that. And what we've seen as we've popped out is we're a little bit behind to a little bit ahead. And in most of our markets, the median household incomes are above that level -- the previous peak level. So in and of itself it's not important, but when you put it in context of how our incomes have grown since that prior peak and you put those combinations, that's why it gives us confidence that the rent-to-income levels are still in our favor here.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: A big picture for Mike Schall. Do you think now is a good time for multi-family M&A, or do you think we're not at that point yet?
Michael J. Schall: Actually, we are -- as a historical statement, I've spent a fair amount of time just looking at the different combinations of companies, and I think it's starting to become a more interesting time. Not that there's anything that's happening that's specific, but I think its -- I think at the bottom of the cycle, every company is very reluctant to do anything because they perceive that they're at the bottom of the cycle, obviously. As you get closer to a top of the cycle or midcycle, I think it's just -- I think the opportunities present themselves. So that's a very generic statement, and again, there's nothing specific happening here.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I'm not suggesting there is, of course. And then the last question is kind of just that you guys are trading at almost $160 a share. Have you ever thought about a stock split, or you're going after Google?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, it's probably my philosophical biases as taught by Mr. Guericke, who preceded me. And we look at the listing fees and the ongoing fees associated with that, and we wonder why we should do it with an overwhelmingly institutional investor base, Rich. Trading costs are typically on a per-share basis, and we're 90-something percent institutional, so why do it? I mean, the reality is we could do it, and if there was a compelling desire among our shareholders, we would do it. But I haven't seen that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just one question. If you end up having meaningful sales out of Fund II this year, is there a possibility that you could get some Promode [ph] income this year? Or is that a 2013 possibility?
Michael T. Dance: Yes, the way you account for that is based on how you distribute out of the partnership. And we have to return to all our partners the 10% hurdle first. And so the likelihood of reaching that from the '12 sales is not likely. So most all of it would be done near the end of the sales process, the disposition process.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies & Company.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question. If you could draw an invisible line through your portfolio and kind of put your A assets on one side and all of the other assets on the other side, could you talk a little bit about just overall operating trends you're seeing in these 2 buckets? Is one meaningfully outperforming the other or is everything just kind of going gangbusters at this point?
Michael J. Schall: Tayo, it's Mike Schall, and Erik may have some follow-up comments. But we believe that it is much more a locational issue than it is a product issue. And because of that or as an example of that, I would tell you that the lease-up of our brand-new Via project had rents that way surpassed our expectations. And from that, if you have a new property in Silicon Valley, we were able to get a very significant premium. If you go down into Orange County and look at other properties we've bought, a number of condo buildings that are rented as apartments, which are the nicest assets, the highest level A that you can buy within those marketplaces, and you were having trouble moving rents or generating any significant premium over the B quality assets in the marketplace. So it's very different by location, and I think that, that is why we focus so much time and effort on getting the locations right and the submarket ranking processes right, because that to us is much more important, trying to understand where supply and income levels are and what people's -- I guess it comes back to consumer psychology -- how comfortable do they feel about their job, their income level versus the cost of renting and how willing are they to step up and pay significantly more in rent, and what do they get for it. So I think that, that relationship is what's most important here. And clearly in the North, we're seeing people willing to pay a lot more and having the ability to pay a lot more, less so in the south land. Erik, do you think that's right?
Erik J. Alexander: It's absolutely right. And then with respect to product, I mean, even in the strong markets of the Bay Area, I mean, some of the top performers end being properties that we've invested a little bit of money in, in prior years, like The Commons in Campbell, a solid product in a good market. I don't think everybody would classify it as AA. And April is picking up 12% rent growth on expiring rates and similar on renewals. And again, that's just not the result of a renovation, because that's been done for some time now. I just think it speaks to the value proposition for that group of customers. They want to be close to jobs and have good housing. And to the extent that people start to feel like they're paying more than they want, we're seeing the increases of people move to the East Bay. We're seeing good growth in Dumont and San Ramon. And we're excited about the prospects for those properties as well.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: That makes sense. One other question, and as a consequence [indiscernible] Fund II that would be of interest to you guys as a going out rate?
John F. Burkart: On Fund II -- this is John Burkart, on the Fund II assets, because of the nature of the ownership structure, we won't be making offers on those assets. Those will be sold. There are many assets that we love in that -- in the fund. They're great assets, but we won't be making offers on those assets.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mike Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 follow-up bigger picture questions. Mike, you talked about development stabilized yields being 6.5% to 7%, and you talked about acquisition cap rates being in the low 4s today. At what point does it make much more sense to start developing as opposed to acquiring, just in light of the $400 million of acquisitions?
Michael J. Schall: Mike, if we were buying those 4 cap acquisitions, and I think I would agree with the premise that you would favor development, but the reality is we found value opportunities within the acquisition area. There were a couple of assets, for example, that we bought in the Fremont area. I'll tell you why we bought them. We can do a exterior and some unit turns there and we can substantially improve the physical asset. We also believe that Fremont is a beneficiary of the Bay Area, or, I'm sorry, Silicon Valley, essentially having a lot more jobs and demand relative to its supply, so we think that the beneficiary will be Fremont and other high-quality cities that are surrounding Silicon Valley. So if we can put together a couple of those components, and I think that the cap rate going in there was around high 4, low 5 range, I don't remember exactly what it was. But if we get that combination of transaction characteristics, I think it supports a strong acquisition program as well. And so we're doing that. But the reality is we can do both. And so we've been active on both areas, and we built our development pipeline pretty significantly over time. And I think that we feel very good about where that sits, and we can simultaneously do acquisitions in the run. I'm blessed because I have John Eudy, who's been year for 20-something years, running development, and Craig Zimmerman, same amount of time, running the acquisitions. And so we have those -- we've got a machine on both those areas, and so we can pursue both.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. Can you remind us what your risk premium is on a development versus acquisition?
Michael J. Schall: Yes. We say around 20%, but I have to caveat that because that's 20% if we can start quickly. So without -- as we know, California entitlement processes can get -- could be a little bit cumbersome, and ultimately time is money, especially if you miss the window with respect to construction costs and some of these other things. So we're saying 20% if we can start the construction process almost right away. I also noted that in the case of that Santa Clara deal that we bought out of bankruptcy and have chosen to go through an entitlement process, and incidentally we own 100% of that transaction, that was bought at a 6.75% type cap rate. Again, you've got the entitlement process, which we expected at the time to take about 3 years. And so you'd need more risk premium to make that happen. So what John and I try to do is sit down and understand the risk profile of each of these development deals and make good decisions with respect to how much risk are we willing to take and how do we get compensated for that risk, how much a premium do we need for that risk.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And the second question for Mr. Lopez there, as you look -- I realize you guys are looking at some markets, but as you look at the gross prospects for Northern California, and you referenced that 28% growth. I think you quoted it on your last call for the full cycle. When does it -- when do you get more bullish on Southern California versus Northern California? Or is it really going to be -- is it market-by-market for the entire cycle?
John Lopez: Well, I mean, it's market-by-market for the entire cycle, but we definitely feel that probably sometime in the early mid next year is where we would expect potential acceleration in the targeted Southern California market to accelerate up to sort of the current run rates in Northern California and Seattle. So obviously going out over time, barring a 1999 5% job growth in Silicon Valley, naturally at some point, this rent growth in the Northern California and Seattle markets will slow below their current levels; that's probably a couple of years out. So we probably think that our target Southern California markets will approach next year and probably a year after that will be some of the leading markets.
Operator: I'll now turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any closing comments.
Michael J. Schall: Well, I guess in closing, we appreciate your participation on the call, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June. We're obviously pleased with the progress made during the quarter and believe that our outlook remains bright. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available for the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company’s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Essex Property Trust. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Michael Schall – President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, (Robin) and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with brief comments. John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are available for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, fourth quarter results and rent growth expectations; second, cap rates; and third, update on the state of California. So on to the first topic. Last time, we reported FFO per share of $1.55 per share, an increase of 18% over the prior year and equal to the high end of our guidance range that was presented last quarter. I am very pleased with the focused effort in operations to the credit of Eric and his team. Eric will comment on portfolio results later in the call. I'd like to revisit our longer term expectations for rent growth. Last quarter, I commented that we expect approximately 28% market rent growth in our target markets over the next five years. Our 2012 guidance contemplates 7.4% market rent growth, which is consistent with that five-year outlook. The following factors were important in arriving at our market rent estimates. First, we have seen a slow, but steady improvement in the state of California and Washington economies since 2010 and we do not see this progress abating. Clearly, we expect the coastal areas in California and Washington to outperform as the inland areas have greater unemployment overhang from foreclosures and related issues. Second, the West Coast was one of the last major U.S. metros to experience economic recovery. Rents fell further than in most markets and thus have greater growth potential before hitting normal resistance such as affordability. Overall, market rents in our portfolio are on average about at the same level as they were in Q3, 2008. However, personal and median household incomes in our target markets are higher now than in 2008. We estimate that current rents would need to grow by about 6.1% that are close to markets to hit the 20 year average rent to median income ratio of 20.2% and rents should grow above that average during improving economic conditions. Third, technology and social media companies and the proximity to the Pacific Rim provided different and well-positioned engine for job growth. This differentiation was apparent in 2011 and will likely continue into 2012 and beyond. Fourth, rent growth is not just about jobs, but rather the combination of job growth and limited supply of all new housing both rental and for sale. Historically, we have seen very strong rent growth for several years when these conditions are present as they are today. Fifth, personal and median household income levels typically declined in recessionary times and accelerate during recovery periods. In 2009, personal incomes fell 5.4% in our target markets and have since grown by 10.8%. Looking at national averages for income growth can be misleading as areas with concentrations of employment in the federal government, energy and tech are the leaders in income growth. Economy.com estimates that personal income growth will average 5.5% over the next four years. This income growth is greater than the 3.5% use in our basic assumption.
 : Second topic cap rates, cap rates range from 4.25% to 4.75% for A property in A locations and in the high 4% to low 5% range for B property in A locations. Cap rates increased from there for lesser locations in property quality. Acquisitions still work in this environment due to low interest rate and strong market rent growth expectations. Our preference is finding value-added opportunities, with rents recovering aggressively in many places, market selection and timing is critical to accretive investment. We have seen limited transaction activity as we approach the end of 2011, which was not unusual, as we enter 2012, we expect transaction volumes to increase and have guided to approximately $400 million in acquisitions in 2012. As you know development pipelines are rebuilding from negligible levels and we carefully track new housing. Our construction pipeline now consists of five projects under construction, aggregating $423 million and we will likely add at least two project starts during 2012. There are significant number of potential development deals that are being actively marketed by other developers and owners, but are not underway largely due to lack of financing, many of them don’t underwrite to acceptable return. Also some of the developers that could provide the financing that is needed are approaching their current capacity and thus are being more selective on new deals. It remains to be seen how many of the available sites will actually be started in the near future. Development cap rates based on current market rents continued to be in the mid to high 5% cap rate range and really haven’t changed significantly, even though market rents have moved dramatically in some areas. Third topic, State of California, as a general statement, the California economy has improved significantly in the last two years. The state’s financial health is also significantly better given huge cost reductions implemented by Governor Brown. The annual budget deficit a couple of years ago, in California was approximately $26 billion. It is now been trimmed to roughly $5 billion. To close the remaining $5 billion budget shortfall, several tax increase scenarios have been proposed and are in the qualification process for the ballot in November. This includes a proposal that is championed by Governor Brown, which proposes a combination of temporary increases and income tax on high income families and $0.50 sales tax increase. Other proposals are also targeting the ballot in November, including the proposal for a split role for property taxes, which would allow commercial property to be reassessed every three years, while leaving the Prop 13 mandated maximum 2% increase in property taxes in place for residential property. We believe that the Governor Brown proposed tax increase is most likely to be included on the ballot in November and thus Prop 13 will likely not be changed. I would now like to turn the call over to Erik. Thank you.
Erik Alexander – Senior Vice President and Divisional Manager: Thank you, Mike. It is my pleasure to be here to report our fourth quarter operating results and share some of our views for 2012. After posting the best sequential scheduled rent gain since 2007 last quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of building occupancy during the fourth quarter. We were successful in gaining 120 basis points of occupancy during the quarter, while still achieving modest rent growth during this seasonably slow period. And that result with 6.5% year-over-year gain in gross revenues for the quarter. I too would like to offer my congratulations to the dedicated people of operations that made this happen. Well done team. The quarter was characterized by good demand in all of our markets and healthy renewal activity throughout most of the portfolio. Current demand is at or above our expectations for this time of the year. By and large customers continue to report strong satisfaction, turnover remained low, move-outs due to affordability are in check and home buying is still not a major factor driving turnover. New multifamily housing supply remains very low and largely concentrated in the few areas of our portfolio. Our 2012 delivery expectations are detailed on page S15 on the supplemental package. Based on the existing pipeline, total housing deliveries are expected to peak in 2014, where housing deliveries as a percentage of existing stock are expected to be 0.9% in Seattle, 0.6% in Northern California and 0.4% in Southern California. These estimates are based on total housing construction, which includes both rental and for sale product, and are in part based on limited development of for sale homes throughout our coastal market. So, couple these dynamics with a portfolio occupancy in excess of 97% and we believe we are in good position to push rental costs and are optimistic about the prospects for 2012. As I said earlier, we believe the fundamental to deliver strong results are in place and we look forward to improving performance throughout the year. During the quarter, we completed almost 3,500 new lease transactions and signed nearly 3,700 renewals. As expected during the holiday season, new lease rate were lower than the peak of the third quarter, but we still recorded a 2% gain over expiring rate. Renewal rates continue to be strong and average more than 6%, a 6% gain during the quarter. Average rental rates for new move-ins grew throughout the quarter and we’re the highest during December as they approached capacity – as we approached capacity. In January, the average new rental rate for all transactions was $1,460 matching our peak month of August in 2011. So, despite a seasonally slow our demand period, we have seen good results in the first month of the year and believe rent growth should be healthy throughout 2012. In January, our loss to lease for the same-store portfolio is 3%, but with offer pricing already moving higher in February, I expect economic rents to grow during the first quarter and our loss to lease to be closer to 4% to 5% by the end of the period. First quarter renewal activities has been good so far with an average rent gain of 4.2% over expiring rates through yesterday, while average renewal offers for March and April ranged from 3% to 8% across the portfolio. As expected, operating expenses were down during the fourth quarter and under control for the year, utilities, property taxes and payroll increases will likely increase our expense growth 2% to 3%. In 2012, we will continue to be vigilant about gaining cost and pursuing initiatives and technologies that help us improve efficiency. Turning your attention to our lease up activity, Essex was busy in 2011 as we stabilized seven communities during the year deal with the most recent to achieve occupancy above 95% as we stabilized the residential unit six months ahead of schedule. Reveal in the Warner Center area of Los Angeles continues to lease ahead of plan and is currently 87% occupied and 90% leased. Although the end is near with this 438 unit project. We do face a fair number of lease expirations during the next two quarters so, we do not expect stabilization to occur until April. We only planned one new delivery this year, which is a 66 unit infill development at our Woodland Commons property in Bellevue. This project includes a new leasing office and amenity package for the entire community. Essex will be delivering more than 900 units next year. Now I will comment on each of our regions beginning with Seattle. Market trends were down slightly 1% on a sequential basis but average property rent grew 7.8% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Depending on the submarket we are still within 3% to 6% of the previous peak in 2008 and up 18.5% from the drop. At the end of December, occupancy was 97.3% among stabilized assets with the 4.1% net availability. As of January 30, occupancy remained unchanged at 97.3 with the 5.2% availability. The job picture continues to be strong in Seattle as we saw 2.7% job growth for 2011 and expect a 1.8% gain in 2012. Boeing added more than 1,800 jobs during the quarter, but more importantly, Boeing announced it will produce the 737 MAX in Renton. Office absorption was modestly positive this quarter, Amazon will occupy the last phase of its main campus in downtown and is reported that they are pursuing an additional 300,000 to 400,000 square feet of office space to satisfy their growing needs. Expansions of eBay, Expedia and Microsoft that also been reported recently. Turning to Northern California, market rents were down 0.5% sequentially with the average rents growing 9.3% compared to last year’s fourth quarter based on submarket location we are now at prior peak level to 3.5% above the peak and up 19% from the bottom. At the end of December, occupancy was 97.5% with the 3.8% net availability. As of January 30, the occupancy inched up to 97.6% with a 4.2% availability. Job growth continues to be solid in Northern California and ended the year up 1.7% and was led by San Jose which posted a 3% annual gain. There are no signs of this changing as we call for 2.3% job growth in the submarket for 2012. This is highlighted on S-15 of the supplement along with all of our submarket job forecast. Another strong sign of expansion for the region is the central capital flows reached an all-time high during 2011 with $11.7 billion committed to investment. Absorption of office space and R&D further supports our belief that the region will continue to experience a healthy economy and continued job growth. During the quarter, we saw another 1.9 million square feet of office space lease. San Jose alone took down more than a million feet of office and R&D space combined during the period. Finally, in Southern California, market rents were up 0.4% sequentially and average rents moved 3.5% over the same period last year. Based on submarket location we have reached rent levels equal to the prior peaks in San Diego and are within 3% to 6% of our prior peak for the rest of Southern California. At the end of December, Southern California was occupied at 96.7% compared with 5.4% net availability. As of January 30, occupancy stood at 96.3% with a 5.9% availability.  With respect to military presence in San Diego, there is a transitional reduction of troops due to budget cuts, military housing policies, and a temporary relocation of the USS Ronald Reagan to Washington, but the net effect of troop rotation in the region is expected to be positive for 2012. There is nothing dramatic to note on the job spread in Southern California during the fourth quarter as we saw year end with a 1% gain over 2010. Greater job creation will be the key to delivering more robust revenue growth in Southern California, but low supply and availability, particularly in Los Angeles and Ventura counties should help us achieve the targeted rent growth in the region for 2012. We believe that Southern California holds the greatest potential to generate results more favorable than planned. Office space absorption saw the strongest quarter of 2011 with 1.2 million square feet absorbed. Orange County accounted for half of that leasing activity. So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with fourth quarter results and our performance in 2011. As usual, jobs and housing supply are key drivers of our results. We continue to believe that Essex is located in excellent markets and that there are many positive indicators to suggest we will be able to build on our success during 2012. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Mike Dance – Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Thanks, Erik. Today, I’ll provide an overview of the fourth quarter financial results and provide some comments on our 2012 guidance. During our third quarter call, we provided 2011 guidance for total net operating income of $307.5 million and our result exceeded those levels by $1.2 million or $0.03 a share. As Erik described in his remarks, the leasing of the Via occurred much faster than our internal projections demonstrating the strength of the Silicon Valley rental market and contributed to the net higher operating income for the quarter. However, the increase in net operating income from Via has other accounting consequences, concessions in the lease up or the norm even in the strong rental market. However, there is a difference in the accounting for free rent between Essex and our peers and that we do not record rental income during the free rent period. The accelerated lease up also caused unfavorable variances in our interest expense and G&A expense. Once Via reach stabilization on the residential units, we ceased capitalizing interest on the cost of residential units and therefore we have higher interest expense. As the development activity started to wind down, we also reduced the allocation of development overhead to the project and that increase our general and administrative expenses. While we had incrementally higher G&A and interest expense this quarter, it should not be lost that overall we saved $17 million on Villa compared to our original budget and approximately $5 million of these savings can be attributed to the accelerated lease up. It was the right decision to accelerate lease up of Villa given the opportunity to do so. Thus the related increase in interest expense and G&A expense of approximately $400,000 this quarter were attributed to the lease up of Villa and should not detract from our solid quarter. Currently all the active developments are owned by joint venture partners. As now shown on S-14 in our supplemental material we now have higher management fees from development that are earned from our joint venture partners. These fees however are offset by the cost of development employees and their associate overhead. I think it is important to note that when developments are done on balance sheet all the associated costs are capitalized. During 2011, when we started development in the joint venture the overhead cost associated with the third party interest in these ventures have been allocated in G&A. Beginning in 2012, we will match these expenses to the management fee earnings instead of including them in our G&A expenses. During the quarter the IRS completed every deal of a loss from a taxable REIT subsidiary that resulted in a tax refund of $1.7 million or $0.5 of share. With this increase in income from the tax benefit we achieved the high end of our range for funds from operations of $5.74 for 2011. I might now to highlight some of the changes we’ve made to Page S11 in the supplement. We added additional detail on the components to make up our equity income from co-investments on the income statement. We hope this additional detail will help make modeling this line easier in the future. For 2012, we expect co-investment income to be 27.1 mid volume. The breakdown for the 2012 guidance was roughly $14.6 million income from operations from our operating joint ventures and $12.5 million in preferred equity income. The $12.5 million preferred earnings includes assets with 50% interest in the Park Merced preferred equity investment. Although we can’t disclose specific detail on the Park Merced investment, we have disclosed in FY ‘11 the information needed to forecast our 2012 earnings. The $123 million book value of preferred investment multiplied by the weighted average preferred return of 10.2% approximate the $12.5 million used in our guidance. We expect interest expense to increase over 2011 as a result of the full effect. The financing activities related to the 2011 investment and the reduction of taxable variable rate exposure of 19% of total debt at the end of 2011 to roughly 6% of total debt at the end of – 19% at the end of 2010 to roughly 6% of total debt at the end of 2011. We intend to maintain adequate capacity on our unsecured bank line which can be done by either exercising accordion feature available on the current line or by paying down the line with proceeds from another unsecured bank term loan similar to the loan closed last month and private placements of unsecured debt or a debut public debt offering. Our guidance assumes that the majority of our ‘12 guidance or ’12 acquisitions will be done on balance sheet with 40% unsecured debt and 60% common equity from our after market equity program. Once we file our 2011 10-K we plan to increase the size of the existing ATM program. That ends my comments and I’ll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will be now conducting the question-and-answer session (Operator Instruction). Our first question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Swaroop Yalla – Morgan Stanley:  Yes, hi. I’m looking at S-14, same-store NOI growth shows the change of 7.7% slightly different from 7% to 9% guidance which you gave earlier. Just wondering if that is the yield math or there has been some reassessment of conditions in the last two weeks?
Michael Schall: Swaroop, now this is Mike. No, it really wasn’t that, it was just simply rounding off. We do budgets from September to November and we rely on them. We use a ground up budgeting process and then we decided that the range given, where we stood in December was better than to some of the ground up budgets and we decided to keep a range of 7% to 9%. So, we could get the appropriate.
Swaroop Yalla – Morgan Stanley: Great. And the acquisitions which you completed, can you talk about the cap rates there and also there seems to be sort of redevelopment component, where do you expect yields to come in after you finish some of those?
Michael Schall: I think the average cap rate of the properties that we acquired in 2011 is somewhere around 5%. As you point out, a number of them involved some kind of repositioning, which will increase the yields from there. The newer properties consistent with what I said in my prepared comments are lower than that. They are 4.5% to 4.75% range and the value-added opportunities are in the 5.25% to 5.5% range. So, over time, we are not in any tremendous hurry to complete these redevelopments. In some cases, it will take several years by the time we complete the exterior renovation and then the upgrade of the leasing office and amenities and then finally do the unit terms without drop in occupancies significantly. That process takes several years to play out.
Swaroop Yalla – Morgan Stanley: Got it. And just lastly on from California, you mentioned that this greatest potential to surpass guidance there, just wondering what some markets, I mean, if you can just talk a little about some markets and possibly Los Angeles and Orange County?
Erik Alexander: This is Erik. I think, again, consistent with comments with the low supplies and not just our low availability, but market availability is low. And really all four counties would have a major presence, where we have seen activity, more recently, rents moving up, offered rates being expected, new rents going higher, is that in Los Angeles in particular. Some parts of Orange County and Ventura has been actually strong over the last couple of months and so we are looking for that to go, to continue in the same direction. San Diego has been pretty consistent with the expectations so far.
Swaroop Yalla – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Jana Galan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, thank you. I was curious in your guidance for acquisitions in 2012, are you looking at any opportunities outside of your current markets?
Erik Alexander: We are not, at this point in time, we are – I think I have commented on prior calls that we are adding some East Coast markets to our market research process, but we do not expect to make any changes in our geography in the foreseeable future. So, for now, it's just – it’s just a point of reference or information to us.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you. And then in regards to you mentioned developers or marketing deals that you felt that they were kind of underwritten. Is it more the underwriting difficulty or you just think that the returns aren't high enough for the risk?
Michael Schall: Well, if you think CEO math is in question, developer math I think is much more so. So, developer math and John Eudy is here, he lives with this everyday, but we just don’t buy a lot of the performance. So, John, do you want to comment?
John Eudy: I think that said it Mike. No, just the expectations for – we all believe that rents are going up over the next couple of years quite a bit, but there is a bit spread as on what we think versus what some folks say.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
John Eudy: Price going in.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Hey guys, thanks.
John Eudy: Hello Eric.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: You’ve always been very good about finding, I guess, what I'd call interesting investment opportunities to supplement your core earnings growth. I guess I was thinking back to 2009 when you were buying multi-family bonds, which obviously turned out to be a great decision. So, I am just curious today from your perspective what’s the most interesting investment opportunities outside of your core business?
Michael Schall:  It’s a great question Eric. And I don’t think I have a simple answer. I think that finding well located properties that are that we can add value to continues to be the best overall return and I say that because in many cases just take a step back and you look at the apartment markets particularly in urban California, where you’ve got less than 0.5% to 1% of stock being produced in any one year, that means that by definition the average age of the multifamily stock is more than 20 years old. Well, there are repositioning opportunities within that 80% to 90% of the marketplace that I think are really pretty interesting and so I think that is a key focus that we see this year. I think that we have come tremendously long way under John Burkart’s direction in our redevelopment programs in terms. We’ve now done a lot of full scale redevelopments and we’ve been able to do them cost effectively and adding value along the way. And I think that those opportunities are really pretty exciting. I also think that the preferred equity investments of the general statement given how low the underlying first mortgages are on a lot of these properties have Fannie, Freddie, debt in the high 3% range for 10 year financing, creates a lot of cash flow in these transactions, which is perfect for these preferred equity investments. So, I think it will be a processing involving careful selection. I think there is still pretty significantly good opportunities out there to choose from.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Great and then you brought up the low, I guess the low cost on GSE data and I guess just thinking about, where interest rates are today versus also how well your stock has done over the last year. I mean does having that low cost of capital change your investment hurdles at all or are you still sort of staying firm and saying 8% to 10% unleverred is where we want to be even though our cost of capital has come down over the last year?
Michael Schall:  Our formula for determining whether to buy something or build something really starts with what is the value and the cash flow embedded in the share of stock from the existing portfolio and trying to determine, whether we are making the company better i.e., accretive to NAV, accretive to cash flow. And so we won financial models on the company trying to gauge into the key components and what we’re trying to do is accrete to the shareholder interest. So, it changes almost daily. Obviously as the stock price changes then interest rates change and therefore it’s really to be genesis of where the fund and third-party joint ventures come from. If we can find a cheaper cost of capital represented by them and a different risk reward scenario, we’ll go in that direction otherwise we will be acquiring on balance sheet. But that is a iterative process and one that we will be pursuing as we look at each deal this year.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay. That’s it from me. Thank you.
Michael Schall:  Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: Good day. As you guys see this tech boom resurge, I mean we heard Boston talk about in their call yesterday you guys have obviously outlined it. Are you seeing this expand to other market outside of San Francisco and the Peninsula Valley and what I mean is expand in a meaningful way, where you think there are other parts of the West Coast that could really get traction out of this?
John Lopez: This is John Lopez, Alex. Are you meaning outside of what the core markets we currently operate in or just?
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: No, no in your core market, there is a lot of buzz about how the tech boom has really exploded, having maybe I just don’t read the Seattle papers enough or the L.A papers enough. But don’t seem to hear as much buzz coming out of those markets I just curious last tech boom we had Seattle was hot that as well. So, I’m just sort of curious if you’re seeing it in some of your market?
Erik Alexander:
 :
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill: I think John you would agree that certain other – parts of the Bay Area, biotech is in certain areas for example and even pushing up outside of Silicon Valley into Alameda County. We have Tesla and Solyndra not only in Fremont for example. So, I think it is as things become more expensive there is a tendency to push out these different – get a different types of technology and or submarket driven depending upon where each of these technologies are biotech versus software versus other types of things, wouldn't you say that’s true?
Erik Alexander: Yeah after that I would add on to that, that I think what you might want to look at this time, Alex that maybe other than the last tech boom was the emergence of the health in biosciences and that is a very big component obviously in Northern California markets, but it is also has a big presence in San Diego, but that is an area where that will be expanding as it go on – if that’s going to be a larger percentage of the expenditures that we see it in the increase in the amount of money spend towards venture capital in those life science areas.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill:  Okay, so you would expect to see that in the same sort of rent surge?
Erik Alexander: Yes.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill:  Okay and then specifically on Seattle, there is some talk that in South Lake Union especially there is a concern about potential oversupply, is that a concern for you guys?
Erik Alexander: There is a lot being build Downtown relative to what was being build a couple of years ago which was very little. Roughly right now there is about 6,000 units under construction in Seattle, roughly 5,000 that is Downtown, but it’s a very big chunk, its about 40% of the overall metropolitan area and if you look at the number of jobs versus housing units that are available to live Downtown, it is one of those core areas where there is more workers than housing supply to them and over the last 15, 20 years its been more of a push for the higher income people getting jobs Downtown because it's more of the tech and more of the healthcare is going Downtown. We are seeing people choosing to live Downtown versus commute to the far suburb, which is becoming extremely difficult. So if you look at – I would say that you have to also remember that initial boom was due to a abating of BMRs if you got it in during the year. So what I think you will see is a little less starts this year and so I don’t think that is going to be a reason to think either the Downtown or the total market. In the end, we think it will always gets delivered, it still 1.1% multifamily are less than one on the total residential supply line, so, we are looking at – we are getting job worth of 2%, we expect that to continue for several years.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill:  Okay. So, the point is you are not expecting like repeat of what happened in Belvieu, what is…
Michael Schall: I think what happened there was, it was driven by the incredible belief in the condos, you could sell anything in any price market which drilled, I would think way more than half of the deliveries that we saw and convert to apartment that’s not going to happen this time.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill:  Okay.
Mike Dance: Not to mention that 2.5% to 3% job growth in Seattle became minus 10 in 2008 that had a small impact.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill:  Right, right, okay. And then just on the JV front just given the prospect of rates staying low through 14, pension funds they were trying to catch up, are you getting more calls from pension funds who want to partner with you to try and solve their long-term return hurdles?
John Burkart: Hey, Alex, this is John Burkart. Absolutely that is the case, we’ve obviously long-term relationships, great relationships in the pension fund, private equity world, but we are getting calls certainly from people, they talked for a long time and many new calls interested investors as going through invest in West Coast multifamily.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill:  Okay. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thanks Alex.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Garg with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Gautam Garg – Credit Suisse:  Hi, guys. Obviously the Facebook IPO is going to pump a lot of capital into the system, I’m just trying to gauge – better gauge the impact that could have on the Bay Area of rental market, is there anything you can talk about with regards to the fact the Google IPO had on the markets around 2004 and 2005 time period?
John Lopez: Well, its very difficult job, again this is John Lopez. It is very difficult to pair out across the entire MSA impact of the Google money that it had on the housing market. I mean, I think what it will probably do, it will solidify the single family market on the peninsula much quicker than you’ll see in the multifamily of good change. But then again that will then triple down to a solid, solid single family prices shooting up is only good for a multifamily side.
Gautam Garg – Credit Suisse: Right, okay.
John Lopez: Yeah, I think it’s more an indirect effect we know that it will just be a less alternative for people who are getting job from the future to buy.
Gautam Garg – Credit Suisse: Makes sense. And another question if I remember correctly I think on your last call you mentioned something about additional vacancies you do student rentals which a lot of the students moved out of your apartment unit went to an on campus option. What percentage of the portfolio does it represent now and is there any outlook you have on that front for 2012?
Erik Alexander: Yeah, this is Erik. I commented on that. I mean there is really three properties that are dominated by students, two in Santa Barbara and the small one in the Santa Cruz, one in Santa Cruz fully occupied during the fourth quarter and we made good progress actually in Santa Barbara by doing bed rentals and respectively the occupancy there is about 90%. The – our outlook is better frankly we had two windows of demand one actually starts in February goes for a couple of months and then the other one towards the end of the summer before the semester starts and we’ve already seen in Santa Barbara a big uptick in interest phone calls and visits including from freshmen that are already looking for housing for next year, so through a positive sign for us and in fact if I think we were still able to get rentals during a very good timeline it's difficult to do, so we’re changing the approach a little bit now that we exchange some success with the bad rentals and so we look to be fully occupied before the semester starts in the fall.
Gautam Garg – Credit Suisse: Sounds good.
Erik Alexander: And that similar rent probably a little bit higher, I think we called for 3% increase on the rent based on the fact that we don’t think there is any new supply threat facing us this year.
Gautam Garg – Credit Suisse: That sounds okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS: Hey, its Ross Nussbaum here with Derek Bower, I got a question regarding Prop 13, if I look at your same-store pool and if I am looking at the numbers right, in California you guys stayed somewhere around $29 million worth of real estate taxes in 2011, if did you have to take a guesstimate as to if you’re effectively mark-to-market that number, what do you think the tax number might be?
Mike Dance: Hi, Ross, this is Mike Dance. Yes, about $20 million probably $22 million to $24 million.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS: I am sorry it would be another.
Mike Dance: Yes.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS: 24
Mike Dance: Yes.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS: So almost double that you got, but.
Mike Dance: Right.
Michael Schall: That’s correct.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS: And when you guys talked earlier about market cap rate, just want to make sure we’re definitionally correct? Those are basically on if I will mark-to-market tax numbers so that’s what the buyer effectively is paying?
Michael Schall: Exactly. We have a definition that we’ve used for many years for cap rate and I realized can be different from what others use, ours is a standardized 95% occupancy, market rents today a normal management fee pre-capital, pre-CapEx.
Ross Nussbaum – UBS: Makes sense. Yep. Thanks very much.
Michael Schall: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Well hello guys, thank you for allowing my guest appearance.
Michael Schall: Hello, well welcome back David.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: I have a couple of old chessnuts to throw at you or at least to kick around as this with either rate of rental increases particularly experiencing in Northern California, are we anywhere close to a political response in terms of the rent cap?
Michael Schall: It’s a good question David. And, I can’t – I don’t know with certainty what exactly is going to happen within the political scheme. We have maintained a process by eliminating our to one renewal option to 15% increase largely because of the some of the issues that have cropped up in the past as it relates to that issue. And, so far I don’t know of any organized activity that is pushing on the rent control front, but we continued to monitor it closely, it’s important to us, and so far so good.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: When we experienced this last time, was it more of a Northern California phenomenon or Southern or was it just above and down?
Michael Schall: It’s one of those subjects and issues that is the pretty well-received by the people. So, it’s everywhere…
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay.
Michael Schall: And so I wouldn’t limit it to any one market.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: And I think it was on a couple of calls ago, you made reference to the social network, obviously for Facebook and others sort of adding another dimension to tenants understanding of what’s happening in the marketplace, how is that playing out in terms of sort of the tenants sort of, I mean, e-mailing one another, Facebooking one another with regard to chatter about rent increases?
Erik Alexander: There is some of that. And it actually works against us. And for us as we have a lot of the times can monitor all the activity you can see, but what people are talking about or you hear because somebody comes in to the office and we deal with it case-by-case. Thankfully I think we do a good job of providing service and housing and often times we have plenty of defenders which is the best thing. We don’t have to get involved in it at all. We have the other tenants talk to me about how great their experience is at Essex and a lot of people that are in touch with the competitive market. They will tell you hey, you think that’s bad you should go see X, Y, Z and how much their rent is. Nobody likes getting an increase, but you're still way better off here than there.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. On another subject, it was good to see property sale will be only $7.4 million could you give me the total of how many properties you sold last year?
Erik Alexander: Two.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Two, for how much Mike.
Michael Schall: I think one was low 20 millions and the other was…
Erik Alexander: 15.7, yeah.
Michael Schall: So, low 20 million.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. And any idea what you might do this year, I don’t think unless I have missed it, you have not included as a specific reference point in your guidance?
Michael Schall: I would say $50 million to $100 million.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: $50 million to $100 million. And if you will be upper end of that, would that mean that perhaps you did a little less ATM issuance?
Michael Schall: That’s correct.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. So, we could see the two being as intangible one off or more?
John Burkart: This is John Burkart. We are pretty opportunistic about our sales. We have actually a very good portfolio overall. So, we are ending up recruiting a few things here and there, but the execution is very opportunistic. So, if the situation is right on the small office buildings with an absolute excellent execution by the team involved, so if you are an owner/operator at what was probably low 2s in actual cap and an economic cap of about 4.25% assuming 20% office vacancy like the market currently has. So, that type of stuff will be all day long and it keeps for those opportunities.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay. And could we assume that will be more second half of the year rather than front end of the year?
John Burkart: We actively market properties, so it will be when do the opportunities come up?
David Harris – Imperial Capital: But nothing imminent?
John Burkart: Yeah.
David Harris – Imperial Capital: Okay, alright great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Thank you and thank you for friending me.
Michael Schall: Always a pleasure.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So, to Ross Nussbaum’s question in the NAV or the property tax impact from Prop 13, if I am doing this math correctly would that be $13 a share value roughly to your NAV?
Michael Schall: You mean, at the current multiple, if you just do the straight line on the multiple?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Well, I mean, if I were to just take out, say add more cost to the NOI line item and then CapEx, I mean, in that range?
Michael Schall: Yeah, if you’re just saying, yes.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Something like that, I mean, depending on the cap rate I use it would change, but obviously…
Michael Schall: I guess, the one comment I’d make Rich is that if you’re using trailing NOI, remember properties trade on a current market, not a trailing basis. And I’d argue that, that number probably offsets pretty much the Prop 13 NAV impact.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, okay fair enough. And on the Prop 13 comments that you made at the beginning of the call, what is the risk that they might view multifamily housing as commercial property. Is there any risk of that it could be – they could further bifurcate residential in to single family and then the multifamily business that you guys run?
Michael Schall:  It’s another good question and if you look at the history of Prop 13. It has been challenged in every conceivable fashion from the course to the initiative process, to the legislature; it’s been attacked hundred different ways with a hundred different approaches. So, it’s difficult to say this approach, the one you’re suggesting is going to be the one that prevails. It’s a political process Rich and as you know they’re pretty hard to predict. I will tell you that largely this is a matter of dollars. It’s a matter of dollars supporting the path of least resistance to get tax increases in California and for the most part, whatever the donors, which are likely the state employee unions that are providing the big dollars to get most of these proposal served, they’re going to pick, whatever they think is going to be the path of least resistance. After this point after what is been 30 years of Prop 13 its been tried a lot of different times and a lot of different ways, actually not been obviously the path of least resistance because taxes have gone up here many times over that period of time. So, it was why it was labeled the third rail of California politics and I don’t believe that anything has changed that.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay and then the last question, as you mentioned kind of the intelligent gathering in the East Coast to recovery. But I don’t remember exactly, but how long have you been kind of just staying knowledgeable on the East Coast. Is that always been the case or did you just kind of start keeping your eye on the price our way?
Michael Schall:  Well you will recall that we’re in a bidding process.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Town and Country?
Michael Schall: Yeah, Town and Country and so we’ve had some level of market research that we have just increased the intensity of that. So that it is similar to what we do on the West Coast in terms of market timing model trying to understand the supply demand relationships and hopefully looking for balances. And we believe that rents have great growth potential on the West Coast, which is why we wouldn’t make that shift at this point in time. We think we have about the best locations that there are in nation and we don’t want to dilute that presence. But the whole purpose of the market research review is to try to identify entry points and get the timing right. So that’s what we are looking for.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay sounds good. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird:  Thanks very much. To follow-up on David’s earlier question, what is the range of acquisition and disposition volume that is underlying your FFO guidance range for the year?
Mike Dance: Acquisitions we’re looking $400 million to $500 million and dispositions between $50 million and $100 million. What we’re targeting is kind of a net accretion of about a $1 million.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: And on the dispositions Mike, is it more market, submarket dynamics or the age of the properties that a CapEx might be needed. What’s driving your selection process?
Michael Schall:  You had that’s all of them, it’s a variety of decisions, where we evaluate the portfolio and look for situations that we think we can improve the portfolio by selling the assets sometimes it relates to long-term rent growth, sometimes CapEx, a variety of items in here.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Okay thanks. And then also for Mike Dance, I’m sorry Mike, I just think I just missed some of this in your commentary and your prepared remarks. What drove the cost savings on via relative to budget? I know you still obviously with some of it was attributable to the earlier than expected lease up. Is there any other major contributors?
Mike Dance: $5.5 million of that was used interest expense, property tax expense, capitalized overhead, all of the stock cost, all the other cost were hard cost savings.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: And was that on product cost, labor cost and mix of everything?
Mike Dance: I will let John answer that.
John Eudy: Combination of things, it was acceleration to the job we got done six months ahead of schedule. So, general conditions were less. It was that the buyout occurred in declining market at the time the buyout was done on the material side as well as the labor side.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: And then finally, just a question on the development process, are you seeing you any delays in getting things permitted or approved given the workload that some municipalities are having overloaded. I just read today that San Jose is trying to take some action to lower fee construction taxes in the city per office development and requesting in the budget to add staff for the planning commissions. Are you seeing any challenges in that way?
Erik Alexander : There are issues. All of the cities had some form of staff reduction 2, 2.5 years ago. We hadn’t added much to staff. So, there is some friction there, yes.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. That’s all I have.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon guys. Mike, I want to go back to the disposition topic. You talked a little bit on prior call about wanting to grow the size of the company too much. And it sounds like you are looking at many of the acquisitions on balance sheet. Yet the disposition plans fairly small. Can you give us an update as to where you stand on that front and whether it's more just a cycle timing or is there a plan to grow the portfolio at this point?
Michael Schall: Yeah, it’s a little bit of each of those things. That is cycle timing and when you’re getting big rent growth and amid low cap rates you’re trying to get to the best of both world’s and so we’re trying to time our activity so that we maximize value. We hesitate to try to focus on a specific amount of dispositions in any one year because it can change over time. We have a choice of funding our acquisitions with dispositions proceeds for example or a combination of stock and debt or joint venture equity. So, we look at it holistically and we try to find the best approach to maximize value. So, it can change over time.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: And that’s helpful. A question on operations, can you bifurcate within the portfolio kind of the performance of some of the newer Class A properties you’ve bought some of the condos relative to some of your would you call kind of Class B type assets in terms of what you’re seeing on rents in the Southern California markets. And also I’m just curious if there is any markets, where you’re starting as you are pushing pricing aggressively, if you’re seeing any doubling up starting to emerge?
Erik Alexander: Hi this is Erik. We haven’t seen or heard a lot about any of the double ups, if we go to the second part of your question with respect to As and Bs I think all of the property types that performed well in the stronger markets. So, certainly in the Bay Area and the Pacific Northwest, they performed equally as well. There is probably a little bit of difference in Southern California between the new condos quality stuff and some of the B products we’ve seen they go up and down a little bit. So, I think the greatest potential is, with some of those As and gone down Orange County and so forth we expect greater performance out of those may be this year, but its pretty close.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: And the same is true in Seattle?
Erik Alexander: The same is definitely true in Seattle. We have a couple of properties out there, performing of As, performed very well and the Bs have as well. So I think certainly when you have the strong market conditions like you have in Seattle in the Bay area they all move. We see the malls are moving together, where you have maybe more modest growth in Southern California maybe there is a little bit more movement in the Bs at that time. But again when things tightened up in the submarkets we’ve seen nice jump in the A products. So I think when you start to see more consistent overall market performance, the economy and the job situation improves. I think we’re going to see the As maybe moving a little faster.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, then final question, two- part. I apologize if I missed this. Mike you usually go through cap rates. Could you give us the update on those and IRR targets for acquisitions versus development and then also thinking on the dividend at this point?
Michael Schall: Sure. I did go through the cap rates A and A product and A location in the low to mid 4 range, B and A location sort of high 4 to low 5 range. We think those unlevered IRRs and 8.25 to mid 9 range depending on what we’re looking at. I think that does it, right.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Development?
Michael Schall: Development, on the development side, yeah the comment that I made was the development cap rates based on today, market rents in place today are in the mid 5s really not all that different from the year ago. The difference obviously is that in some cases rents have moved a big number 20% or something like that. So, obviously, a deal before a 20% rent jump and after is not really the same deal. So, that is where market selection and timing really comes into play and something that John Eudy and I talk about a lot.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets:  And then finally just dividend?
Michael Schall: Dividend we are – we propose that to the Board. I don’t want to guess what the Board might say. I’ll give you a little bit of historical precedent however and that is to follow the FFO growth rate of the prior year. However in this case, because we had a couple of years of declining FFO and we increased the dividend a very small amount we will play some catch up. So, I am guessing it will be in the mid – maybe little bit higher single-digit range.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates:  Hey, good afternoon. Couple of quick ones. Moving out to buy homes during the quarter, I've heard the portfolio and any movements regionally worth noting?
Erik Alexander:  No, region is really, this is Erik, worth noting. It’s in the portfolio wise it’s in that 9% to 12% range, which is consistent with sort of the long-term activity. It has been as high in the 15%, 16% I think for a couple of quarters during the boom. And I think it hit a low in the 8 – just over 8% range.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay. And other question is I know that the topic of single family rentals has come up in the past as it relates to the expected impact on your portfolio or others from a competitive standpoint, but just given the continued headlines related to institutional capital entering the space, could you just talk about this from a multifamily operators' perspective in terms of the approach that one could take, should they decide to do this and what the opportunities could be on the revenue and expense side?
Michael Schall:  Yeah, Dave we – you and I have talked about this separately. And there are opportunities to buy portfolios in concert with local operators that are specializing in this type of activity. Several of which were actually at your conference sometime ago. The issue for us is the most of that is not in the markets that we are in. The typical market where that’s going to make sense is going to be a market where the homes are deeply, deeply discounted. And we are seeing in most of our markets the value of for-sale property increasing or being relatively flat and you need a big reduction in price in order to make that work in our opinion. You find those opportunities in the Inland Empire of California, in the Sacramento Valley, and in certain other areas and we have certainly looked at some of those opportunities. We struggle with how to make that a business. There may be a trade there or an opportunity to do a dealer to, but we just don’t see it as a long-term annual business and that’s why we have at this time in point its data on the sideline. There is just – there is no way that I see that in carriers where single-family homes and median price homes it's in $400,000 to $500,000 range to make that work from a single family rental standpoint. So, that is the question we continue to look at it and but at this point in time we are not seeing the fantastic opportunity.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: But, Mike, just putting the investment part of it aside and understandably still given your answer there, but just purely from an operational perspective in terms of revenue and expense synergies between the two businesses in appropriate market assuming that there is a concentrated portfolio with both multifamily units and single family, how have you thought about that?
Michael Schall: Yeah. I mean, again I think well even within our footprint. So, if you say okay, the three County Bay Area, the counties surrounding the bay, the areas that we are going to be able to buy homes that are discounted enough in order to make that work out on an investment basis are going to be areas that we all renters will not want to rent in and not want to live in. So, I am sure there are some areas where that will work and just not areas that we own property and I’ll give you some examples. Maybe Hayward have some areas where within the – within Alameda County that where you could find housing in expenses enough to generate a positive cash flow a significant positive cash flow on the rental transaction. The problem is we don’t really want to be in Hayward. It’s not one of our desired locations. We have one property there, it’s up in the hills near Cal State East Bay has very specific reason why it’s there and why it’s a good investment. That aside, we just don’t see, we don’t see it as major competition. I know that it actually you went to Skyline and you were – you noted that you caught them on a very short-term period where they had a lot of move-outs, but I think that’s an anomaly. I think that there are typically in the 20% to 25% move-out range right now to home ownership and that’s the highest end product anywhere. So, again we are sensitive to it, I assure you, we just don’t see it as being a major detraction from our operation.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Sure. I will take it offline. I understand the answer from an economic perspective, but more so was thinking about just purely operational revenue synergies and expense synergies given your platform, but I'll follow up with you. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Very good.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Yes. I am just curious across your market, if you have seen any real change in demand for all your products, whether it’s the one bedroom, two bedroom, or the three bedroom and if you are what you think is causing that or driving that?
Erik Alexander: This is Erik. We haven’t seen any unique changes in product demands. Some of the, if you might imagine, smaller ones that are in studios and the value propositions for peoples, almost don't matter what's submarket driven end and larger floor plans and three bedrooms are popular with families and tend to not always could tend to follow a pattern of school enrollment. So, I can’t say that anything unique is popping up.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Okay, thank you.
Erik Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Michael Schall – President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, in closing, I would just like to thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to continuing the conversation next quarter. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Inc. Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael J. Schall: Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, we will be making comments during the call which are not historical facts, such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are here for Q&A. I'm going to discuss 2 topics on the call today, our Q3 results and a strategy update.  So onto the first topic, Q3 results. As you know, last evening, we reported core FFO of $1.42 per share, a 14.3% increase compared to Q3 2010. Although that result was consistent with consensus estimates, that same property performance was below our expectations for the quarter, primarily due to occupancy. As Erik outlined on last quarter's call, we chose a strategy of creating higher rents for lower occupancy, which was mostly successful as rental rates increased 2.4% sequentially and 5.3% quarter-over-quarter. However, our plan to increase occupancy towards the end of the quarter was not realized as consumers reacted to the uncertainty surrounding the Eurozone and global economic issues. I am disappointed in our speed of reaction to these changing market conditions and we all realize that we must do better.  In my 25 years in this business, I've learned that the road to economic recovery is not smooth but rather a bumpy path. Having said that, I believe that you will all feel much better about where we stand after the call this morning. During the quarter, we remained active on the investment front having closed 3 acquisitions for $298 million and representing 1,383 units. That brings the total closed acquisitions and preferred equity investments through September to $489 million. We have several transactions in the pipeline in Q4, cap rates remain in the low to mid 4% range for A property and A location and high 4% range for B property in A location. We also announced a new development project, Fountains at La Brea, located in West Hollywood, as outlined in the supplement. Development deals can take a long time to put together, and we've been working on this deal since 2010. There are 3 other potential development deals in our pipeline. If they come to fruition, we should be announcing them in the next several quarters. Thus far in 2011, we started construction on 4 apartment development projects aggregating almost $350 million. Development cap rates are in the 5.5% to 5.75% range based on today's rents for deals that will be construction ready within the next 6 months. There area a significant number of potential development deals being shopped around. Most of which fall below this cap rate level and therefore, they may not be started soon. Financing development deals requires a big balance sheet, and the companies with big balance sheet are increasingly occupied with their committed pipeline. As a result, I am more confident now that apartment supply will not be as big a factor as I thought several quarters ago, at least until 2014. We continue to watch the supply picture closely.  We are pleased to increase our 2011 guidance as indicated in the press release. Mike Dance will review the guidance change components in his comments. Now into my second topic, which is strategy update. We expect to issue our 2012 guidance in late December or early January. The following comments relate to our outlook and focus for the company for the next several years. Our overall goal continues to be growth in core FFO per share to the extent its consistent with NAV growth. This is essentially the same basic goal that we've pursued for the last 17 years. We remain strongly optimistic about the apartment markets over the next 5 years, and we believe that we are in the early stages of recovery in rents, driven by the rebound in rents following the 14.5% reduction in market rents that we experienced from September 2008 to December 2009.  At September 30, market rents were still approximately 2% below the prior peak. Given these factors and with an assumption for a slow but steady pace economic recovery, we believe that our portfolio will experience weighted average market rent growth of approximately 28% over the next 5 years.  Our confidence is based on the following observations. First, the West Coast recovered later and thus has more room for growth before hitting natural limits such as rent-to-median-income ratios. Second, a better than average job growth outlook led by the tech sector. Third, for sale development continues to be at very muted levels and it will take at least a few years for apartment supply to recover. Fourth, demographic tailwinds, including retirement and downsizing by the baby boomers and their desire for accessible units and the echo boomers entering their prime rental years. On total housing supply, we believe that it will take several years for supply levels to recover. In Seattle for example, total housing supply is expected to be 0.4% of existing housing stock in 2011, growing to approximately 1% in 2014.  Following a similar pattern, in 2014, housing supply is expected to reach 0.6% of stock in Northern California and 0.7% of stock in Southern California. Thus, even with limited job/demand growth, the West Coast markets are expected to have an undersupplied housing condition. We also studied the various East Coast markets and have chosen to remain focused on the West Coast largely because of the factors noted above. We have made significant improvement in the overall quality of the portfolio through our recent acquisition and development efforts. With distress abating, our focus will be on well-located B quality property. We expect to remain an active investor for the foreseeable future. As in the past, we will focus on acquisitions that are accretive to the portfolio's cash flow and AVN growth rate. For practical purposes, those acquisitions will need a minimum 9% unlevered IRR to be accretive; 9% to 11% fixed returns on structured finance investment, which we will likely limit to about 5% of total capitalization; development deals with a 10-plus-percent unlevered IRR, with the company's unfunded commitment to development expenditures targeted 5% to 7% of total capital. We will expand our property sales activities over the next several years, mostly to call the portfolio of property with lower financial recurring expectations and the sale fund, too. Our valuation thus far indicates that up to 20% of our property will be available for sale over the next several years. The key considerations in the sales decisions will continue to include use of proceeds, competitive cost of capital options, the effect of Prop. 13 in California and also growth rates and cap rates both relative to the portfolio and to the stock price.  As an example, we have sold one property this year and have listed several others that were originally acquired as part of the merger with John M. Sachs in 2002. Redevelopment is an important part of our overall strategy. Our coastal markets are producing less than 1% of housing stock in a typical year. Thus over 20 years, we will produce somewhere around 20% of stock, meaning that 80% of existing housing stock will be in excess of 20 years old. Given that environment, redevelopment is an essential part of our overall strategy. With the drop in construction costs amid the great recession, we completed more than 10 major exterior modernization projects, which are now ready for interior unit term programs. Beginning in 2012, we will ramp up our unit term programs to be from 1,000 to 1,200 units per year. We expect redevelopment to contribute 8% to 10% cash and cash returns and a high teen IRRs.  With respect to the balance sheet, we expect to continue to operate the company in a thoughtful and conservative manner. Given the volatility and uncertainty of the current environment, we've employed a math [indiscernible] approach to investments, whereby capital commitments are matched up against capital sources without significantly increasing our financial exposures. In this environment, having access to many capital sources is desirable. We continue to utilize joint venture partners for a significant portion of our external growth to control our forward commitments and get paid for our real estate expertise and maintain access to this important capital source. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander. Thank you.
Erik J. Alexander: Thank you, Mike. It's a pleasure to being here to report our third quarter operating results and give our view of the rest of the year. The rate growth momentum that I reported on last quarter continued to be strong into the third quarter, and allowed us to post the sequential gain in scheduled rent in more than 3 years. As you might have predicted, this growth is led by Northern California in the Pacific Northwest though Southern California showed modest growth as well. The third quarter was really marked by 2 distinct periods for Essex, the early strong part of the quarter and September. Encouraged by the acceleration in new rents, strong renewal activity, lower turnover and higher occupancy during the second quarter, we aggressively pursued a strategy to push rents during the peak demand period. As expected, we did see an increase in availability, though traffic remains strong and renewal efforts were also successful throughout the period.  In August, I think we experienced a bit of a headwind, even though traffic remained strong and existing residents were accepting higher rent rates, perspective residents seemed less confident and reported looking at more communities before making their decision. We took out some additional notices in our net availability grew. We made appropriate pricing adjustments throughout August but entering September, we felt that trying to find that optimal balance between occupancy and rent levels during this period of customer uncertainty could prove to be risky for the fourth quarter. Therefore, we've lowered our offered rates during September and then to October to ensure higher occupancy and a more manageable availability during the fourth quarter. Those adjustments proved to be wise as occupancy at the end of the quarter was 95.5% with a net availability of less than 6%. And just a month later, we had a peak of 96.6% in our occupancy with a 4.9% availability.  Not surprisingly, we experienced more vacancy loss during the third quarter. Much of this increase in vacancy was concentrated among 3 student-dominated buildings where the traditional second wave of demand never really materialized amidst a national leading fee hike of 21%, an increase in availability per on-campus housing and more doubling and tripling of students than seen in prior years. Additionally, in Ventura County, where 12% of our portfolio resides, occupancy was slower to recover and required more aggressive pricing to lower availability. It is true that the greater sequential vacancies lost actually occurred in the Pacific Northwest followed by Northern California, but that is where we achieved 3.6% and 3.7% gains on scheduled rents for the period and that would certainly be a benefit next quarter and into 2012. The average rent gains for 4,100 new transactions during the quarter was 7.5%. Additionally, rents on new move-ins during the third quarter were 3.7% higher than the new move-ins rent achieved during the second quarter. I think this stat showed clear evidence that market rents continue to rise in our region and are consistent with what has been widely reported in independent market surveys. Therefore, I believe the loss to lease in our portfolio at the end of the third quarter was only reduced by our summer harvest and stands at 5.8%. The cost additions of this lost [indiscernible] also remains the same with the Bay Area in the Pacific Northwest having the most room to grow. Renewals also continue to grow during the third quarter and were 7.8% higher than expiring leases on 4,200 transactions. October renewals have not dropped off either as renewals were executed at an average gain of 7.5%. Therefore, the combined results for achieved rents during September as well as October was actually higher than what we achieved in June on a combined basis.  As we approach the end of the year, I do expect to see some decline in our gains and renewals as market rents historically moderate compared to the summer season. Overall, we continue to believe there is an ample opportunity to increase revenue within the portfolio in the coming year.  Now with respect to operating expenses, all the drivers remain similar to the second quarter in that real estate taxes insurance, management fees and administrative costs were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2010, resulting in a modest increase over last year of 1.5%. Utility costs remain within expectations and are up only 1.7% from last year at this time. Turnover is compared -- sorry, turnover is up compared to the second quarter and in third quarter last year, and is now equal to 2010 on a year-to-date basis. Therefore, expenses were up in this category during the quarter. Additionally, cost per turn is up in all regions as we continue to improve the quality of our products in an effort to achieve higher rents. This approach applies to our renewal efforts as well as we seek to satisfy our existing residents by granting reasonable improvement requests to their home in conjunction with higher rental rates. We expect turnover costs with payers and maintenance to decline in the fourth quarter due to lower volumes and fewer onetime expenses and will look for the other expense categories to be relatively flat to down. Now with respect to our new lease-up activities during the third quarter. Following the stabilization of Skyline near than Allegro last quarter, Bellerive, Reveal, Santee Village and Via all made excellent progress during this period. We completed our final phase at Via during the quarter and are currently 64% occupied and 75% leased at this new development. We expect to reach stabilized occupancy early in the first quarter of 2012. Santee Village was leased up ahead of schedule and was 92% occupied and 95% leased at the end of October. Bellerive also leased up ahead of schedule and was 95% occupied and 100% leased at the end of October. And finally, Reveal is leasing ahead of schedule and is currently 78% occupied and 85% leased. Now, I'll comment on each of our regions. In Seattle, market rents were up sequentially 1%. Based on submarket location, we are now within 3% to 6% of our previous peak of 2008. At the end of September, occupancy in Seattle was 94.9% among stabilized assets, with a 5.6% net availability and 96.5% as of October 30 with a 4.9% availability. The job fixture continues to be strong Seattle. Throwing at that is 6,800 jobs year-to-date and is expected to add more in 2012 to keep up with production. We believe that unemployment in the region will drop below 8% next year. Continued office space [indiscernible] more jobs in the coming year. At Seattle, it absorbed more than 1.8 million square feet so far this year, or nearly 2% of stock. In Northern California, market rents were up 3% sequentially. Based on submarket location, we are now 3% to 5% above the previous peak in 2008. At the end of September, occupancy was at 96.1% with 5.6% availability and 96.7% as of October 30 with 4.8% availability. On a strength of hiring activity in the Silicon Valley, we are revising our jobs forecast up from 36,000 to 44,000 for 2011. The future remains bright in the region as office and R&D absorption continue to be positive. An additional 800,000 square feet of office space was leased in San Francisco and [indiscernible] in the quarter, while San Jose added 1 million square feet of leased office space, an additional 800,000 square feet of R&D space, following a huge absorption in the prior quarter. San Jose has now approached 4 straight quarters of positive absorption keeping us confident in continued job growth for the region and bullish on demand for apartment. Turning to Southern California, market rents were up 0.8% sequentially. Based on the submarket location, we are now within 1% to 6% of the previous peak in 2008. At the end of September, Southern California was occupied at 95.1% and had a 6.3% net availability. By October 30, the occupancy stood at 96.5% with a 5% availability. Last quarter, we revised our jobs forecast down for the region and our forecast remains unchanged this quarter. However, we have seen some improvement in the professional and business sectors in Los Angeles versus prior quarters where it was flat to negative for the category. The quarter did see some layoffs or job relocations in Ventura County specifically, including Farmers Insurance, [indiscernible] and Bank of America. Commercial space absorption was up during the quarter, with noted improvements in downtown Los Angeles, Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena. So In conclusion, we're obviously pleased with our lasting gains in scheduled rent. Occupancy is back, and we are poised for a good fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide some additional details on our '11 guidance. But before I do that, I want to highlight the changes to our debt structure that contributed to S&P's increasing their senior unsecured debt rating from BBB- to BBB. Pursuant to the $250 million secured Freddie facility, we were notified during the third quarter that Freddie would be increasing the spread on the facility effective December 1 from the current 99 basis point spread over the Freddie reference rate, to a 235 basis point spread. In preparation for the Freddie repricing, we are finalizing a new bank credit facility and opted to terminate the secured Freddie facility and expand the unsecured bank facility from $275 million to $425 million at 125 basis point spread over LIBOR with a 5-year term including the 2 1-year extension options. The termination of the Freddie facility resulted in the acceleration of the unamortized loan fees totaling $700,000, of which half is included in the third quarter as a noncore loss on early retirement of debt and the other half is in the guidance as an increase to the fourth quarter's amortization of deferred financing costs. The Freddie facility is secured by 11 assets. After the facility is paid off with unsecured debt later this month, the secured debt to gross asset value would be 36.5% and 44% of our net operating income will be unencumbered. With upcoming maturities of secured debt and on balance sheet acquisitions, the company is considering a 2012 debut public unsecured bond offering if the public debt markets are attractive. Now turning to guidance. The increase in same property NOI guidance that was provided last quarter expected a higher vacancy and a higher maintenance and repairs expense as we aggressively increase rents and cost more resident turnover. The net operating income guidance would also predicated upon achieving the 2.4% increase with scheduled rents during the third quarter, with a decline in occupancy of approximately 70 basis points. With actual vacancy increasing 130 basis points during the quarter, our new same store net operating income guidance was reduced 60 basis points to be an increase of 5.4% year-over-year. For the month of October, financial occupancy was 96.2%, with continued increases in scheduled rents from both higher renewals and new leases over expiring rents. Our preliminary October same property results are reporting an increase of $410,000 in sequential monthly gross income over September, and $577,000 higher than the average growth income for July, August and September, giving us confidence that we are well-positioned to benefit from higher scheduled rents and occupancy in the fourth quarter and into 2012. The revised midpoint guidance for '11 projects a 3.9% increase in the same property revenues for the year and a 6.4% increase in same property revenues for the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. We are also projecting a 1.1% increase at '11 same property operating expenses and a 1.2% decline in the fourth quarter same property operating expenses compared to the comparable quarter in '10. Consistent with the fourth quarter '10 results, property operating expenses are expected to decrease significantly in the rest of the year as we reduce the number of units that will need to be turned for new resident move-ins. We had favorable change in the same-store net operating income guidance, resulting from the increase in vacancy has been offset by favorable variances from our '10 and '11 acquisitions and favorable leasing activities from the consolidated development community. As highlighted in our press release, the empty condo buildings purchased during the year will all be stabilize during the fourth quarter, and Dia is expected to be stabilized early in '12. The preliminary October results reported increase of $275,000 in nonsame property growth income in October compared to the September results. The leasing activity of West Coast joint venture Reveal property has exceeded our expectations, and the recently announced WESCO acquisition of Redmond Hill has increased our estimates for income from co-investment. The formation of a new joint venture for the Dublin development site and the WESCO acquisitions just mentioned have all increased our guidance for income from management fees.  Lastly, the lower spreads on borrowings from the new bank facility and the drop in the SIFMA index on our delay -- demand no debt has reduced our projected interest costs for the year.  This concludes my remarks, and I will return the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Mike, just to confirm so, do you say that you saw 110 basis points improvement in occupancy from end of September to end of October?
Michael T. Dance: Yes.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So given that the rent trends are going the same direction, you're seeing the same strength in renewals, is it safe to expect about 3% plus sequential growth in Q4?
Michael T. Dance: Not quite, just under 3%.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. I mean, I think -- I guess, I was just trying to understand the NOI guidance change of 60 basis points. If occupancy is being gained back and if rents are going at the same level and also you have lower expenses, I was just wondering how, why guidance is dropping?
Michael T. Dance: Because we didn't anticipate the 130 basis points decline in occupancy. We're only anticipating 70 basis points. So the regain in occupancy, we did buy back some occupancy in September that we were not expecting.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And this gain in occupancy, is it concentrated in any markets or is it sort of more uniform?
Michael T. Dance: It is uniform across the portfolio, but we lost more in the Pacific Northwest followed by the Bay Area and then Southern California. So we did gain more back in Seattle as all markets now are in that mid-96 range.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And a question for Mike Schall. On the development pipeline, can you talk a little bit about what level of starts you anticipate going forward for the next couple of years? You did about $350 million this year. But from your comments, I think it seemed like you're not seeing too many deals, which are penciling in the 5%, 5.5% yields on current trends currently.
Michael J. Schall: John Eudy is here so I'll make a couple of comments and then turn it over to him. We are seeing a pretty decent deal flow. There's a lot of deals out there for being discussed. I mentioned that we've been working on 3 other deals that are not part of the supplement and continue to be in negotiation. Therefore, there's no assurance that they will come to fruition but we're confident that they will. And so I guess from my perspective, in our perspective, we would rather develop toward the beginning of the cycle, and so we are trying to fill our development pipeline sooner rather than later. Obviously, the top of the cycle development deals even though the cap rates may be the same as the bottom of the cycle, the IRRs are dramatically different. So it is John Eudy and I talk about this all the time, and we work together to try to fill our development pipeline and I think in total, it could get to $650 million thereabouts, of which we're about half because we're doing venturing most of the development deals. So we would have unfunded commitment of somewhere around $325 million, something like that. John, do want to add in terms of just the deal flow out there? Because you're talking to a lot of these guys and there's a lot -- John and I talk about it a lot. There's a lot of stuff out there and it keeps circling around, so John, do you want to describe the environment out there?
John D. Eudy: In general, from the beginning of the spring of this year-to-date, we've seen a lot of deals that were being pitched that we didn't think met the threshold of the minimum 5.5% going in cap rate. And what we have found is the ones that had landed with the capital partner like ourselves that have [indiscernible] to do it had pretty much settled out. We have 2 to 3 more deals that are likely that we're going to be announcing in the next couple of quarters that will keep us pretty much on pace with what we started this year or next year if everything comes the way we think it's going to happen, and the deliveries would be late '13 into '14 for the entire portfolio at that time.
Michael J. Schall: We want to be a little bit careful with respect to the guidance part of this, because we're going to -- that's why I tried to keep my comments to the next several years as opposed to 2012 specifically. So please hold off and wait for our 2012 guidance discussion, which will be sharee in another month or 2. I think Mike actually has one clarification.
Michael T. Dance: I just want to make sure I understood your question. I wasn't to ensure whether you were asking about sequential increase in gross income or the year-over-year. In my prepared comments, I said that the year-over-year projected increase is 3.9%. The sequential increase will be closer to 2.3%.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Sequential growth rate, Mike?
Michael T. Dance: Yes. And gross revenue, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann from Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Mike, maybe just big picture in terms of the asset sales you talked about and the strategy going forward. I think you mentioned 20% of assets so maybe around $800 million. Should we think of that as roughly half of that as Fund II and then maybe the other half is obviously some of those lower growth assets you mentioned and maybe give us some sense of potential timing.
Michael J. Schall: Jay, that's a good question. Timing is going to be strongly a function of the items that I talked about, which are accretion, dilution, what we're going to do with the proceeds, the Prop. 13 impact. And so I don't want to go in there, essentially be sort of focused on a certain amount of dispositions in any one year. We're trying to look for the best opportunities and if you look at a graph of cap rates, for example, between A, B, C product, you will find that it compresses towards the top of the cycle, and so, I guess, the first thing we're trying to do is we're trying to get the best of the combination of cap rate and growth rates. So we expect the markets to have significant amounts of growth, therefore, that's why we haven't sold more up to this point. But as we realize that growth and we -- and cap rates remain low, that will be the primary consideration for selling property. We want to, I guess, from our perspective, yes, there are some assets that are on our disposition list and it's pretty significant list but having said that, we're not in any particular urgent. There's no particular urgency with respect to what we're going to do with the exception of Fund II it's completed its investment cycle, its life cycle so over the next couple of years, we're definitely going to sell some Fund II assets. But I'd rather -- rather than commenting about how much and exactly when, I'd rather defer that until the 2012 guidance discussion.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And at this point, the strategy is still to reinvest within existing markets or give some thoughts in terms of perhaps what you might be considering outside of junior core markets at this point.
Michael J. Schall: Yes. As I said in the comments, we will stay focused on the West Coast. Transitioning markets are good for us. I can give you an example in the city of Sunnyvale, which we have a very strong concentration in that city are -- that market contains 11% revenue growth year-over-year. In Northern California, it's 6.2% for the press release. So we have 11% in Sunnyvale. So that means there's a bunch of areas within Northern California that are in the 2% to 8% range. So in terms of real estate transactions trying to go to the areas that will benefit most in terms of growth, it's not all the same. It's not as if all of Northern California experience 6.2%. The variations are pretty dramatic. And therefore, that creates the opportunity, I think, in terms of our investment program to find the areas that are -- that we expect to recover next and invest ahead of that growth. So we will stay within our existing footprint, but we will be very careful and mindful of how far rents have grown within each submarket.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And maybe just last question in terms of Southern California. I know it's continued to lag but if you look out over perhaps into next year, I know you're not giving guidance at this point but would you still expect Southern California to lag versus the overall portfolio?
Michael J. Schall: We have -- John Lopez is here, and John spends his days trying to figure out supply and demand for each of 30 submarkets and then trying to figure out, based on supply and demand what happens with rents. Now, there's dramatic changes. You get a 20% rent growth estimate in Silicon Valley, for example, and if you look at his work, he has sort of Silicon Valley as a market perform, given the incredible amount of rent growth in Silicon Valley [indiscernible] about Northern California, Silicon Valley specific and so that becomes a portfolio performer but CBD LA, Eastside Seattle and -- what am I missing, John -- Orange County, become -- pop to the top of the list in terms of where we think we'll get the most rent growth. So John, you want to comment? That's a process that we follow and so the top 5 markets -- what it was 2 years ago, it was strongly Northern California and Seattle, now it's a mixture of both. What are they, John?
John Lopez: Our top markets, Jay, would be over the next 2 years markets are the core infill Los Angeles markets downtown, West LA, Woodland Hills, Tri-City and in Orange county. So next year, probably overall, Southern California will be a little bit below the portfolio but that will be because we have expected San Diego to lag. It just didn't have the big drop that we saw in Orange County in LA. So it's going to be a mixed bag. Probably Ventura and San Diego will lag the portfolio, but we expect by next summer that Orange and L.A. will hop to the above portfolio growth. It's kind of a dichotomy there.
Operator: . Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just want to go back to the occupancy thing. I mean, certainly the bar is set pretty high for you guys. Some of the other companies spoke about As, being able to push more on As and having some softness on the Bs. So I want to get a better sense for what happened why you think it's a surprise and if this is sort of a reflection of more of the B nature of the portfolio or this is just something that you think there's more market-wide?
Michael J. Schall: Alex, this is Mike. I will answer that and turn it over to Erik afterwards. Because of these sales condo deals that we bought over the last couple of years, I think we have close to the best assets in many marketplaces. Certainly, as it relates to Irvine, the Platinum Triangle, some of our properties in West LA and Warner Center. And so we have a lot of experience in terms of what we see on the ground, and we also have experience in obviously the Bs, which make up most of our portfolio. But the reason why I mentioned the Sunnyvale comment that I just mentioned a minute ago where we had 11% year-over-year revenue growth because we have both A and B assets in that marketplace. Your B is obviously a brand-new property, and we've tracked what's happened with rents versus our expectations at our underwriting, and we have 5 or 6 other properties in Sunnyvale, which are B oriented and so we can tell you with a lot of confidence that it has a lot more to do with submarkets than it does A versus B. So with that, I'll turn it over to Erik. You want to add anything to that?
Erik J. Alexander: I'll just say that we see examples of that in other markets as well, including Southern California. Mike Dance mentioned Reveal is that new product in Warner Center, and we've done well there, ahead on the weeks of schedule, slightly ahead of rents as expected and we're competing with both new and old products. In Orange County, we've seen some of the older products. B products perform better than say, Anavia, which is new, nice A product. And so to Mike's point I really think it's driven by the individual markets.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: And just so I'm making sure I'm hearing you correctly. It sounds like as the summer progressed into September, the existing, your existing residents were fine with the increases. It was really just on the new tenants and post-September, so post 9/30, what's up with the new tenants? Are they once again comfortable or are they still skittish?
Erik J. Alexander: It's mixed. We see traffic start to tail off as typical business has held up very well and again, we got good leasing velocity in October as we settled in at the higher occupancy rate at the end of the month. And again, I don't have a ton of data yet over the last couple of weeks because there's not a lot of transaction volume, but I can tell you that the direction of those new rents has been going up since probably mid October. So that's what I would have expected to see. I'm glad to see it, and we're not having a lot of rejection. And as I commented before even in the last couple of weeks that Reveal projects again, continue to get good rates and have strong traffic there. So we're seeing positive signs.
Michael J. Schall: Let me add one additional item and that is, can you outline the expiration profile for November, December because we turn a lot of units and part of this is we got big rents on a lot of units turned because in June, July -- May, June, July, we turned a lot of units. And so keep in mind that we got big increases on a lot of turns. And the turn profile, our expiration profile changes throughout the year. You just heard what happened in October, and this goes back to our confidence for our Q4 results because there's just not that many expirations in November and December and therefore, most of it is baked in. Isn't it a good point?
Erik J. Alexander: So that is a good point. So expirations in November are 5.5%; in December, they're 5% portfolio-wide and that includes a low of 3.5% in Pacific Northwest. Then they inch up to 6% January. And so to Mike's point, it was strong during the -- my view is it's relatively strong throughout the period when you see those strong renewals. These pricing -- these price offerings both renewal and new are intertwined, right? We've talked about this before where customers have really good information. They can get pricing information on an hourly basis if they so choose and some people challenge us that way. But again, I think the results speak for themselves that people are comfortable with those levels. And the thing that I would add is that further confidence for the fourth quarter is I do have a fair amount of information already on November, as executed renewals are tallied, and there are some 900 of them at over 6% or 6% over expiring rates. So that again, it looks really strong and will serve us well.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just second question here for Mark or Mike Dance. Just on the -- with the public unsecured debt markets influx, curious what's going on in the private unsecured debt markets. Is there in the same flux or maybe they're a little tighter because it's more direct underwriting.
Michael J. Schall: I think it's not quite the same. We do have a number of large investors that are interested in increasing their investment in us but despite that widened, so we were hoping to price an unsecured private placement of about 50 basis points wider than what we would get on a secured. And we weren't quite there yet, but I think we can get something done 50 to 75 basis points over to a magnitude, that would be pretty meaningful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: When you're sitting here today taking into consideration the health of your markets, what you've been seeing in terms of rental rate growth. Is the 96.6% occupancy that you ended October at, is that where you want to be or do you want to drift that up to sort of 97? Or are you comfortable pushing rental rate harder down and seeing that trip back closer to 96? Can you sort of talk about where the sort of pricing dynamic is sort of leading you these days on the occupancy side?
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I think we'll watch the response of the customers. And again, if we're seeing clear response that they continue to accept rate, we'll push a little bit because I don't think there's a lot of danger given the low net availability. Again, as I commented, traditionally, as rent moderates during this period of time, that would -- such low availability of traffic holds up. So it was up like 20% actually in October compared to last October and probably about 10% in Northern Cal, slightly positive in Southern California. It was actually greater improvement over last year in San Diego. If we continue to have that and low availability, I think we can move rates and we'll do that.
Michael J. Schall: Let me add to that because Erik and I talk a lot philosophically about what the sweet spot is for occupancy, and we think it's 96% to 96.5%. And, Mike, thinning the hairline will continue to thin if we have dramatic shifts in occupancy from quarter-to-quarter, and thus we are going to strongly work on managing occupancy within a tight range.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. Because, I mean, if I look back, I mean, obviously, there was different sort of mode of thought during the financial crisis. But, I mean, a lot of the fourth quarters historically, you guys have sort of run close to 97% occupancy if you go back, and so I didn't know whether or not you guys were trying to operate back up at that level or whether or not given what's been going on and your ability to push rental rate, lower occupancy is sort of where you want to be.
Erik J. Alexander: I think our status is strong now, and we can hold that through the end of the year and very content to do that. If we see something different, like I said based on what the customers' telling us, we'll start to drift higher on the rate and put ourselves in a position to strike early in 2012. But to Mike's point, there'll be more discussion about that balance between those 2. It's interesting. It's a hard thing to do. We thought we were gaining confidence, for example, last year going into, even October for Seattle and in retrospect that they were probably pushed too hard last year and dropped our occupancy to even low 95.5% or something like that if I recall. And again, and that was again the customer was saying, "Hey, your rate was going up too high, and I'm not interested in moving right now." So we're going to be careful.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Where did you guys send January renewal notices out at?
Erik J. Alexander: We haven't sent all of them out. Some of them were sent out closer to 30 days in advance, and then only the higher ones are sent out at 60 days in advance. So I don't have a summarized report for that yet but again, I would say that they are similar to what we have been doing in the past couple of months. And again, those are declining a little bit even as pleased as I am with 6% in November, that's obviously less than 7.5% in October and September, so I'd expect it closer to that.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then last question, can you talk a little about where returns on redevelopment are trending given what's going on in the market with rents and acquisition pricing, et cetera?
John F. Burkart: Yes. This is John Burkart. The numbers are kind of a range and again, for the type of the products that we're delivering obviously, we're trying to [indiscernible] the size, see the marketplace so we had some that are on the low side in the 8% cash-on-cash and then others that are quite frankly, substantially higher in the 20 to 25. Overall, we doubled the amount -- roughly double the amount of reservations that we did in this quarter over the last quarter, and it worked very well. And as Mike mentioned, we're increasing that number in much greater flag as we go into 2012.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. Just a quick follow-up for Mike Dance. I mean, when you're increasing the amount of redevelopment in portfolio, I mean, how much of an impact does that have on the recurring but noncapital enhancing CapEx for you guys?
Michael T. Dance: We're targeting, Bob, with the exterior and the kitchen and bath, the dollars that we're going to spend, is that what you are asking?
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: No, I mean, the adjustment from it FFO to AFFO should be going down as your redevelopment spend increases because you're spending more money on units to do a whole cadre of improvements rather than just doing maintenance on them?
Michael T. Dance: We try to break that out on the statement of cash flows, so I'm not sure how the analysts -- we don't put it in our AFFO number because it is revenue-generating so I don't know what...
Michael J. Schall: I think the question is to the extent you redevelop something, you basically aren't going to have to do as much CapEx in the future because you redeveloped it, so what effect does it have on AFFO going forward? I think it's the question.
Michael T. Dance: I don't think we do enough redevelopment to have a significant outcome on the rest of the portfolio.
Michael J. Schall: It's not thus far, yes. Maybe the more significant number is we do have some rehab vacancy that is part of our vacancy number, and I don't know what that number was. I think it was around 50,000 for the quarter.
Erik J. Alexander: Yes, I didn't comment on that earlier, but there were certainly some in the third quarter and to the extent that the timing is right, we will take advantage in the fourth quarter of getting some units started for next year. I would add a comment on this A, B redevelopment substances where we see something as well that I think supports this sort of the market is really the bigger driver. We're renovating an exterior of a 1970 building in Orange County, and we had favorable surprise on the response and rents had gone higher than we expected there, which is very positive. And in turn, we were getting a acceptable returns, about what we thought we would get in Simi Valley, which is in Ventura County but it hasn't seen that same bigger spike that we enjoyed in Orange County. So again, I think that maybe the easy one because we talked about the softness in Ventura, but I would say that we were pleasantly and remain consistently pleased with the results in Orange County and expect some of that to happen in San Diego where we're doing work and certainly in the Bay Area where we're at.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe from Citi.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on Alex's question and try to better understand whether the rise in occupancy in October was really a function of you're just changing your pricing or if there was a sentiment shift among your tenants as well. So could you just talk about how much you are pushing rents on new tenants in August and September versus what you did in October? And how you think that, that should trend for the rest of the quarter?
Erik J. Alexander: This is EriK. That's hard to decipher. There's clearly a difference in rent levels related to improving occupancy, but I also think, as reported by the site's, the regional managers if there was, a more confident sentiment, if you will, that part is more difficult to quantify. But if I isolate out just the new rents achievements in those months that you talked about September and October, it's in the $1,400 as far as achievement. So that's about $50, $60 dollars less than what was achieved say, back in June but is slightly more than what we've achieved in just a month before that in May. So we started pushing and getting some gains in June and then we just carried that into July, in August so it's a little of both, but...
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Erik, keep in mind that we turn a lot more units in June, July than we do in September, October as well. So the number of transactions actually matters here. So if you recover or you given up a little bit on fewer units than you gained on the June and July period of time. So it's still net beneficial trade from my perspective. But as Eric said, overall rent levels of what we've achieved didn't change all that dramatically from June to October.
Erik J. Alexander: Yes. And again, keep in mind that I just gave you those high at $50, $60 less in October compared to June. But historically, you have a decline in that measurement as well. You have maybe -- in going all the way back to even more positive years of 2008 when you see that, that those rents moved down in '09, moved down in '10 and again part of it is seasonality, part of it is consumer sentiment and part of it at least earlier, September was occupancy driven. And again, it really -- as I said, we were really surprised a little bit by just the strong results in renewals, and we'd come of these 2, 3 very good months on the new rent gains, I mean, double-digit gains in Pacific Northwest and the Bay Area. Strong traffic that's held up nicely in August, and people were just sort of looking but not doing anything. And then again, that's what I said, at some point, you say well, I don't know how long that part's going to last. Let's see if we can entice them to snap up some of these units and they did.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got you. And so I guess since you mentioned that the $60 normally declines to some extent just given seasonality. So on a percentage basis, you did see some decline but it wasn't it was huge change in, I guess, the trajectory of your results. It was just more of a seasonal and a bit of a pause.
Michael J. Schall: Well, Eric, again, it was strategy. It was a little bit of market. The market changed here somewhat in terms of what the consumer did. The consumer was reacting to current events, and we all know what they were. They range from Denver to the U.S. credit rating and the stock market so far. I remember -- I think it was actually you guys, maybe it was Michael. But commenting on our last conference call that our market cap's going to be a lot lower after the call because the stock market was in free fall that time in August. The market did change, and these properties are pretty economically sensitive. We all know that. That's nothing new. That's why this is such a big deal to everyone, and I get that. I guess I have to step back away from this and remind everyone, this is a longer-term business. I know it's quarter-to-quarter, because we're a public company but there's this little bit of inconsistency between what our objectives are and what the quarter-to-quarter objectives might be. And so hopefully, you and everyone else can appreciate that they don't sometimes line up perfectly, and we may have to go in somewhat different direction. In the beginning, I said, hey, we're disappointed in our reaction to change because I think we could have done it better. But we also -- the reason why we wanted to bring the October results here is yes, we have a very strong trajectory through the end of the year and again, we don't turn that many leases in November and December, and you know what October is so the skepticism maybe in your report last night, I think we've directly addressed here on the call.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. That's understood. And, I guess, sometimes with the market up and down, 200 basis points a day, it makes you want to be more short-term focused. But just one quick last question. And I was just wondering if you can have had significant presence in any other market just maybe to next year, what market that might be?
Michael J. Schall: My quick answer would be Boston because it's similar to the markets that we're in on the West Coast, but I'm not sure that we want to diversify that of our tech-oriented markets and do another tech-oriented market. I'm sure that, that is ultimately what we're trying to accomplish. We're trying to find markets that are to some extent countercyclical to what we might see out here and so what happens in New York City.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just kind of following up on that last question. As you look at your portfolio today and the markets that you're in, is there any markets just as you're going about repositioning -- and not as a repositioning but recycling of assets, is there any markets where you would like to lighten up or markets where you would like to increase exposure?
Michael J. Schall: Well, John Burkart is here, and he's the keeper of the dispo list. So, John, you want to comment on that?
John F. Burkart: As far as lightening up our exposure, clearly we have some underperformance specifically Ventura and a couple of areas, there would be some discussions toward lightening up our exposure but overall, we're looking asset by asset and looking at where the current returns are and projected returns, and then make a decision to try to optimize the overall portfolio returns. Well, some of it is market related and some of it is asset related within that marketplace.
Michael J. Schall: Actually, Mike, let me add to that because I think that yes Ventura is on the list and that's nothing new. It's been on the list for -- yes, these lists were prepared pretty close to a year ago. And we chose to execute on the Sax asset -- assets, as I commented, primarily because the rest didn't fall as much in San Diego, that's one factor. The expected rent growth is not that much, it's another factor. Our overall expectation for Ventura County, for example, just to follow up on John's comment is actually fairly positive for the next several years. And again, we're not -- we don't have a gun to our head with respect to any of these transactions. We're trying to find that sweet spot between projected rental growth and cap rates, and so we can find the appropriate exit. So I think we -- in retrospect, maybe we wish we would have done fewer of these Sax assets but nonetheless, we are where we are and we are focused on it, and it will be a bigger part of what we do going forward.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. Second question in terms of your markets where you've pushed aggressively. Are you starting to see people double up as you're pushing along 8% and 10% renewal increases?
Michael T. Dance: It's hard to quantify. Certainly in Santa Barbara, where I commented earlier only because we just have more people on the ground get involve with the student population there. We've actually ended up with more availability than we wanted. But since school started, there's actually now 5 or 6 people that were already sick of their triple share arrangement or converted to rise living or what have you. So certainly in some markets like that where the rent service is very price sensitive or at least initially was. But as far as the Bay Area goes, you get a little bit of it, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming.
Michael J. Schall: I just wanted to follow-up on that one. The studies that I see talk about the -- what is the household formation demand of the Echo Boomers just in general because they're entering their prime renter years, and the numbers that I see of range from about 500,000 to 1.5 million nationally. So I think that there's evidence that yes, there will be some doubling up, but I think there's going to probably be more undoubling, i.e -- most of the double-ups are obviously kids living with their parents. And I think that the trend will be for a net uncoupling, not a net doubling up even with the rents that we have. And except Northern California, rents are still where they where. Like I said, on our portfolio, rents are still 2% below what they were in the prior peak. So I don't think there's a lot of evidence that rents are at the point where there's widespread doubling up. I just -- I don't see that at this point in time.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then finally, you sold West Dublin into the joint venture, and most of your developments right now are in joint ventures. I understand with the large development in San Jose multiphase, trying to reduce some risk there. But you talked about cap rates spreads being 100, 100 plus between development and acquisitions. Now I'm wondering why you're putting those and why you're choosing a little more development -- more joint ventures on a development as opposed to keeping maybe some of that upside on the balance sheet?
Michael J. Schall: We talk about this a lot, and again, John Eudy is here. I guess to simply put it, we targeted an exposure of our unfunded commitment. You're right. Development has a cap rate spread over acquisitions, but it doesn't have the same ability to lock in the capital that's going to be consumed over the next couple of years. And that capital mismatch issue is a significant one in development. I mean, at this point in time, most of the stuff that we're looking at, we are ready to start construction right away. We're on Fountain La Brea, which we just announced. We're under construction now. So we're trying to get into the dirt very quickly, minimize that cost risk so we have a general contractor ready to sign the GC agreement pretty much right when we close and then get right into the real estate. So we are focused on that unfunded commitment level. And just to be -- what we're planning to do is essentially of that $325 million number, which is a number that we feel comfortable with. We'd rather develop twice as much in a joint venture than to do $325 million and own it all.
Erik J. Alexander: This is also most of the joint ventures have promotes in them. And so to that extent, as Mike said, we're doing twice as much, and we have promoted interest. We're actually in a great spot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Could you give us a characterization if there is any difference in the tenant profile between the tenants that are moving out and the tenants that you're backfilling with, either in terms of average household income or credit profile or any metrics that you follow?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. I would say that it's fairly similar. I don't have a perfect information on this relative to the specific guidance that you've mentioned. We have not changed our underwriting criteria for income requirements. And so sort of by definition, the in-place rents often are lagging the market rents. And so these people that are moving out moved in previously, and the next ones are in moving in at a higher rate. So they're obviously qualifying with a greater income, both their -- sorry, [indiscernible]. So we have seen an uptick in denial this year, not huge, but, again, that's largely related to credit issues. So again, we're not sticking our neck out there. We, a couple of years ago, had reworked our underwriting models for the applicants to accommodate for people that had otherwise good credit but were just upside down on their mortgage. And we, again, I think, made an appropriate and safe bet on those people. So, yes, I guess that's -- those would be my comments about that.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then could you just give us some color on the disposition incentive program? What are some of the parameters with that? And when was it put in place? And why did you feel this need for it?
Erik J. Alexander: It was put in place a couple of years ago, and the parameters are either percentage of the sales price or a percentage of the gross profit. And as Mike alluded to, management here has been very ingrained in the acquisition and development side. And we're trying to improve management's willingness to let go some of these assets, the people -- oftentimes, you unfortunately get married with some of the things that you were involved in acquiring or developing. And this is a way to make sure we had them set out to do the right thing and dispose of assets that aren't going to keep up with the rest of the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from KBW.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Following your comments earlier, Mike, about unwinding Fund II over the next 2 years. Given that 3 quarters of Fund II's NOI is in NoCal and Seattle, and in conjunction with your relatively positive outlook for SoCal, I guess is it fair to assume that your net exposure to SoCal will ratchet up over the next couple of years? And if so, how much exposure to SoCal are you comfortable with on a relative basis as a percentage of NOI?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Haendel, I think it will change over time. And I think we took SoCal NOI contribution to 60% at several years ago, and then we started buying Northern California and taken SoCal from 60% to 50%. And actually, we would have probably taken it further than that, further down, except that we just can't find that many deals to buy here in Northern California and Seattle. We've been pretty aggressive up here, and thus you just can't move the numbers. The portfolio is big enough that you can't move the numbers that much. So -- but having said that, I think John Burkart is probably better to talk to you about the specifics of Fund II and what impact that might have. John?
John F. Burkart: Yes, Haendel, I want to make this clear. [indiscernible] if you said NoCal and Seattle or SoCal and Seattle, but actually, the majority -- the NOI's majority assets are really NoCal and Seattle, with some in Southern Cal. And as you can imagine, the probable plan would be that we would be selling more out of the areas that have -- had higher growth, i.e., NoCal and Seattle, sooner with the Southern Cal gaps that we expect to get height and more growth going forward, bidding a lot of sale. And we have a good amount of time to execute the plan and obviously great flexibility with our partners. These are long-term partners, 10-years-plus, and all on the same page. So we have it -- we bid all of our authority to change the deadlines as we desire, if we think the market is seems appropriate to keep the asset longer.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, actually, Haendel, let me take a step back. What we do is, like our 40 submarkets, try to focus in on the ones with the greatest rent growth running conversely. As we picture it, we try to buy in the top 1/3 and consider selling in the bottom 1/3 in terms of growth. Those markets are not necessarily geographically perfect. In other words, there are markets in Southern California that we're selling, and there are other markets in Southern California that we're buying. So I think it's difficult to categorize or determine a percentage by Southern Cal versus Northern Cal versus Seattle because the reality is, we could be buying and selling in Southern California. We could be trying to acquire in downtown L.A. and sell in San Diego, for example. It really goes down to more of the submarket and asset-specific factors that are driving our sales decisions, and less sort of macro percentage is tied to the 3 large regions.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Got you. So certainly appreciate the color and I understand the process here. But there -- I guess there is no hard set fast rule on what the max exposure to any specific region is, though.
Michael J. Schall: Yes, I'd say 60% is probably the most we're going to do in Southern Cal. It's subject to everything I just said, yes.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Got you. Okay. And the average tenant income for your portfolio today, do you have a sense where that is? And if so also, would you give me a sense of where rent as percentage of income is today across the key regions and where that has tended to top out over -- as you look back over the long run?
Erik J. Alexander: This is Erik. Again, with all the different products and so forth out there, I'd have to say it is sort of in the mid-70s kind of range. And I don't see -- with respect to the topping out, that's hard to say. John, I don't know if you have any comment on that.
John Lopez: Yes, Haendel, this is John Lopez. I would probably say that right now, if we look at it from the regional in Seattle, we're still a good portion below the long run rented income levels. And particularly, when you look at what those rent income levels are during expansion years, I don't think there's any immediate pushback there. In Northern California, we're probably right at the long run average in San Francisco, maybe a little above the long run. But again, if you look at where they are in terms of expansions, we're not that far away. But we're still below in Oakland and Silicon Valley. I mean, we're much closer in Silicon Valley than we were before, but we're still probably in the 18.5-range when the average is about 19. If we go to Southern California, San Diego, we're right about at it because we didn't have the big drop in rents. But in Seattle, L.A. and Orange, that's where the biggest gap exists right now. So probably Seattle, L.A. and Orange have the big gaps. We're right there in San Francisco and San Diego.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Appreciate that. And one last one, just wanted to clarify. When you guys talk occupancy for the quarter, that's average financial occupancy, right? And then with that being the case, would you give us the average month ending physical occupancy for the months of July, August, September and October?
Michael T. Dance: The number I gave was, 96.2% was financial occupancy. I think Erik had a visible occupancy as of the end of the month. We'll circle back with you on each month's end. We don't have that right now. I don't...
Erik J. Alexander: No, other than that, I can't -- I mean, they're getting the most recent one I know, just with this, because we ended 96.5% at physical in October. And it was 96.2% financial for October, and again, expected to be higher both on physical and financial for November.
Michael T. Dance: And part of the problem with the physical occupancy, Haendel, and why we'll follow-up with you with the caveat, it doesn't really mean that much because between the end of the month and the first of the month, you get a big dropoff because you get all your notices of move out one at a time. First -- so the first of the month tends to have more move-outs than the rest of the year.
Erik J. Alexander: That's generally true, what Mike just said, but I don't want you to be worried about [indiscernible] November. As of yesterday, we're at 96.4% physical occupancy. So even though it drops down some, we're not going to have a big drop there, looking good.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch from Green Street Advisors.
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: And, Mike, just one question from me. Have you heard anything new on Prop. 13 legislation? It seems like there is some increased scuttlebutt about a potential [Audio Gap] rule.
Michael J. Schall: Andrew, we track that fairly closely. I mean, Mayor Villaraigosa in L.A., came out as you know, it just hit the press, and they're talking about repealing Prop. 13. Unfortunately, he's not part of the structure that will ultimately lead to that. So I think that Jerry Brown has a somewhat different approach to trying to raise some revenue in the State of California despite we had a background. We had a $26 billion stellar shortfall of which he implemented the cuts of around $15 billion and then there was that $8 billion in other revenues that he didn't expect, which left a -- it still left a shortfall. And he was pushing for tax increases in it. At this point in time, he's not -- they have not completed them in the State of California. There were some temporary tax increases that expired on June 30, and they were vehicle license fee, a 1% surtax on wealthy or high-income earners. And there was a third piece, sales tax increase. So that was the place that the governor wanted to go. Obviously, the Prop. 13 discussion is one that really has never gone away over the last 20 years. But practically speaking, it requires a 2/3 vote at some level, which is very difficult to get even in the great State of California. And therefore, the people that would typically fund this type of activity generally are not willing to throw their financial support behind it at this point in time, given the high threshold for approval level and the perception of success. I think that the environment is that there will be continued discussion on Prop. 13, but I suspect that, that's not the way it goes at the end of the day.
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just, hypothetically I know you guys track this. What would be the increased operating expenses or decrease in NOIs, assuming your property taxes in California were mark-to-market?
Michael T. Dance: The annual increase in expenses would be in the low $20 million. $20 million, $22 million, depending on whether the [indiscernible] value came in.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Mike, you've been doing this for a while, and you've been through many different periods in which the consumer has experienced a shock in the past. So could you put August and September in historical perspective for us maybe in terms of the magnitude of which occupancy came in below your target?
Michael J. Schall: Yes, Dave. I think it had to do with -- first of all, every situation is different. I'm not sure that when you get to historical precedents, everything is a little different. Remember, this is always in a quarter. We're talking in a broader scheme of things. This is a blip on the radar screen, ultimately. So the reality is, I think, that the analysts have become so focused on all the moving parts within the quarter, and they ascribe great value to individual movements and new lease rates, renewal rates, occupancy rates that is really beyond the scope of what you can manage, all within a timeframe. Because again, as I said earlier, what you might do as an owner of a portfolio over the long haul can be significantly different than what you might do in the quarter. And that topic of conversation is one that Erik and I have revisited many times over the last 30 days, because he's -- we are focused on cash flow and revenue. And practically speaking, given the quarterly result thing, you may have limitations on what you can do in terms of how far you can move occupancy down in search of higher rents, for example. So I guess from my perspective, there was a pretty sudden change in consumer sentiment, as we said before. Our division managers would describe it or do describe it as effectively seasonality starting a month earlier. I think it's just related to the results, the things that happened in early August. And I think everything is -- every situation is a little bit different. And so I'm not sure that history is going to help us with this. What I also can say is, our reaction to changing conditions -- and again, we're not talking about, oh gee, the market went from being great to being horrible. We're talking about a shift of sentiment, a shift of preference and that type of thing. It doesn't change the broader picture here. And I think that we could have reacted faster and better to build occupancy quickly. One of the issues, we were a little bit more -- we had a smaller portfolio, a flatter organization than we do now. And it was easier to implement change than it is now. So that is something that we are working on and will be the focus of a meeting that begins immediately after this conference call.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Well, I understand the preference for focusing on the long term. I actually think that, that's a point in my question is that given such a robust outlook, 28% rent growth over the next 5 years, people are looking for evidence of that sustainability or evidence that there may be weaker demand than expected. So on that note, just thinking about your 5-year model, what level of household income growth is embedded in that? And how important is that component to the model?
John Lopez: Dave, this is John Lopez. Our top market, we have probably on average over the 5-year period, probably in the range of about 3.5% annual average, obviously in chunks upfront, higher in the first 2 or 3 years. That would probably be the basis for it. And obviously, it's critical for us because that is the -- we've gotten some -- the rents went down. They came back. They probably fell more than they should have, given the drop in occupancy. And so there was a bounce back. But going forward, we are going to need those jobs and that income growth to get that rent growth. And we're seeing that. If we look at the -- what we're getting the job growth, and we are seeing the income growth, and not just overall personal income, but in wages and salaries, so we're seeing the ramp-up. We've seen it before, and we believe it's there.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: The multi-family supply and single-family market, this influence is pretty well understood for the next couple of years. So really, to be on track to hit that -- to hit target over the longer term, we need to start seeing household income growth of 3.5% or better over the next couple of years.
Michael J. Schall: Well, yes, I think that -- yes, well, the 28% is comprised of, let's say, 3.5% times 5 years, that's 17.5%. So you're talking about outgrowing income levels by 10.5% over 5 years, which we think is sustainable given the other measurements, rent immediate income, affordability issues and that type of thing. So that is what the assumption is based on.
John Lopez: And you're right, Dave, because obviously, getting that consistent growth, given what we've had today based on -- now we're starting in our market the next 5 years out. I mean, we're essentially above 95% in Seattle, 96.5% in Northern California and 95% in Southern California. So we've got 2 years of very, very limited supply with moderate increases, starting at 96% occupancy. And we already have, year-over-year, 1.25% job growth. So we're very confident in those numbers. Remember, David, that it's -- we look at the national numbers and you say it's an anemic job. But we've got 3% year-over-year growth in Silicon Valley and even Southern California, where we're a little disappointed. If you look at the office absorption in Southern California, that would almost put it on the top of the chart in the entire country. I mean, Boston has done well, but their absorption isn't beating Southern California. Texas has done well, but the absorption rates -- even in the third quarter this year in Dallas, Houston, Austin would not make Southern California look bad. So we believe that -- L.A. obviously has lagged a bit. But if you look at the recent numbers, it's been very positive. And the coupling of increasing in the professional business service in the jobs in the third quarter in L.A. and absorption of office space, that wasn't a coincidental accident. So we're seeing 2%-plus growth in Seattle, 3%-plus in Silicon Valley. San Francisco is ramping up. We're above 1% in Southern California, without the participation yet of L.A. So we think we're in a really good position.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments.
Michael J. Schall: Okay, thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As you can tell, we remain solidly optimistic about the future. We appreciate your interest in the company and look forward to next quarter's call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. Good day, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. As a reminder, we will be making comments during the call which are not historical fact, such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainty which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Erik Alexander and Mike Dance follow me with brief comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are here for Q&A. Our goal continues to be growing core FFO or cash flow and NAV per share. In pursuit of that goal, we have created a balanced platform of internal and external growth sources. We plan to improve but not significantly expand the Essex portfolio and are comfortable with total capitalization ranging from $7 billion to $10 billion. A key aspect of the plan includes opportunistic property sales and reinvestment of proceeds to improve the portfolio's overall quality, growth rate, and financial results. We have an exceptional external growth platform, the value of which we do not want excessively diluted by portfolio size. It is important that superior real estate deals move the needle with respect to our per share metrics. Thus, the use of institutional joint ventures is integral to the plan because they require less Essex capital, share risk proportionately, compensate us for our real estate expertise, provide the potential for incentive compensation in the form of promoted interest and help us manage our overall size, given that properties will be sold by these ventures at some point in the future. We expect to be selective with development, which will likely average around 20% to 25% of our external growth, and we expect to utilize up to 5% of the balance sheet to fund preferred equity and similar opportunistic West Coast apartment investments. I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, Q2 results and market commentary; second, review of the investment market; and third, California's fiscal situation. So first topic, Q2 results, market commentary. Last eve, we reported core FFO of $1.40 a share, a 14.7% increase relative to Q2 2010. Market conditions strengthened throughout the quarter and continued to gain momentum through July and into August. It is no surprise that Northern California and Seattle are leading the way, which Erik will describe in detail along with recent improvements in Southern California. We are pleased to increase our 2011 guidance as indicated in the press release. Mike Dance will review the guidance chain of components in his comments. We believe that the remainder of 2011 and 2012 will be very good for apartment operators. We see nothing that will meaningfully change the housing supply until at least 2013, including for-sale home-building, and we believe that tepid demand growth will keep pressuring apartment occupancy rates, pushing rents higher. As suggested last quarter, Northern California and Seattle remain a step ahead of Southern California and that performance differential widened this quarter. There are several contributing factors: first, tech employment has been one of the leading components of job growth, and thus the tech centers outperformed; second, Southern California has had slower job growth, reflected in our revisions to our economic forecast on Page S-15 of the supplement; finally, Southern California has lower market occupancy rates and more vacant condos being rented as apartments that need to be absorbed before rents gain traction, which we believe is happening. We acknowledge that U.S. job growth has underperformed the typical economic recovery and that the near-term outlook is muted. However, we note that the U.S. has added 750,000 jobs so far this year or a 1.2% annualized pace. That number includes 945,000 private sector jobs, with the government losing about 205,000 jobs. The better news is that nongovernment wage and salary growth was 5.3% from June 2011 versus 2010, which is much better than expected, while government wage and salary growth was minus 0.4%. While we agree that economic conditions are far from ideal, they are perhaps not as bad as many perceive.  There's a pipeline of apartment development that will start being delivered beginning in 2013, and we've started tracking each deal. We continue to believe that high-density apartments can be constructed in 2 to 3 years, and in significant numbers and will tend to be located closer to the urban core. Thus, the regional development impact measured as a percentage of stock may mask a more significant impact on the relatively thin A-quality component within selected urban markets. We view tracking apartment and for-sale development as mission-critical. We announced 3 acquisitions in the press release aggregating $262 million. About $225 million of those acquisitions are part of our newly-formed WESCO I co-investment program. The company acquired Bellerive, another vacant condo deal located west of the 405 near Santa Monica, which appears to be among one of the last vacant condo deals that are available in the market. We continue to see a substantial deal flow, both for acquisitions and development transactions. Thus, we expect to be active investors through the end of the year and expect to exceed the $500 million original acquisition guidance range, the high end of the range. Second topic, the investment markets. As a general statement, cap rates did not change materially during the quarter and remain in the low 4% range for A-quality property in A locations and the high 4% range for B-quality property in A locations. Cap rates increase from there for lesser locations and property quality. Our calculation of cap rate uses effective current market rent and pro forma operating expenses before CapEx. Now that large rent increases have returned to selected markets, there's a widening differential between the cap rate noted above and the properties going in unleveraged yield, sometimes as much as 75 basis points. It remains to be seen how this differential will impact cap rates going forward. We're beginning to see more well-located B quality property being listed now that rent growth is contributing to meaningful increases in property value. We continue to see an active development pipeline and are pursuing several development deals underwritten based on today's rents. Development cap rates range from 5.5% to 6% or 6.75% to 7.5% upon stabilization. Third topic, the California fiscal situation. The quick update on California state budget situations. By way of background, Governor Brown originally proposed to close the state's $26 billion budget shortfall by extending tax increases and reducing spending in roughly the same amounts. Ultimately, the extension of tax increases was not enacted as originally planned, although the governor still expects to submit the proposed increases to voters at the first possible opportunity. The governor signed a balanced budget for fiscal '11 to '12 that did not include substantial tax increases. Instead, the budget reduces expenditures by about $15 billion affecting every level of state government. In addition, $8.3 billion of the shortfall was made up by an improving tax revenue outlook resulting from improving economic conditions. While finding a balanced budget is good for California, the cost reductions are dramatic in scope and their long-term impact is not completely understood. For example, while funding K-12 education remains at a similar level as the prior year, significant tuition increases were needed at the University of California and California State University systems, given the reduction in state support of 25% and 22%, respectively. Accordingly, while positive progress has been made, many issues remain concerning the budget situation, including the solvency of local governments. Governor Brown is also leading a discussion of how to attract jobs to California but there are few details on that point at this point in time. We will continue to follow this activity closely. Again, thank you for joining us. I'd like to now turn the call over to Erik Alexander.
Erik Alexander: Thank you, Mike. It's my pleasure to be here to report our second quarter operating results and give our view of the second half of the year. The rent growth momentum that's started to build in Essex's portfolio during the first quarter of this year accelerated during the second quarter in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California and remains robust today. While Southern California's revenue results were more muted, they were still favorable on a sequential basis, and gains in rent accelerated the most in June and have continued at a healthy clip in July.  Occupancy for the portfolio was essentially flat for the quarter, but we saw a dip in June as peak demand season began in earnest and we continued to ask for higher rents across the board. As stated on our first quarter call, we've achieved market rent growth earlier in the year than initially forecasted. Therefore, we have revised our economic forecast up for 2011. You can review these details on S-15 of the supplement, but of note is an increase in our portfolio rent growth assumptions from 5% to 7.5%, with the biggest gains in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California and a reduction in our job growth forecast for Los Angeles. I will comment on these items along with supply expectations later when I summarize each region.  The continued acceleration of rent growth throughout the second quarter gives us good reason to believe in a sustainable recovery and better results for 2011 in all of our markets. The actual rent growth results have improved every month since March and are on pace to continue that trend in August. In the nation's leading markets, it is no surprise that the Pacific Northwest and Northern California lead the charge for Essex. What we see that should help our continued growth is a more recent improvement in Bay Area rents outside of the Silicon Valley, where 60% of Essex's Bay Area portfolio is located and healthier rent gains throughout much of Southern California. Overall, the Essex portfolio saw market rents increase 11% since the second quarter of 2010 and 4.7% over the first quarter. As expected, this improvement in market rents has resulted in a growing loss to lease. At the end of the second quarter, this number stood at 6.8% of scheduled rent compared to 4.1% at the end of last quarter. This obviously represents a growing opportunity to increase revenue. Renewals continued to grow during the quarter and were at 4.9% higher than expiring leases. May renewal results eclipsed 5%, but June renewals didn't quite reach the 6% as expected. This is due in part to some residents with larger increases choosing to move. However, July saw a 6.6% gain in renewal rents, and the first 1,200 renewals in August have posted a gain well over 7%. Average rent gains on new lease transactions were 8.1% during the quarter, but June had a 10.2% gain over expiring leases compared to April at 5.9%. July results were comparable with a 10.8% increase over expiring rate. Again, the Pacific Northwest and Northern California are still leading the overall revenue growth for Essex but Southern California results have improved from 3.6% in April to 7% in July. So again, we have confidence that Southern California is gaining steam and should contribute to a better second half. Therefore, with the growing loss to lease, we plan to take advantage of the expected decline in occupancy and push rents throughout the portfolio during the high demand period through September. While the financial occupancy was essentially flat at 96.9% compared to the first quarter, physical occupancy had actually dropped to 95.9% at the end of June with a 6.5% availability and 95.5% occupancy, with a 6.7% net availability at the end of July.  For reference, physical occupancy was more than a point higher last year at this time. The strategy will be to maintain this level of availability in an attempt to gain consolidated increases greater than 8% on expiring and new leases for the remainder of the year, with a watchful eye on the relationship between scheduled rent gains and financial occupancy during the fourth quarter. When executed properly, this approach will allow Essex to post sequential gains in revenue for the third and fourth quarters, achieve our revised revenue guidance for 2011 and put the company in a strong position for revenue growth in 2012.  So although our revenue results were respectable and look promising for the second half of the year, the spike in expense growth during the second quarter put a damper on sequential NOI growth. I don't believe there's any reason to be alarmed as expense timing can often be lumpy. Onetime repair and maintenance items, especially duct and gutter cleaning, tree trimming, landscape enhancement, along with an 11% increase in turnover and an increase in actual turn cost accounted for most of the second quarter rise in expenses.  Distinct from our redevelopment program, we have completed modest upgrades in apartments upon turn in an effort to meet market expectations for these units getting higher rent. This practice will continue as appropriate but is more prevalent among units vacating after a longer-term residency. One element of expenses that will remain is the wage increase that was effective April 1 following a 2-year salary freeze. However, modified office hours, shared responsibilities and centralizing some of our processes will moderate this expense impact.  Given a lower-than-expected increase in utilities for the rest of the year, further savings in property taxes and reduced turnover assumption, we actually expect annual expense growth for 2011 to be lower than initial expense guidance. Expense control will continue to be a focus for Essex. We have expanded our internal resource management group recently to intensify focus on reducing utility consumption. We've also increased our attention on aggregated purchasing and vendor consolidation. These efforts will bear fruit in the second half of the year and continue to help us manage operating expenses throughout 2012 and beyond. Finally, we continue to invest in technology to help us improve efficiencies, enhance customer service and ultimately reduce costs.  Currently, there are 10 active initiatives in various stages of deployment at Essex, including centralized invoice processing, check scanning, resident portal, customer surveys, online renewal capabilities. Given evolving technologies and a deserving industry experience, we think our patience will lead to improved efficiency and expense reductions at a lower cost to implement. On our new lease-up activities, these all remained on track with Skyline, Muse and Allegro now stabilized. Via, 284 units under development in Sunnyvale, is off to a phenomenal start, with Phase I 96% leased and 67% occupied. Phase II is already 35% leased and move-ins will begin next month. Santee Village, Bellerive and Reveal are all leasing within plan.  Now to comment on the region. Starting with Seattle. Seattle leads all markets for Essex. Essex market rents were up 6.6% sequentially and nearly 12% since the first of the year. We are now only 3% from the previous peak in 2008. At the end of June, occupancy was 95.8% among stabilized assets with a 6% availability. The job picture continues to be strong in Seattle. And related to our improved forecast, Boeing added some 4,000 jobs since the end of last year. Additionally, the number of Microsoft employees moving in to our communities since last quarter has increased by 225 residents. Multi-family supply picked up 250 units but remains at a low 0.4% of total stock.  In Northern California, Essex market rents in the Bay Area were up 5.7% sequentially and 9.7% since the first of the year. During the quarter, market rents in San Francisco and Santa Fe have actually crossed over their previous peak in 2008 by about 3%. At the end of June, occupancy was 96.3% with a 6% net availability. Our job forecast is up, and for the first time since 2007, all of our Northern California regions are adding jobs. Office and R&D absorption remained strong in the region with San Francisco MSA leasing an additional 800,000 square feet of office space and 1 million square feet of industrial space during the quarter, while San Jose added 500,000 square feet of office space and 2.5 million of R&D space. Collectively, that equates to more than 6 million square feet of absorbed commercial space during the past 4 quarters in San Jose. Finally, in Southern California, as expected, Southern California trails our other markets, but Essex market rents were up 2.9% sequentially and 4.8% since the first of the year. San Diego has actually led the charge this year posting a 5.2% gain in market rents since January. While San Diego rents have virtually returned to their 2008 peak, Los Angeles and Orange County still have about 4% to 5% to go to close the gap before reaching their prior peak. At the end of June, Southern California was occupied at 95.5% and had a 6.5% net availability. As mentioned earlier, we have revised our job forecast down by 16,000 positions for 2011. Although driven by losses in the government sectors, the reductions posted in business services will be a segment for us to watch closely. Multi-family supply was bumped up 300 units related to a delivery in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of last year. However, we are tracking over 4,000 units under construction in our market with deliveries spread out through 2013. There is no material change in commercial space absorption during the quarter for Southern Cal. So in conclusion, we saw a fair amount of good news on the rental rate front, and we have to continue to execute wisely to convert those results at a meaningful NOI gain for the rest of this year and into 2012.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael Dance: Thanks, Erik. Today, I will highlight the capital markets activity and review the changes to our guidance using information shown on S-14 included in the quarterly supplemental materials released yesterday. At the end of June, we raised $115 million of debt from a private placement of unsecured bonds. And year-to-date, we have raised a total of $265 million from top tier fixed-income investors, and we plan to continue to access the private placement market in the foreseeable future to fund the refinancing of existing secured debt obligations. We expect that by the end of 2012 that over 50% of our Net Operating Income will be from unencumbered assets and be well positioned to access the public debt market to refinance the $200 million in secured debt that will be maturing in 2013. For the first 7 months of 2011, we have raised over $200 million in common stock from the At-the-Market equity program. With the formation of WESCO and the Canada Pension joint venture, the 2011 guidance for the second half of the year assumes no additional common equity issued for the remaining of the year. We continue to maintain one of the strongest apartment REIT balance sheets, with a debt to total market capitalization of 32%, interest coverage of over 3x and a total debt to EBITDA of approximately 8x.  I am pleased that we have been able to improve our financial strength while still forecasting growth in 2011, core FFO diluted share of 12%. This success has been achieved in large part by a disciplined match funding of the external growth investment activity with approximately 55% common equity and 45% long-term debt. We have approximately $325 million of undrawn capacity on our credit facilities and $200 million of availability on the current aftermarket equity program. Now I'll finish my remarks with some comments to our 2011 FFO guidance. I am embarrassed at the FFO impact from the retirement of the Series B and Series F preferred equities in the 2011 guidance, given that the end of the first quarter was not properly communicated on last quarter's conference call. The updated 2011 guidance now has the full impact from the issuance of Series H preferred shares and the write-off of the cost of the issuance from the retired series. As Erik pointed out in his comments, we expect the third quarter to have higher vacancy and an increase in repairs and maintenance cost as we increase renewal rates and cause certain revenues to move out. During the fourth quarter, we will likely be less aggressive on renewal rent increases to rebuild occupancy during the slower leasing season. The guidance of a 6% increase in year-over-year same property Net Operating Income is expected to be achieved by an increase in gross revenues ranging between 4.3% to 4.5%, and increases in property operating expenses ranging between 1% and 2%.  The other changes in guidance are primarily the result of the investment activities and the 2 joint ventures formed during the second quarter, which have all been highlighted in yesterday's press release. The forecasted results in the third quarter will have some dilution from the lease-up of Via, Muse, and Santee Village communities included in last quarter's guidance, plus the third quarter -- plus the second quarter acquisitions of the West LA condos acquired on balance sheet, and the Warner Center Reveal apartments recently purchased by our WESCO joint venture. Given this lease-up activity in the non-same-store portfolio and the expected increase in the same-store vacancy, the midpoint of our guidance for the second half of the year has FFO per diluted share of $1.40 in the third quarter and $1.50 in the fourth quarter.  That concludes my remarks, and I will return the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley.
Swaroop Yalla: Mike, this is a big picture question. Part of media articles on institutional investors entering the single-family rental market, picking up distressed properties and in turn renting them out. Does this give you any concern, especially in your suburban market, if you see this as taking demand away from you?
Michael Schall: That's a good question. I saw at least one of these articles in The Wall Street Journal. I think the premise of those articles were buying homes somewhere around $100,000 each, so that you could get the 8% cap rate that was commented upon. And so as I've commented before, we view California as the tale of 2 states. You have the inland part of the state and you have the coastal part of the state. I can pretty much assure you that all the homes that they're referring to in that -- in those articles are in the inland part of the state. I think in the case of The Wall Street Journal article, they were talking about Vallejo. But with respect to the Sacramento Valley, with respect to the Inland Empire and other areas, I think that's where you're going to find those homes. That's where you're going to find massive foreclosures. Those are areas where the price of a home went from $300,000 to $450,000 and then back to $150,000 in the course of 5 years. And it's so different from the coastal market. But I want to also note that way back when in the RTC days, in the early ‘90s, we actually bought a portfolio of houses, single-family homes and went through the process of selling them off. And John Eudy is sitting across from me, he remembers it well. It was a challenging prospect, so even though we've looked at some opportunities to make those types of investments, at this point in time, and for the foreseeable future, we will pass. Good question, though.
Swaroop Yalla: Great. And just can you comment on the cap rate for the acquisitions you did this quarter? I know some of those are vacant right now, but I just wanted to know the stabilized sort of yield and also on the disposition.
Michael Schall: Yes, we can comment on that. The Oxnard purchase, The Arbors was in the 5% to 5.5% range. The Reveal is in the 4.5% to 4.75% range, and Bellerive was in the 5% range. Again, I think the difference is in how we look at the acquisitions area is we can get paid to provide services, so those are higher cap rates than what I think we -- than what I cited. And generally, higher cap rates as compared to core properties that are fully leased up, basically operating properties. So where we can get 25 basis points to 50 basis points in the case of Reveal, for example, to complete a lease-up because it didn't lease-up then therefore, some component of the buyers cannot do -- cannot finance lease-up transactions, we'll take that all day long. We think that's a competitive advantage. So if we can add value, and a lot of the acquisitions that we're looking at is trying to add value in search of a better-than-market cap rate, and I think each of those examples are good examples of what we've been able to do.
Swaroop Yalla: Great. And on the disposition?
Michael Schall: The disposition was in the 6% to 6.5% range on our numbers. Remember we have Prop 13, which gives us a little property tax number. The buyers, obviously, are looking at property taxes based on the current value. So I'd say the buyer was buying at about 5.5% cap and our sale was in the 6% -- it's about 6.25%, I believe.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Can you guys talk a little bit about where you are in your markets relative to market rents and whether or not that's capped out over the last 3 or 4 quarters to any sort of material measure?
Erik Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. No, we don't think so. As we commented earlier, we started to approach some of the peaks, prior peaks but continue to get good momentum in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. And as we commented, see growing trends on both the renewals side and the new rents side in Southern California which is most encouraging.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: So you've seen that the private guys have sort of kept up with you guys in terms of rental rate increases to sort of keep market from -- you guys from getting too far ahead of the overall market and you're pushing rents?
John Lopez: Yes, Rob, this is John Lopez. Also to note is if you look at our Seattle market, where we had the biggest swing, if you look at what our vendors are indicating where we are from their previous peak, it's right in line where we're at. So we feel that we went a little bit farther down on the downside, and so we don't feel we've outstretched the mark at this point.
Michael Schall: And I would add to that too regarding the loss to lease. We've commented that it increased over the quarter in all markets. And so there's still a fair amount of rent to capture there, and the people seem to be responding favorably for us in that area month-after-month, and again in August as well. We expect similar results on the renewal side in September.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And then I guess, sort of a related question. Are your move-outs to rent increases lower than expected, as expected, higher than expected? I mean, where are you sort of falling out on that? And is that sort of driving your rental rate growth decisions?
Michael Schall: It's difficult to dissect for this time of the year because there's a seasonal increase in turnover. And we've definitely seen a few more people moving out as I commented citing that it's too expensive, although again the averages that I spoke of, some of them are obviously much higher. And therefore, they're moving out and we're turning around and capturing the new leases at the market rent and achieving a greater gain. So I would say that we are careful in some of the submarkets where we look. And we see that a greater percentage of people are not responding to our offers and then adjust the following renewals appropriately or even negotiate with those that we've already sent out.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then last question, with the new fund, is that -- is there any sort of outs for you guys in terms of being able to offer the fund acquisitions and if the fund says, no, then you guys can do it on your own balance sheet if you really wanted to?
Michael Schall: That is exactly how it's structured. So it's a true joint venture as opposed to a fund where we have more discretion. Both partners need to agree. There's essentially criteria, that outside the criteria we can invest on balance sheet. And so to the extent that our partner doesn't want to do something, we have conviction. We can definitely do it ourselves.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Mike, you mentioned in your remarks that you expected more development near the urban core. So do you have any desire to start investing in areas more outside the core? And how should we think about that relative to your goal of improving the quality of your portfolio?
Michael Schall: I still think the urban core is the place to be. I think that if you add -- supply is supply. If you add supply in the best places, it's still going to soften the secondary location. So I do not mean to say that in the supply going to the urban core that, that somehow makes the periphery better but rather it just provides more -- again, supply is supply whether it's for sale or for rent. Housing supply is the critical matter relative to housing demand, and so it just gives us one more variable, I guess, to manage is what I'm saying. And we're going to, as I said before, we're going to be very mindful and careful about monitoring supply because I expect that it will get out of whack from time to time. And if you could just picture this with me, I suspect that cap rates will remain low even though rents are growing at well above the average compounded growth rate over time that one would expect. And therefore, the quality of the deal is going to be lesser in the future relative to what it is now. And that more development deals will become financeable towards the top of the cycle because what typically happens at the top of the cycle is you get -- you have higher rents that you're looking at today and for whatever reason the rent growth expectations moderate a little bit, but not completely, and therefore, lots of deals get launched at the top of the cycle. So again, it's something that we're going to monitor very carefully and manage the portfolio accordingly. I can't exactly tell you what that's going to mean because the scenario has yet to play out. Again for the next year and a half or so, I think we have phenomenal conditions in this industry.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then, when you talk about improving the quality of your portfolio, you're really talking about just, I guess, the growth profile more so than, say, just increasing average rent or buying at a low cap rate?
Michael Schall: Yes, it's hard to generalize. If you said increased average rent, well, that would mean you probably wouldn't do Seattle because average rents are a little over $1,000 relative to Northern California which has average rents in the $1,500 range. That I think is misleading. I think that Seattle is a -- represents a very good opportunity to grow the portfolio, and it's a market that we're pursuing aggressively. So looking at -- average rent levels would not be the criteria because it's too simplistic. We are trying to improve the locations, number one. We've always been a location company. We try to get the timing right, which means understanding where each market is relative to the cycle and deploying capital to the right place, and those will be the primary considerations going forward.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick one on your guidance. Could you tell us what you're forecasting in terms of sequential revenue growth in the third and fourth quarter? It would seem to imply a pretty large ramp from the second quarter.
Michael Schall: More in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. The third quarter will be a little bit muted by the expected increase in vacancy. But yes, it's very significant in the fourth quarter as we're increasing the rent roll.
Michael Dance: And just to add, to throw numbers at that, I think last quarter we said Q3, Q4 somewhere in the -- around 2% on average. So it'll probably be a little bit more than 2% in Q4, Mike, and less than 2% in Q3.
Michael Schall: Yes.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And I guess for you to get that, I mean, is it a reasonable assumption for us that you need like 7% to 8% rent growth over in place leases in the back half of the year?
Erik Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. It is, again, as commented, we got well over 7% on the renewals in August. That's what we see for September. The new lease side is north of 10%, overall, even going into August. And then the base rents in the fourth quarter and the number of transactions allow us to, if we're in that 8% range, a little over that on average for all of those transactions we had there.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Toti with FBR Capital Markets.
David Toti - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I have a couple of questions about first, on land costs. And then, I want to follow up with capital markets. Can you give us some specifics on what you're seeing in the market relative to the cost of entitled land, both for garden and for high-density locations, whether you want to use a square foot or per door cost?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. First off, garden, we don't play in that space too much. That's usually out in the Sacramento and the outlying areas. On urban, it really depends on fees. There's a whole number of factors that play into that but just to give you a range, for a higher density 4-story podium deal, in our markets, it ranges anywhere from 45 to 100 a door and anywhere in between you can land depending upon the specifics.
David Toti - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Have you seen any acceleration in pricing on your title lands in your markets in the last couple of quarters?
John Eudy: By acceleration, there are a lot of opportunities that have been floated out there by a lot of different people [indiscernible] from 2 years ago, 3 years ago. And the traction that's happening, we've seen a few outliers that have price pointed up a lot, that we have not been able to touch. But in general, there is an upward pressure, but it's probably not as much as some of the opportunities look like from the seller side.
David Toti - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Mike, just a question for you. Given recent volatility in capital markets and the sort of expansion of credit spreads, 2 questions. Number one, are you seeing that in your available credit in recent quotes? And number two, does it in any way change your view towards your external growth strategy?
Michael Schall: On the first, I think it's too early to tell. I mean there's been a significant change in the treasuries, and we have a deal in the pipeline that we're going to get for the joint venture. We're going to be getting some quotes from the GSEs. So we haven't gotten to that point yet, so I can't answer what impact the decline in the treasuries has on our credit spreads. So I'd just be guessing, so I won't. And then, impact to our aggressiveness on acquiring will depend on where these quotes come in and where we see actual pricing.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch: Going back to your same-store revenue guidance, I think you bumped it 20 basis points. I was wondering if that was from stronger Northern California and Seattle expectations or is it kind of the little bit of strength you're seeing in the Southern California rents?
Michael Schall: Yes, it's actually strength in all markets. We don't see any slowdown in the Pacific Northwest or Northern California so far. And as commented before, we've seen nice acceleration in Southern California.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then, with your job forecast down a bit, are you just expecting that you have favorable wage growth and the occupancy is up? Or how do you offset kind of the lower job forecast?
Michael Schall: Yes. I think -- this is Mike. I think that even though the job growth is not what we hoped it would be, there still is job growth. And amid virtually 0 supply, I think we have 0.2% of single-family and 0.2% multi-family supply this year. So with that supply, i.e., next to nothing, the combination is still a positive combination. So that's the job/supply relationship. And then, demographics continue to be a positive thing for us. Obviously, the Gen X and Gen Ys are in the prime rental ages. And as a result of that, I think that they are providing some strong support for the multi-family space. So I think it's a combination of those factors.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: Just with regards to the tech growth in Northern California, it seems that it just continues to build and build. And just curious if you think that will sort of -- if you're seeing any signs at the froth that you saw in the dot-com era or perhaps maybe fewer Visas, or maybe it's a different dynamic this time where you don't think that we'll get back to that froth that we saw then?
Michael Schall: Candidly, Alex, I am hoping that we don't get back to the froth that we had then. It was a very unique time. Rents went up about 40% between 1998 and '99. Rent to median income approached 30% or actually hit 30% in a couple of markets. And not -- the things that are not good and not healthy happen when you get to those levels. Of course, that was -- the backdrop behind that was all these companies that raised billions of dollars without having any revenue or really any company. And obviously, that whole program didn't end well. We view this as being completely different. The numbers in terms of actual amounts of job growth are not nearly as much as they were back then. And we view them as sustainable, real companies with real products. Their valuations arguably may be stratospheric but nonetheless, in terms of people, in terms of employment, in terms of having real companies with good growth prospects and really the latest in the international market when it comes to the tech world. So a real deep market. We view that as long-term sustainable and long-term very healthy for both the company and both the Northwest and California.
John Lopez: And Alex, this is John Lopez. Just a reminder, the [indiscernible] industry cycle, that was 5.5%, 5.25% job growth. That's the end of a 4-year run of good growth in the area. We're now at just 2% growth after losing 6% or 7%. We still got ample vacant space in this marketplace, so I don't think we're anywhere near that.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: Okay. And then on the JV front, you now have 2 new JV relationships. Just sort of curious where the institutions are falling. Are they willing to go back into sort of the communal funds? Or do they want or they still prefer to have the individual relationship where each venture is with its own institutional partner?
Michael Schall: Actually, John Burkart is here, and he runs or oversees that part of our business. John, do you have a comment on that?
John Burkart: Yes, absolutely. Alex, after the last few years, the institutions clearly want a lot more control, and so they are -- they desire to have more control, which typically means a JV type structure. That they also wanted to get their money invested, and so they're willing to give some things up. And I think it's -- at this point in time that transition is incurring a little bit. They're starting to realize they want to get more money out. But overall, in the last year, their focus has been less partners, more control. Clearly, they have identified us as being a top-quality partner, and so we're constantly spoken to by the institutions looking to co-invest with us.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: Okay. So you see that changing and maybe, over the next year or so, seeing more communal funds, or you see the institutions still wanting that control and have the individual relationship?
John Burkart: Alex, say it one more time, please?
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: It sounded -- I wasn't sure if you were suggesting that the -- they may be increasingly open to the communal fund going forward or if they still very much want that control of the one-on-one fund.
John Burkart: Yes. No, I am suggesting that's the case. And then, yes, the -- my expectation is over the next year or 2, you will start to see some more funds -- discretionary funds. It just isn't slow to go there. But the pressure to get money out the door and as they look at their opportunities, they will move into that field. Going back a year ago, that wasn't really an option when you spoke with those individuals. Now they're entertaining that option for sure.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Harris with Gleacher.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: If we think back to the last cycle, you ran into some political resistance over rising rents. I'm just wondered if -- was it -- would you say that was more of a characteristic in North or Southern California?
Michael Schall: It's Mike. I think it was in places where rents were -- the largest increases were given out. And they're, especially today in -- amid the social networking that is possible, that the ability to communicate what people consider to be excessive increases is a growing issue. And internally, I have encouraged Erik and operations to have some limitations on renewal rents as a result of that, and it varies from location to location, depending upon the circumstance. But nonetheless, I'm a firm believer that we need some self-management within our industry to avoid broader and more painful regulation out there. And I am going to be more publicly discussing this topic because I think it's a really important one for the apartment space.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: And you think that the advance of social media, call it what you will, it actually raises this type of topic now when compared to, say, 4 or 5 years ago?
Michael Schall: I absolutely believe that.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Okay. And we're nowhere near that point now, would that be fair to say?
Michael Schall: David, it's easier -- and let me just add one more thing. It's so easy now to connect several different people, different properties with the political structure. And that whole process is much different than it used to be. So again, I think this is an important issue going forward. And I'm sorry, I missed your last question.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: And, well, I was saying your sense is that -- I mean, obviously, you can always have outliers, but we're nowhere near that sort of pressure starting to build in Northern California today?
Michael Schall: We do have -- I would guess that one of the top comments to the CEO website is on this issue. So I'm not going to say it's not out there. It is out there. Again, we're trying to come up with rational approaches to this, and I do fear -- I remember well in the late ‘90s a local operator giving out 35% increases got tremendous scrutiny by the political processes. So I am concerned about it. I think it's a key issue, and I think a little bit of self-regulation is important here.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Okay. Well, high fives on the sale of Chula Vista. I'm curious as to know, did you use a 1031 at all around that transaction?
Michael Dance: We did not. We used the proceeds to pay off the Series S that we retired.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Okay. And what about the pipeline of the sales that -- as we look forward for the balance of the year and into '12?
Michael Dance: Well, you'll start seeing some Chula Vista like assets. There's not many of them, but maybe 4 or 5 more that we will list and hope to get those done before the end of the year. And then '12 will really depend on I think what locations we think we can -- have achieved the right growth that we are expecting and sell them at the right time.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: So we can expect to see sales, not every quarter, on a fairly regular basis over a number of quarters?
John Burkart: This is John Burkart. I think from Essex's perspective, we've always tried to be somewhat opportunistic. So we're watching, as Michael is saying, we're watching where rents are going, what's going on with cap rates. And clearly, over the last many months, we've had rents move up and a level of downward pressure on cap rates, certainly in the secondary areas. So as Mike alluded to, at this point, you may see a few more transactions from us. You should expect over time to see transactions -- disposition transactions from us, but I would say, a certain amount per quarter. It's not a methodical execution. It's much more of an opportunistic play to improve the portfolio overall.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Right. Okay. And the question -- final question on the ATM, you've kind of got to $217 million, I think, year-to-date in the press release. You did $251 million last year. I think Mike Dance, you referenced, there's another $200 million left on the program. I mean, is there any sort of limit that you would sort of envisage in terms of sort of capping this thing out? I mean, relative to the base, this is pretty high volume of equity issuance. I know it's all for good to finance good acquisitions and maintain low leverage, but it's still pretty eye-popping in terms of equity issues relative to the base.
Michael Dance: The limit is the amount of good investment opportunities that are available to us.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: You could always sell. You can always step up the selling.
Michael Dance: Well, that's true and...
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: And not use a 1031, too.
Michael Dance: Yes, that's true to the extent that we have good opportunities to sell. But my comment earlier was I -- because of what we expect to sell in the second half, we're not -- and the fact that we now have joint venture partners as a source of capital, we do not expect much usage on the ATM if any from here on out.
David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Right. Well, the stock price is kind of back to your average as we speak anyway, but...
Michael Schall: David, it's Mike. But just more fundamentally to get the point, in my comments, I made the point that property values are going up, and they're going up because the cap rates are still about where they were, but now you have a significant bump in rent. So now you have a higher NOI stream to risk the lower cap rate being applied. So had we sold more assets previously, we, I think pretty clearly, we would have left something on the table. We are very sensitive to -- and Mike is the king of this, managing the source of capital and understanding the value of the portfolio relative to the stock price and other metrics. And we're focused on it. We agree with you. We think there'll be better opportunities to sell in the future. But actually I want to differentiate us a bit from some of our peers that are out there selling massive parts of their portfolio. That is not at all what we're talking about. We don't have that many locations that we need to sell or want to sell. And so to use John Burkart's word, opportunistic, I think is the key. We've -- I think the older stack methods that Mike was referring to, represent sort of a unique part of our portfolio because for the most part our portfolio is not -- that is not representative of our portfolio. So selling those off is maybe a little bit more defensive. Going forward, we're going to look to be opportunistic.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Biffert with Bloomberg Research.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Maybe I missed this, but what are -- what is the rent as a percentage of income in your portfolio for your tenants?
Michael Schall: Our range for our in-place tenants or for the marketplace?
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Well, for your in-place tenants.
Michael Schall: We don't...
Michael Dance: Yes, we don't track it.
Michael Schall: We don't do that. This is a market -- if you look at the market averages, it's probably around 24%, 25% in San Francisco; 18% to 19% in Silicon Valley, about 18% in the East Bay, 17% in Seattle. And it runs about 18% in Ventura, 19% to 20% in San Diego and Orange, and about 18.5% in L.A.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And what -- how far below the norm is that currently?
Michael Schall: It is not below the norm in either -- significantly in either -- reported for California. The real 2 areas that are below the norm are Orange and Los Angeles. And they're probably anywhere from 5% to 8.5%, 9% below the norm as far as if you've got immediate rent growth to bring it back to that norm. In Northern California, in San Francisco, we're about at the norm. And in the East Bay, in Silicon Valley, we may be about 5% from the norm.
Michael Dance: John, just one point of clarification though. The norm that you're using is the average of the last 20 years. And the average of the last 20 years had 3 recessions in it. So it tends to skew the "norm" down from what was the norm in 1995 to 2000.
Michael Schall: And that is an important point. There have been plenty of -- there have been plenty of times in the past at different points in the cycle that we've operated much higher than that average because it hasn't pulled down. And if you look in Seattle, we're probably getting it up into the high 16s when the norm is about 18.5%, so we probably have a good 7.5% or 8% left to go in Seattle.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Well, that leads to my next question then. Mike Dance, I think you said that you guys were going to be less aggressive in the fourth quarter on your renewal rent increases to maintain occupancies through the slow period. And I'm just wondering if you have the backfill in demand, why would you be less aggressive? Why wouldn't you continue to push rents until you saw that pushback or the demand drop off?
Erik Alexander: Yes, this is Erik. I think we would. I think what Mike is talking about is that we're going to keep a watchful eye on that balance. And so if we don't get something, right, if we don't get the demand, we need to be careful what we're doing on the renewal side. From an income standpoint, we haven't had any trouble qualifying new residents all of this year with these increasing rents at our communities. That's not been a big issue for us to deal with it. And we've been covering that well. Depending on the community, it ranges from 2.5x to 3x the rents on their income qualifications. And again, they're covering it very well.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, Mike, another question. Just when you look at your opportunities that you're -- for acquisition or development, what are you seeing around the transit hubs? Is that an interest for you outside of, say, your core urban markets that you talked about in the future?
Michael Schall: Sure. We love the transit hubs. One of the deals that we bought, development deals that we're going to put into production is in Dublin, which is, what,100 feet from the brand new West Dublin BART station. So I -- we believe in the urbanization of California. And the general rule there is certainly political acceptance to that concept and the integration of -- actually, our deal, our Via deal that we're delivering now has a -- the local light rail valley transit nearby and some retail that I think that's very interesting. So we believe in it. We think it's been well accepted by the tenants. It's a -- yes, I'd say it's a major consideration to what we look for in a development deal.
Erik Alexander: Yes, and even Reveal which we just bought is an interesting conversion of a rail line to a dedicated bus line that's being expanded all the way through the Valley and then connects with the Metrolink, which is the subway that goes into Central Station in Los Angeles. And the ridership on these double-train luxury buses, air-conditioned, is gaining in popularity. So it is part of the attraction of going there. And we hope that, that continues.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: And just lastly, in some of the markets that are weaker, in Orange County and in some of your other weaker markets, are you seeing a significant shift in population outside of those markets and that you think it might take a while for them to come back? Or do you think that it's the opposite, that you're seeing people come in now, that they're seeing cheaper homes or cheaper rent and that, that's turning around?
Erik Alexander: Yes, it's hard to say. We don't see people moving out. And I think we see activity similar to before as people can move closer to their job and get good housing. They're doing that. We see that in all of our communities. So again, they're looking for a lesser commute and they want certain amenities that those people are coming in. The ones that are leaving, then the reasons, again, seem to be about the same with the exception of slight increase in the -- moving for maybe less expensive rent that people are locating about the same outside of the area as they were last year whether it be relocation for family or jobs or so forth. But again, they're coming in for the same reasons as well.
John Lopez: Right. And again, this is John Lopez. Just to point out, if you look at the trends and the increase of occupancies that we've seen, in each one of our regions and each one of our markets, it's being led by the top areas. But the clear trend is people are taking advantage of with lower prices, the top end and even availability that usually isn't there in an average market.
Erik Alexander: Yes, I think that's probably a good point. I mean, we saw that first hand at Skyline and Axis which are higher-end properties. And so you had people moving from within Orange County to both of those high-quality products, but you had a number of people moving from outside of the area that hadn't previously considered Orange County because of the product -- the specific product offerings so.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just want to go back to Rob's question real fast. You talked a little bit about loss lease. Can you break that out by Northern California versus Southern California and Seattle?
Michael Schall: Sure. Northern California is just under 10%, Southern Cal is just over 4.5%, and Pacific Northwest is just below 8%.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Second, Mike, in terms of the investment outlook, are there plans for any additional preferred equity investments?
Michael Schall: They are, as you know, opportunistic in nature. And so if we see those opportunities, we'll react to them. They will tend to be lumpy. It isn't like we can produce a ongoing stream of those transactions, really, the opportunity framed by underlying debt rates that are very low and you have the opportunity to take that piece above the existing debt level. So I -- we're working on some, but I would be -- it's impossible for me to give you any meaningful guidance on what we might do.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And third, just a bigger-picture question. When we talked a year ago, you guys were underwriting pretty decent growth over the next 5 years. Curious if that has changed at all given the macro outlook here? What kind of growth you're underwriting over the next 3 to 5 years in terms of when you're looking at IRRs? And also, as we get back to kind of peak-ish rents here, and we're not seeing significant wage or job growth, how much can we continue to push rents longer-term there?
Michael Schall: Well, I've got 2 comments. One comment is, we actually are seeing wage growth, so I think that's an important piece that would -- as a statistic. And John Lopez can elaborate if he wants, but the non-government wage and salary piece, i.e., not bonuses of employed people, was at 5-plus-percent June over June, June ‘11 to June ‘10. So we are seeing that. And again, I think in the high-tech world, wage growth is probably among the best, I'm supposing. So I think that part of it is good. In terms of the 5-year growth rate, it's up a little bit. We’ve talked on previous calls that we thought the blended average of our portfolio growth there was in the 30% to 35% range over 5 years. It might be a little bit higher than that, but to the extent we're front-ending a lot of this rent growth. Obviously, Northern California and Seattle is much greater than what we originally expected this year. We're not expecting that to meaningfully increase the 5-year growth rate. I think John Lopez has bumped it from 30% to 35% to 35% to 40% over 5 years, so he has some increase in the 5-year projected growth rate. But to the extent that we get outside growth upfront, I wouldn't expect that to just essentially add on to what the 5-year growth rate is.
John Lopez: Yes. And just to add to that, Mike -- this is John Lopez, is that we have those expectations with a very moderate job growth expectations as the underlying driver and the lack of single-family supply and the long gap in multi-family. And our view of growth going forward, really hasn't changed that much that we expect to see improvements year-to-year, but not in 1.5 years turning around to phenomenal 5%, 6% GDP growth.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And your unlevered IRR targets, your comments on cap rate's not changing, I'm just wondering if you're -- but now you're doing it through joint ventures, saving the added fee income. Have those actually gone up this quarter?
Michael Schall: No. I mean, I think our IRR targets are similar. They are in the 9% to 10% range, levered in the mid-teens. So I think that those expectations are still pretty much unchanged. I will give you that market selection becomes more important because there are markets that are scaled towards the bottom of the rent cycle, really have not seen any meaningful recovery in rents. And then there are markets where we've seen very dramatic rate of recovery well in excess of what we expected. So it makes a more interesting acquisition dynamic right now.
Operator: And our next question is from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Any update on the mezz loan program?
Michael Dance: Yes. We just gave it. We have some in the pipeline but, as Mike mentioned, nothing we can give guidance on at this point. They're kind of letters of intent. They're not to a stage where we have commitments for breakup fees.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Mike, I'm sorry, I missed that.
Michael Dance: Yes, Paula, in my opening remarks, we talked about capping that activity at effectively about 5% of total capital. So we're looking for opportunities. And again, they tend to be lumpy. But they could be -- not necessarily -- they're generally not mezz loans. They're generally, preferred equity-type investments that -- and other opportunistic things that are of the similar type of investment.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then at the -- our NAREIT meeting, you had talked about labor costs still being low but providing you an ability to essentially cherry-pick talent, and that was accelerating productivity at the construction sites. Are you still seeing that? And is that perhaps one of the drivers of the reduced costs on the Via project?
John Eudy: Yes. This is John Eudy. On Via, remember, we bought that out in the winter and early spring of 2010, which I would say is probably the very bottom of the market. And that's what I consider the baseline going forward compared to the 3 buyouts that we have recently done on the starts for this year. From then to now, there is about a 4% to 5% increase that we've seen on a comparable -- net rentable square foot comparison. I do think that, that will start to move up as we see more of this activity starting to occur. Through this year, it's not going to go up much, maybe another 2 or 3 points, but going into the spring of 2012 and later, we're -- it's a projection, we don't know for sure. It's probably another anywhere between 5% to 8% beyond the number that we're buying that at today.
Michael Schall: And just to add to that, Paula, I do think that John and -- John and I talked about this, he will agree that the quality of the labor force was a material factor in terms of getting Via delivered faster and at lower cost than what we...
John Eudy: We obviously hit on all cylinders. We got the lowest pricing point. We got the best-quality subs at the time, and the translation was we're, what, 10.5% below the original project cost...
Michael Schall: That was cost of capital, too, because we are 4.5 months ahead of plan.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then finally, just looking out long term, can you talk about your view of the role of preferreds in your capital stack?
Michael Dance: It's, again, very consistent with the investment strategy. To extent that we have these, what you call mezz or preferred equities, we like our preferred stock as a way to match-fund those because they typically have similar terms. And to extent that we can get 300 basis points or more of arbitrage between what we're going to get on the yield and what our cost of funds are, we think that is an appropriate use of preferred stock. Outside of that, we don't see as many opportunities to use that as a source of capital.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: I just wanted to come back to the turnover comments you had in your opening remarks, and I think you discussed having a little bit higher turnover in some of your more seasoned residents in terms of pushing those rental increases on them and them leaving and then that resulting in higher turn cost. I was wondering if you can just sort of elaborate a little bit more on that? When you look at $7 billion your turnover year-over-year at least, is down 300 bps on an annualized basis, and for the 6 months, it's down the same, 300 basis points. So I just wanted to tease out, is that sort of higher turn relative to what you expected? And then also talk a little bit about the resident base.
Erik Alexander: This is Erik. Yes, no, overall, I think the turnover is still below what our initial expectations were for 2011. But we did see a seasonal increase in the second quarter over first quarter. As it relates to who is moving out, I think a little of what we saw in June were more -- a few more move-outs among people that got higher increases. And so all turns aren't created equal. And so what we're trying to do is be wise about what we're getting back as far as the product. And so these enhancements, as I said, are not distinct redevelopment programs there. Better paint and more liberal replacement of fixtures maybe for longer-term residents that have been there for a while, so that you have sharp apartments. That's a relief that these -- at these higher rates and get those while the demand is there. So again, that translated to some higher costs on some of those turns. And we expect to see some more of that going forward. But I wouldn't apply that to all of the units. As we go into next year, we're going to be looking to take more advantage of expanding the turn strategically to get better rents and select marketability.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: When you look at your resident space -- resident base today, what's sort of the average tenure within your portfolio of that resident?
Erik Alexander: I don't have that prepared. I can get back to you. It has -- when we last looked at it as you -- intuitively, you might appreciate that it's been longer over the last couple of years because rents were flat or down and that they are going up. Some people are moving. It's in that 2-year range, a little bit more. It tends to, again, be between, I think it was 22 months and 27 months, again, depending what part of the cycle that you're in.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: And are you tracking, I mean, are you able to say what is the rationale for that move-out, home purchase, rent, job and...
Erik Alexander: Yes. I mean, we do track that. Some of it is subject to interpretations. When somebody says that they're moving out of the area, we try to get the best explanation that we can so that we can stick it in the appropriate category. But oftentimes, that's all you get. You don't know whether that was for family or job loss or too expensive. But again, we collect information the same way and the move out related increase again is -- or too expensive is up a little bit over the first quarter and over the same period last year, so in that 6% to 7% range versus last year, as you might expect. Nobody was moving out because it was too expensive, maybe 1% or 2%. And then on home purchases is something that we've always paid attention to. But again, it’s bouncing around in the 8% to 10% range over the last couple of years. For the second quarter, it was at 10%.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Right. And so when we think about the spread between the new and the renewal, at least some of that is being -- in a new lease, you're losing some of that based on the higher expenses that you're flowing through?
Erik Alexander: Yes, I suppose that's right. Again, there's a timing issue related to renewals. So our practice has not been to send renewals out above current offered rates. So in California, if you're sending out increases 60 days in advance, you have economic rent growth in between the time somebody gets their renewal and maybe even decides to leave. We've seen people accept month-to-month premiums and delay their decision to move a couple of months after getting their increase. And so again, you're actually picking something up on the new side given that those economic rents are growing in all markets.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then just a last question, Mike Schall. Mike, you mentioned at the beginning of the call something, being a $7 billion to $10 billion -- you mentioned $7 billion to $10 billion. What are you trying to reference in that from a perspective of your gross asset base, enterprise value and...
Michael Schall: The total capitalization. Again, the comment I'm trying to make is, I would focus less on the specific numbers and more on the concept of not trying to become the largest company, but rather focus on the per share metrics that we're trying to accomplish, which is cash flow per share and NAV per share. So again, we view the company as an investment company, and we have some advantages of size. Obviously, you have more portfolio to spread, technology initiatives and other stuff. That's an advantage of size. But then there are some disadvantages of size. And as I look at our company, one of the things we've been able to do is add a lot of value via external growth. So trying to keep our external growth machine as an important part of the overall results is important to us and so obviously, maintaining company size is a key consideration. Obviously, the bigger your portfolio, the less impact your external activities have. That's the point.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Right. But at some point also from let's say an M&A perspective, if you can consolidate within a market and drive efficiencies, that could drive significant value even off of a bigger base?
Michael Schall: Yes, I agree with that. But I think that there is a limit to how far you could drive those efficiencies. And so I totally agree with you, if you could find the right opportunity to grow the base and, obviously, one possible way to have more markets to grow in, which is a whole different discussion and not something that we are looking at imminently. But it depends on how you view those -- the depth of those efficiencies and how that again relates to the value of the external growth platform. That is the key right there.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: And so being at the lower end of that $7 billion to $10 billion sort of enterprise value today, should we expect that you can still grow meaningfully up to that $10 billion before you have to ratchet up disposition pace and things like that?
Michael Schall: Yes. And again, we're not in a hurry to get to the $10 billion either. We're trying to accomplish things. If we can grow externally and add meaningful value going from $7 billion to $10 billion, then that is important to us, and that's what we're going to do. If we can find better opportunities, and I think it was the point made earlier about if you find a better cost of funds in your disposition program than you do in issuing your stock, then that becomes the key objective. And again, we're trying to manage the per share metrics that are -- those are the focus, much more so than company size, much more so than trying to create the operating efficiencies. The operating efficiencies are important, but the depth of the operating efficiencies -- you hit a point where it's just hard to drive those numbers meaningfully.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Right. But at least on a per share and I think NAV cash flow, growth is still ultimately important. But some of these things, some of the preferred and mezz and some of the stuff that you do there, you get on a treadmill, it's hard to replace, right? So from a per share perspective, you may take a step back as you recycle that capital into more hard assets?
Michael Schall: Yes. Well, and I agree with that as well. And I think that, that's why we're going to limit that to a 5%, limit it to 5% of total cap because we don't want that to get completely out of control. Having said that, I think it's a great opportunity to add value right now. And I think those transactions, you've got one example where we -- our Santee Court building where we bought the first loan and then we ended up buying the building. So there are opportunities that those transactions can lead to in the future to add value. So I wouldn't necessarily suggest that there's going to be -- they're going to create a cliff to worry about. I think that we will be able to identify transactions over time that are -- that add value, and I think that becomes an important part of our overall program.
Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Well, the way the market is going, you may get down to $6 billion before you get up to $10 billion. So you have a lot of room to move to add to it.
Michael Schall: [indiscernible]. We're trying to keep this an upbeat call. This is a good call.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew McCulloch with Green Street Advisors.
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: With the comment you made on the self-imposed rent control, does that put you at risk, if your competitor is kind of blowing right past you, maybe causing you to leave money on the table? I ask -- you're very far from having a monopoly in any of your markets, meaning you don't set market rents. The collective market sets market rents. And I understand maybe the motivation to cap rent increases in theory, but could that be problematic if you do?
Michael Schall: It's a factor. We've looked at the potential impact of it. And we think it's relatively minor, but there is some impact. And Erik and Mike and I have had several conversations about that. And I agree with you, the market sets the rent. But at the same time, I think that if I look back in history, the late ‘90s, for example, it was important to have an industry view of not being too abusive with rent increases. So personally, I believe that some restraint is appropriate. I don't think it costs us very much because the caps that we're talking about in general are somewhere in the 15% range. The caps that we had in the late '90s were somewhere in the 10% range. And again, this is just for existing tenants. This is just on renewals. This has no effect obviously on new lease rents. And I think there are other tangible benefits as well, like, for example, it should reduce your vacancy because if you have a rent increase, your existing residents, they go -- you tell them to go look at other buildings in the area and they're more likely to stay there, which is going to ultimately reduce vacancy and reduce turnover. So I think it's a balanced approach. And again, we're not trying to put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage, but we're trying to come up with a rational program, and I think we've done that.
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Just one quick question. Can you just walk through your new lease and renewal rates for the different SoCal markets? I think you gave it for SoCal in general, but the different markets?
Michael Schall: The new lease and renewal rates?
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Yes, growth rates?
Michael Schall: Okay, in Northern California...
Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Just individual SoCal markets. If you could break it out, L.A., Orange County, San Diego.
Michael Schall: We have that information, but it's not by county. It's by our regional portfolio managers, so we'll have to take another slice and dice at the data and get back to you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: Just quickly on San Jose, just speaking to some folks, it sounds like there's a bunch of development activity going on out there. Just wanted to get your perspective if this is just a few deals in the works or if there's a meaningful amount? And if there is a meaningful amount, when do you think it's going to start coming online?
John Lopez: Alex, this is John Lopez, there is about 7 or 8 deals that are in the construction phase right now. There is one of those components, it's probably about, IAC had 1,500 units that starting, obviously, not all at once. So we're probably looking at 6 or 7 deals in the 300 to 400-unit range that will probably be coming online in late in mid-2013 to 2014. So we've got 1.5 year before that delivers, but there have been an improvement. Those starts were all within the last 6 months.
Erik Alexander: There are several behind it, right?
John Lopez: And there are more behind that. I mean, that's what's under construction right now. You're probably going to see that rate pick up with the recent rent increases. We've had that strategy and we expected that to go up.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: Okay. So I guess I'm just a little surprised because you always think that it takes such a long time to get permits and the zoning that development would be a lot slower. Has San Jose become much more development-friendly or these deals have been in the works for some time?
John Eudy: Yes, this is John Eudy. Most -- every one of those deals have been on the shelf the last 2 years. And then there was a little bit of an impetus that got people started, those in north San Jose like ourselves. If you got in the ground by September 30, you were able to get the affordable requirements waived. If you miss that date, you don't. So that will shut the door on a number of deals after September, because the economic differential is about 50, 60 basis points in cap rate. I think that's part of it. That's the total amount that's going to come on over the next 1.5 years to 3 years. It's a small loss in the budget compared to what happened 3 or 4 years ago when you take this multi-family for sale out of the picture.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Michael Schall: Thank you, operator. Well, in closing, we're pleased with the progress made during the quarter, and we're also pleased that the outlook remains very strong. We think that the long-term growth rate for the West Coast will be among the best in the country. Just want to thank you once again for joining the call, and we appreciate your interest in the company. And we look forward to hearing from you on next quarter's call. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Inc. fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instruction)  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Keith Guericke of Essex Property Trust, Inc. Thank you. Mr. Guericke, you may begin.
Keith Guericke: Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, we’re going to making some comments on the call which are not historical facts such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company’s filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Joining me on today’s call will be Michael Schall and Michael Dance. John Eudy and John Lopez will be avai0lable for Q-and-A after the comments. Last night we reported core results net of non-recurring items for the quarter which reflected FFO, $0.02 ahead of consensus. Our strategy to focus on occupancy, which ended the quarter at 97.4%, was an important part of that success, maintaining strong occupancy positions as to have maximum pricing power. Our market is as impacted as any by job losses. What we have going for us in 2010 is that we do not have significant new supply of either single family or multifamily units coming at us. To summarize, the new housing supply projected for 2010 as a percent of existing stock by market follows, in the Seattle region, we expect to see about six-tenths of 1% of new supply, Northern California, about two-tenths of 1% of new supply, and in Southern California, one-tenths of 1%. In addition, home prices and affordability are also moving in our favor. As we mentioned over the last few quarters, we expected our California single family markets to recover in earlier 2009 and the trend of declining year-over-year prices to end. This has happened. In Northern California, median sale prices are up 20% from the bottom, which was in Q1. Year-over-year prices are up 9%, and transactions are up 16%.  In Southern California, median sales prices are up 12% from the bottom. Year-over-year, prices are up 2% and transactions are up 27%. For the economy to recover, we believe the single family market has to recover. Let me just comment a little bit on California. I know many of you are concerned about the impact that the California budget problems are going to have on the state’s ability to grow jobs and create opportunities. I don’t have answers to the problem; I’d like to remind everyone that there are many positives in California. The biotech industry is flourishing in California because of the University system. Google is in Silicon Valley because of Stanford University. Large tech companies have hundreds of billions of dollars on the balance sheet waiting to be used at the right time. We remain significant synergies for start-ups to be near our tech centers. 50% of all venture capital money is spent in California. As the Pacific Rim continues to become more important, California exports will grow with that demand and finally, the climate and the quality of life here still beats the hell out of most of the country. So, with that just update on the Prop 13 issue, we still have no visibility. Both sides continue to raise a significant war chest. We assume the issue will probably get to the ballot. In our market, cap rates on economic grants have remained lower than most expected and have actually continued to trend down. In Seattle they range from 5.75% to 6.25%. In California, both north and south, the range is in the 5.5% to 6.25% range. We are starting to see more opportunities and surprisingly we’re seeing some foreclosure opportunities from the construction lenders. In the fourth quarter, we purchased a very high end condo project in Irvine, California from a construction lender at approximately a 6% cap and at a discount of about 40% to the original developer’s cost. For 2010 we have a target of $300 million of acquisitions, currently we have two large transactions in contract totaling $175 million. One with contingencies removed. We’ll touch on development real quick. Refer to our supplemental financial information schedule, S 9. Projects under development are on track to be delivered in the first half of this year. Of the total cost to complete, approximately $27 million is being funded by a construction loan; the remainder is being funded by the balance sheet. Of note, total cost at Berkeley and Seattle projects have been reduced by $9.5 million. This is a result of cost efficiencies we are obtaining. We’re going to continue to evaluate our predevelopment projects. There’s two on that schedule and if we see the appropriate opportunity, we could start one of those projects in 2010. As discussed in our press release, we purchased a site in Dublin for $5 million. Our cost represents a cost of less than one-third of what it had previously sold for. We’re going to continue to look for opportunistic land acquisitions in 2010. We do not have a specific goal built into the 2010 guidance. Before I turn the call over to Mike Schall, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate everyone at Essex for tackling the challenges, but 2009 threw us, working hard and doing their best to serve our residents as well as produce results for our shareholders. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Schall.
Michael Schall: Thanks, Keith and thank you everyone for joining the call. Our fourth quarter results followed the pattern of gradual improvement that began in mid 2009. The apartment supply demand picture remained largely unchanged. That is, demand driven by jobs has stabilized but remains in a weakened state, given high unemployment and uncertainty. We see this continuing until job growth resumes, which we expect to begin in mid 2010. On the supply side, the pipeline of new apartments and condos being rented as apartments continues to be delivered, a trend that will continue into 2010 and will affect the timing of the recovery of each West Coast submarket. During the quarter, market rents on Essex’s portfolio declined slightly, market rents were 8.9% lower at year end versus December 2008. We experienced the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter, which we planned for by reducing turnover to an annualized 45%. We continue to absorb gain to lease, we define as a percentage of scheduled or in place rents exceed market rents. As a result, the 4.7% gain to lease reported in last quarter’s call has declined to 3.8% at the end of the year. Home purchases surged in the fourth quarter, representing 14% of move outs, versus 10% for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, and 11% in the fourth quarter of 2008. We continued to use concessions on a limited basis in Q4 for all but the properties in lease up, and we expense concessions up front, a more conservative approach than most other companies. We issued earnings and guidance press releases yesterday afternoon. In addition, we provide our market rent forecast for 2010, which is included as page S 14 in the supplement. Overall, we are forecasting flat market rents in 2010. However, market rents are expected to continue a gradual decline through June, and recoup that loss in the second half of the year. Market occupancy rates declined in 2009, and are expected to partially recover to 94.5% in the West Coast markets by the end of 2010. We have assumed that occupancy levels in our portfolio will average 96% in 2010, which remains significantly above the expected market occupancy levels noted on the market forecast, but below the 97% occupancy reported in 2009. The combination of flat market rents, a 3.8% gain to lease, and 100 basis points of lower occupancy are the primary components of our projected 5.5% same store revenue decline in 2010. Our 2010 plan assumes that operating expenses will increase from 0% to 1%.  Now I’d like to briefly review each major part of our portfolio. Starting in Seattle, in the fourth quarter, market occupancy was down 25 basis points to 93%, again, attributable to continued deliveries of new housing. On the Essex Seattle portfolio, market rents continued to decline during the quarter, and for the year, we’re 15.7% below December 2008 levels. Jobs in Q4 were down 6,000, although we see signs of stability, most important, we have seen jobs in professional business services stabilize and actually increase in Q4 after falling sharply for post of last year. Seattle lost 11% of its manufacturing jobs since August 2008, which includes a 6% loss of jobs at Boeing Seattle facilities. Going forward, the manufacturing sector is beginning to stabilize. Cumulative job losses in Seattle since August 2008 total 78,000 or 5.5%, which is the same as in Northern California, but greater than Southern California which was 4.7%, and the U.S. average at 4.5%. Looking to 2010, we forecast additional market rent decline of 2.5%, with weakness in the first half and a slow recovery beginning in Q4. Job growth is expected to be slightly positive at 0.5%. Condo and apartment deliveries are slowing down, but there are simply too many units available in the marketplace. For 2010, we see 3500 multi-family units, that’s 0.9% being delivered almost all in the first half of the year. Single family deliveries in 2010 will be at the lowest level since we tracked the Seattle market. We expect 2500 units or 0.4% of stock. We expect Seattle to be the last Essex market to recover. Now on to Northern California, in the fourth quarter, market occupancy was flat sequentially, at just under 95%, and down roughly 100 basis points from fourth quarter 2008. Market rents were down slightly on a sequential basis, mostly due to seasonality. On the Essex Northern California portfolio, market rents declined slightly in the quarter and for the year were 9.6% below December 2008 levels. Looking forward to 2010, we expect jobs to be roughly flat overall in the first half of 2010, although the Fremont submarket will likely experience moderate losses in Q1 due to the expected closing of the NUMMI plant which employs about 3500 workers. Overall, market rents in the Bay Area are expected to increase 0.2%, although we see rent declines of 2% in the Oakland MSA as a result of the expected NUMMI plant closing. Northern California should be the second West Coast region to recover, due to increasing job growth in the second half of the year, along with minimal supply of new housing. We expect the better areas to be downtown San Jose, the Peninsula into San Francisco and downtown Oakland, areas that are in the heart of jobs and face little or no new supply. Now on to Southern California, in the fourth quarter 2009, job losses in Southern California slowed, beginning in the third quarter and actually had job growth resume in the fourth quarter. On Essex’s Southern California portfolio, market rents increased for the second consecutive quarter, although they were down 5.9% for the year. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect Southern California to lead the West Coast markets out of recession, all four Southern California counties are showing signs of imminent job growth primarily because job losses are abating in the lagging construction and manufacturing sectors. The multi-family pipeline is nearing completion with only 5,000 units, 0.2% of stock, throughout the four coastal Southern California counties remaining to be delivered in 2010. As before, these additional deliveries along with the overhang of the 2009 deliveries will slow the recovery of certain submarkets, including West LA, Downtown LA, Woodland Hills and Orange County. Thank you for joining the call. I will now turn it over to Mike Dance.
Michael Dance: Thanks Mike. Today I will recap our 2009 accomplishments and provide some color on our 2010 guidance. Our 2009 core FFO of $5.43 per diluted share was down approximately 4.8% from our core FFO in 2005. Normally, a year-over-year decline in same store net operating income of 4.8% would result in a much larger percentage decline in FFO because of the negative impact of leverage from debt with fixed interest rates. However, we successfully mitigated the expected negative impact of this decline in net operating income by reducing our G&A costs by $3.2 million, and opportunistically creating a positive arbitrage from retiring our Series D preferred partnership units at the end of 2008, retiring the Series G convertible preferred stock during 2009, purchasing over $100 million in unsecured REIT bonds at an average yield at 10% and by using the proceeds from dispositions at a fixed cap rate to buyback 350,000 shares of common stock at below $58 per share. We believe that in spite of being in markets that have felt the brunt of the economic recession, that our 2009 same store NOI decline and the core FFO decline of 4.8% will be among the better results in 2009 of our peers. Reported FFO of $6.74 per share increased by 11.8% over the 2008 FFO of $6.02. Both these years include the impact of the non-cash component of interest expense on convertible bonds. On page S-3 of our fourth quarter supplemental financial information, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-core FFO items reported in 2009 and 2008. The mid point of our guidance for 2010 is $4.75 per diluted share, which includes $0.16 of non-core FFO gains from the disposition of $42 million in REIT unsecured bonds sold in January, at an effective yield to put to the buyer of those bonds of approximately 4.5%. We intend to use these proceeds to invest in higher yielding external growth opportunities. Our 2010 guidance assumes interest and other income of $13 million, which is comprised of approximately $7 million on the marketable securities, $2.5 million from existing structured finance notes and an additional $3.5 million from new investment opportunities expected to occur in 2010. The 2010 guidance assumes a range between $4 million and $5 million or approximately $0.14 a diluted share, of dilution in 2010 from the lease up of the 581 apartment homes expected to be delivered in 2010. The dilution to FFO from lease-up activities is attributable to three items. First, we used the cash method to recognize rental income for free rent. So we don’t recognize income until the resident makes their first lease payment. Second, we engage in significant free leasing activities and we incur normal operating expenses before the asset reaches stabilization. Lastly, two of the development sites being delivered into operations have approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space that we have assumed will remain vacant throughout 2010. The 2010 non-same property results will increase by approximately $2.2 million from not having the negative impacts from the 2009 lease up activities at Belmont Station in Los Angeles and the Grand in Oakland. Our 2010 guidance also assumes dilution of $3 million to $5 million from external growth pipeline that assumes we will acquire one or two additional condo developments that will be converted from their current for sale condition to rentals requiring the build out of leasing offices and the dilutive costs of incurring upfront and operating expenses during a lease up and our cash basis accounting method noted earlier. Additional dilution from 2010 acquisitions is expected from condo units as we convert these units for rent. On a normal apartment development that has ground up construction, the property and interest is capitalized while construction activities continue to occur during the lease up activities. This is not the case for condo development. As of the end of December, we have over $150 million in cash and marketable securities and of $200 million in capacity on our secured line and unsecured bank facility. Based on 2010 net operating income, the assets that secure the debt with 2010 balloon payments are expected to generate over $100 million of additional proceeds that can be used to fund all our 2010 capital requirements. Our guidance assumes that external growth activities will be done predominantly on balance sheet and financed with 50% debt and 50% equity. A new institutional investor fund or a possible joint venture structure will be considered, when we intend to use additional leverage and/or when fees earned from sponsorship will significantly increase the expected FFO accretion over a balance sheet financed investment. Our assumption for interest expense is that the Federal Reserve will not begin to increase rates until after several months of sustained employment growth. Given that our rent growth assumptions do not assume increases in employment until late into 2010, we are assuming a slight 25 basis increase in interest rates in 2010 that will increase the cost of variable rate debt, and we are assuming an effective rate of 6.8% for long term debt refinancing activities to occur in the second half of 2010. The 6.8% effective rate includes the amortization of additional financing cost from settlement payments on the forward starting swap contracts. General administrative expenses for 2009 totaled approximately $24 million, and our guidance for 2010 assumes that $700,000 decrease in executive based compensation that is tied to achieving stated performance goals. If it becomes probable that the performance criterion for 2010 will be achieved, then our 2010 G&A costs will increase over this guidance amount. We will not be providing quarterly guidance, other than to point that we expect same property net operating income to decline sequentially through the third quarter, with a slight sequential increase in net operating income in Q4 2010. This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Just on the capitalized interest front there, looks like it picks up decently, yet you’re completing a lot of projects in 2010. Are we to assume that some of those projects that where you stopped capitalizing interest and you’re going to start capitalizing again, as you move forward potentially down the development pipeline?
Michael Dance: No, that would be capitalizing on the delivery for the first six months of the apartments that we’re delivering, and then this typically stays where certain units are delivered while other construction activities are going on. So even during the lease up, we’re continuing to capitalize. In addition, when we acquire condo projects that convert from for sale to for rentals, there will be some capitalized interest on the assumed acquisitions of completed condo projects.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: As you’re going out buying land right now, just curious, I mean you talked about cap rates are very low in the market still. What kind of spread would you begin to look to develop again?
Michael Schall: We basically said historically that we need 100 to 125 basis points. So I don’t think that changes and looking at 5.5 to 6 caps on acquisitions, that’s putting us in the 6.5 to 7 range on development. Frankly, right now it’s hard to see those things pencil out. Although we do think that if we can buy land very opportunistically, it sets us up for the future and the one deal that we did buy in Dublin was, as I said, on a per unit basis was at prices we have not seen in many, many years.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Maybe just a final follow-up question here, in terms of the line of credit there, most of the activity in the fourth quarter was put on the line. Is there a plan to turn that out? I thought on a previous call you had mentioned the plan to sell the exchangeable bonds to sell the bonds that you purchased to take out the exchangeable notes.
Michael Dance: We sold $40 million of bonds in January, so we paid down the $10 million on the bank facility, but the rates on the five year secured facility are very attractive and we’ll probably try to maximize the balance on that line.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Can you talk about the $175 million of acquisitions you have in contract or under contract, are they kind of core-ish or are they opportunistic? Is it a combination? What do you have there?
Michael Schall: There’s two transactions. One is very opportunistic. It’s basically a broken condo project in Southern California, where we would be buying it from the lender and the second deal is more of a core deal in Northern California.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: For the condo acquisitions that you did and maybe plan to do, I mean this isn’t the right word, how occupied are they of owner occupants and what’s the length of time it takes to really kind of turn them around into full scale rental buildings?
Michael Schall: The first transaction that we closed on in the fourth quarter actually is, we’re finishing construction and we’ll start leasing up in the third quarter of 2010. The deal that we have in contract in Southern California now is complete, has not been sold. So it will start leasing up. There is no issue with reducing the giving rate of existing tenants, but it’s not a broken condo deal. It was built as condos, but never sold.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: How much of the $300 million that you’re targeting for this year? Do you think will be of this kind of broken condo variety?
Michael Schall: It’s hard to tell. I mean, opportunities come and go and we’re going to be aggressive if the opportunity, we see them. Currently, the one deal is about $125 million, so I wouldn’t count on anything more beyond that.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: The one that’s under contract is $125 million?
Michael Schall: Correct.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: In terms of financing, you said you would go 50/50 debt to equity. Where you trade now, I mean are you comfortable raising equity to finance acquisitions on that 50/50 sort of basis, or would you raise equity in some other way?
Michael Dance: Probably the latter, I think when we see the equity drop, it just raises the bar for what it takes to do an acquisition. So as the cost of capital goes up, we need to find more attractive acquisition deals, but we have flexibility with debt capacity that we could increase leverage a little bit more if need be.
Keith Guericke: Rich, could I ask you a question? Are you getting a feedback reverbs, because we’re getting it on our end. We just want to make sure you guys can hear.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: I’m not hearing. You sound clear as day. I’m often not sounding very clear anyways, at least according to you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dustin Pizzo - UBS.
Dustin Pizzo - UBS: Keith, just so you know, we actually were getting a little bit of feedback there. John, as I look at your job forecast in the supplemental, the expectations for the number of markets are fairly meaningfully above those estimates from Economy.com and some of the others. For example, in LA, they’re looking for a loss of 20,000 jobs, Q4 to Q4, versus your 15,000 increase. So can you help us get any more comfortable with your forecasts and if the jobs were to remain negative in markets like San Fran and LA, do you envision any recovery in positive market rent growth getting pushed back into 2011?
John Lopez: Let me just address the first part. If you look at for example at Orange and San Francisco, where we have about 5,000 jobs, 6,000 jobs in Orange year-over-year, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, we get our numbers plugged in, annual growth numbers for Economy.com. So that equates to about 13 or 14 year-over-year negative. So I haven’t read the report on their actual breakdown by quarter, but we also use Rosen Consulting so we’re not exclusively on Economy.com. So I can tell you Rosen is more aggressive in Orange County than Economy.com is so. It’s not that we only use Economy.com and we choose to be more aggressive, but it’s a blend of both our researchers we’ve used throughout our history. Your second point, obviously we need some job growth. Most in the second half to get that rent growth, but we don’t expect that through the second half. So in those markets where we expect some rent growth, we probably expect maybe slightly negative to flat in the first half. So we’ll know by midpoint if we’re not getting job growth and that will have us adjust our numbers downward. I don’t know, if that answers, what you were looking at there.
Michael Dance: It has very little impact on the 2010 guidance, in that we don’t have that much leases turning in the fourth quarter anyway. So it doesn’t have that big a change in the revenue that we’ve given guidance on.
John Lopez: Just what we do is we look these are our markets we live in and analyze constantly. So what we’ve looked at in the recent trends, we think we might have a little bit better on ground information. Particularly in Orange County, as an example is, Southern California’s been improving and the business services jobs has become very strong and that’s disproportionately important to Orange County. So we think that driver, if you look at U.S. numbers, and Southern California numbers, and Orange County numbers, George County numbers, manufacturing losses were abating, business services expected to outperform in that disproportionately drives Orange County ahead of most markets. We just think that we’ve got very good coverage. We use our vendors, but we also update what we see as current trends because, their forecasts are not always real-time forecast, up-to-date.
Dustin Pizzo - UBS: Keith, given your commentary on Prop 13 if there were potential appeal or modification, can you update us on what the onetime hit to NOI, might be?
Keith Guericke: Yes, I think it’s in the $6 million to $7 million range at the NOI level.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Levy - Macquarie Group.
Michael Levy - Macquarie Group: I’d love to get a better sense of what’s going on in Seattle. Can you elaborate a bit on the timing as to when you might see some pricing power there?
Michael Schall: The problem with Seattle hasn’t really changed or deviated from the pattern that we’ve been talking about for some time, where they had a development pipeline that was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and pretty much all that was delivered in the last 12 months, plus the next six months. So it’s just weigh too much supply on the one hand and then the other part, which I alluded to in the call is, the job losses in Seattle, cumulative since August 2008, 78,000, negative 5.5%, were worse than the U.S. and average was 4.5%. So you have both sides of the equation being affected, too much supply and greater than average job loss and those are the key factors up there. The better news in the whole thing is that pipeline is being delivered and pretty much we’ll be through it by the end of this year, towards the later half of this year. As a result of that, Seattle typically is able to outperform the nation when it comes to job growth when that resumes. So we think we will hit a period probably in early, mid-2011 where you’re through the supply pipeline and you have better than average job growth and that will lead to a strong recovery in Seattle. Again, I think that’s a last market of Essex portfolio to recover, and I think it begins in late ‘10 and picks up steam in ‘11.
Michael Levy - Macquarie Group: The absence of Washington Mutual and other companies that have either gone away or are struggling mightily there, that you think is going to be compensated just by the natural growth that has been going on in that market over the last 20 years or so.
Michael Schall: Yes, exactly. I mean if you look at that market, it has some of the best has had, some of the best job growth of any of our Essex West Coast markets. Again, that cycle or that pattern has been interrupted, but we don’t think it’s been interrupted for good. We think it will resume that normal pattern, again just based on the technology component in that marketplace, the trade with Asia and other places. We think there are some fundamental very good positives of that market. So by no means are we taking a step back from Seattle, but in the short term, it’s got some problems that have to be dealt with. We remain long term bullish on Seattle, short term it has the biggest drag in our portfolio.
Michael Levy - Macquarie Group: Just one follow-up if I could, just hearing of the talk with the acquisitions that you’ve done so far this year and the talk of development. How likely is it that you’ll end up acquiring more than $300 million in assets? Is it reasonable to assume that number is just a conservative estimate and you might end up acquiring more?
Keith Guericke: I would say that $300 million is our best guess. If we saw some just fabulous deals, I mean, it’s really going to get down to what’s the cost of our capital and what are the opportunities out there. The cap rates have held up and there’s a tremendous demand out there for every deal that’s marketed probably has 15 to 20 bidders on it. So what we tried to do is find deals, source deals that are off market and not gone through the bidding process and there’s a limited amount of that kind of supply out there. So, if we could find more, we have the capacity to do more, but I think $300 million is our best guess of what we could do.
Michael Levy - Macquarie Group: The remaining, if I were to think about that strategy, if I were to think also about where the rest of the acquisitions might come from this year, it would probably be from the foreclosed developments or stuff like, similar to what you’ve already been doing?
Keith Guericke: That stuff is very hard to find as I said in my comment earlier. I don’t know that we will find any more of those, I mean there’s a couple more out there that we’re looking at right now, very honestly, but it’s just difficult, so I would think that probably you’re going to see more goods core kind of stuff in core markets in California, primarily.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill & Partners.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Just continuing on, on the foreclosure and the OREO sales, the banks that you’re speaking with, are they marketing these or are they trying to keep them low, sort of off the radar, so as not to attract anyone’s attention to their loan portfolios?
Michael Schall: Well, these were actually I guess the one that we bought in Irvine, there was a broker involved, but it wasn’t widely marketed. I don’t think that the banks are necessarily trying to hide anything. We’re talking to, frankly, all the banks and to the extent that they have something that they can afford to get rid of, they’re willing to talk to us. So I don’t think they’re trying to keep anything secret.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Then the Dublin site, this is near Avalon’s deal?
John Eudy: This is John Eudy. The West Dublin Barge Station as opposed to the Dublin/Pleasanton Station. It’s a brand-new station that was just completed last year.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Then on the security front, are you guys still buying marketable securities or have you stopped that?
Michael Dance: We have not purchased any REIT unsecured bonds. We’ve disposed of $42 million in January.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill & Partners: What about aside from REIT bonds, other types of marketable securities?
Michael Dance: We will look at those and underwrite those if we feel that there’s appropriate risk/reward, we will invest in those.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Finally you made the comment earlier about 50% of VC capital being spent in California. What’s the talk out there with the potential to tax, change the carried interest tax? Are people thinking that this will cut down on job growth or that sort of like the California situation, it’s not really going to matter and there will still be tons of VC investment in jobs out there?
Keith Guericke: We haven’t focused on that and I don’t know. I mean, I don’t have an opinion right now. So as we get closer to what it means, I don’t think that the VCs are going to dry up overnight because of these issues. It’s a cost of doing business for them, frankly. So I think that there’s still going to be a fairly healthy VC investment portfolio out there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Can you walk through your outlook for same store expenses I guess 0% to plus 1%. You’re trending below where you were for full year 2009.
Michael Schall: The only places that we see pressure on expenses next year are property taxes, where as, California has Prop 13 so the effect of Prop 13 is evaluations are lagging and, therefore, we’ll have an increase in property taxes under Prop 13. It’s limited to a maximum of 2%.  So that is one category of expense pressure upward and the other one is the utility expenses which we have a couple percent increase assumed. We have less visibility on that one, but again, I think that is the other area that we see some pressure upward on cost. Otherwise, we are almost across the board assuming flat expenses to down expenses.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then in terms of the acquisition assumption, the $300 million, what’s the rate you’re assuming or the yield for the full year?
Keith Guericke: We’re working in the 5.5 to 6.25 range. The deals that we are currently working on are in that range, ones we have in contract. So that’s the assumption in the 2010 guidance.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Keith, if you’re starting to see some distress, I know it’s very small at this point, is your assumption though that that will increase overtime and perhaps you’re going to see better opportunities as you look out to 2011 or even beyond?
Keith Guericke: We don’t think so. I mean, for a couple reasons. (1) There’s a tremendous amount of money out there chasing these deals. (2) Unless the GSEs do blow up, I don’t think they will, you’ve got that money out there at 5.5% to 6%. So, I don’t think you’re just going to see the cap rates moving up significantly. I think you might see a little bit more product come to the market, but right now the amount of product on the market is historical lows. So I think that there’s plenty of demand out there to keep the cap rates low.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Who are you competing most with at this point in terms of when you’re looking at these properties?
Keith Guericke: Well, the first condo deal, there was some local players. The other REIT that we were aware off and then a fund, and the other deal, sort of the core deal was an off market deal. I don’t think we had any competition on that one.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michelle Ko - Bank of America Corporation.
Michelle Ko - Bank of America Corporation: Just along those same lines, I was just wondering if you had to fund your acquisition through debt, is it more attractive to look at the secured right now or the unsecured? We’re hearing that some of your peers are raising unsecured at pretty low levels?
Michael Dance: That’s an ongoing evaluation that we’re continuing to consider both, but I’d say right now the benefits of the secured is you get a slightly lower rate. The benefit of the unsecured is you’re creating more debt capacity for the future as your NOI grows. We’re kind of looking at pretty low NOI rates. So we’re pretty optimistic, will be a lot higher in ‘12. If you get the unsecured on that, you’re able to increase your debt capacity in the future. 
Michelle Ko - Bank of America Corporation: If you had to issue unsecured today, what rate would it be at?
Michael Dance: Hard to say, because we have not ever been in that market, but I would say, with an initial debut, it’s probably low sixes.
Michelle Ko - Bank of America Corporation: Do you think you could give us some cap rates on the recent acquisition of the Regency and the disposition on the Maple Leaf?
Michael Dance: Yes, the Regency was around a six cap and Maple Leaf, I think it was around 5.6, 5.7, something like that.
Michelle Ko - Bank of America Corporation: Then just lastly, I know you talked about this a little bit earlier, but could you just go over again, why you think Southern California will recover faster than Northern California?
John Lopez: This is John Lopez. It started out in 2007 with its recession and so on the upfront part it just went in faster and made the cuts faster and what we’ve seen is it’s probably about one or two quarters ahead of Seattle and about a quarter ahead of San Francisco and a lot of that is primarily because outside of the East Los Angeles.  We don’t have as much manufacturing drag in those areas, where more manufacturing in Northern California and Seattle. So that will be sort of less drag in there and the business services, there’s a bigger sector down there and will be a leader out, it is leading already.
Keith Guericke: Michelle, we actually have seen market rents increase for the second consecutive quarter. We didn’t see that in Northern California or Seattle. So we actually have some on the ground real information that indicates that’s the case.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I think you said on the last call, when you guys were beginning to think about acquisitions, and looking at what looked to be fairly low cap rates, that you were underwriting double-digit rent growth in 2011 and 2012 to sort of get you interested, is that still your underwriting assumptions as you’ve been going forward?
Michael Schall: This is Mike. I think it was high single-digits. I think there actually will be a double-digit rent growth out there. I don’t know exactly where, but I think the underwriting was high single-digits in ‘11 and ‘12 and actually there maybe a double-digit number out there, but I think of the last couple of underwritings we did, it was high single-digits.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Has that changed at all as you’ve been going through the last few months of acquisitions?
Michael Schall: No, our outlook has not changed.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Question for Mike Dance. In the guidance for interest and other income of $13 million, did you say $3.5 million of that was going to be from new activity and if so, what kind of things would that be?
Michael Dance: It’s basically using the proceeds from selling bonds that investors are willing to pay 4.5% for the bonds that we purchased at a 10% yield, and we have basically taken our Seattle acquisition person and put him in charge of kind of joint venture, mezz, second deeds. There’s attractive GSE debt that gets 70%, and if you can get 70% financing at low 5.5%, it leaves the investor a lot of opportunity to put an additional 10% loan on it at very attractive yields to us on properties we would like to own. So we see that as one of the few players on the West Coast doing that, and if we’re able to get low teen type returns on a deposition on assets we want to own, we think that’s a good move for our balance sheet and for our shareholders.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: What type of volume would you expect to do potentially in mezz type investments?
Michael Dance: We’re targeting 50 throughout the year, but probably most of that to happen in middle of latter half of the year, $50 million.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just last question, the up tick in move outs for home sales, did that concern you at all? Did you think it was just tax credit related? Are you worried that it might eat into the jobs recovery once it comes in the second half of the year?
Michael Schall: We’re not that concerned about it, I mean, we’re more concerned about overall increase in new housing, be it single-family or multi-family. I think that this is really trading within some multi-family, or rental housing and the single-family stock. Ultimately, we think that’s on balance, a net zero for the most part. So the big picture I think, the things that we concern ourselves with most, are jobs driving demand and overall levels of production of housing. Not that concerned about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Toti - Citigroup.
David Toti - Citigroup: Hey, guys. Michael Bilerman and Eric Wolf are here with me as well. A couple of quick questions, first of all, do you think that your B price point helped you or hurt you relative to some of the declines you’re seeing in market rates? Given the results in the fourth quarter, I would have expected it would have been a bit more resilient where you’re positioned?
Michael Schall: I think it helped. We operate some A assets and B assets and for the most part I actually think the Bs have a little bit more resiliency than the As. Having said that, when you look at some of the development deals and how they’re priced two to three months free rent and coupon rents that have been hammered pretty hard over the last year, I think that the Bs are doing better than that, but, it’s certainly not perfect. I mean, I certainly would admit that there’s plenty of pain in the B section as well. I think that probably more important than that is ultimately the locational issue in that. What we think will happen for example, in Seattle we’ve had a lot of the product being delivered in Bellevue and Downtown Seattle is that the secondary locations will experience more pressure as those people that now can afford to live in Bellevue and Seattle will move closer to where the jobs are. So I think where we see the bigger difference is in the better locations as opposed to the product, per say.
David Toti - Citigroup: Do you guys see any more opportunities or arbitrage opportunities such that you found with the exchangeable bonds in the line?
Keith Guericke: Could you repeat that? I couldn’t hear you?
David Toti - Citigroup: Are there any sorts of opportunities, arbitrage opportunities, like the exchangeable bond deal, that you have at the floor.
Michael Dance: Yes, we believe, we will be able to arbitrage out of the exchangeable bonds and so I think we’re pretty confident of getting that $3.5 million additional interest and other income from those types of opportunities.
David Toti - Citigroup: Mike just one small question, can you remind us what’s left if the current ATM program?
Michael Dance: There’s close to 5 million shares.
Operator: Your final question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo: I guess a question for Mike, maybe just more of a housekeeping question. I think in fund two, you might have addressed this earlier I apologize if I missed it. I think in fund two you have some debt that’s maturing in the construction lending. I was curious what your plans were for those pieces of debt.
Michael Dance: We have the ability to extend those loans. Those loans were provisions in the original agreement, but they have rebalancing require machines, so we’re looking at rebalancing with the current lender or seeing what terms we can get from other lenders that maybe don’t have the same attractive spread, but maybe have the ability to take out a larger loan so again, weighing the benefits of both.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo: What’s the impact of the rebalancing on those loans?
Michael Dance: It’s well within the capital in the fund, so no special capital requirements would be made. So I don’t have the number of off the top of my head, but I think it may be in the $9 million to $10 million for the two loans, approximately.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Just one last question is I’m curious, when you unite I guess I’ll call it the economic view from John along with what you see for asset pricing and market level fundamentals, where do you guys see the best relative value in your markets today and how you rank them for investment. I guess where I’m going with this is, do you have a plan to maybe more consciously reweigh your portfolio of the next two or three years through recycling capital.
Keith Guericke: I mean, we’ve tried to do that overtime and in our history there was more visibility, if I could say, as to where we thought the best growth was going to be. Today, I think we see near term Southern California having the best growth. Unfortunately, cap rates, we don’t see a lot of cap rate differentiation. Cap rates are sort of the same in Northern California, Southern California, so there’s not a cap rate advantage so it really, you sort of have to look to near term growth. Near term growth is going to be best in Southern California. I think that when Northern California recovers, though, it’s got, in my comments I talked about one-tenth of 1% of new stocks it’s going to take of new supply coming in 2010. So it’s going to take a while before the single family and multi-family production can re-tick up so I wouldn’t be surprised to see Northern California’s growth rates be better over the next three to four years than Southern California. So, it’s going to be a matter of balancing growth rates and cap rates for those markets as we evaluate opportunities, and I don’t know that we’re going to see any particular market get a greater share of activity going forward.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo: How do you fold Seattle into that? Just because as you guys have discussed, supply has certainly been a possible and I know while that’s upon us, you might not want to sell into that weakness. Nevertheless, cap rates do feel fairly full there I guess I mean do you try to take advantage of that because it implies the core growth could be soft for some time.
Keith Guericke: The real problem there is NOIs have been hammered so badly, even though the cap rate at five in three quarters doesn’t sound that bad, the pricing on a per unit basis has just been crushed.  The other issue up there, there aren’t many transactions we’re seeing up there to really understand what’s going on. I think long-term as Mike said, we’re bullish on Seattle. Short term we’re going to suffer through the consequences of having a portfolio there, but frankly, if we could find some great opportunities up there, we would not be opposed to looking at them as well.
Operator: Thank you. That was our final question in queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Guericke for final comments.
Keith Guericke: Thank you. We appreciate your interest and hope to have all of you on next quarter thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 Essex Property Trust Earnings and 2009 Full Year Guidance Conference Call. My name is Stacy and I will be your conference moderator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call Mr. Keith Guericke, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.
Keith R. Guericke: Good morning, thank you for joining our call this morning. We'll be making some comments in this call which are not historical facts, such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Joining me on today's call will be Michael Schall, Mike Dance and John Eudy. Included in the earnings release on your... on our website you will find our market forecasts for 2009. These forecasts reflect underlying assumptions that support the guidance for 2009. Also included with our earnings release is a schedule titled New Residential Supply which includes total residential permit activity for the larger U.S. metros as well as information on median home prices and affordability as compared to the Essex markets. To get those details visit our website under investors and media. Last night we reported another strong quarter with core FFO increasing 10.2% per share. For the quarter the portfolio grew revenue of 3.4% greater than the same quarter in 2007 and six-tenths of 1% on sequential basis with occupancies at 96.6%. I was originally going to go through a long winded description of what happened to the national economy in the fourth quarter but, I realized everybody already knows what's happened. So I'd really... just we're going to look forward here and basically I think 2009 is going to be a pretty tough year and 2010 is probably not going to be much better. National job losses are going to be somewhere between 2 and $3 million and it's going to hit our markets. We've built our 2009 guidance of the optimistic end of that range assuming 2 million jobs will be lost nationally with approximately 100,000 of those job losses in our markets. All markets are going to suffer job losses. What will differentiate Essex is the low level of new supply being delivered. There is still fairly large differential in the cost of single family versus multi-family and the quality of life factor that historically has kept our population in place even during economic downturns. There are a few positive signs in the market. Single family transactions have increased due to price corrections and very low borrowing rates. Lower oil and other commodity prices resulted in a flat PPI for the December 2008. Current trends indicate significant year-over-year PPI declines by summer of 2009. In addition, a majority of the home sector jobs, particularly corporate finance, have already been cut back to pre-bubble levels. When the financial markets do show market fundamentals will be strong for departments, consumers will be stronger positioned and the residential supply pipeline, both apartments and single family will be low. Modest job growth should drive... has in the past driven strong rental growth. Now let me comment on each of our markets quickly. Demand conditions have changed in Seattle. We now expect a loss of 15,000 jobs based on expectations of lay-offs at WaMu, Boeing and others and related sub-contractors. New apartment supply is forecasted 5100 units or 1.3%. The job losses in the new apartment supply, however, is tampered by the steep drop in single family production. Only 4400 new homes or six-tenths of 1% will be delivered in 2009 leading to total supply of 9500 units or less than 1%. This is down from 12,600 units in 2008. By contrast the lowest previous growth of new single family homes was 1.2% in 2002 and on average... an average production rates since 1990 has been 1.6%. In addition, Seattle has very low exposure to the financial... to financial jobs after the loss of WaMu. We expect market occupancy 95% and market rate declines of 2% in this market. Performance by sub-market will vary with the weakest components being downtown Seattle where job layoffs and overlap with new supply. Newer high rise buildings will be the weaker segment of the Seattle apartment market. In Northern California, San Francisco and San Jose had minimal exposure to single-family construction and mortgage finance jobs. We expect the Essex to continue to outperform the general economy. In addition, San Francisco has the lowest exposure to manufacturing among major metros and the San Jose economy has already experienced their steep manufacturing cutbacks in our last downturn in the early 2000. San Francisco and San Jose are expected to lose approximately 11,000 jobs or six-tenths of 1%. They are almost equally across those two markets. We expect occupancies to stay at or above 95% and rents to be flat in 2009. New total supply in San Francisco and San Jose is 5900 units or four-tenths of 1%. Oakland has more exposure to manufacturing and had a larger exposure to single family construction industry. The area had shed most of those jobs. Jobs are expected to decline by 10,000 in 2009 compared to 27,000 in 2008. Single family construction and financing jobs have been cut back to pre-2001 levels. Southern California, overall the Southern California markets remain some of the most supply constrained in the U.S. However, like Seattle the recent multi-family supply pipeline was concentrated in high end, often high rise condo projects. This pipeline will be all but completed by the end of 2009, particularly in West LA and downtown Los Angeles, their Irvine area of South Orange County and downtown San Diego. Majority of our portfolio in Orange and San Diego are older lower price product outside of these central nodes. New total supply is forecasted 7400 single family units and 13,400 multi-family units which is approximately four-tenths of 1%. The housing finance jobs concentrated in Ventura and Orange have been cut back to 2002, 1990 levels respectively -- 1998 levels excuse me. Job losses of 68,000 are forecast for 2009, this is down from 86,000 in 2008. Rent growth will range from flat in San Diego to down 4% in Los Angeles with each market performance will vary across submarkets. Occupancies will range from 93 to 95 across the submarkets. 2009 is going to be a tough year as I mentioned earlier. We believe that all markets (ph) will experience job losses in 2009, some more than others. However our business strategy that has been in place since 1994 which focuses on locating and supply constrained market with high exposure to technology oriented service jobs will continue to serve us well. In preparation for the coming tough times, we took the painful step in December of reducing our workforce by 22 employees, primarily in the development and redevelopment areas. We're going to continue our strategy of defensively operating our portfolio keeping occupancies high. Our balance sheet will remain one of the strongest in the multi-family sector maintaining a low debt to market ratio and a strong fixed charge coverage ratio. Finally, we're going to remain flexible with respect to opportunities. 2009 will be tough but I'm confident Essex will prosper. And I would like to turn the call over to John Eudy.
John D. Eudy: Thank you, Keith. Fortunately we have been fairly conservative in our development activities. The remaining committed exposure to complete our developments which are under construction is 259 million of which 88 million is funded by undispersed construction financing and the remaining 171 million comes from cash and our lines of credit. Of the 171 million, 100 million of the estimated remaining costs related to Tasman Place in Sunnyvale, can be postponed further by delaying the unit starts if the financial markets continue to deteriorate leaving with us with the net current committed cash requirement of 71 million. We are well positioned to adjust the timing of all our pre-development and land held for development starts to accommodate the financing issues in the market. Building during the cost compression stage of the cycle and delivering into the recovery phase of the economy, of course, would be the best execution. The most important thing to note in our pipeline is the average negotiation date on the land purchase price of our entire development exposure is 2004. So, we avoided the overheated acquisition market of mid-2005 to early 2008. During the quarter we had no additions to our pipeline. Defensively we decided to lease one of our pre-development projects known as Essex Hollywood to credit tenure through July 2012, hence delaying development and lowering our overall exposure. We also sold one of our land held for future volume transactions 90 Archer. On the remaining development activity, Belmont Station in LA is now complete and 80% leased, we anticipate getting to 95% leased by mid-Q2 if the current leasing phase continues. The Grand in Oakland is substantially complete and to date we have pre-leased 74 units out of our offside trailer. Our onside leasing office will in the building itself will open for occupancy, February 15. Fourth Street in Berkeley and Joule Broadway in Seattle are progressing ahead of schedule and are below our original development cost estimates to date. On Tasman Place in Sunnyvale, we've moved back the anticipated start date to September 2009 to better time the delivery date into early 2012, a time when we believe both, there will be both a dearth of new inventory and the current job market will improve. We're also seeing construction number substantially below our initial estimates and we expect this cost compression trend to continue for the near future. Our two fund development Studio 40-41 and in Studio City and CLO in Chatsworth are both slightly below our scheduled development cost estimate and Studio 40-41 will be delivered on time and CLO will be one month late. We have been able to avoid the pitfalls of development by limiting our exposure, having income operating options to delay development much like the Essex Hollywood deal where we extended the lease to the our tenant for three years and most importantly by not being aggressive on land acquisitions over the last four years. Our conservative platform has positioned us to have the flexibility to better time some of risk inherit in this business. At this time, I would like to turn call over to Mike Schall.
Michael J. Schall: Thanks John and thank you for joining us today. Despite gloomy economic conditions, the fourth quarter of 2008 ended on a positive note with revenue growth in each region of Essex's portfolio compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Again Northern Cal and Seattle led the portfolio performing near or above the high end of our original guidance range. For the year, revenue growth was 4.5% equal to the high end of the guidance range. For the quarter, most of the operating metrics were positive given the backdrop of the deteriorating economy. We made the decision to increase occupancy in each region of the portfolio early in the fourth quarter and then held that level throughout the quarter. Financial occupancy thus increased 0.3% to 96.6% helping push sequential revenues up 0.6%. We've been able to continue the high occupancy execution so far in 2009, as indicated by our physical occupancy and net to lease for the portfolio as of January 26, 2009 of 97% and 4.3% respectively. Delinquencies continued to be less in budget for the quarter, although more people with job related issues are moving out unexpectedly. Finally, same property concessions declined from $262 per turn unit in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $187 per turn in 2008. We commented on earlier 2008 conference calls that we were maintaining the defensive bias toward revenue management based on the weakness in the economy and rental markets. This approach favors occupancy over coupon rents, longer lease durations, diligent collection effort and limited corporate exposure. During the quarter, we experienced widespread job losses and announcements of future job cutbacks. At the same time, we are nearing the peak of deliveries of newly developed apartments in most submarkets, including several condo complexes now being rented as apartments. The combination of peak in new supply and reduced jobs continue to weaken our already soft Southern California markets and change our rental dynamics in Seattle from favorable to challenging. While our best rental market remains Northern California, it will content with limited job reductions from many employers, including Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Yahoo! and eBay. The shock of these events and the normal seasonality was apparent in our loss to lease statistics which turned negative creating gain to lease as of December 31, 2008 of 2.8% of schedule brand. Meaning that scheduled brands pursuant into places, which is greater than economic rents as compared to a loss to lease of 1.9% of scheduled brand as of September 30, 2008. I should point out, however, that we used loss to lease statistics as an indicator as they can vary considerably from quarter-to quarter and are affected by a variety of factors. We revised our outlook for 2009 on several occasions over the last four months and each revision was negative given the extraordinary change in employment picture and expectation for a long term recession. The outlook now incorporates limited rental revenue reductions in each major area of the portfolio. Essex is we believe well positioned for this difficult period given its supply, its coastal supply constraint, quality of life markets and strategy based on B quality properties in A quality locations. As a result, we expect to continue to perform in the top tier of the multifamily companies. Now I'd like to briefly review each major part of the portfolio starting in the Northwest. The Seattle area experienced a significant change during the quarter as newly built apartments and condos rented as apartments continued to enter the market amid lower demand due to job losses at WaMu and other employers. Lots of corporate demand added to the supply demand difficulties. Deliveries of competing housing are expected to continue well into 2010, leading to our expectation of a challenging operating environment for the remainder of 2009 continuing into 2010. As of January 2009, our Seattle occupancy included approximately 2.4% Boeing employees, 0.5% WaMu employees and 6% Microsoft employees. As of January 26, 2009, physical occupancy in Seattle was 97.3%, net availability of 3.8%. Home purchase activity represented 11% of our move-outs for the quarter compared to 18% a year ago. In Northern California, we expect to experience layouts and it has experience layouts in a limited development pipeline. And we expect it to continue outperform Seattle in Southern California. We see very limited similarities between the current market conditions and those of 2001. San Francisco and Silicon Valley are expected to be the best performers of the Bay Area submarkets while the open MSA is expected to experience moderately larger job reductions and greater supply of computing housing. As of January 26, 2009, physical occupancy was 97.9 in Northern California and net availability was 3.5%. Home purchases represented 11.7% of our turns for the quarter compared to 15.7 a year ago and then Southern California. The softest experience in Southern California will continue throughout 2009 as most of the major submarkets will continue to be affected by job losses and continued delivery of competing housing. However, in most submarkets, we expect the new housing deliveries to occur -- the remaining new housing deliveries to occur in 2009 which should represent a bottom end of the housing market. As a result, we believe the challenging operating environment in Southern California will continue in 2009 but that growth will resume in 2010. On January 26, 2009, physical occupancy and LA Ventura was 95.8% net availability of 5.3%, Orange County occupancy -- physical occupancy was 96.4%, net availability of 4.9%. And in San Diego physical occupancy was 97.4%, net availability of 5.5%. For our Southern California portfolio combined move out activity attributable to home purchases was 11.5% for the quarter compared to 13.1% a year ago. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Dance, thank you.
Michael T. Dance: Thanks Mike. Today I will highlight our 2008 results and provide an overview of our 2009 guidance. Our 2008 funds from operations came in at the high end of our guidance principally due to property operations achieving the higher end of the 2008 guidance in gross... in the net operating income, a very challenging economic environment. Other contributing factors for achieving 2008 results were the low interest rates on our variable rate demand notes and our $3.5 million gains from the early retirement of $53 million of exchangeable bonds. Offsetting these gains was non-recurring items related to severance benefits and a loan loss reserve related to a borrower that files for bankruptcy protection in November. As of December, we have over a $100 million in cash and marketable securities and only $35 million in 2009 debt maturities. In addition, we have over $300 million in capacity on our secured line and bank facility. And we have $60 million of construction financing for the $69 million of remaining cost to be incurred on the Joule development. Our Fund II is remaining, development costs are fully financed. The 2008 net operating income from unencumbered assets exceeds 87 million or approximately 32% of the total net operating income for the portfolio. Our 2008, I'm sorry, our $200 million bank facility has been extended through March 2010, and is our only debt that has financial covenants. We have significant capacity on all these financial covenants and our unencumbered net operating income can be used to obtain 10 years secured financing and provide maximum flexibility and financial strength for opportunities. The cash flow heads liability at December 31, 2008 was 73 million, which relates to 375 million and forward starting swaps that will be settled late in 2010 and 2011. The amount of this liability reflects the extraordinary stress and volatility in the financial markets that existed at the end of the year, and we believe the ultimate settlement amount of these contracts will diminish or become favorable as the credit markets stabilize over the next 24 months. Our 2009 guidance was predicated on the economic outlook that 2009's gross domestic product will decline by a 1.3%, which will reduce the jobs in our markets by approximately a 100,000 or 1% decrease in employment. These job losses coupled with known supply increases will decrease our net operating income from the 2009 same property portfolio by approximately 8.7 million. The 2009 guidance includes an estimated $1 million increase in property operating expenses for change in our fixed-asset policy. The higher than expected increase in the Seattle regions 2009 operating expenses is attributable to two items: the first is the high assessment of property values, which has increased to region same property estimated tax expense by $900,000; a 20% increase over 2008. We will be appealing several of the property tax assessments and may be able to reduce some of those projected increase. The second major increase to Seattle's operating expenses relates to our cost accounting change and our method of allocating overhead cost, which increases Seattle's same property corporate allocation by $600,000 or 50% increase. General and administrative expenses for 2008 totaled $27 million. The increase in the fourth quarter compared to the first nine months was partially caused by the complete rollout of the Yardi YieldStar at level one during the third quarter, while the change in overhead that allocates these costs to the properties will be effective on January 1, 2009. The 2009 guidance assumes over $2 million decrease in general and administrative expenses attributable to cost reduction initiatives and by increasing the allocations of property management overhead to property operations as I mentioned in my earlier remarks concerning Seattle's projected increase in operating expenses. Our estimate for 2009 funds from operations per diluted share will range from $5.50 to $5.90 per share. The mid-point of the 2009 guidance is $0.19 per share below the first call consensus estimate due impart by the additional interest expense required by the adoption of APB 14-1, which will increase interest costs by $0.11 per share in 2009. The 2008 results after restatement for APB 14-1 will be $6.04 a share compared to our 2009 guidance of $5.70 per share. The biggest contributor to the $0.24 drop in the 2009 guidance is that our estimate of the non-recurring funds from operation items in 2009 will decrease by approximately $8 million or $0.27 a share, from the $10 million of non-recurring FFO items in the restated 2008 results. APB 14-1 requires the 2008 gain on retirement of debt to be restated from $3.5 million to $4.9 million. In January 2009, we retired $18 million in exchange of bonds which will result in the $2 million in other income in our 2009 guidance. The mid-point of the 2009 forecast assumes that the weighted average APB 14-1 book value of these bonds will be approximately $148 million with an imputed interest rate of 5.75%. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon actually. Real quickly, just in the past you've updated us on affordability in your markets. How does that stand today just given the pricing declines we've seen in this single family housing market right now?
Michael Dance: The affordability of single family housing you mean?
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: The affordability gap relative between multi-family and single family.
Michael Dance: We did not redo that calculation. What we'll... I'll do is, we'll do it and put it, maybe put on the website, so anybody who wants to see it can take a look at it. Because I don't have that at my fingertips right now.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: That would be helpful. Secondly, looking at your portfolio, you have a good mix of both class A and class B assets. Have you seen any significant trading down from the class A to the class B assets?
Michael Schall: Yeah Mike, this is Mike Schall. We've seen some of that. I mean... I think the key issue that we're dealing with is sort of a timing issue. You have general economic weakness at a time when the bulk of the deliveries which are all class A assets are hitting the markets. So you have sort of the worst of both worlds. You've got job losses onto one hand, and you've got especially in Seattle and downtown LA, and moving to district of LA and various other submarkets, you've the got bulk of the deliveries coming into the market. And so I'd say typically the As suffer as things compress during economic stress, which is clearly happening now. But the Bs are right behind us. So I wouldn't say the Bs are immune from that obviously. I think everything is in the marketplace. Again, largely driven by just timing factors. And there is just way too much supply coming online at a time when you have demand shock. So I think everyone is affected by that. I think the As are affected to a greater extent, but nonetheless it's painful for all.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
John Lopez: And Mike, it turns better and your first question, this is John Lopez, even with the changes in the interest rates and prices, in our market our affordability rates are running at or below long run averages and our rent to income are at or below long run averages. So the imputation that too is that, the cost of the renting versus owning is still a breakable for us right now.
Michael Dance: So those were words of John Lopez, our Economist.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: That's very helpful. Then, third the 2 million of debt extinguishment I think you have in the first quarter there. I'm assuming that's from your exchangeable notes. Do you expect to continue to repurchase additional exchangeable notes throughout the rest of the year?
Michael Dance: If it's economically to our advantage, meaning that to take those out, we're going to need to get six and a quarter GSE type financing. So, if we can get yields to put that or at that level or better, we are a willing buyer. But we haven't seen many sellers at those type of pricing. So, we'd love to but it's beyond our control.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then finally Keith a question, a bigger picture question for you. You talked a little bit about 2010 as being another challenging year. Just given the gain of lease in place right now in the portfolio as well as the benefit in 2009 from the LIBOR rates, could 2010 be a worse year than 2009?
Keith Guericke: That's a wonderful question. And we don't think so, we think that '09 is going to be a tough year. We think that the first half of '10 is going to continue to sort of be the front-end of the recovery. And it will still be tough, but it will start getting better. So I'd expect that first half of '10 to be, continue to be pretty tough and then the second half of '10 starting to see the light of day. So, overall for the whole year of 2010 I would expect to be slightly better than 2009.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michelle Ko with UBS. Please proceed.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Hi. I was wondering if you can give us more color on the move outs that you are seeing unexpectedly. Is it because of doubling and tripling up or people moving home with their parents?
John Eudy: Michelle, it's hard to track exactly where are those are coming from but, and so it's more anecdotal than anything else. But, so we had and I would say it's not is a larger factor. Actually, I have said this on the last call for the third quarter. I know in my opinion it's not as larger factor as the benefit we're receiving from lower move outs to buy a home. And, but still it's something that we are beginning to track and trying to keep our eye on. So still not a significant factor. Just something that is entered the equation that's different from six months ago.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Okay. And also can you talk a little bit about renewals, terms like some of your competitors are becoming more aggressive. On the renewal side as well. Are you giving concessions at this point on renewals to lock in occupancy?
John Eudy: We are in some cases and we're not another. So it really is a region by region decision. You can imply from the fact that we'd probably have the highest occupancy out there in the multi-family world that we are being very aggressive with respect to renewals, which means we will give some concessions if we need to. Obviously, when you are faced with turnover costs that can range from a 1000 to $2000, you would rather keep your existing residents in place. And, we're very mindful of that obviously and we spent a lot of time on renewal strategy. And, but I would say that there is no sort of overwriting corporate approach to renewals. It's a little bit different in every market depending upon the factors and conditions of that market. But it's something, yes we are very aggressively pursuing and execute as key part of our overall strategy.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Could you talk about what some of those markets where you might have to be giving concessions, what some of those markets are and how large are some of those concessions?
John Eudy: Well, the concessions are typically in the markets that have the greatest supply. So right now you have very significant amounts of supply coming online in downtown LA and the arena of LA, arena district in Woodland Hills. In Orange County, you've got a number of lease-ups that are happening there. Downtown, Seattle we talked about it. Say all of those are areas that are offering, the new product coming into the market is offering typically two months free. You need to compete with that. And again lot of this just attributable to just the timing of when the bulk of this supply is coming online, occurring exactly when the job market is the worst it's probably been in a long time. So we sort of have the worst of both worlds, you have typically two months free and sometimes more than that in a lot of new product that are coming into these marketplaces and we are competing against that. So you should expect that we can outperform that dynamic by any huge margin. You've got to compete with the factors that are in place in the marketplace.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi Guys. This is David Toddy (ph). Just a sort of big picture of question. I know you touched upon the government stimulus coming probably aimed at the single-family housing market. Given your relatively optimistic view of job loss for the year, are you more concerned about this single-family home stimulus than job loss, or would you say it's a bigger concern for the later half of year.
Michael Schall: The stimulus in a way it's being read, the tax credit in the $7,500 range, that's significant in homes that are $200,000 or less in all markets. It's 400 plus in Southern California, 600,000 in Northern California and 400 in Seattle. That represents 1.1 to 1.2% of the prices. So it is not as big a factor in our high price single family markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then I'm just moving over to the development pipeline. You've got about a 100 million invested in starts and land parcels. I assume there was a year-end test for value or impairment, given the... I think a relatively optimistic view of your markets going forward. What do you think your tolerance is around that test, the value test for those parcels?
Michael Dance: David, this is Mike Dance. The impairment test is only for developments that we are not intending to develop. And so far these are all in-field type markets. We are looking at possibly delaying them, but we have not abandoned any of the development pipeline.
Unidentified Analyst: I noticed that you pulled dates off of the two projects in pre-development?
Michael Dance: Yes, again that's just provide flexibility as John mentioned in his comments, to make sure we're well positioned to start when financial markets will be able to... where we can get financings for the developments, and provide the delivery of the time is going to be a pent-up demand.
John Eudy: Yeah. And one follow-up, the land base number that we're in at remember is anywhere between four and 4.5 years prior, which put us in a much better position than had they been deals that were tied up in the last two or three years.
Unidentified Analyst: How long can you guys carry those projects with that sort of... in terms of an extended start date?
Michael Dance: We have the financial power or capacity to carry on for as long as we think there is going to be economics so that they justify the ultimate development.
John Eudy: And another thing to note too, much like the Hollywood deal that we just re-did the lease on, each of them if you go down a predevelopment main street Walnut Creek, we are in the process of vacating it, it includes about 65,000 square foot of office and retail right in the downtown core of Walnut Creek. We can choose, should we decide to at some point to release it. Campus includes about a 12, 13 year old building. We are in just in the process of moving out the tenant and that includes 260 to 2,500 net square feet of completed office buildings. These aren't completely vacant land parcels. They have intrinsic value at numbers that are, have alternative financial decisions that we could choose, should we decide to further delay it, we can change our business plan.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last question on your disposition plans, for the100 million, can you tell us anything about your pricing expectations, what types of assets those might be in the timing?
Keith Guericke: These assets... the assets we're looking at in 2009 are essentially we're looking at assets that we have no debt against, so that would generate maximum cash proceeds from the sale. They are generally smaller properties, generally decent quality. So, we think in the marketplace that decent quality property and those markets are going to be 6 to 6.5. And that would be our expectation that we are frankly we are marketing, marketing situation. So I think any comments beyond that are probably inappropriate.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: This is Michael Bilerman speaking. Just on the capitalization on the land and pre-development versus the land held for future, what are you doing in terms of capitalizing interest on that... on those?
Michael Dance: To the extent that we're continuing to actively develop which would include getting beds and working on designs, get the most cost effective costs, we continued to capitalize interest to the extent that they are postponed. And we're just waiting for times to improve we've stop capitalizing interest.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: And then on the Hollywood side, what was the dollar amount sort of the effective yield you're getting now on the assets?
Michael Dance: 6 cap.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: And dollars?
Michael Dance: Dollar amount of the lease?
Michael Bilerman - Citi: Yeah. (inaudible).
Michael Dance: The base is about 23, $24 million, so six cap on that. I don't have the right number on top of my finger tips sorry.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Hey guys. Keith, you mentioned job losses of maybe 2 to 3 million at the national level. You guys selected the 2 million number. How much would the forecast change if you had to assume the 3 million job losses? And I think you talked specifically about 100,000 losses in your terrific markets.
Keith Guericke: Right. Exactly I mean if you look at the various expectations in the marketplace. As I said the range, I mean now we've got access to the Wall Street Journal and other documents, so that loss... job losses range from 2 to 3 million. We looked at what happened in the fourth quarter and again look at the types of jobs that we have in our marketplace and a significant portion of the jobs that have been lost have been manufacturing, number one. Number two is single family or just construction in general. And so if you look... if you take again looking at our markets in the $100,000, 100,000 jobs are really related to the jobs clarification that we have in each of our market. So, John Lop is here and he probably could maybe give you a better answer as to if we looked at the $3 million range, what would be the job loss be?
Unidentified Analyst: Well, there is a 2 to 3 million, if you would go to 3 million, my anticipation was because you know some of the sectors that we don't have at worse, the impact could be we could potentially lose, instead of the 100,000, it will could to the 125 135, which would have some small or not a huge impact on our level of growth upfront in '09.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Yeah just trying to get a sense of how much that built into the guidance number. And then I guess to follow on to that is it just seems like Northern California and Seattle seem to be lagging and that they had better performance from much of last year but they are only starting to see the slow down just now.
Keith Guericke: You have to remember that in... their big cutbacks in economies that we have that are keeping us from being cut back now occurred in '02, '03, '04. Seattle, they lost 100,000 of manufacturing jobs in one year and we didn't gain much of that back. So we went... Seattle and Northern California went through a deep pairing of jobs more than most economies in the '02- '04 period.
John Eudy: Jay, I've got one more thing and that is my comments for Southern California. Remember Southern California has been in the midst of sort of finding the some of the battles with respect to job losses for a couple of years now. Ventura County being the most notable example or San Diego County as well. So I think that as you... we are more concerned about Seattle as I commented early over the longer term. But at the same time I think Southern Cal sort of works through its issues and it may one day be a very significant positive force for us. So that's roughly half our portfolio. So I think you have to look at each piece separately, so if you are going to say gee, Northern California is still going down, don't forget that Southern California probably bottoms out in 2009.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Right, and then and just back to the cap rates you mentioned maybe 6 to 6.5% for your dispositions but if that broadly applies to the market. Does that mean that you need to see development yields now of the mid 8% range? And I guess how far away are we from those kinds of opportunities? Sounds like you are shifting more towards future acquisitions I guess as forward going?
Keith Guericke: Well, we're stay... as I said we're going to flexible and look for the opportunities. And if we see acquisitions in the 8 to 8.5% range, we'll jump on it. If that happens, it will probably be a very, very small window which isn't going to stay there very long I'd guess. And so the answer is yeah, we've always been opportunistic. We've always tried to stay flexible and development when cap rates in the acquisition front where 4.5 development, a heck of a lot more sense and it will flip around on us. So if... wonderful thing about this market, it flips back and forth, you got to be ready to take your spots and you can't get to focus on any one particular activity.
Keith Guericke: I'd add something to that too. I mean I think that's the 6 to 6.5 cap expectation and obviously others have reported similar type numbers out there in the marketplace, fairly distinctly different from how the public marketplaces value on our company. So as long as that differentials in place i.e., employ capital of the company relative to the transactions in the private world are as large as they are. They create so I think other opportunities. We obviously wouldn't do a lot of development or acquisition, you would look at the other opportunities such as depositing off some properties and buying their securities back that which is I think pretty unique opportunity right now.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Well you mentioned $100 million but would you expand that?
Keith Guericke: We're flexible. The issue is that we can do that $100 million and not have to do worry about 1031 exchanges and use all that money for whatever we want to use it for. And if we go beyond that, we have to start looking at 1031s and it becomes less effective but for the right opportunities, yes.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay and just lastly, can you talk about homes being rented? I mean how significant is that in market... especially in Northern California?
Keith Guericke: It's becoming a greater factor to allow our portfolio although it's not a huge factor. It tends to be the largest factor in the more affordable single family markets. So it's for example a huge factor in Riverside County, but still you have this differential where the housing prices are still single family, for sale prices are still very high in most of the coastal markets. And as a result, it's not viable to buy a house and rent it out and expect to make money in that transaction. So it is still the exception rather than a rule, although again it's certainly happening more now than it was a year ago.
John Eudy: And just to add to that, in some secondary markets that we are not currently operating in, you can rent brand new homes competing directly with existing market rents. So in other markets, it's getting much worse.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets, please proceed.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Hey, thanks and good morning I guess to you guys.
Keith Guericke: Good morning.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Keith, can you talk about dividend policy and your thoughts about stock dividends and what the plan might be for Essex?
Keith Guericke: Yes, our policy has been to increase our dividend on an annual basis approximately at the same rate as our FFO growth has been for the previous year. So last year 2008, we increased our dividend 10%. This year, we've got a 10% FFO increase. However, I would not expect that we would be looking at the 10% dividend increases given the financial markets and that we will increase the dividend but it will be minimally because it makes more sense to keep the cash in house. Number one. Number two with respect to stock dividends, our payout, our dividend payout ratio is in the 70% range. We have plenty of room. We've got a capital plan in place that is... covers this out for three years. So we are not going to go to the stock and cash dividend plan that is being done (ph) around by others.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay and then maybe a question for Mike Schall. You mentioned the health, relative health of the San Francisco and Bay Area I guess, and wanted to know if you were seeing any impacts on the negative from a pullback in the venture capital marketplace?
Michael Schall: That's clearly a part of what's happened up here. And but I guess the difference is, reading the various press releases out there, it seems like the tech companies are dropping 1000 and 2000, actually HP is a notable exception with its merger but with a much smaller numbers in general. As it relates specifically to venture capital, we've seen some venture capitalists instructions to their portfolio companies to get positive and cash flow and don't expect us to change any time in the near future. And as a result of that they too have laid, have joined the lay-off program and that has contributed to a softer outlook in terms of the Northern California market. But again not in huge magnitude, not huge dollar amounts or job loss amounts and therefore we think that we have built that into our guidance and our job growth expectation for 2009 and John Loop (ph) is here. He may want to comment on that, and follow up on that. Anything specific to venture capital John?
Unidentified Analyst: No.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Well, I mean one thing I recall that a year ago is you guys were talking in a positive tone of course about Seattle and that sort of suddenly took a turn this past quarter. Is there any risk that D.C. could have a similar impact, say six months down the road to the Bay area?
Michael Schall: I mean obviously anything can happen, but remember Seattle... and again I can't emphasize this enough. This is a cancels a two things: on the demand side you have job losses up there. And again I mean I have looked at a lot of press releases and I got... I have a lot of them here, your typical numbers in the Seattle area are like 5,000 jobs. But look at Yahoo! and e-Bay and those have seen 1 or 2,000 jobs typically and were much bigger market in the Bay area related to Seattle. And then the supply picture, I mean the supply picture in Seattle is pretty huge. And it's all concentrate and it's all hitting now. So to a certain extent a lot of this is just pure timing of when things happen. Obviously, we've got to play the cards that we're dealt and it's going to be a difficult environment. But I'd say the same thing I said, I didn't say today but on the last call which is at the end of that process, the supply pipeline dries up and we are going to be left with a period of extreme housing shortage I think really throughout the West Coast. So I guess to answer your question I don't see Northern California repeating what happened in the 2001 to 2003 period, primarily because I just don't see the... you don't have the overhang of the H1T Visas that we had back then. You had... you had all the Y2K and internet bubble employment that flipped around and went the other direction. You had Venture Capital at all time highs and that bubble burst. So you had a bunch of bubbles back then I guess that's the other key point that sort of burst all at once and gave back most of the employment that was gained in the late 90s. This time around, I'm just releasing like that. I will see a bubble there to burst. And therefore I don't see the downside with respect to the job picture, and conversely you don't have the supply. So I think it's a completely different scenario than the 2001 to 2003 period. And it's a dramatically different scenario as well with respect to what's happening in Seattle and downtown, Belvieu.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Good morning everybody. A question for Michael Schall and certainly Keith as well. And it was addressed a bit earlier. I just wanted to fine tune it maybe a little more. But the portfolio is made up of certainly good locations and desirable markets. But you have at least from my analysis, have a relatively more affordable product in your market. It's a bit older. Your cost basis might be lower than some of the competition in that market. Those factors, when you combine them, how much more competitive does that make you in a month... in those markets, given the economy. And when might we see that here in the cycle... when might we see that extra competitiveness that you have that leg up that you might have?
Michael Schall: Alright. I think typically having been through a few of these cycles that things tend to compress as the markets deteriorate. So, in other words, the Bs outperform the As in the same marketplace. Now in that scenario, it doesn't mean that one is going or rents are going up in the Bs and down in the As. It just means that the percentage changes are different. They both go the same direction in my experience. So I think you are seeing some advantage of that. I think you can compare the fourth quarter overall revenue results across the board. And I think you are going to see... I think you are seeing some of that basically. Again, it doesn't mean that one is going to go one direction, the Bs are going to one direction and As are going to go different direction. It just means that the magnitude of the change is going to be different.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: And from an occupancy standpoint. I know occupancies in your markets are pretty high anyway and they are certainly high in the portfolio. But, are you starting to see even on the occupancies side yet, or you are occupancy is holding a bit more firm than the competitors?
Keith Guericke: Well, I did go through the occupancy number, including physical occupancy in January '09, end of January and it seems to be hanging in there. It is somewhat more challenging the whole occupancy in this marketplace. And as time goes on, this is sort of a momentum industry and I think we are carrying a fair amount of momentum into 2009. And I certainly hope that holds. I have a little bit of difficulty giving you exact guidance on where occupancy goes. I think that we are budgeted to give up some occupancy because holding 97 in a market that we expect to be in the 95 range, I think does reflect some inherent safety in the B product. And I think will be able to hold a 2% differential, but clearly we are budgeting occupancy above what is in John Lopez's market expectations, publicist part of the supplement.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: I guess it was more along the lines of, from the competitive product in your market or what maybe deemed competitive product in your markets as you're relatively more affordable, arguably more affordable, older product holding up or able to hold up a bit better than some of the competitive products in your market.
Keith Guericke: I certainly hope it's apparent that it is. Because from my read of our fourth quarter results again relative to others, my read is it's holding up better.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Are you out, do you know if you're outperforming the markets in January in terms of occupancy? Are you a 100 basis higher or about equal --
Michael Schall: We are better than the markets in occupancy, yes.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, okay.
Michael Schall: Yes. And all you have to do is really go to some of the new product in some of these marketplaces and look at what they are renting the new units for. And we can outline give you names of product that you can take a look at. But the issue is if people on the new product... the owners of new product are becoming extraordinarily aggressive with respect to rents, the B product has got to become extraordinarily aggressive with respect to rents. It doesn't... they are not completely independent of one another. They all relate and they all compete within the same marketplace. And as a result there are sort of shades of one another. So, anyway if you like to have a conversation I'll be glad to continue.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: No. And my last question is really I mean how transient really is your typical tenant? I mean these markets are not the cheapest markets to live in, whether it's rental or housing, they are close and to major destination et cetera, they are well located et cetera. But I mean how mobile, I mean these are in many cases two income households or families, it's not just real easy to pick up and move and move back in with mom and dad, especially if they are not living in California. So, the tenants I know maybe loosing jobs, they might be having some trouble but I would have to imagine and I might be wrong, but I would have to imagine that they are probably pretty sticky, they need to be there somewhere in that market and is that a fair characterization?
Michael Schall: Yeah, I think it is. And remember, I mean the rental market, it changes over time. You've got people to enter that are younger college graduates, entering the rental market. I have three kids, none of whom I assure you want to move home with mom and dad. And they, I would call that pretty darn sticky. I mean there is another piece of the renters pool that represents people that are older that will never be able to afford a home, notwithstanding the mortgage craziness of the last year or two that will never be able to own a home. We like that. We think that makes up a significant amount of our renters. And so I think that there are some inherent sort of safety things in the product and the locations given the housing, the limited housing alternatives that you have here. And I think that's helping us as well.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. Well yeah, if California ever gets affordable I think we are all in trouble. So, okay thank you for your answers.
Michael Schall: Thank you.
Keith Guericke: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Summers (ph) with Greenlight. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Earlier you referenced your ability and desire to access GSE financing. I was wondering if you could talk about, what your capacity is to access those markets and talk more about kind of what the terms of some of that debt looks like in terms of, it is strictly secured, what types of LTVs do they look for, how long can you go out in terms of duration and where are they kind of pricing? Just to kind of get that feeling for, if you wanted... if you could really all completely refinance your balance sheet with this type of money, how much can that benefit you?
Michael Schall: The pros of it is the... there.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes sorry.
Michael Schall: The pros of having secured financing is as I mentioned in my remarks the fact that there is really no covenants associated with them. So once you have the lot in place, you have that opportunity to do as you described and get additional GSE financing. The GSEs are in business and they are eager to loan. What we have been experiencing is a lot of volatility in the spreads and that volatility is inversely related to the tenure index. So we accept that the tenure takes to pop up, their spreads come down, to accept that tenure goes down then their spreads go up. And they are kind of honing in at the low 6% type range, 6 to 6.25 depending on asset quality. The loan to value is more of a function of a debt service coverage ratio. They are targeting 120 to 125. You can get slightly lower rates by giving them higher debt service coverage ratios. There are five year products, there are 10 year products. Our philosophy has been to have about 10% of our debt maturing in any one year or so. We like the 10-year product. It just kind of letters our cost of funds and we're long term holder. The negative is as Keith mentioned in his call, the 10 year debt becomes inefficient over time as net operating income increases on the asset. And you pay principal payments on a 30 year amortizing loan with the 10 year balloon and five or six years into it becomes inefficient, makes you look at getting second loans on some of those. Probably the biggest determinant is there are make whole provisions that are very onerous if you sell the asset and buyer doesn't want to assume the loan. To answer your other question about what our capacity is, it's a fairly easy calculation. I mentioned in my remarks that we have about $87 million of net operating income. Some of that's needed to fund the $200 million bank facility that we have. They require... one of the covenants is that we set aside some of these encumbered assets to in effect secure the unsecured facility. So it's kind of a moxie moron (ph) but so in essence that even though it is unsecured, they do require an unencumbered pool. But again that's only $200 million of our debt of which none of its currently outstanding or very little of it. So we're not incumbent to keep it. We have the flexibility of not having a bank facility. And so if you take the 87 million divided by 125 debt service coverage, use whatever interest rate you want to use that will imply where our capacity is if we dump the bank facility. Does that answer your question?
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah and then, a couple of follow up questions. If the 6 to 6.25% term right now, how does that compare to a year ago?
Michael Schall: They are about the same. Again even though the index has dropped, what's changed dramatically is the spreads. A year and half ago, we were getting 80 basis points spreads. Now we're paying 350 basis points spread so.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then in terms of the Fed's plan, they to target this 4 to 4.5% mortgage rate. Would you expect that to benefit on your cost of financing as well kind of similarly?
Michael Schall: I don't think so. I think they are using the profits they're making from spreads on our loans to fund the losses, the single family. But that's more of an administration, you'd have to... I don't know the answer, so I am speculating.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. So they do treat lending money to you guys differently than the single family market?
Michael Schall: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then does the money come directly from Fannie or Freddie or they are just guaranteeing it and then there is other buyers because of that?
Michael Schall: Right. The latter.
Unidentified Analyst: The portfolio, so I believe that but for the part they sell if off.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much guys.
Keith Guericke: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please proceed.
Rob Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Thanks guys. Just a couple of quick questions. You guys talked about how you are being aggressive on renewals before. How aggressive are you being these days with credit underwriting? I mean are we to the point yet where you are willing to tweak your credit requirements slightly downward in order to increase the pool of available runners?
John Eudy: Generally no. No, we have not changed our credit or our underlying standards, and we don't expect to other than maybe one in a hundred properties or something. We generally don't want to go down that run because in our experience, you end up creating a delinquency issue which is just difficult to deal with. So we are going on hold tight on credit standards.
Rob Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay and then lastly you talked about assumption of 100,000 job losses in your markets in 2009. What was that number in your markets in 2002, roughly a similar point in time in the last recession?
John Eudy: Rob, just to give you an example, it was almost 100,000 in San Jose alone in one year and...
Unidentified Analyst: 200,000 in two years.
John Eudy: So it's very little compared to just what happened across our portfolio in that time period. I would say I would probably say we loss almost 2 to 3 times at one year in our markets.
Keith Guericke: But John, I mean you create the context. The context is there was also a huge run up in to us prior to the 2001, 2002 job losses. So you had essentially all the Y2K and Internet boom jobs and capital created the bubble and then the bubble burst and it came back down. I mean correct me if I'm wrong. It doesn't appear to be a bubble this time. So a $100, 000 a 100, 000 job losses when there is no real bubble to speak of is a much more... is a reason why it won't be worse, we wouldn't expect to be much worse, is that right?
John Eudy: Just an example in Silicon Valley, just two years before that, the job growth which is typically between 1 and 2% was over 5% and I believe 4% the previous year. So there was a huge build up and that's why we think this time came almost all from technology which we haven't had this time. That's why we believe that the tax sector is relatively better off than some of the other sectors that has built up.
Rob Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Harris with Royal Capital, please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, hi guys. You may have touched upon this. Forgive me if I am asking something you have already gone over. But are you seeing distressed opportunities across your markets and I am talking land as well as rental properties?
Keith Guericke: I'll let... this is Keith... I'll let John tackle the land but the answer is we are seeing some distress in several Southern California markets. However, it isn't to the level where we feel that our cost of capital makes a lot of sense. But yes, they are essentially... what we are seeing there is we are seeing some condo deals that can't be sold and the developers are broke, the products going back to the bank, the bank really doesn't want to deal with. So they probably like to sell it but we need pretty significant or I think most of the investors need pretty significant prices. And it hasn't been there but there are distressed situations clearly out there.
Unidentified Analyst: Keith I think it'll be fair to say that it's... we don't see deals out there as distress as our stock price?
Keith Guericke: Yeah.
John Eudy: On the land side, we are tracking a few deals, and we would love to tie up and steal a few deals over the next year because being countercyclical, buying the downtimes and deliver on the recovery. But what tends to happen with most land deals in our -- in a core markets is sellers usually have the option of hanging on. It's a general rule unless they're over financed and getting land loans to buy speculative land are very pure and far between even in the really good times. So there are very limited opportunities that we could pursue. We're out in the Valley or Riverside or tertiary markets that would not be the case. But we just have not been able to see things. People pulling their horns, they decide to leave it as a parking lot longer and not sell it. So yes, we'll see a few things that we may end up tying up over the next year but I don't think it's going to be much.
Unidentified Analyst: Can you just remind me, have you got any capacity left in the second fund?
John Eudy: We do not.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Any temptation to talk to investors about a third fund to take advantage of these type of opportunities that may be 6, 12 months down the track?
John Eudy: Yeah, David I don't know if you were in the last, we've actually had the last couple of calls that talked about creating a fund three, and we are investigating that. Unfortunately, most investors, most of the state pension funds et cetera have been suffering from the denominator effect. And as a result, there's not a lot of cash flowing right now. We are continuing to monitor that and that's one of the... I talked about being flexible and that's one of the flexible pieces who are puzzled this year if we can capture some of that type of capital, we will absolutely do it.
Unidentified Analyst: But maybe you need to market to a different constituency?
Keith Guericke: Well, I'll call you after you after the call.
Unidentified Analyst: Alright. Thanks guys.
Keith Guericke: Okay.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi guys, juts one quick one. Just wondering about California's state budget woes and the S&P downgrade heavily, do you expect that to have any impact on layoffs? Does that continues and or do you expect any revisiting on perhaps their team if things continue the way they are in California?
Keith Guericke: I mean right now the Governor has put the employees of the state on a two day furlough. So clearly the state is trying to address these issues and control the bleeding. I don't know I mean clearly if they don't solve some of these priorities, some of these issues, probably some of the state projects will either get put on hold. I expect that part of the federal government's bailout is those cash dollars are going to come to California in a pretty significant way to solve some of the problems, which is a short-term fix. Prop 13 is a subject that comes up all the time. I mean clearly if the Prop 13 was designed to keep the residential, the homeowners in their homes because taxes were going up and people can't afford to live there. If it were to happen, where and there is no indication I mean it comes up all the time and it's always been beaten down. So, if we were to come up very, very clearly, they would go after the non-residential. Clearly the homeowners would vote themselves out and they would be a matter of whether the multi-family people could drive the homeowners curtail. So that's all speculations having said that, and there is no current indications that any of that's on the drawing board.
Michael Schall: Let me add one thing Karin to that and that is Arnold Schwarzenegger has indicated its quote unquote the third rail of California politics having been tried several times before, and so politically very undesirable. Not that it could be tired again. But the other piece of it is that requires a two thirds vote which getting a two thirds vote is pretty difficult to state.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Sure. Do you know how does the furlough effect you guys at all or do you have a lot of state employees in your property?
Keith Guericke: Again it's a furlough of two days per month. So I mean it's not like people are --
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Can't afford the rent.
Keith Guericke: Can't afford the rent.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Got it.
Keith Guericke: So, I mean it's a factor, but I don't... we haven't had any comment from any of our residents with respect to it.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Right. Okay, thanks you very much.
Operator: At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Keith Guericke for closing remarks.
Keith Guericke: Well thank all of you for being on the call. And it ran a bit little bit longer today than normal, but we appreciate your support. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: We thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude your presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the third quarter 2008 Essex Property Trust earnings conference call. My name is [Tawanda] and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen only mode. We will facilitate a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Keith Guericke, President and CEO. 
Kevin R. Guericke: Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This morning we will be making some comments on the call which are not historical facts such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company’s filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Joining me on today’s call is Mike Schall, Mike Dance and John Eudy. Included in the earning’s release on our website you will find our market forecast for 2008. These forecasts have been revised this quarter to reflect the change in jobs and rent growth for several of our markets for 2008. Also included with our earnings release is a schedule titled New Residential Supply which includes total residential permit activity for the larger US metros as well as information on median home prices and affordability as compared to the Essex markets. To get those details visit our website under investments and media. Last we reported a strong quarter with core FFO increasing 10.2% per share. For the quarter the portfolio grew revenue 4% greater than the same period in 2007 and 7/10% on a sequential basis. We are very pleased with that result.  The recent events in the financial market has increased the level of uncertainty and the likelihood of longer periods of weak economic growth. This uncertainty will affect all metro areas and apartment markets. We believe our markets are well positioned for the long haul. The view that all California markets are experiencing the worst and the same of the housing crisis is inaccurate. Real estate is driven by local conditions.  0Our high quality of life coastal supply constraint department markets have not been immune from the impact of the housing crunch, but are very distinct from the unconstrained inland areas of the state. I would like to discuss some of these economic indicators that separate our coastal markets going forward.  Our largest exposure to home construction and finance jobs are in the Orange County Ventura markets. The bubble in these sectors began in 2003 and peaked in mid 2006. As of September 2008 the jobs in these areas have been cut back to the 2002 to 2003 levels. Accordingly, we feel the majority of these cuts are behind us in these markets. Market occupancy in both these markets is at or above 95% currently. Foreclosure activity has been relatively high in California. Again, California as a whole gets lumped together as one big market and this is actually a very inaccurate view of this area. Foreclosure activity nationally was down 7% sequentially in Q3 to 765,000 units resulting in a foreclosure rate of 6.2 per 1,000 of single family homes in the housing stock. In California that rate was 7.2 in Q3. However, if you disaggregate, in our coastal markets foreclosures were down sequentially 22% to 43,000 resulting in foreclosure rate of 5.4 per 1,000 stock. In Silicon Valley and San Francisco, the foreclosure rate is half of the national average. By contract in the unconstrained inland markets of Modesto, Stockton and Joaquin in the North and Bakersfield through the inland empire in the South, the foreclosure in Q3 totaled 31,000 resulting in a foreclosure rate of 14.7 per 1,000 of stock. We believe these foreclosure rates are a proxy for exposure to single family rentals going forward and thus feel our core metro area will face less exposure to the single family rentals. Last quarter we mentioned we saw a slight improvement in the seasonal pattern of transactions driven by price declines. This trend continued to a much larger degree in Q3. Transactions in Q3 increased by 16% sequentially and 12% year-over-year in our metros. Year-over-year prices are down from 35% in Oakland, roughly 30% across Southern California and 15% to 20% in San Jose and San Francisco. A significant portion of these transactions were foreclosures. Despite the decline in home prices, single family affordability remains low in our markets in relation to both current incomes and historical levels of affordability in each market. It is still difficult to buy a home and more financially appealing to rent. In addition, single family permit activity has dried up. In our markets the trailing 12 month single family permits have represented only 3% of the single family housing stock. We believe this limited supply will lead to a quicker level of stabilization.  We continue to believe we have chosen the correct strategy of locating in limited supply housing markets with a high exposure to technology or Internet service jobs. Our portfolio has the largest exposure to venture capital funding which we think is an advantage especially particularly in the current financial environment. Year-to-date venture capital funding has been about the same as last year and up roughly 40% from the low point in 2004. Our markets represent 9% of the jobs in the country yet receive 51% of all venture funding particularly San Francisco and Silicon Valley which receive roughly 40% of all venture capital funding. Big picture, we have two focuses at Essex, we want to operate our portfolio efficiently and we strive to keep occupancies high which we believe is going to produce the best NOI result going forward. And two, we want to maintain a liquid balance sheet which Mike Dance is going to describe a little bit in his comments, actually a lot in his comments. Given the uncertainty of the equity in the debt markets we believe it is important to know that we are covered or the next three to four years.  We also want to know that we have liquidity that will allow us to take advantage of distressed opportunities that we believe will be popping up in the next 12 to 18 months. We are currently finalizing our projections for the next year by submarket and completing each of our budgets. We are not far enough along to give guidance, but given what I have seen so far, next year’s FFO will not have the same growth we are enjoying in 2008. Now I would like to turn the call over to John Eudy.
John D. Eudy:  We have had on new additions to the development pipeline during the quarter and I have the following updates on our activity. Belmont Station in Los Angeles has been substantially completed and was open for occupancy on August 8th. We continue to make significant leasing progress and have leased 155 units or 56% of the property to date. The Grand in Oakland is nearing completion on budget and scheduled for occupancy in January.  Our temporary leasing office will be open tomorrow and early indications are showing significant pre-leasing interest off of our website and phone bank. The building will be the only new luxury high rise rental community in its competitive market much like the Essex on Lake Merit was in Oakland when we completed it in May of 2002. As you may recall we experienced a six month lease-up of 270 units in the post 9-11 dot com era meltdown period prior to the economic rebound which began in 2003.  I would expect the same type of market acceptance on the Grand. The remainder of the development pipeline and construction is on budget or less than the estimated development budget and slightly ahead of delivery time outlined in the S9 supplemental. We have added no pre-development projects or land held for future development during the quarter. On the pre-development projects we have in our pipeline all are currently leased at rates substantially below market rents and we have the flexibility to extend the leases or release should we desire to do so and extend our anticipated current scheduled start date. On land acquisition activity, we continue to be actively engaged in the market and are attempting to take advantage of any overreaction to the current economic climate and add to our land pre-development pipeline for 2014 and later deliveries. With a time frame from the site identification to delivery between five and six years in our supply constrained markets the best time to contract to acquire land is counter cyclical to positive economic news. It is probably fair to say that right now we have that in our favor when we are talking to land sellers. Compounding the situation for land sellers is the fact that development and land financing is virtually impossible to obtain now but for the most well financed companies and developers. For the time being the error of speculative merchant developers in our space is over. Construction costs has continue to go in our favor in contract buyouts on the deals we are currently building. We are seeing real time traction beating our budgets and expect to see that and continue to be the wind at our sails at least for the next 12 months. With oil now balancing around $65 per barrel, wood at a 30 year low and other construction related commodities following a downward spiral, that will translate into significant savings to our high cost budgets going forward. On the labor side of the equation, I have never seen a more competitive market with general and sub-contractors in my 30 years in the business. The infrastructure of individual talent and companies built up during the home building boom of the last six years is at our disposal for a very limited number of construction activity starts on the rental development market. We are getting the best of the best subs giving us both the competitive buyout situation as well as the most talented personnel which translates into more efficient productivity at the side level. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mike Schall.
Michael J. Schall:  Last night we reported another strong quarter operationally. As you may recall, our 2008 guidance originally assumed a second half economic recovery that clearly will not occur. Given that expectation we are pleased with the performance of the portfolio especially our ability to maintain strong occupancy levels throughout our critical summer leasing season.  During the quarter we experienced the following difficulties, overall sluggish employment growth especially in Southern California, localized supply issues in various submarkets including downtown Seattle, downtown Oakland and many Southern California submarkets and failed condo projects being rented as apartments. Partially offsetting these headwinds was a 24% reduction in move-outs to purchase a home. What does this mean? In the short term, weaker job growth and lease ups of a finite number of newly developed apartments and former condo projects will drive moderating multifamily fundamentals. However, longer term current trends will lead to a future point perhaps in 2010, where the coastal markets will experience a pervasive housing shortage.  Typically three things happen when rental market conditions soften, first more people double up. This is difficult to track directly although we have anecdotal evidence that it is beginning to happen particularly in Southern California. Second, is a compression between A and B rents. Most of the newly developed communities in the coastal markets, including our own are A quality property. For the most part they require more concessions than anticipated indicating compression in rents. In general, B quality properties near A quality lease ups are not doing well, but are less affected than the A’s. Finally, delinquency becomes a bigger issue. For the quarter same property delinquency actually declined although we are aware of the need to remain vigilant in our collection efforts. With strong occupancy throughout our markets we are well positioned for the seasonally weaker fourth quarter. Our results follow a similar pattern as previous quarters with better than expected strength in Northern California and Seattle offsetting moderate weakness in Southern California. During the third quarter Northern California led the way with an 8.4% same property revenue growth well above our guidance range for 2008 up 5.5 to 7%. Our Seattle same property revenue growth of 7.5% also exceeded the top end of the 2008 guidance range in this case by .5%. In Southern California our revenue growth of 1.1% fell below the guidance range of 1.5% to 3% for the first time this year. Conditions continue to deteriorate in Southern California due to greater supply and more job loss. Operating expenses grew at 3.9% for the quarter near the high end of our guidance range of 2.5% to 4%. Year-over-year expenses were influenced by large property tax reassessments in Seattle, higher utility costs and a couple of property specific issues. As stated previously, we expect property expenses to remain near the high end of our guidance range for the remainder of 2008. Earlier this year we completed the conversion of our property management and general ledger systems to [Yarde] and the rollout of 24 hour call center support at all of our properties. During the quarter we finished the initial implementation of Yield Star’s price optimizer software.  With [Yarde], call center and price optimizer conversions now in place we are pursuing ways to leverage these investments in the form of higher rents and lower costs. Same property concessions both in total and per unit turned declined during the third quarter. Most of this decline is due to the implementation of price optimizer which provides an array of net pricing options, in other words without concessions to the residents. Loss to lease which estimates the difference between market and in place rents without regard to concessions declined from 2.4% of scheduled rent in the second quarter of 2008 to 1.9% at September 30, 2008. The use of fewer concessions in Q3 resulted in lower economic rent contributing to the decline in loss to lease.  Now, I’d like to briefly review each major part of our portfolio starting in the northwest. The Boeing machinist strike has shut down production for several weeks. As of October 2008 approximately 2.2% of our Seattle properties were occupied by Boeing employees. Given that there is a tentative agreement to resolve the strike, we do not expect a significant impact at our Seattle communities.  Downtown Seattle softened this summer due to condo units reverting to the rental market and it is too early to determine the impact of the sale of Washington Mutual. During the quarter we completed the residential lease up of our East Lake at our Lake [inaudible], 127 unit property owned by Fund 2 consistent with our rent and absorption expectations. As of October 20, 2008 physical occupancy in Seattle was 96.4% and net availability was under 5%. Home purchase activity represented 14% of our move outs for the quarter compared to 17% a year ago. In northern California the overall market continues to be strong but has some pockets of weakness due to supply issues. An example of this is downtown Oakland. As of October 20, 2008 physical occupancy was 97.5% in our northern California portfolio with net availability under 4%. Home purchases represented 9.3% of our turns for the quarter compared with 13.8% from the same quarter a year ago. Now, to southern California. John noted that we commenced the lease up of our Belmont Station properties consisting of 275 units in downtown LA. Current rents average around $2.50 per square foot ignoring concessions which is close to our expectations. However, we’re using one to two months in concessions versus the half of month that was originally planned. We’re expecting stabilization by June, 2009.  Physical occupancy in southern California summarized as follows, in LA, Ventura, 95.6% physical occupancy, net availability of 6.1%. Orange county, occupancy 95.2%, net availability of 6.2%. In San Diego 97.2% physical occupancy with net availability of 5.2%. For our southern California combined move out activity attributable to home purchases was 7.7% for the quarter compared to 9.5% a year ago.  Now I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Dance.
Michael T. Dance : My comments today will briefly discuss the basis narrowing the range of our 2008 guidance and then I’ll highlight the activities that have strengthened our financial position, add ability to meet the 2009 and 2010 debt maturities and all commitments. After the $0.01 adjustment for the right off of unamortized loan costs related to the sale of Cardiff by the Sea, the third quarter funds from operations are in line with first call’s consensus estimate and the guidance we provided on the second quarter’s call. As Mike highlighted earlier we have maintained high occupancies throughout the portfolio and we are well positioned to replicate the same property revenue results achieved in September in to the fourth quarter. The midpoint of our FFO range for 2008 assumes that there will be modest revenue growth from the apartment communities in the non-same property results with the ongoing lease up activities at Belmont Station and from the communities in the redevelopment pipeline that are close to returning to stabilized occupancy. The midpoint of the 2008 guidance assumes that short-term interest rates will continue their recent downward trends as the Fed continues its bias of reducing interest rates to stimulate the economy. To achieve the high end of guidance we will need continued rental growth in our Northern California and Seattle markets, high occupancy in Southern California at current rent levels, lower volume costs on variable rate debt, and approximately $0.05 from a combination of increases in noncore income or expense reductions. I’ll now comment on our capital plans. It is important to note that it is an Essex discipline to match fund investment decisions with the cost of capital that generates positive arbitrage and accretion to cash flow per share. Accordingly, to meet this match funding objective it has been the capital plan to fund the development commitments of almost $300 million and redevelopment commitments of $55 million with a combination of common equity, construction loans, forward-starting swaps, the unsecured and secured line facilities, and with Fund II’s institutional limited partners. Accordingly, we have raised approximately $140 million in equity by selling common stock at an average price of $120 per share; we have started three mortgage applications with Freddie and Fannie which are expected to raise an additional $100 million before the end of the year; we have construction loans in place to fund approximately $100 million of the development commitments in Fund II or in joint ventures; and we have made the final capital call for Fund II institutional investors of over $30 million. As highlighted in our press release, the new secured line facility of Freddie Mac will increase our borrowing capacity from $100 million to $150 million before the end of 2008. Currently we intend to exercise our option to extend the $200 million of secured bank facility so that it will mature in March 2010. As we plan for the 2010 debt maturities we have the ability to expand the new Freddie secured facility by $100 million to $250 million. W e also have significant borrowing capacity from our 2009 and 2010 maturities. These secured loans that mature in 2009 and 2010 were originally underwritten with 1999 and 2000 rents and have had 10 years of principal payments. Using the current underwriting practices of Freddie and Fannie we expect that the refinancing proceeds from 2009 and 2010 maturities will generate enough additional funds to pay off the mortgage balance and also retire our exchangeable bond obligation. We also have approximately $400 million in forward-starting swaps as a hedge in the event long-term interest rates are significantly higher when these mortgages are refinanced in 2010. In summary, these capital activities are expected to leave us with close to $100 million in cash and marketable securities and over $300 million in line and construction loan capacity by year end with only $25 million in 2009 debt maturities. This capital plan provides us the needed resources to finance our active developments and provide sufficient flexibility to fund future opportunistic investments. This concludes my remarks. I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: John, can you just talk about where pricing is today on some of the land opportunities you’ve been looking at versus where say it was three to six months ago? And also, have there been any further changes to what you’d be targeting on the development side from a yield perspective or is the mid-6 range still a fair assessment there?
John D. Eudy: First on land prices, they probably peaked when the condo urban guys were active in the markets two and a half years ago maybe. At that time we were boxed out. We hadn’t contracted any land in our pipeline for well over three years. My range would be between $100,000 and $150,000 at door for land was being contracted at that time and up. Currently there have not been a lot of transactions to look at so it’s difficult to gauge but I can tell you we are in negotiations on deals where we had fished around we’ll call it $1 and now we’re offering $0.50 and we’re getting a response. Where it all settles out I can’t say because we haven’t really done a deal yet in the range that makes sense. With that in combination with there’s going to be some retraction on these hard costs that we saw go up 100% over five to six years, we expect our development yields that we’re targeting are in the mid-7 range on current yield.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Keith, as you guys look at where cap rates appear to be headed and the potential for additional stress in the market, have you moved any further down the path of considering a Fund III today?
Keith R. Guericke: Fund 3 is an ongoing conversation. We have not made any more commitment than we spoke about on the last call. It’s something that we’re very interested in. We are cognizant of the benefits of it. I think the reality is many of the potential investors out there are suffering from the denominator effect so the ability to go out and be aggressive to raise a fund is problematic. Having said that, it’s on our radar.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Mike Dance, the equity you guys issued during the quarter, was that done through some sort of drip? I just don’t recall ever seeing any press releases or SEC filings about it or anything like that. Separately can you also just touch on the expected pricing of the mortgage applications you mentioned that are in with Fannie and Freddie?
Michael T. Dance: About a year and a half ago we had a prospectus supplement with a Cantor Fitzgerald control equity offering and that is the vehicle we used to raise the common equity. Current pricing from Freddie and Fannie continue between $115 and $120 debt service coverage and we’re seeing anywhere between $225 and $260 in spreads depending on the quality of the security.
Operator: Our next question comes from Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Investment Research.
Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Investment Research: Tenants. Can you provide a little bit more color in terms of any kind of consolidation you’re seeing? Do you have figures around any increases in unit occupancy?
Michael J. Schall: As I said on the call, it’s all anecdotal at this point in time. We don’t have that information. I know that historically we started tracking it in Northern California in the late 90s. That was the last time it was relevant and it’s not something we track on an ongoing basis. So I don’t have any hard statistical information. Anecdotally, again Southern California has more double ups. If it becomes a greater factor, if we think that our occupancies in general are suffering because of it, we will start tracking it but we haven’t seen that need at this point in time.
Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Investment Research: Did you talk about delinquencies?
Michael J. Schall: I did and I noted that during the quarter our delinquencies are down year-over-year.
Analyst for Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Investment Research: Obviously there are some expenses that are fairly unpredictable going into next year, but what kind of initiatives are you taking to potentially control tax increases?
Michael J. Schall: Most of our taxes are already controlled by Prop 13. Most of our portfolio is in California and Prop 13 limits California reassessment to 2% in general. I think most of our property tax exposure is limited because of Prop 13. In Seattle less so but we think that we had a big increase in assessed value last year which resulted in the property tax increases that we saw go through the quarter or really all this year. So I think it’ll be less substantially next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to follow up on the question on distress opportunities. Given the competitive nature of capital and where returns are today in perhaps other areas whether it’s debt at large, but where do you think returns will have to go in order to again raise that capital that you mentioned in there today? A further question on that is, would you anticipate raising liquidity on your own balance sheet, meaning sell assets today because Freddie and Fannie are still providing capital and you can sell at low cap rates and would you deploy that 12 to 18 months down the road?
Keith R. Guericke: I think that the kinds of returns that investors are going to need in a front format are going to be in the high teens or low 20s, just expectations and alternative opportunities. I think that drives that. With respect to our own balance sheet, we sold the Cardiff by the Sea which was a very good asset and a very good market and basically it was an asset that we’d only held for a short time but the reasoning behind that was we were going to do a rehab project on it. Then about a year ago as you’ll recall our share price had dropped down to around $90 or just slightly under $90 and we thought it would be a better use of those proceeds to sell that asset and buy our shares back. As we all know, real estate’s not quite as liquid as our shares are so it took us about six or seven months to do that and by the time we got that transaction done our share prices were back up around $120. So we used those exchange dollars really to buy the property up in Seattle which was at a much better cap rate than we sold the Cardiff transaction by. Beyond that we’re sort of cleaning up some of our lesser projects down in San Diego that we acquired in the [Sachs] merger. I think right now what’s happening is that people who are actually selling are those who are in distress and started to sell into a distressed market. Unless we thought we could do substantially better, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense, and the other probably that we have is that many of our assets have low bases so we have to finalize in exchange a 1031 exchange within identification period within 45 days. So we don’t have the luxury of sitting on those proceeds for 18 months to wait for better times. I think what we’re going to do is look at either joint ventures or hopefully a Fund III or if we have opportunities at $120 if we ever see that again to look at our own share price or our own equity. Those are the kinds of things I think we’re going to use to take advantage of the future.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Switching back to markets, the Pacific Northwest is specifically Seattle and then I guess San Francisco, can you give us a sense of with NOI growth really having been stronger than expected year-to-date, how much of a deceleration are you anticipating perhaps over the next six to nine months? Are you looking for levels to drop in half from here? Do you think that they go flat similar to where Southern California is?
Keith R. Guericke: I think we’re in the process of analyzing our various submarkets and in the process of doing budgets. Clearly we’re not going to have the [effacle] growth we had this year but I think Northern California and Seattle are probably going to drop to the 3% to 4% range and so we’re still going to have decent positive growth in those two markets.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Why do you think you’ve still got some modest growth versus say the period after 2001?
John D. Eudy: I can comment on that. The period after 2001 was extraordinary. I think we lost in terms of job losses 200,000 jobs approximately in Santa Clara County alone which was about 10% of the workforce. So those were incredible never-to-occur-again type of statistics. I don’t think that we see anything that’s remotely like that this time around. Again, there was a huge bubble you’ll recall Y2K, dot com explosion and then busting; those were extraordinary events. Again I don’t see any parallels to that at all. John Lopez, do you agree with that?
John Lopez: That sounds right to me.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: On the concessions, I noticed that they were actually down in Southern California. Can you actually explain that given the pressures you’re seeing in that market?
Michael J. Schall: I did comment on that. The comment was that with respect to our pricing model since we’re using a price optimizer piece of software, it generates an array of net prices. Not to say we can’t offer a concession but it tends to focus on a net pricing type model as opposed to a gross plus a concession. It’s really a function of the price optimizer software. The offset to that obviously is that economic rents are lower because our economic rents don’t include the net effect of a concession so the tradeoffs were lower concessions but also lower economic rents.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: And at the same time, what are you seeing from your competitors? What are the concessions like in the market now?
Michael J. Schall: We’ll go to the new product of the market. There’s quite a bit of lease up activity throughout Southern California. We’re seeing in those transactions one to two months. That includes our downtown L.A. project as well. So pretty significant concession activity on all of the lease ups. Less so, typically half a month to a month on areas that do not have any lease up if any concession at all. Again, the net effect of rent sometimes does not include a concession. You just go with a lower coupon rent.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Michelle Coe] - UBS Securities.
[Michelle Coe] - UBS Securities: I believe you said earlier that you expect next year’s FFO will not have the same growth as in ’08. I just wanted to clarify a little bit about what you said earlier. Do you anticipate FFO to grow in ’09?
Michael T. Dance: What I said was we’re in the process of getting our budgets together and finalizing our projections for 2009. We aren’t in a position to give guidance. I was just signaling that you should not expect a 10% growth again. I will leave it at that but we aren’t in a position to give guidance at this moment.
[Michelle Coe] - UBS Securities: I was also wondering if you could talk some more about the sale process for Coral Gardens, what kind of cap rate it sold for and if you can give us a sense of how some of the cap rates have moved over the last three months for A versus ESS?
Michael J. Schall: It’s difficult to give you market information because there isn’t a very large market. As I’ve said, that asset is an asset that is sort of in a market that we’re not particularly happy with and the asset’s an older asset that we would like to just get rid of. The cap rate on that is probably about a 6 which is higher than we’ve seen in a long time. In fact it actually might be slightly higher than that. But it’s an asset that we think we can get rid of at this point and use the proceeds more productively somewhere else. There’s just not a lot of activity in those market places right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just to follow up on Jay’s question regarding required returns. You said fund investors are looking for high teens to low 20s today. How does that compare to return expectations that you guys have when you’re buying today? Can you just talk about how you get to those returns given where you’re pricing you’re buying say the two assets you bought this quarter?
Michael J. Schall: It’s very similar. Frankly what we look from a REIT perspective is we try to three things when we buy or develop a new asset and then [inaudible]: Be accretive to FFO, be accretive to our growth rate and be accretive to NAV. We don’t spend as much time looking at IRRs as maybe our outside investors’ partners would. Having said that, if you were to do the IRR calculations on the types of transactions, as you will notice last year we did almost $400 million of acquisitions. So far this year we’ve done about $80 million. So the reality is we’ve become much more selective and to find those kinds of returns is very difficult. The answer is we’re trying to find very similar kinds of returns even though we’re looking at slightly different metrics and there are very few of those transactions in the market. We think that things will get better. I shouldn’t say get better because that’s a double-edged sword but we think that those opportunities will provide themselves in the near future and we will have some. What we’re doing internally is very consistent with that.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: The next question is just regarding the Southern California submarkets. Did your ranking of the health of submarkets change at all? I think San Diego was near the top last quarter and Ventura was down the list. Is that still the same outlook?
Michael J. Schall: I would say that San Diego remains at the top. Ventura sort of started having its difficulties sooner and it has worked through many of those difficulties. As you’ll recall it had pretty significant layoffs at Am Gen and Countrywide so the market has worked through significant amounts of those. So I’d put them and L.A. County sort of number two and then I think Orange County is the weakest at this point.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: The next question is on your dividend. I know you’ve got a pretty low payout ratio. Are you guys still hovering close to the minimum payout ratios to maintain your REIT status? Will you guys need to grow your dividend next year?
Michael T. Dance: No. We have some room. Taxable income is about $30 million less than our current dividend.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Final question on WaMu. I know you said it’s a little early to know what the impact is. Do you know what percentage of your residents are employed by WaMu?
Michael J. Schall: I don’t know. We have not tracked that historically.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky.
Michael Salinsky: Keith, I know you haven’t finished the budget for 2009 and I know you’re not giving guidance, but given what you’re seeing right now, what’s your gut feeling? Is this a shorter term pullback or is this more of a prolonged downturn here?
John Lopez: Given what’s going on our outlook is that it’s going to be a very difficult job formation in 2009 through at least the first three quarters. Probably the duration is [inaudible] to five quarters on weak economic growth.
Michael J. Schall: We think it will get better into the summer next year but we won’t really see strong improvement until the end of next year.
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: I noticed on your development pipeline [90 Archer] is now marked for sale. Is that a fourth quarter transaction or is that a next year transaction?
John D. Eudy: [Inaudible] fourth quarter.
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Will there be any gains on that?
John D. Eudy: Yes.
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: I believe your marketing an asset from the Fund. Is that a next year event?
John D. Eudy: We have put an asset out for the fund to market. At this point in time it’s not in contract so I don’t know that it will sell. If we don’t get a price that makes sense for us, we will pull it off the market.
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: You talked in the past that you’re bias was still towards Northern California and Seattle. Just given what you’re seeing with the developments in Seattle, WaMu and the Boeing situation, has that changed in any way?
Michael J. Schall: I don’t think so. The reality is all these markets are cyclical and as Southern California continues to get beat up, John had talked earlier about some of the land prices that he’s seen come down. Some of that’s in Southern California so opportunities are going to come up. It’s difficult at this point in time to see which market is the best cyclical advantage but frankly if you look forward, Boeing is still going to be very strong. It’s got a hu8ge backlog on the Dreamliners. Microsoft is still going strong. We’re expecting Seattle to continue to be fairly strong at least through next year. Northern California as Mike said, this is very different than the 2001/2002 implosion we had here. We’ve lost very few jobs year-to-date compared to losing 200,000 jobs back there. So this market still has got legs. As I mentioned in my comments, we’ve got the formation of new ventures and new companies and we’ve got a great venture capital foundation here. So I think these are still the obvious markets but there’s going to be a point in time where things get so cheap in Southern California that it does open up and we continue to monitor that but frankly I haven’t seen it yet though
Operator:  Your next question comes from Lindsey E. Yao – Robert W. Baird & Co.
Lindsey E. Yao – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Related to the commercial I guess employment, you mentioned something about the 2.2% occupied by Boeing employees. Do you have an idea of how much of the overall portfolio is leased with commercial or corporate contracts?
Michael J. Schall : We do not generally like the corporate business and so it’s not a big percentage, it’s less than 5% of the portfolio in general. It’s not something that we focus on and it’s a very small percentage.
Lindsey E. Yao – Robert W. Baird & Co.: I guess with that, it’s a very small percentage but have you seen any trends so far with employers coming back to you saying, “You know what we’re going to have to cut back?” at all.
Michael J. Schall : I know that’s a good leading indicator, we have not seen that yet. But again, I don’t think we have enough of those units to really be a good barometer on what is happening there.
Lindsey E. Yao – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Then just looking at the new supply in Seattle, sorry if I missed this but can you just give some more color on the nature of that supply that’s coming online?
John D. Eudy : There’s two nodes where the supply is coming on line. Over the next 18 months is downtown where there’s approximately 2,000 to 2,500 coming online. A majority of that is condo conversion and there’s a similar number in downtown Bellevue over the next 18 months and there’s two or three large high rise projects that have 500 plus that were originally intended to be condos. We think those will all go apartments. Those will probably burn off and supply will begin to decrease at the end of ‘010. 
Keith R. Guericke : Those are high end units and they’re all going to be, the rents to make those things work and I frankly don’t know what the construction costs are because we didn’t do any of them but I know they’re high end and if they were being built in any normal market which that market is very similar to most of the California markets they’ve got to be $550,000 to $700,000 per unit so the rent that they have to get are very high. Frankly, most of our product up there is B plus A minus kind of product so we don’t think it’s going to have any absolute direct competition with us.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: If you could explain this to me in just like a sentence or two because I still don’t know that I get it entirely. You raised your guidance or low end of your guidance to effectively raise your guidance and then you didn’t get the second half recovery that you originally planned. Could you just explain? Is it just that you had better than you expected performance in your core markets? What was it that made that happen or was it just sort of a wide range to begin with?
Michael J. Schall : Offsetting the not obtaining the second half growth in rents that we were expecting has been a windfall in short term interest rates. We’re really benefitting from the variable rate demand notes that we have on our low income where we have below market rate rents.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: That got you $0.20 of guidance?
Michael J. Schall : Historically we’ve paid about 4.5% to 5% on those mortgages so take $250 million and we’re paying about 3.5% so almost 200 basis points on $250 million.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: The next question is on the lack of transaction activity, Keith and I guess all of you kind of referenced, does that to you illustrate – I guess it does illustrate that there aren’t stressed sellers out there and that is good in a sense that there’s not this situation where you have sort of a problematic environment from a debt maturity or debt expiration perspective. But, do you see that on the horizon? Do you see mom and pop owners of real estate that are going to be faced with some debt maturity, debt expirations in the next couple of years? Are you monitoring those types of situations?
Keith R. Guericke : Yes, there’s sort of two issues, one is those properties that put five year bullets on essentially three to four years ago, that’s stuff we’re looking at and then sort of the other pocket that we think there’s going to be some opportunities in – well, there’s two other pockets, one pocket is there were a number of private rehabbers, they were fairly prominent and they were looking at pretty high octane transactions and used a lot of leverage. I think a number of those guys are going to face IRR clocks or just loans that mature here the next couple of years that they’re going to have pain because they had way too much leverage. I don’t think the moms and pops are going to be in trouble because the guys that went out and just put on normal Fannie Mae loans at 50% and 60%, maybe even 70% had rent growth in those last few years. The only ones that are going to be in real trouble are the ones that way over levered. I think that’s a potential opportunity. The last one is there are a number of condo developers that built projects that have sold nothing so we don’t have to look at a broken condo but they’re just upside down. They can’t sell, their equity is gone, maybe the mez is gone. We’re talking to construction lenders that might have to take a haircut to get out. I think there’s the opportunity and the issue is whether or not we can get the price to a point where it works as a rental.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So in ’09 in a period where it will be sort of tough fundamentally you can actually see a good chunk of acquisitions if things align themselves right?
Keith R. Guericke : Yes, I think that’s a true statement.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Just two quick follow ups, are you seeing any people materially going out and renting foreclosed homes in your markets?
John D. Eudy : Absolutely. It represents competition in several of our submarkets. Fortunately, we don’t have a lot of property in the inland empire, that would be ground zero for trying to compete, have a two bedroom unit competing against a three bedroom home at very reduced rents. Sacramento Valley, the same phenomena. So, it’s less the case in the coastal markets but still a factor in a number of places. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: But it’s not the individual like one bedroom person that’s going to live in a tree line street and watch kids playing hopscotch, right?
John D. Eudy : No, no. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: It’s a family?
John D. Eudy : It tends to be, even within the coastal market it tends to be the more outlying of the coastal markets. If someone in San Francisco doesn’t have that option, Palo Alto doesn’t have that option, Santa Clara County for the most part doesn’t. But, there are some properties, again not the core of our portfolio that are closer to the more outlying areas and they have a greater impact. Again, it goes right back to what Keith said which is look at where the foreclosure activity is the greatest and that is where you’re going to see the greatest impact from rental competition.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Lastly, are you seeing people move from Class A to your properties? Are you seeing that sort of type of traffic?
John D. Eudy : It’s hard to track that. We think anecdotally we think that is happening as people become more price sensitive and try to focus on improving their personal balance sheets, pay back a little bit of credit and they can obviously do so if they go in to more affordable properties. We also mentioned there’s a number of submarkets that there’s a significant amount of new product being delivered, it tends to be very high end and probably pushes that segment of the rental market beyond what it would have historically been pushed and as a result of that I think we are going to see pretty significant discounting of the As and that will inure to the benefit of the Bs.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of [Hanwell St. Jess] – Green Street Advisors.
[Hanwell St. Jess] – Green Street Advisors: To follow up I guess on an unrelated question, are you seeing any pressure from your investors to sell assets given what’s going on with asset pricing in the market and the broader economy?
Keith R. Guericke : No, we’ve just had meetings with our investors this last summer and we talked about the markets and what’s going on and basically in the current fund we’ve got about three years left plus a couple of extensions so this downturn we don’t think it’s going to last forever and clearly we think we’ve got plenty of time coming out at the other end to still execute and make the right decisions.
[Hanwell St. Jess] – Green Street Advisors: Are you adjusting expectations, what I initially believe were high teens, return expectations?
Keith R. Guericke : We have not adjusted those expectations for the long term. I think that a number of those assets were bought early and we had good cap rates going in and we’ve gotten some great rental growth and great NOI growth in the assets that are in that fund. I think we’re going to be just fine if we sit tight and execute at the right time.
[Hanwell St. Jess] – Green Street Advisors: To follow up on an earlier question, I didn’t quite hear the answer and I guess I was just looking for more color on change in asset pricing that you feel has occurred specifically more in the last 30 to 60 days given your activity in the marketplace?
Keith R. Guericke : Again, I think you’re right, I didn’t answer that specifically and partly because I don’t know. There has not been a lot of transactions as somebody had mentioned earlier. We had a fund asset that was listed, as of today we haven’t received a price that is acceptable to us so clearly prices in the market place are down. I would guess that B product is in the 5.75 to 6.25 range in most of our markets today. A year ago that would have been at least 100 basis points less so I think that’s kind of the range of where things are at.
[Hanwell St. Jess] – Green Street Advisors: One last question, can you give us a sense or maybe quantify your pricing power between new leases, people coming in the door and renewals?
Michael J. Schall : I think in this world the two are becoming closer and closer to one because everyone does for example a lot of Craigslist type advertising and information, rental information is so available via the Internet that your ability to have significant difference between new pricing and renewal pricing is pretty limited. I guess it depends on the circumstance a bit but we’re seeing a sort of tightening of that relationship as time goes on. I think that continues. I don’t see a big difference between the two.
Operator:  At this time there are no further questions in the queue. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining today’s conference. This concludes the presentation you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-07-31 12:00:00) =====
Executives: Keith Guericke - President and CEO John Eudy - EVP - Development Mike Dance - EVP and CFO Mike Schall - SEVP and COO John Lopez - Economist
Analysts: Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities  Alex Goldfarb - UBS  Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets David Toti - Citigroup Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Paula Poskon - Robert Baird Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2008 Essex Property Trust earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Keith Guericke, President and CEO. You may proceed, sir.
Keith Guericke: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. This morning, we'll be making some comments in the call which are not historical facts, such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results, and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC; we encourage you to review them. Joining me today on the call will be Mike Schall, Mike Dance and John Eudy. Again, we are going to try and keep our comments short so that we are all going to speak. Included in the earnings release on our website, you'll find our market forecast for 2008. These forecasts are unchanged from the previous quarter. Also included with the earnings release is a schedule entitled "New Residential Supply" which includes total residential permit activity for the larger US metros as well as information on median home prices and affordability, as compared to the markets that we operate in. A note of interest, single-family permits for our combined markets, the Essex markets are down approximately 40% from the same quarter in 2007. This represents about 0.4% of existing stock. Multi-family is approximately the same. In order to get those details, you can visit our website under Investors and Media. Last night, we reported another strong quarter with core FFO increasing 11.7% per share. For the quarter, the portfolio grew revenues 5.1% greater than the same quarter in '07 and 1.3% on a sequential basis. Again, I think the strong performance just demonstrates the fundamentals of our supply-constrained markets. In the second quarter of 2008, we saw some signs of stabilization in our California existing home sales markets. Even though prices were down 21%, and transactions were down 20% from the previous year; however, we track movement from quarter-to-quarter, and the traditional seasonal increase Q2 over Q1 was much stronger this year, and Q2 '08 transactions in our markets were up sequentially 50% over Q1 '08. Last year, in the same period the seasonal increase was only 8%. Lower prices are inducing transactions, albeit below historical levels. We think this is important because the increased transaction level indicates the confidence by the consumer that we are nearing the bottom of the price decline. Going to each of the markets; in Seattle and Northern California, the economies are doing well with the exception of the Oakland MSA where the outlying areas are more heavily affected by the decrease in the housing jobs. The apartment markets in both Seattle and Northern California have performed at or above expectations through the first half of '08 with occupancy rates well above 95%. And rent growth at 10% for Northern California and 7.8% in Seattle for the second quarter. These two markets continue to be the two best rental markets in the country. Southern California, as of June, year-over-year job growth across the region remains weak. We are seeing signs that the weakest sectors are beginning to stabilize. As we stated last quarter, the cuts in the housing sector occurred at a much more rapid pace than anticipated and we believe the worst of the cuts, the big cuts are behind us. Now going to each of the markets and I've sort of lumped these by (inaudible) and Ventura and Orange are the markets where we've had the greatest issues. The Ventura and Orange County markets experienced disproportionately high growth in the home financing jobs, with the housing bubble that started in late 2001 and 2002. The job losses in the home finance sector began in early 2006 and accelerated in the second half of '07. Again, we believe the worst losses have already occurred as of June jobs in the sector are back to the late 2001 levels. We expect these job markets will stabilize going forward and single-family supply will continue to decline to even lower levels. We don't expect to see significant job losses from a multiplier effect because the home finance sector does not have significant sub-industries that feed it. Going to Los Angeles, home financing jobs were also cutback in LA, and are back to late 2002 levels. However, in LA, the bubble in the sector was much smaller relative to the market's economy. By comparison, over the last 12 months, home financing jobs are down 6.5% of the sector's total; however, this is only 0.1% of the total jobs in LA. LA has also seen a large reduction in residential construction jobs; however, these have primarily been in North LA County which has little direct impact in downturn, West LA and Long Beach where our portfolio primarily is located. Manufacturing jobs have been the biggest drag on the economy, and we see signs of improving conditions in this sector in the first half of '08 relative to '07. Finally, San Diego, this economy has outperformed the rest of the Southern California for the last 18 months. It had considerable job losses relative to construction, home construction, that's primarily behind us; however, San Diego is a much smaller exposure to the home financing jobs and heavy manufacturing. Manufacturing jobs are flat year-over-year and this trend is continuing. They've had strength in the bioscience and other technology sectors and that's clearly helped the San Diego market. The market occupancy has remained above 95% and above levels from the same period last year. Generally, we come in on cap rates. We continue to see softness there, although the number of transactions has been significantly smaller than typical. It is difficult to get a real fix on what cap rates are based on transactions. However, we would estimate that cap rates have probably slipped another 25 basis points moving across the board in each of our markets. So, for [AB] products, in the Bay area, we think that the spread is somewhere between 4.5 for the best and 5.75 for the B. Southern California, the spread is probably 100 basis points, 475 to 575 and Seattle 4.5 to 5.75. With that information, I will turn the call over to John Eudy.
John Eudy: Thank you, Keith. Our active development pipeline, including Fund II transactions, is comprised of eight developments under construction are 658 units, $622 million. We are about halfway through the construction process, completion and delivery operations will occur fairly equally at the rate of about 200 million a year over the next three years, consistent with our strategic plan. During the quarter, we have added to the active development pipeline, Joule Broadway 295 units in Seattle and Tasman Place, 284 units in Sunnyvale. On the remaining active development projects, I have the following to report: Eastlake 2851 in Seattle is now substantially complete and 94% leased as of yesterday, right on plan. Belmont Station in Los Angeles, last quarter we expected to begin occupancy in July and disappointed to report that occupancy will slip into the first half of August and possibly as early as next week. We've previously reported that due to partnership capital defaults from the prior developer, we became the developer after construction started. In retrospect, we did not fully understand the extent, the plans were not coordinated properly and we underestimated the transition issues when we took over the developer role. Our people in the field have risen to the occasion and we are almost done. To-date, I am extremely pleased with the pre-leasing team and the lease activity to date. For 79 days, since we opened, we have 98 leases or over one-third of the development leased and ready to occupy. As an abundance of caution, we have moved our stabilization date to June 2009. If we continue to lease at the current rate, we will beat that date significantly. The balance of the other active development projects, including the Grand in Oakland, Fourth Street in Berkeley,, Studio 40-41 in Studio City, and Cielo in Chatsworth are on time and on budget to-date, consistent with prior quarters reporting. On predevelopment activities, we have chosen to be defensive on our Essex-Hollywood transaction and we extended the lease with our tenant through July 2009, thereby delaying our anticipated start date. The Cadence transaction in San Jose and the Main Street in Walnut Creek developments are both on track and pending construction start in January 2010. In our Supplemental S-9, we have noted two joint ventures. Both transactions include money partners having equal equity investments with us, unlike Belmont Station where the developer from the (inaudible) do not expect to have any kind of issues like we have experienced on Belmont Station since we are driving the transaction from day one. There are no other changes on the land held for development from last quarter. One note on the recent spike in oil, we've seen additional pressure in metals and other oil-based materials such as asphalt and plastics. However the labor side of the equation has been very, very competitive, more than I've seen in the last 15 years. The offset to materials costs have netted out to annualized construction cost increases of less than 10% which we have already built into our modeling. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Schall.
Mike Schall: Thanks, John. And thanks everyone for joining us today. Before discussing the quarter, I want to report that Essex sustained no damage from the earthquake that was centered in Chino Hills area of Southern California on Tuesday. Now on to the quarter. Despite the housing gloom and doom stories out there that you heard, we had another strong quarter operationally. Long-term current conditions all seem to point to lower supply of both rental and for-sale housing which is good for Essex. In the short-term operating conditions remain good in southern California and very strong in Northern California in Seattle. The summer is our peak leasing season and therefore is critically important to us and we remain well positioned for the remainder of 2008. During the second quarter, Northern California led the way with 10% Same-Property revenue growth well above our 2008 guidance of 5.5% to 7%. Our Seattle revenue growth also exceeded the top end of the 2008 guidance range in this case by 0.8%. In Southern California, our revenue growth remained near the top of the guidance range which was 1.5% to 3% and we continue to have the same challenges that were discussed on prior calls, largely related to localized supply or job loss issues. Still it appears that recent shocks at Countrywide and Amgen for example are not getting worse and management is effectively working through those challenges. Operating expenses grew at 3.6% for the quarter near the high-end of the guidance range of 2.5% to 4%. Year-over-year expenses were influenced by a couple of property specific issues and the impact of new initiatives including Level 1 and YieldStar. We recall that our guidance included large property tax reassessments at many of our Seattle properties which have contributed to their expense growth. The 2.5% sequential increase in expenses reflects the cost that I just referred to plus the seasonal increase in turnover which ran at a 42% annualized rate in the first quarter and increased to 56% in the second quarter. We expect operating expenses to remain near the high-end of our guidance range for the remainder of 2008. During the quarter, we completed our conversion of our property management and general ledger system to Yardi, in addition we now have 24-hour call center support for all of our properties. We note that typically 30% to 40% of our calls come in after hours or while the staff is otherwise unavailable, so the call center support is very effective. We continue our implementation of the YieldStar's Price Optimizer software and it's running at 70 properties up from 24 reported on last quarters call. Loss to lease which estimates a difference between market and in-place rents without regard to concessions rebounded at the end of the second quarter to 2.4% of rental income versus 0.9% reported for the first quarter. Most of this change was attributable to firming rents in Southern California as compared to the discounting that was required to hold occupancy in the first quarter. Overall in Southern California, we reported positive loss to lease of $1.8 million at June 30, 2008 versus negative loss to lease of $3.5 million at March 31, 2008. Our actions to maintain occupancy in the first quarter allowed us to be more aggressive in the second quarter, resulting in higher rent levels and a 50 basis point increase in sequential occupancy. Now, I would like to provide some additional facts on each major part of our portfolio starting in the Northwest. All markets surrounding and including Seattle are strong. We continue to carefully watch the supply picture particularly in Bellevue, although job growth has been sufficient to absorb new units. As of July 22nd our physical occupancy remains strong at 96.9% with net availability at 4.1%. Home purchase activity represented 15.8% of move outs for quarter compared to 21.5% a year ago. In Northern California, as before, all sub-markets performing well, although the East Bay has greater supply issues and more fall out from the problems in for-sale housing.  Again, for Northern California as of July 22nd, physical occupancy was 97.2%, net availability of 3.7%. Home purchases declined substantially. They were only 8.3% of our turns for the quarter compared to 19.7% a year ago. Southern California obviously is a huge area and there are considerable variations in results based on property location, the Inland Empire has by far the greatest difficulties with combination of more supply and too many more or less more transient jobs, like for example construction jobs. Fortunately, we have a very small presence there. Our view is that San Diego, Los Angeles and Ventura counties improved marginally during the quarter and in Orange County conditions were effectively unchanged. Overall, I believe that our operations group did a very good job of implementing an occupancy-based pricing strategy during the first quarter, which positioned us to firm rents in the second quarter. Physical occupancy as of July 22nd, 2008, LA Ventura was 95.5%, net availability at 6.3% in Orange County 95.8% physical occupancy, net availability at 5.6% and San Diego physical occupancy is 96.1%, net availability of 5.8%. For all of Southern California combined move out activity attributable to home purchase was 7% for the quarter versus 14.5% a year ago and that pretty much follows similar patterns no matter how you break that down by county. That concludes my comments. I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Dance. Thank you.
Mike Dance: Thanks, Mike. My comments today are intentionally brief to allow more time for the questions and answers that will follow. The strong June quarter results beat the First Call Consensus estimate for funds from operations by $0.02 a diluted share. The second quarter's results are very similar to the results we reported for the first quarter. Given the uncertainties in the economy and the volatility in interest rates we believe the results achieved this quarter are an appropriately conservative run rate for the results that can be expected for the remainder of 2008. The favorable second quarter results benefited from a decrease in the interest expense of $20.2 million in the first quarter of 2008 to $19.8 million for the second quarter. While the total debt increased by $80 million. The decrease of $400,000 in net interest expense reflects the additional interest expense of $900,000 from the mortgages originated in 2008, unless the increase in capitalized interest of $500,000 on the cost incurred for development communities. And the reduction in the weighted average interest rate of 5.6% to 5.4% during the second quarter. This reduction in interest rates reduced our borrowing cost by $800,000 which is attributable to the $400 million of variable rate debt as of June 30th which paid a weighted average interest rate of about 3.5%. We believe that the Fed will quickly increase short-term interest rates as soon as there are indications of a recovering economy to reduce inflationary pressures. If we continue to benefit from the current low interest rate environment with continued strong demand for housing in Northern California and Seattle, we are confident that we can beat the midpoint of our guidance. If there's a spike in short-term rates without the strong demand for rental housing, there's some risk we'll fall below the midpoint of our guidance. Except for the change to project the 2008 interest expense, we have no other significant changes to our 2008 guidance. Before I close my remarks I want to highlight some of the accomplishments achieved during the quarter. First, I want to recognize the finance team's success during the quarter as the company obtained approximately $70 million in secured 10-year debt financing by Freddie and Fannie. , They negotiated a five-year extension on the secured line and increased the line's borrowing capacity by $150 million, and arranged a $60 million construction loan from two of commercial banks that participate in our unsecured line. Given the liquidity concerns caused by the turmoil in the credit markets, we feel fortunate to have the financing partners with the resources and commitment to meet our ongoing capital needs. Next, I want to highlight the economic performance of our Value Fund II during the quarter. In our earnings supplement on S-11, the operating communities owned by the fund achieved year-over-year net operating income of 15%. Based on our economic research, we refocus our capital allocations from Southern California to the Bay Area and Seattle and this has proven to be the correct strategy. The ability of our fund acquisition and development teams to source value-added opportunities in supply-constrained markets has to date exceeded our high expectations. And lastly, I want to personally thank all of the employees in our information systems, accounting and property operations that this demonstrated outstanding team work and a willingness to work long hours to successfully complete the rollout of our new property management and accounting platform This concludes my remarks and I will turn the call back to the operator for question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo from Banc of America Securities. You may proceed.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Hey. Good afternoon or good morning to you guys. Keith has there been any change to your underlying same-store revenue growth assumptions?
Keith Guericke: No. I mean we guided down inventory accounting for last quarter and I think we outperformed our worst expectations, but we have left everything else in place.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Okay. So, how do you think about it then, I mean because the current range implies a pretty dramatic slowdown to about 2% in the second half. Is that just being overly cautious on your part or are you seeing anything and it sounds like you are not since you mentioned Southern California appears to have the worst behind us. Can you just help us think about that a bit?
Keith Guericke: You have been very kind; you haven't used the sandbagger word. Those who know us know that we've been generally pretty conservative, we never want to disappoint. And I think as Mike accurately described it is that we are being conservative this quarter and we probably could have tightened the range a little bit, but felt that even though we think that the worst of the job cuts are behind us and we don't see any storms in the horizon, I think that we feel good about where our guidance is and we certainly don't ever want to have to guide down half or re-guide up after we have guided down. So, we have been conservative and again it is just uncertainty in the future with respect to what the heck is going to go on.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Fair enough. Then as you think about the potential for interest rate spikes as you mentioned, when do you expect the Fed to first increase rates?
John Lopez: Well, that will be based mainly on recovery and what we are seeing in GDP growth, it was strong in the second quarter but disappointed in expectations, so until the housing drag is over which probably won't be for another couple quarters, it probably won't be a spike in the interest rates.
Keith Guericke: Those are the words of John Lopez, our Economist.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Okay. So you think that is more of an '09 event than 08.
Keith Guericke: Probably.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then just lastly, should we expect any onetime charges associated with the new line of credit in the fourth quarter?
Keith Guericke: No, the old line of credit is at the end of term. It expires in January. So we expect roll that out in the next couple of quarters here, so it won't be significant.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: All right. Perfect. Okay.
Keith Guericke: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from UBS. You may proceed.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Good morning.
Keith Guericke: Good morning, Alex.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Just going to the [E-Con] forecast, I am just comparing the jobs forecast that you have in your first quarter to the second quarter and essentially it looks the same although looking at the data the job situation seems to be getting worse. Can you just give us an update on what your thoughts are for leaving the forecast the same?
Mike Schall: Yes, Alex. Southern California, the year-over-year numbers look depressing and mainly because the losses were big in the second half of last year. So, we are expecting that those comparisons will get better as we go in line and that is why we are holding our forecast there. In San Jose, the industry jobs are down a bit, but if you look at the household survey the numbers are quite strong and so we think that given the possibility of correcting those numbers that were well within the guidance growth range in that area. So we consider it would be Oakland right now, the outlying areas is Oakland.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. Then moving to the new line, can you give us a comparison what the new pricing is relative to the existing pricing?
Keith Guericke: We're not going to disclose that until we have it finalized and we file our 8-K.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. The Hollywood office lease extension on that development site there, your decision to renew or extend the lease, what is the driver of that? Is that capital preservation? Are there other projects that would have come on line at that point? Is it entitlement issue? What is the driver?
Mike Schall: We have a tenant that has wanted to extend every year. They've been in the building for ten years. And the lease that we did with them and the extension is an accretive transaction, it gives us a bit of breathing room to wait out the market in Los Angeles area and we think the pricing on the buyout will get better over the next 12 months to 18 months. So we have made the selective decision to push it out.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. Then my final question is a two part development question. One if you can just let us know the yield impact of the cost increase on Belmont Station and the second part is as you guys continue to look at busted condo development sites, are you seeing any increased pressure or incentive for the existing developers who want to make a deal now versus earlier this year?
Mike Schall: On the impact of the construction increases for Belmont, it is about a 35% to 40%, a 40 point basis decrease in our expected yield on it. We are going to end up on that, and remember that is a bond deal, Alex. So there is a lot of accretion associated with bond financing. We are going to end up at about the 560 to 590 range on the stabilized yield. As far as the broken condo question, Keith you want to handle that.
Keith Guericke: Yes. We've had our acquisition guys are looking for those kinds of things and there are a number of transactions that we have looked at. Frankly, we've been looking at not the raw land as much as sort of deals that are truly either half constructed or completely done and unable to sale and frankly the developers generally don't have any equity and so you are really having to go back and negotiate with either the mez or the construction lenders. We have not been able to cut any deals yet. We have been very close on a couple of transactions, but I am seeing the pressure on the developers increase and as frankly every deal seems to get a little bit closer. So I have confidence here we're going to see some of those transactions come to fruition.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Habermann. You may proceed.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Hey , guys. Jay Habermann here. Just a question starting off in second half, I know you are being a bit more cautious. I am just curious. You mentioned in Southern California focusing a bit more on occupancy to stabilized rates, do you see that trend picking up a bit more back half of the year in terms of not being able to push rent growth as much?
Keith Guericke: I think that that has been the management philosophy or strategy in Southern California all year to hold occupancy and if your traffic patterns remain, typical as in prior years and we will benefit from that because we will not be starting off in a whole. So, I think Southern California still has some headwinds and as a result of that, I think we'll continue to be a defensive management approach. So it will be hold occupancy, I think we continue that for the rest of the year and likely into probably into early 2009.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Even holding occupancy you still have fairly big embedded gains to lease in certain markets particularly Northern California and Seattle?
Keith Guericke: Gains to lease?
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Loss to lease, sorry.
Keith Guericke: Yes, we do. Are you asking what does that mean for renewal pricing?
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: No. Just getting to your assumptions for the back half of the year you are being more cautious but it sounds that you still have some up sight embedded there?
Keith Guericke: Exactly. I think the rebound in loss to lease really paints a pretty strong picture because Southern California loss to lease at the end of Q1 where we were pretty much discounting to maintain occupancy. We had a gain to lease, a negative loss to lease at $3.5 million. That flipped around completely by the end of Q2 to where we had a real loss to lease of $1.8 million. So, clearly pricing firmed during the second quarter. Again, part of this is because we had relatively high occupancies. We made sure that we had relatively high occupancies coming out of the first quarter which positioned us for the second quarter. You all heard that we went through the physical occupancy numbers. So, after the end of the quarter, we are now two thirds of the way through our summer peak leasing season and occupancies have continued to be firm through the end of July. So all that seems to indicate that we are well positioned for the rest of the year and we will be able to push a little bit harder on rents and don't see real soft conditions where we're going to have to be very aggressive, as we were at the end of the first quarter.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Right And just going back to the other comment, Fed increasing interest rates. What are your expectations for cap rates over the next say six to nine months? Are you waiting on the sidelines for more opportunistic activities and does that in any way influence your timing of a new fund?
Keith Guericke: The answer is yes. Our acquisition goal for the year was $100 million which is very minimal. We haven't closed anything as of yet. We have got one very small transaction here in Northern California that is closing today, at a pretty significant cap rate better than we've seen in the past. We do think as pressure is put on the sellers then cap rates will improve. Unfortunately, this is a matching game as we all know and to the extent that our, interest rates go up or our stock price were to back up, have to match the FFO yield and the debt cost against the yields in the marketplace. So sometimes, cap rates going up significantly. Unless it goes up significantly, it is hard to make these transactions work. So, we're being very selective in trying to conserve our capital and use it wisely.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: In terms of uses of capital, just from weighing the benefits of development now versus acquisitions, given that we're seeing cap rates, in some cases move up closer to development yields. How does that then bias your decision?
Keith Guericke: Frankly, one of the things that we recognize here is that you can't get in and out of the business of development. We can be conservative as John said in Studio City. We leased that site for another year because we think costs are going to come down and that might help yields a little bit. So we can lighten up on the development, but we can't get out completely, but I would tell you that if cap rates move another 25 basis points, acquisition is going to be a very compelling investment alternative and we will push on the pedal for that. We will consider a Fund III.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning.
Keith Guericke: Good morning, Karin.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: One of your competitors talked about seeing some credit quality issues in Southern California, a couple of markets there. Have you guys seen similar type issues there?
Keith Guericke: I listened to one other call that was referring to that. No, we really don't see it. Those would typically be more the outlying areas, and our credit or delinquencies are running as low as they have for the last several years. So, we have seen no change in that. Where you would expect those changes would be once again in the Inland Empire where you are pushing up against affordability issues and a lot of job losses and those types of issues which tend to precede significant delinquency issues, but not an important factor in our portfolio.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Next question relates to dispositions. I think you guys had talked on the last call that you had some teed-up in Southern California and I think you targeted $100 million to $200 million for year. Can you just give us an update on that?
Keith Guericke: Sure. We have got three properties on the market, one in Seattle and two in Southern California. As we speak, there is some activity on all of them. We do not have contracts with contingencies removed and our policy has been not to report the stuff until it is done. So, there is activity. We would expect that at least a couple of those will get done before year-end which will probably be close to our target for the year.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That is helpful. Final question, it sounds like you guys economically are expecting an inflection point in the California economy in the home market late '08, early '09. Does that inflection point make you reconsider your current asset allocation that you guys did between Southern Cal and Northern Cal a few years ago?
Keith Guericke: I think we always are looking at that and part of our process is to approximately semiannually, John Lopez is here so he runs this process. He ranks our 30 something sub-markets by three-year rent growth potential. So, we are very focused on that, continue to run that. I don't think that we are ready to make a change at this point. However, some of the dynamics are beginning to change and we continue to evaluate that on an ongoing basis. So, I think for now we're happy with the prospects in Northern California and Seattle.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next caller comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. You may proceed.
David Toti - Citigroup: Hi. This is David Toti here with Michael Bilerman.
Keith Guericke: Did we hire, Michael?
David Toti - Citigroup: I don't know. I think we are still in New York.
Keith Guericke: We really like Michael to come work for us. He is great.
David Toti - Citigroup: Just a couple of questions, you guys have answered quite a few details today. As ground-up development becomes more challenging in the context of increasing supply and sort of [pin] uncertainty, do you see more of a focus on redevelopment and repositioning?
Keith Guericke: We have a separate group within the organization that does that, and we think it is an important part of what we do. Just taking a step back the macro picture is we believe in locations first and if you are going to be very, very selective as to locations which we are and you all know we are, then you have to have more flexibility with respect to what to do with product that is well located. So, we believe that redevelopment and acquisitions are all things that we have to do well, given our restrictive nature of where we buy or where we invest. So, I think that same dynamic applies. We look at all of the different options, we try to allocate capital very actively within the company and we try to find where the best yields of growth. Everything is benchmarked effectively against what did they do for FFO per share today, what is the impact on NAV per share, what is the impact on the growth rate of the portfolio? So, basically all transactions are sort of benchmarked against that backdrop. We will do any of those three execution options. . Clearly, redevelopment is in many cases the best. Sorry, that is maybe a little bit too general, but that is the way we approach it.
David Toti - Citigroup: That's helpful. Then just another big picture question, when you are thinking about the second half of the year and you are hedging your expected performance somewhat, are you growing increasingly concerned about unemployment or are you more concerned about supply issues?
Keith Guericke: I think it’s the macro economy that we are more concerned about. The nice thing about supply is you can pretty much plot them on a map and we have done that. So we know where the supply spreads are. You don't get surprised on that front or if you do, it is shame on you. The real uncertainty here is in the general economy and what is going to happen there. So that is much more difficult to project. As you know John Lopez is here. He can talk about that a bit more, but he is very focused on the jobs data. We have a weekly Monday morning meeting that he reports out any new activity in that area and we are very sensitive to that data.
David Toti - Citigroup: Great. Then just one last question, if you could potentially quantify any changes in the underwriting to the developments that you are looking at in your shadow pipeline today versus developments that are currently underway?
Keith Guericke: Well, as you know, we target the mid six cap rate on our deals with the current environment. It is challenging to get there in the short run, except for unique deals. So I would say while we are keeping our powder dry, we are look at every transaction. The level of volume on our shadow pipeline is declining a bit over the last six to 12 months, especially in light of the cap rates have moved up a little bit. That alternative is more attractive.
David Toti - Citigroup: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Thank you. On the deal flow, you talked about not having done anything year-to-date and the bid/ask spreads still being pretty wide. Are you seeing a lot of the deals that you bid on year-to-date or looked at actually clearing or is it that these projects or properties are still lingering in the market trying to get a sense is to whether its the market bid/ask spreads that's remained pretty wide or is it just that it not yet at a place where you want to participate?
Keith Guericke: Well, if you just look at the two primary markets we are trying do, where we are trying to expand our portfolio and that'd the Bay Area and Seattle. In the Bay Area, there has only been for the first half of the year I think three or four transactions. One was in San Francisco at a very low cap rate, and the other two were: one in San Jose; and I think one in the East Bay. Modest cap rates and most of the stuff that we have looked at generally has not cleared in either market. In Seattle so to the same thing applies there has only been a few transactions, again one on Mercer Island at a very low cap rate. It's a brand new property and a couple of in the East side at sort of low five to mid five cap rates. So it's as I said earlier we are trying to be judicious with our capital and make sure that where we've got allocated to development and whatever we use on the acquisition side is accretive to what we are trying to do and make us a better company. So, generally I would say that the volume of transactions is down. Nobody is really aggressively buying out there. We haven't been able to get to transactions that make sense for us. We've been into several that we have gotten pretty far down the road and just couldn't make it work at the end of the day. So, we've kept our discipline and walked from them.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. Then, looking at Northern California and Seattle it has been several quarters now that you've been growing revenues at a pretty rapid clip. How much do you think you have left in that market?
Keith Guericke: We benchmarked that against the relationship between rents and meeting income levels and you will recall that these markets are the markets that, Northern California and Seattle I mean are the markets that got beat up the most, coming out of the last cycle, and so rent and meeting income relationships were pushed down quite a bit when we started this cycle. So I think that John Lopez knows his numbers better than I do, but I think in San Francisco we are at the long-term historical relationship between rent and meeting income, which means that going forward there will be a bias toward growing at about meeting income growth rate, but in Silicon Valley, East Bay, Seattle certainly we are still at a 5% to 10% lower relationship, so that means that you should be able to continue to push rents. So, we think that there still is upside potential there. The other sort of barometer is that typically when economic conditions deteriorate you have more of a propensity of people doubling up and we really haven't seen that to any great extent at this point in time. So that, is obviously the reason why we continue to look at Seattle and Northern California from an acquisition standpoint. So, all these things tie together at some levels. We think that there is still room to grow here.
Mike Dance: Let me just throw another piece of information in there. The other thing we look at is single-family affordability. Even though we've seen home prices drop, anywhere from 8% to 20% depending on those sub-market in Northern California and Seattle, even at the top end of 20% in Northern California that takes the median home price down to $600,000, which given the median household income in this marketplace keeps the affordability at about 60% which is very similar to Seattle. So, again, single-family affordability still is an issue in these markets.
Keith Guericke: And just one last thing to add is obviously future growth is obviously dependent on future job growth. So, we are in good condition. If we get good job growth, we can maintain above average growth in those markets.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. Then also on the expense side, you've had margin expansion in those markets because the revenue side has been so robust, but expenses on a standalone basis have grown at an above average clip in those areas too. If those markets were to slow, you think those expenses would come down commensurately?
Keith Guericke: I think you have to break that apart. Really, the percentage of expenses above what you would consider normal. If the normal expense growth is 2.5% to 3%, some significant amount of that can be explained with these new initiatives, the property tax situation in Seattle and the other stuff that I commented on the call. So, I think that those things are beyond the normalized expense growth and really are the reason why our expenses are above the long-term expected increase in expenses.  So, I think it is more timing of different things. Again Seattle property tax we have got some big reassessments up there based on valuation, significant valuation increases. That is not going to happen ever year, that is a phenomenon that is a one-time only event, and is affecting us again, similarly Level 1 call center support, YieldStar, some of the other initiatives that we are working on have a one-time increase in expense. So I think it will go back to a more normalized level from this point on. Mike do you have anything to add to that?
Mike Dance: We also changed our philosophy on how we allocate property management fees back to the properties. So this year some properties that were not paying any property management fees without starting to charge them a fee and that again increase the allocation away from G&A to property absolute impacted the NOI and no impact on FFO, its just a reallocation. We were much lower than our peers in what we were allocating so we are closer to the middle of the group now.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Keith Guericke: Again accounting rules world. I am just kidding.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.
Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. A couple questions, can you just talk about the development yields that you expect on that $600 million? How that's maybe changed and what kind of returns are you targeting on the redevelopments and what kind of dollars do you think that you will spend annually on the redevelopment program?
Keith Guericke: On developments, the range is 6.25 to 6.5 on the stabilized number and redevelopment.
Mike Dance: Yeah, redevelopment we will spend $30 million to $40 million and the average there will be about 8% return on that $30 million to $40 million.
Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Mike, do you have any update or have a quantification on the convert with regard to APB 14 or is that not applicable to your convert deal?
Michael Dance: The APB 14, I have to refresh my memory, it has been a while, but if you look at the new rule that's coming out effective January 1…
Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch: Yes, you're talking about the non-cash interest expense.
Michael Dance: Yes, basically, it will take what we are paying at 3.625 and probably bring it up closer to 6% on $225 million, so at least a 100 basis points, that will be a couple of million dollars.
Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch : Okay. Will you put that in your Q or do you know exactly what it will be or you are still finding out?
Michael Dance: We probably should put that in our Q. I don't know that we have done that yet. So, I will check it. It's probably closer to $4 million a year. It is probably about 200 basis points on $200 million, but we restate our prior periods, so it doesn't have a year-over-year impact.
Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch: I understand. I didn't know if and when you were going to disclose that if that has been out there or whether you were still working through it?
Michael Dance: Several analysts have done a pretty good job of estimating it. I think it's already out there, but it is a good idea for us to collaborate that and put it in the in the Q. So, I don't think we have yet, but it is not too late, we haven't filed it yet. So thank you.
Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky. You may proceed, sir.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Looking a little bit more granular at Southern California performance, do you have a breakout of that for Class A versus Class B within your portfolio?
Keith Guericke: What are you looking at specifically? What do you want broken out?
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: I am just looking at performance relative to what you had previously indicated for the quarter was more focused in the Class B segment or how the A and B segments were performing on a relative basis.
Keith Guericke: I mean that is sort of anecdote, I have the property by property operations in front of me. Don't see a lot of change between Class A and Class B. It is much more affected by location. So Southern California being a huge area 20 million, 25 million people, it is local sub-markets specific to a much greater extent than it is Class A versus Class B. So, I don't think there is a much significant difference in how one class of property acted relative to another within a local marketplace.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So, it is safe to say you are not seeing anybody trading down from As to Bs yet in the cycle?
Keith Guericke: It is hard to tell but no. I mean again some of the Class A to Class B activity, there is some lease ups in a variety of different areas. I think the dynamics of those lease ups for example affect all, they don't affect one versus the other, and it is hard to generalize in terms of are people moving up or they moving down. It is dependent upon the local supply in the marketplace and rent levels and they all relate to one another. So, it is pretty difficult to generalize on that statement. The overall trends we don't see a big difference between A and B.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Mike in your comments you were talking about the performance of Fund II, when do you expect to begin harvesting value from that fund, just given the strength we've seen in Seattle and Northern California over the past couple of years?
Michael Dance: I think that selectively we'll start harvesting those that are in more outlier locations, but those that are close to the jobs we believe there is a lot of runway left and we will hold on them for another several years.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Third, just looking at the opportunities within your portfolio, looking at also some of the pressure we are seeing in some other markets around the country, a couple of years back you partnered with a consortium there to look at a portfolio in DC area. Is there any chance Fund III if and when it does materialize would be outside of your target geography at this point?
Keith Guericke: Probably not. We have built our skill set around investing in the West Coast and I would guess that those partners who want to come in and invest with us would look to that skill set and expect us to stay true to that. If we were to do something like go after another market at DC or Boston or New York or whatever, we would probably team up with one specific partner who had an interest in it as opposed to trying to do it through Fund III.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, that's helpful and then finally just looking at you had the TRS income there in the first quarter, is there any additional income we should be looking for in the second half of the year, are there any opportunities on the horizon at this point?
Keith Guericke: There are, but not enough certainty at this point in time to disclose any of them.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, just one or two on the busted condo strategy. How big of an opportunity would you say that is? And how many assets are out there in dollar value?
Keith Guericke: Wow, that is tough. I mean if you go through, the San Diego market started it and we went down there and looked. I think most of that's past now. We had a couple of deals that were in contract and ultimately couldn't get there and the developers I think in both cases found additional equity to bring in and save themselves so those deals went off the market. There is a couple of deals in LA we are looking at. I would guess that…
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Is it a $100 million or is it a $1 billion?
Keith Guericke: I would guess it is closer to a $1 billion than a $100 million. I can think of one or two deals right off the top of my head that are $100 million. It is probably in the $1 billion range.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. When you talk to those folks and sometimes as you mentioned you are speaking to the lenders, is it different conversation sense that you are not really talking about cap rates necessarily, its busted condominium. I mean are they a little bit out of touch with that conversation or are they pretty skilled at the process?
Keith Guericke: It depends. I mean we had one transaction we spent a fair amount of time on recently, that the developer knew he was [toast] and he was just looking to save a little bit of his own equity and the mez was gone and really what we were doing is we are dealing with the construction lender and we were looking at it from an apartment deal trying to make it work as because the condo market is not working for them, it is not going to work for us. So we were looking at it on a cap rate basis and trying to buy new product at mid-to-high 5s, and we had dialogue. But frankly, at the end of the day, I think the construction lender found people with a better set of rose-colored glasses than we had on. Again, there are people out there who have raised funds, who are looking for that stuff. So those transactions are happening and I think they will clear probably at cap rates that we are not willing to pay.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Just a quick one, maybe for Mike Schall. Is there any seasonality to speak up in Southern California relatively speaking to go Northern California and Seattle?
Mike Schall: Yes. Actually there is. I think it is less. Seattle has the most seasonality because things pretty much shutdown from Thanksgiving to mid-January. The holidays are phenomena for everyone and so we do try to scale back our lease expirations beginning in mid-November through mid-January. So, it has effectively taken those lease expirations and lump them into the summer months. So, it is less dramatic, but yes, it is still seasonal.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert Baird. You may proceed.
Paula Poskon - Robert Baird: Thank you. How worried are you, if at all, about the impact of a potential SAG strike in Southern California?
Keith Guericke: I don't know that we went through the (inaudible) strike, and I have heard some comments on other call that was a horrible thing. I talked to our operations people and Mike Schall is here who runs ops. I think we had five people, let's say GM having a little tough time. I don't think our properties are necessarily located in generally different locations than our competitors. So we haven't seen it. We are not particularly concerned about it, but apparently that is a concern in the marketplace.
Paula Poskon - Robert Baird: I have had some questions about it. Thank you. Then lastly, what are you seeing in insurance trends?
Keith Guericke: Insurance?
Paula Poskon - Robert Baird: Yes, your insurance costs.
Keith Guericke: They have declined in last year. I mean there was a huge run-up in insurance costs for the last five years, up to about the last year, and then costs have moderated. I think the expectation of the insurance industry is that property casualty insurance is going softening market. We have seen that in our most recent renewal and I think that will probably continue for a while.
Paula Poskon - Robert Baird: Thanks very much.
Operator: We have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Keith Guericke, President and CEO. You may proceed.
Keith Guericke: Thanks a lot for joining us. Again if there are any questions we didn't answer, please call anyone of us We are here and we will talk to you next quarter. Thank a lot. Bye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-01 12:00:00) =====
Executives: Keith Guericke – President & Chief Executive Officer Michael Schall – Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Michael Dance – Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer John Eudy – Executive Vice President, Development 
Analysts:  Michael Billerman – Citi Craig Nelcher – Citi Karen Ford – Key Bank Capital Markets Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities  Alex Goldfarb - UBS Steve Swett - KBW Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs Steven Rodriguez - Lehman Brothers 
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2008 Essex Property Trust earnings conference call. My name is Angelique and I’ll be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, President and CEO Keith Guericke. Please proceed sir.
Keith Guericke: Thank you. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today we’ll be making some comments in the call which are not historical facts such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty which could cause actual results to differ materially. Many of these risks are detailed in the company’s filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Joining me on today’s call will be Michael Schall, Michael Dance and John Eudy. Included in the earnings release on our website you’ll find our market forecast for 2008. Please note we have made some changes to our rent growth forecast. We will discuss the highlights in the market sections. Also included with our earnings release is a schedule entitled New Residential Supply which includes total residential permit activity for the larger U.S. markets as well as information on mean home prices and affordability as compared to Essex market. To get those details visit our website under investors and media. Last night we reported another strong quarter with core FFO increasing 10.1% per share for the quarter and the portfolio grew revenues at 5.7%, greater than the same quarter in ‘07 and 0.6% on sequential basis. The strong performance was driven by the fundamentals in our supply constrained markets. On today’s call I’m going to concentrate my comments on Southern California where the fall-out from the single family market in manufacturing has led to a weaker job market. Briefly, Seattle and Northern California, the economies and apartment markets in these markets are performing as expected through the first quarter with occupancy rates well above 95% and rent growth on pace to meet our forecast for the year. Going to Southern California, those economies are less reliant on high tech research and development which is driving the Seattle and Northern California economies. In addition some of these markets have larger exposure to the single family industry. Job declines in this sector have come quicker than anticipated. Consequently these markets are weaker and in some parts facing recession. However despite recent single family price declines affordability remains at historically low levels for each market. Now starting with Ventura, the housing boom which started in the first quarter ‘02 created a spike in new jobs. Construction jobs for March were down year-over-year by 2,000 or 11%. At this point the sector has shed the bulk of the job growth since 2002. As of March the credit intermediary sector has – was down 600 jobs or 2% and has shed two thirds of the growth since Q102. We expect the job losses in construction to end in mid-summer and in Q408 for the credit intermediary jobs. And this is based on what we see as jobs lost today. We revised our expectations of 2,000 each outgrowth from flat to down 0.6%. Correspondingly we have revised our forecast of occupancy down 50 basis points to 94% and rent growth down from flat to negative 5%. These factor applied to the Ventura portfolio result in approximately a $1 million decline in revenue from our original guidance. Like Ventura, Orange County has a higher exposure to residential financing. The credit intermediary jobs will cut even faster in Orange. Jobs in this sector are now back to levels last seen in August of ‘01. We believe the sector will stabilize by the end of third quarter ‘08. In March construction jobs were down year-over-year by 5,100 or 5%. We expect losses to continue at the current pace through the end of 2008. The market has shown improvement in other sectors that were weak in ‘07, notably retail trade and professional and business services. We have revised our job growth forecast from flat to down 5,000 or 0.3%. Our forecast for the apartment market remain unchanged at 95% occupancy and 2% rent growth. We expect the weakest areas to be in South Orange County submarket which is roughly 50% of the apartment market. A majority of the credit intermediary and single family construction jobs were located in South Orange. Besides the job losses the area will be negatively affected by the lease ups in the Platinum Triangle area of Anaheim. Occupancy in these areas double in 95 – excuse me 94% in Q1 while the rest of Orange County maintained 95% occupancy. Just a point, majority of our portfolio’s in North Orange County. Going to LA, LA has a – LA County has a smaller exposure to the housing sector than Ventura and Orange. Construction and credit intermediary jobs were down 11,600 or 5% year-over-year. We expect housing sector job losses to continue through the end of ‘08 but at a slower pace. Manufacture will remain the largest drag on the LA economy going forward. We revised our total job growth in Los Angeles from 30,000 to 10,000 or two tenths of 1%. We are lowering our outlook for occupancy by 50 basis points to 95% and our rent growth forecast from 3% to 2%. The weaker areas will be in North and East Los Angeles County where the manufacturing housing sectors are, a larger part of the economies. The submarkets west of downtown will outperform the county forecast. Finally San Diego has seen a sharp reduction in credit intermediary and construction jobs. There is very little left to lose in these sectors from the buildup since 2001. We expect the housing sector to be stable by mid-summer. Manufacturing remains weak but other service sectors have outperformed Southern California and are still growing. We’ve revised our total job growth in San Diego from 10,000 to 5,000 or 0.4%. Our outlook for apartment market for the year remains unchanged at 95% occupancy and 2.5% rent growth. Just a quick update on Cap rates, in the Bay area, looking at A location, A product Cap rates seem to be in that 4.25, 4.5 range. B product and B locations, 5.25 to 5.5. Southern California, slightly higher, 4.5 to 5 for the A product, A location and 5.25, 5.75 for BBs. And in Seattle, A location, A product 4.25 to 4.5 and B location, B product, 5.255.5. Remember, this is on very limited data. So I’d like to – at the end of my comments I’d like to turn it over to Mike Schall. Thank you.
Michael Schall: Good morning – or afternoon and thank you for joining us. Based on the feedback from prior calls I’ve scaled back my prepared remarks to allow more time for the Q&A session. Once again as Keith indicated we had a strong quarter operationally. As expected Northern California reported superior results leading the company with 11.8% seeing property revenue growth well above guidance of 5.5 to 7%. Our Seattle results were also stronger than expected and above guidance. In Southern California our revenue growth was within our 2008 guidance range of 1.5 to 3%, although we continue to see deterioration in operating performance in several submarkets attributable to increasing multifamily supply and/or job losses in specific areas. Operating expenses grew at 4.4% for the quarter, slightly above our guidance range of 2.5% to 4%. Most of this increase as well as the 5.8% increase in Northern California operating expenses was due to our Hillsdale Garden property in Northern California which reported unusually low expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and had a property tax reassessment related to the formation of the joint venture with land owner. In addition we discussed unusually large property tax reassessments at many of our Seattle properties which was also included in our guidance. Accordingly, operating expense expectations remain within our guidance range for 2008. I would like to highlight progress made in improving our operating platform. Our conversion to Yardi’s Property Management and General Ledger System is now 85% complete with 18 properties awaiting conversion at this point in time, everything else being done. We are now running Yieldstar’s Price Optimizer at 24 properties and we’ve implemented call center support at 98 properties and expect to complete the call center roll-out by May 16th. Next topic is loss to lease which estimates the difference on an annual basis between market and in place rents without regard to concessions. Loss to lease declined for the quarter to 3.1 million or 0.9% of scheduled rent.  We now show that marker rents in Southern California are below scheduled or in place rents. This relates to aggressive pricing to hold occupancy as we prepare for our peak summer leasing season. Most of this gain to lease in Southern California relates to lowering rents on a temporary basis to hold occupancy. Now I’d like to quickly go through more detailed statistics for each major part of our portfolio. Starting in Seattle, physical occupancy as of April 21st was 97.3%, net availability 4.1%. And the home purchase activity represented 19% of our move-outs compared to 20% a year ago. In Northern California, again as of April 21st, physical occupancy stood at 97% and net availability was 4.7%. Home purchases represented 10.2% of turns for the quarter compared to 16% a year ago. And in Southern California, again holding occupancy as we head into our peak leasing season, this summer is a critical part of our operating strategy. This strategy was tirelessly implemented by our regional and site staffs during the quarter and we do really appreciate their effort. Physical occupancy as of April 21st in LA Ventura County was 95.7, net availability of 6.3%. In Orange County, occupancy 96.5%, net availability 4.2%. And in San Diego 96.6% physical occupancy with net availability of 6.7%. Move-out activity attributable to home purchases decreased in each of the Southern California MSAs. LA Ventura was just down slightly. Orange County was 8.6% of the turns where to buy homes versus 16% a year ago. And San Diego was 9.3% for the quarter compared to 12% a year ago. That concludes my remarks. I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Dance. Thank you.
Michael Dance: Thanks Mike. My comments today will briefly highlight our first quarter financial results and provide an update on the 2008 guidance. After excluding non-recurring items of $.23 a share of preferred interest income, the recurring funds from operations for the quarter was $1.44 per diluted share, an increase of $.10 over the $1.31 reported in 2007. The March quarter results beat the first cost consensus estimate for funds from operations by $.05 a diluted share. The same property NLI growth at 6.4% beat the high end of our 5.4% guidance. And this outperformance contributed $.03 per share to the first quarter’s funds from operations. Our 2008 guidance did not forecast the 100 basis point drop in interest rates on the variable rate debt. This significant drop in short-term rates added another $.02 per share to the quarter’s funds from operations. On S5 in the Supplemental Financial Information attached to our press release we disclosed almost 240 million in tax exempt variable rate mortgages with a weighted average interest rate in the first quarter of 2008 of 3.8% compared to the 4.8% paid in 2007. These mortgages are variable rate demand securities and are exempt from federal income tax. They also are credit enhanced by either Freddie or Fannie. And even though the debt has 20 to 30 year maturities investors are guaranteed repayment at par when the bonds are repriced every seven days. We are currently benefiting by the increased demand for this debt as investors seek low risk, short-term investments. As a result of severable interest rates on our short-term variable rate debt we have revised our estimate for 2008 interest costs, net of capitalized interest to 84 million compared to original guidance of 87 million. This severable variance is offset by the impact to net operating income from the revisions to our total Southern California job estimate. With the new estimate we have decreased our estimated rental revenues in Southern California by approximately $1 million. If the economy stays weak through 2008 we believe that short-term interest rates will stay low and the reduction to our interest expense will serve as an economic edge to our FFO forecast. Other than the $.23 of non-recurring interest income from a repayment of our investment in Mount Vista the first quarter results have no unusual items and we believe that the March results will approximate the operating results that investors can expect for the next three quarters of 2008. With no other significant changes to our 2008 guidance I will conclude my remarks and turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of Michael Billerman with Citi. Please proceed.
Michael Billerman – Citi:  Good morning out there. Craig Nelcher’s on with me as well. Mike, just a quick question on the guidance. I guess you take the core results out of the first quarter, you annualize them and then you add the gain you had, you sort of get to the midpoint of guidance. So I guess sort of what takes you, if you’re going to have some sequential growth during the year, I guess below that? And sort of, what sort of gets us to either end?
Michael Schall: I’m not sure I understand the question. 
Michael Billerman – Citi: Well effectively if you annualize your first quarter results and you add the $.23 of gain you get the $6 a share –
Keith Guericke: Right.
Michael Billerman – Citi: – which is effectively in the midpoint in your guidance. So it sounds like you’re going to have some growth – continued growth in NOI as you go through the year. So I’m just not sure why you would not lift guidance further. I’m just trying to understand how you think you’re going to fall out.
Keith Guericke: Again I think just the uncertainties in the economy. We’re being cautious. We do not want to be overly optimistic and be accused of being Polly Ann-ish. So we’re just kind of assuming the status quo for the rest of the year. And that’s why we have a range of guidance. So if we – if the economy remains strong and interest rates stay low we can expect to beat the midpoint of our guidance.
Craig Nelcher – Citi:  And on the [inaudible] NOI guidance for the year, is there – do you have a new range for that or did the softness in Southern California get offset by strength in Seattle and Northern California?
Michael Schall: That’s right. That’s a good point. And it’s really the favorable news and Seattle and Northern California was offset by the reduction in jobs in Southern California.
Craig Nelcher – Citi: I’m just looking at a development pipeline page, a couple of the development starts were pushed back a little bit. Can you talk about what that was driven through, whether it was just the development timing issue or a decision that you made internally?
John Eudy: On Belmont Station we put a – I’m sorry?
Keith Guericke: Starts, he’s asking about starts.
John Eudy:  Oh, starts?
Craig Nelcher – Citi: The start date.
John Eudy: Yes, start dates are as you know on the estimated dates that we put out, there’s a lot of future guessing as far as the exact timing. There are variables that can happen. We have extended a couple of underlying leases to basically time the delay for example. Essex Hollywood would be one. We were going to start it sooner. We chose to extend the current lease with the tenants in the building out until September of ‘09. That’s one example. Beyond that, do you have specific ones you –
Craig Nelcher – Citi: No, that was specifically – so is that for timing just uncertainty in the market conditions or on liquidity size or –
John Eudy: We had the ability to extend the lease and we chose to do that. So we’re pushing the development out a little bit. And as comments have indicated that the market might be a little bit soft there we figured delivery in 2011 would be a better timing execution. In the meantime the return that we get on the lease is in the 6% range, just over 6% range on our acquisition price.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Ford of Key Bank Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Karen Ford – Key Bank Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. Just a clarification. You said in the first quarter that you received $7.5 million of preferred income but recognized 6.3. Will you be recognizing that balance or has that already been recognized?
Keith Guericke:  We have an investment balance of 1.3 million so they were completely paid off. We got a – similar to a Mez loan with an equity kicker. So we’ve been completely paid off and we will no longer have any –
Karen Ford – Key Bank Capital Markets: No more recognition then.
Keith Guericke: Yes.
Karen Ford – Key Bank Capital Markets: Okay. Next question is it’s kind of like from your commentary that based on the work you’ve done on the sources of the job losses in Southern California that you think most of the bleeding is going to be done by the end of ‘08. Is that accurate?
Keith Guericke: That’s correct. The way we address that is we try to look at the – define the new jobs as sort of this housing bubble which started in 2002. And so what we’re really doing is we’re looking at what happens if all those jobs go away. And with current rates we’re seeing the majority of that bubble goes away by – depending on the submarket, third quarter, fourth quarter of this year. And so yes, that would define our expectation of the outside.
Karen Ford – Key Bank Capital Markets: Great, last question is what do you think the biggest risk is to performance in Seattle? It’s been quite the juggernaught. We keep hearing things about some new supply coming in. What do you – is that sort of the biggest risk that you see in Seattle?
Michael Shall: It’s always a combination I’d say between – as long as the job growth continues at the current level I think there’ll be the demand that’s required to support the new supply driven online. There are large concentrations of new product. I’d say especially at Belleview.  And, you know, and our portfolio’s pretty interspersed throughout the Seattle economy so we’re not necessarily, you know in the hotbed of the new supply, that, anyway our view right now is that the combination of jobs on the one hand, job growth on the one hand and supply on the other hand and we should be fine up there. If that changes then, yeah, the market could soften up because we know with 100% certainty that obviously the supply comes online.
Karen Ford - Key Bank Capital Markets:  Great, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo, Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities:  Thanks, good morning. Keith, on last quarter’s call you discussed that there was, you know, a clear disconnect between the buyers and the sellers in the marketplace and it’s something that we have continued to hear on various turn-ins calls this quarter. Have you seen any change in that in your markets in that dynamic recently, either for the better or worse?
Keith Guericke:  No. I think it’s—we’re still very consistent. The stats that I gave you with respect to cap rate were based on, in northern California, five or six closings, in Seattle, less than that, you know, California or similar sorts of things, just a handful of closings.  You know, there was a lot of listings, especially in southern California right now by privates as well as public companies and, you know there is a lot of activity but it seems like things go into contract and buyers come back for very large price hits and things generally fall out because, you know, again it’s not like the early ‘90s when you had, you know, when you had leverage that was out of hand.  Today there’s not a lot of pain. The sellers, if they’re selling, are looking for, you know, for an opportunity and so, you know if they can’t hit somewhere close to their, to the yields they need and they’ve got good occupancy and generally have loans in place and generally whether its’ rent growth or flat-rate growth they’re not going backwards. So there’s just not a lot of pain so I don’t think you’re going to see cap rates move much more because, I don’t know, sellers just don’t have to.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities:  So do you think then that you just continue to see essentially a stall out in transaction buying rather than pricing change to get the deals flowing again?
Kevin Guericke:  I would think that, in my mind, it’s either going to take a very long time or it’s just not going to happen because, again, if sellers don’t have to sell, unless they see better opportunities, I mean if you can sell an existing deal and you’re willing to take a higher cap rate because you can redeploy that money at a better yield somehow, that might happen. But I just don’t see that happening. And so I would think that it’s just going to stall out and you’re going to see very few transactions over the next 12 to 18 months.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities:  Okay. So then, you know, given your comments there and given that in the past you guys have been one of the companies to take a more opportunistic approach on investments, I mean, can you just talk a little bit about how you view the risk reward equation for, you know, investments on various sides of the capital structure right now?
Keith Guericke:  Well, again, we think that, you know, the development piece is clearly where we can create some value. The other area and, you know, this is not from new acquisitions but from our existing portfolio, redevelopment is a place where you can see yields on our dollars spent in the 8 to 10% range. So clearly that’s an opportunity for us.  You know, we are actually looking at some opportunities where lenders are involved because there is some pain there. And so I think you’re going to have to find those areas where there is pain involved in order to get a better than normal return.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities:  So that would be kind of a tough situation where you may look to do, you know, sort of a loan-to-own type of deal?
Keith Guericke: A loan-to-own or a buying out a piece of debt that’s underwater or some combination of the above. 
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities:  Okay, thanks guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of UBS. Please proceed.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS:  Thank you. Good morning.
Keith Guericke: Yeah, good morning.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Just following up that one little bit on the financing side, what are you guys seeing as far as the Life Companies and Fannie and Freddie? We’ve heard some comments on the call before yours that it sounds like Fannie and Freddie are now lowering their spreads after widening them. What are you seeing on that end and then what are you seeing on the life company?
Keith Guericke:  Yeah, Freddie and Fannie are still about 200 basis points, spreads on a 10-year mortgage which is what we attempt to do. And, you know, Life was probably about 75 basis points more than that.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS:  Okay, are you seeing the Life Co.’s getting — want to be more aggressive in the apartments or more rested on the development side or no change? 
Keith Guericke:  Really no change.
Alex Goldfarb – UBS:  And then as far as portfolio allocation, just listening to your comments on Seattle and just looking at what you’ve done in exiting Portland, if you were going to think about doing some repositioning on the portfolio are there any markets that you’re inclined to increase investment in or decrease investment in?
Michael Schall:  Yes. The reality of our business is that it’s a combination of cap rates and growth. And, you know, clearly we had the most exciting growth in northern California and Seattle, but it’s also the most difficult cap rates. I mean clearly everything else equal we’d like to see a more opportunities in those two markets.  Unfortunately, I mean, everything is cyclical and, you know, these markets, you know will also over time soften and southern California as it gets speeding up is going to create opportunities. So, you know, we’re going to have to look at the combination of cap rates and growth rates over a three-year horizon to really, you know, make those decisions.  But I would tell you just, you know, the easy decision sitting here today is, you know, northern California and Seattle is, would be the place that we’d, you know, we feel very comfortable today.
Alex Goldfarb – UBS:  Okay, and then the final question is just on the new Sunnyvale deal. It seems to — if you cold just provide some background on that. Obviously, it’s come about and now it’s already in the development stage, so if you could provide some color background on that as well as how you’re going to handle the retail aspect of it.
John Eudy:  Sure. John Eudy again. We had that in contract for almost two years if you recall, Alex. And we got it entitled in February, got past the SEQUA [ph] challenge period in March and then just closed the property last — about a week ago. In terms of start, we’ve got it anticipated to start February of next year.  We’re starting working drawings as we speak. It is a mixed use deal that has about 48,000 square foot of retail. We’ve got a pad out front of just under 15,000 square feet that we have a lease in negotiation right now with a small anchor grocery store and then the rest is in line underneath the footprint of the building of approximately, you know, 32,000 square feet plus our leasing office.
Alex Goldfarb – UBS: Okay, thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Steve Swett with KBW. Please proceed.
Stephen Swett - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Thanks. You know, Keith, just to follow up on the questions on the cap rates, I understand there’s not a whole lot of data and there’s no pain to force some of the sellers to execute transactions today, but you reference some rental growth rates that may turn negative.  And so from a return perspective, you know, it may look that, you know, some of these owners in southern California, you know, a sale might be a better option than a hold. Could you just provide maybe your feel for what cap rate differences might be between, I don’t know, northern California and southern — I’m sorry, northern Orange County, southern Orange County or the, you know central areas of L.A. versus the inland empire? You know, the discrepancy between those areas?
Keith Guericke:  Sure, you know, I don’t have — I have a little bit of data. I was talking to our acquisition guy down there in preparation for this and it’s tough to differentiate a lot. I would tell you that southern Orange County is generally newer product, more A’s. Northern Orange County is sort of the solid, you know, B’s and, you know, A minus, B plus kind of market, so that would just tell you that the cap rates that I discussed for A’s in L.A. or, you know, probably 50 to 75 basis points in south Orange County.  I would tell you that Inland Empire, not because we’re looking out there, but because brokers give us feedback all the time, cap rates are probably six-and-a-half to, you know, say [inaudible] point 6.5 so maybe 6 to 7 depending on the quality of the real estate because I think everybody is recognizing that there’s going to be a lot of pain out there for a fairly long period of time.
Stephen Swett - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Okay, and then Mike, a couple of operating questions. On the gain-to-lease that you referenced in southern California, have you seen any change in, as the spring has progressed, I mean, I think you referenced that you had to get more aggressive in rents to hold occupancy. Has it changed with the typical seasonal pattern or is it still weak?
Michael Schall:  Really Steve, it’s — very little time has passed since, you know, the quarter ended, so I don’t think that we’ve seen a change thus far. But I will say that if you look at that number it is highly concentrated in our larger buildings so, you know, for example Hillcrest Park which is 600 units right next to Ventura County, is about 800,000 of the three million. Southern California gained the least number and so it tends to be heavily focused on larger buildings in a couple of those markets and I think it’s too early to tell if things have changed.  What we’re trying to do it be a little bit defensive about it and try to make sure that, you know, if the world — if we don’t see a lot of evidence that the world is getting better then we’ll assume that it’s getting worse and we will just hold occupancy wherever we can.  And so I think it’s sort of — it’s the right strategy given that market and, you know, if we get surprised on the upside with better traffic patterns and job growth then, you know, that’s great. Too early to discern whether it’s changed from the first quarter, though.
Stephen Swett - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Okay, and then last question, sort of related, as you roll out Yield Star you obviously have various strength across all your different markets. As it gets implemented is it something that you expect that Yield Star will provide the rents and you’ll go with those? Or is it something that you’ll roll out a little more slowly and just let your leasing people get their hands around, you know, how it works and what the numbers are that are recommended?
Keith Guericke:  Well at least initially I think the beginning part of the roll out has been a little bit slower just because you do end up with some data conversion issues and, you know, making sure that you have [inaudible] codes and things like that correctly working. And so that part of the roll out has been a little bit slower.  And then we are, the second part of that is, you know, we are constantly testing the Yield Star results against what we know about the market and so we want to be, yes, we want to be very careful in terms of how we roll it out.  So, you know, that we expect to roll out, you know throughout the rest of the year and essentially be close to done some time in 2008. And do we’ll speed up from here unless we have some difficulties.  But it is a more, you know, the level one conversion was started at the beginning of the year and it’s almost done so that was a very quick roll out. Yield Star is a bit more complicated and therefore could possibly have more air and also it’s critical importance to us. So we are being pretty cautious when it comes to that roll out.
Stephen Swett - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Okay, thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Thanks, and on Yield Star, when do you expect that to be fully rolled out?
Michael Schall:  By the end of the year.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, I don’t know if you said that, but I know it now. You know, nobody should be assuming 10 to 12% revenue growth in any market, you know, in your case Seattle and northern California for any length of time. It’s not sustainable.  So in your mind what are some of the factors besides maybe supply and affordability, maybe that’s it, that are sort of inflating revenue growth there and what would you sort of say to people about the longer term expectations for revenue growth in those two, you know, good supply-constrained markets?
Keith Guericke:  Well, I think if you track revenue growth for Seattle and northern California, you know, over a longer period of time you get somewhere in the 4% long term average, you know, rent growth. So you’re right. Those are not sustainable over the long haul.  Having said that you also have, you know, sort of the cumulative effect of this business and, you know, it’s really what loss-to-lease has meant to capture in that we had pretty significant increase in rent last year in 2007 and really we’re turning — we’re continuing to turn leases so we have — we will continue to capture some portion of loss-to-lease which won’t be, going forward, at double digit range but it’ll slowly taper off throughout the year as we price more and more units in the inventory. So does that answer your question?
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Yeah, and for northern California, the Bay area, what would you call sort of the long term trend?
Keith Guericke:  I think it’s about the same. I think those two are pretty similar, Seattle and northern California, somewhere around 4%.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, would you guys be buying back stock at $120 a share?
Keith Guericke:  No reason to.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, and then just a question on just sort of the makeup of the market in terms of the tenants. How open are you to, you know, bringing in tenants that may have just lost a home, you know, angry tenants that are upset about their circumstances. I mean, are they in some cases very good tenants and how are you tackling that opportunity?
Keith Guericke:  You’re saying someone that lost their home in foreclosure?
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Yeah.
Keith Guericke:  Yeah, we are making an exception for that person because, you know, in general we don’t want people that are either as a result of foreclosures living in, you know, apartments where they have, you know, where it goes into the credit history.  But in that case given what happened there were many, may people that are very good credit risks that just got in essentially over their head. They bought off on very expensive homes and, you know 95 to 100% financing that they couldn’t afford and everyone knew they couldn’t afford it but they took it anyway.  If we find people in that scenario we will make an exception and for a sublet, you know, I don’t remember exactly, but it’s slight increase in deposit we will accept them as tenants and we’ll do that throughout our, well, the entire west coast.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Any idea what percentage, I mean, of new tenants are of that category?
Keith Guericke:  You know, I don’t track it. I know that there are several, you know, in that category. So we do make exceptions on an ongoing basis but I don’t have a number for you.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Great, and kudos on the brief comments. I think that that’s a better use of your time for the opening remarks. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jay Haberman of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs:  Hey guys, good morning to you. Keith, you mentioned some of the impact obviously on the construction job losses as well in manufacturing. I just wondering, you know, obviously given the decline in single family home prices what are you seeing outside of that in terms of say retail for example and employment there?
Keith Guericke:  You know, in — and we can take those markets sort of one by one. In Seattle, you know, everybody talks about all the cranes. And the cranes aren’t all residential. There’s a lot of office et cetera being built.  So in Seattle the retail and office market seems to be going at sort of the same level it had been. Northern California is very similar. It’s got a strong new construction especially in the office in Silicon Valley.  I don’t know if you can hear this but we’re getting some feedback buzz here. Anyway. And then in southern California it is slowing down a little bit but not, you know, I don’t think we’ve been able to measure that yet.
Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs:  Okay, just trying to get a sense, I mean, it sort of sounds like you’re indicating the bottom might be late this year and I’m just sort of wondering what gives you that confidence given that home prices are continuing to decline and some estimate that we’re only sort of half way through the price declines so far?
Keith Guericke:  Okay, there’s sort of two questions there. Are you talking about the decline in single family or just generally in retail office?
Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs:  Decline in single family but ultimately your expectation that sort of job losses sort of bottom out late this year?
Keith Guericke:  And the reason for that is, what we do when we look at jobs relative to each of these sectors, is we sort of look at what’s the long term trend has been for those jobs. And then what we’re really doing is we’re saying that the jobs that we’re talking about going away has been the bubble piece of the job formation. So take that and then you look at how the permit activity has dropped off and in our markets, even thought we’re producing in generally in the California markets, a half to three-quarters of 1% of existing stock, the permit activity is dropping off.  So as that permit activity drops off, obviously there’s nothing to follow up. Anything that’s in construction today is going to get finished so we’re assuming that we see the existing project finish up and then we’re going to see a drop off back to sort of historical norms with respect to anything that gets started.
Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs:  Okay, and just, you know, switching gears in terms of redevelopment you mentioned the returns there, seemingly attractive versus obviously current cap rates, but do you plan to expand that program much from the current base?
Keith Guericke:  Over time we will expand it. We are retrenching a bit there and trying to compress turn times for units in the redevelopment programs. And we’re also mindful of the fact that we really don’t want to be tearing apart our buildings when we’re struggling a little bit sort of economically so we’re being a bit more selective as to redevelopment activity, but the long term implications, the long term opportunities of redevelopment remain very strong.
Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs:  Okay, great, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Good morning, a quick question. Coming and just looking at what you’re seeing in the markets right now, looking at asset pricing, maybe a way to come at it differently, have you made any changes in your acquisition or development underwriting assumptions over the, let’s call it, six months?
Keith Guericke:  Well, in our acquisition, we haven’t bought anything for, or closed anything for six months so the answer is we’re looking at how can we make transactions accretive in today’s world given our — and again it’s not just the asset price. It’s the asset price coupled with our capital cost.  And in today’s world given where, you know, thank God our share price has come up recently, but when our share price was down where it has been in the early part of the quarter, interest rates the spreads on Fannie and Freddie are up from 80 basis points to 200 basis points and cap rates haven’t moved comparably.  You’re just not going to do anything. So the answer is, yeah, we’re looking for, you know, on the acquisition side a minimum of five-and-three-quarter, preferably above that. And on the development side we haven’t put anything new in contract other than we’ve got the portfolio that’s been there for a long time, but we haven’t put anything new in contract in a couple of years. So yeah, we are being mindful of the changing asset values.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay, no, that’s helpful. Second question, in terms of your guidance that you originally provided for ‘08 you had $100 to $200 million of projected dispositions. Have you outlined those assets first of all? And second of all, if you have outlined what do you expect the timing on those transactions to be?
Keith Guericke:  We did not identify them necessarily in the guidance. We are generally looking at our lower quality assets in southern California, which is going to imply a slightly cap rate for those dispositions.  We’ve got a couple that we’re working on right now but nothing far enough along to report on. We generally don’t report those until they’re in contract with contingencies removed. But that’s where — that’s the profile that we’re working on.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay, any thoughts at this point in April about starting another fund?
Keith Guericke:  We’re looking at it. When our share price was in the $100 range the fund cost of capital made tremendous sense as our share price continues to pick up some, you know, pick up a little bit it becomes more of a difficult comp, I mean we have to compare the cost of our equity on balance sheet versus the fund.  I mean clearly, I think some of our peers who have gone into the fund business look at it as a separate business. We look at it as an alternative cost of capital and I think today if we can get a little bit more traction our share price were to move a little bit better, the balance sheet’s probably a better place to finance. But we are — right now that is an ongoing discussion in-house.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay, related to that, what kind of referral rates would institutional investors be looking for at this pong?
Keith Guericke:  Well, that’s part of the problem is that we have a cadre of investors that invest with us, Fund One and as a result of the great results of Fund One are in Fund Two and they have a certain expectation. If we were to go out and try and find lower hurdles we’d probably have to go out and approach new investors, which is a lot of work and it’s very expensive. So I think that we can probably expect sort of the low to mid-teens generally in the marketplace but we have not proved that at this point.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay, and then finally you had the $0.23 cent gain here in the first quarter and I know your guidance for the full year doesn’t assume any additional transaction activity. I mean, is it covered completely there at this point or are there a couple opportunities that you’re looking at that could produce some additional income maybe in the second half of the year at this point?
Keith Guericke:  Yeah, we’ve always go things that are there and depending on the opportunity we can pull the trigger or now. Nothing significant though.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay, thanks guys.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Steven Rodriguez of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Steven Rodriguez - Lehman Brothers:  Hi guys, forgive me if you talked about this already, but I was wondering if you could give us an update on funding the development? I see you guys have about maybe another 350 million of remaining costs of the End Place development?
Michael Dance:  Yeah, this is Mike Dance. We have a pipeline of unencumbered assets that, you know, as we, for example John mentioned we can close on Tasman [ph]. This last quarter we put an unencumbered asset into a [inaudible], see which one gives us the most attractive pricing and coverage and to win. We measure them on several different metrics and make a decision to move forward on them. And so we just keep an unencumbered pool going from the development pipeline. On a short term basis we have the bank line and that’s got about 150 million in capacity on it so it’s kind of the combination of the bank line for short term needs and the secure line for taking down the equity piece.
Keith Guericke:  And then probably the other piece that I discussed earlier, the disposition program is looking at 100 plus million which would be, as I said, selling some of these lower brand stuff in southern California which is higher cap rates. Those higher cap rates will certainly marry up with a development deal much better than they would with a reinvestment in acquisition.
Steven Rodriguez - Lehman Brothers:  Is it fair to say that, I mean, should you sell in the lower range? Say 100 million or less of assets? You could expect a lot more secure debt, maybe 50 to 100 million or even more so?
Keith Guericke:  That’s right.
Steven Rodriguez - Lehman Brothers:  All right, thanks.
Operator:  Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Billerman of Citi. Please proceed.
Michael Billerman – Citi:  Can you talk about how the development lease-ups are going and in particular looking on the pipeline? Belmont Station’s operations was pushed back a couple of months and the Grand was pushed back a couple months.
Keith Guericke:  Yeah, Belmont, delivery of the physical product got delayed for a combination of reasons and that’s the reason the lease-up hasn’t really ensued yet. We open up a temporary leasing office next week and within this next quarter we’ll have pretty good visibility on how that’s going.  As far as the Grand, we pushed it to January just because we’ll have our pre-leasing — we’re going to physically complete the building just around Christmas time and the initial occupancy in January is more realistic at this point. The one fund asset that we have, East Lake opened up about a month-and-a-half ago up in Seattle on Lake Union. That’s at about 67 or 68 leases as of the beginning of this week and it’s going, you know, fairly well.
Michael Billerman – Citi:  And how’s the rents you’re receiving compared to what your expectations were say a couple months ago?
Keith Guericke:  Slightly up by a couple of pennies.
Michael Billerman – Citi:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Ladies and Gentlemen there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I’d like to turn the presentation back over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Keith Guericke. Please proceed.
Keith Guericke:  Thanks for joining us on the call and we are here for any follow-ups if you need it and we hope to have you on the call next quarter. Thank you.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the presentation for today. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day and thank you for enjoying today’s conference.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2007 Essex Property Trust Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Keith Guericke, President and CEO, please proceed.
Keith Guericke:  Good morning and welcome to our call. I’m going to apologize in advance a little bit. I think our comments are going to be a little bit longer than normal. We are trying to support the 2008 guidance, plus give you color on what’s happened for the fourth quarter. So we are going to be a little wordy. Please bear with us.  This morning we are going to be making some comments on this call which are not historical facts, such as our expectations regarding markets, financial results and real estate projects. These statements are forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed with the company’s filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Joining me in the call today are Mike Schall, Mike Dance, and John Eudy.  Also included in our Earnings Release on our website you’ll find our market forecast for 2008. We will discuss the highlights in the market section. Also included in our Earnings Release is a scheduled time new residential supply, which includes total residential permit activity for the larger US metros, as well as information on the median home price and affordability as compared to our Essex markets. To get those details, visit our website under Investors and Media.  Last night we reported another strong quarter with core FFO increasing 12.7% per share for the quarter. The portfolio grew revenue 6.2% greater than the same quarter in ’06, and 1.3% on a sequential basis. On today’s call, I’d like to comment on how we see multi-family financing. I’ll also comment on the basis of our 2008 guidance on a market-by-market basis. And finally I want to comment on Cap rates.  To the extent that multi-family sector has gotten painted with the same brushes as the other property sectors from this credit crunching financial situation, I think that’s been a huge overreaction. The multi-family sector still has access to financing from Fannie and Freddie. Nine months ago we were able to borrow 60-65% of value at 80 basis points over the ten-year treasury. That’s not available today. But we can still get financing in the 55-60% range, at 170-180 basis points over the ten-year treasury. In fact, in January we completed a loan on a Southern California property with an all-in rate of 5.21%.  We’ve been big believers in using mortgage debt from the agencies, since we’ve been public in 1994. I think we’ve seen unsecured market cheaper than mortgage debt maybe two months out of that entire time. So you will continue to see us use that financing strategy. Let me talk about each of our regions quickly. Seattle’s economy remains one of the strongest in the nation. GDP for the state of Washington has one of the highest percentages of exports in the country, which is benefiting from the currency issues. The success at Boeing from record-breaking orders of the 787 as well as deliveries on the 737 has driven the growth across that region. Expansion at Microsoft and the surrounding software industry on the eastside has led to a 3.4% growth in the information and business sector jobs. Residential construction is expected to remain relatively flat over the next two years. Increases in the multi-family deliveries are being offset by declining single-family supply. So again, if you look at the permit schedule at the back of our information, those numbers don’t exactly true up.  Despite the boom in apartment rents over the last two years, the ratio of rent to median household income remains relatively low at 16%, and this is below the historic average, and renting represents approximately 51% of the costs of ownership in this market. We expect for 2008, 28,000 new jobs, and a total supply of multi-family and single-family of about 12,500 units, or 1.2% of the existing stock. We expect occupancy will increase to 96% with a 7% rent growth in this market.  In Northern California, job growth was slightly stronger than the nation in 2007. The strongest economies in Northern California are in the San Francisco and San Jose areas. The recovery of the San Francisco and San Jose economies had little to do with the single-family boom. These markets have little, if any, exposure to the sub-prime single-family market. New single-family supply in this market totaled only 0.4% of the existing stock. Internet technologies, business service, education, health, and tourism have been the drivers. We forecast 28,000 new jobs or 1.5% job growth in ’08, with new total supply of 7500 units or 0.6% of stock. Occupancy levels remain at about 96%, with rent growth of 5.5% in San Francisco, and 7% in San Jose.  The Oakland market did have exposure to the sub-prime mortgage issues, primarily eastern Contra Costa County, where we have little ownership exposure. In the second half of ’07, Oakland suffered from significant loss to construction and financial intermediary jobs, which are now back to the 2002 levels. Thus we don’t expect these sectors to remain a drag on the economies going forward. Stronger growth in the service sector will lead to overall job growth of approximately 10,000 jobs or 1% in ’08. This level of jobs should keep occupancy at about 95%, leading to a 4% rent growth. Affordability continues to be on our side. Let me give you some statistics here quickly, relative to ownership, and I’ll do it market by market. San Francisco in ’07 actually saw home prices go up slightly 2.5%, however we think that prices are going to go down 7.5% in ’08, resulting in median home prices of about $771,000. If you then look at what the cost of ownership relative to renting is, rent will be about 53% of ownership. And if you look at what rent is as a percent of median household income, it’s about 26%.  In San Jose we saw prices pick up on the single-family homes of about 3% in ’07. Again, expecting about a 7.5% price reduction in ’08, resulting in $737,000 median home price in ’08. Rent as a percent of ownership at about 45%, and rent as a percent of median household income at 18.1%. And then finally Oakland, prices were flat in ’07. However we expect to see a little bit larger 10% price change in ’08, negative price change resulting in $621,000 home prices. Rent as a percent of ownership at about 48%, and rent as a percent of median household income at about 19.3%. Let me give you the rent as a percent of median household income; put that into perspective for you. Historically, across this region it’s been 23 to 24%, so in San Francisco rents are at or slightly above the historical levels. In San Jose and Oakland they are significantly below, which I think bodes well for us to be able to push ramp. In Southern California, the economies are weaker and in some parts facing recession. However reduction of single-family construction to negligible levels will help the apartment market. In Ventura County we continue to be negatively affected in 2008 by the loss of jobs at Countrywide Financial and Amgen, and on the supply side with two large lease ups in Simi Valley and Oxnard we expect to continue to lose some construction jobs and single-family supply will be cut. We expect total new supply of about 1300 units in this region, which is about 0.5% of existing stock, and we expect to see jobs flat. Occupancies will fall slightly to 94.5%, with flat rent.  In Orange County, we saw drafting cut back in financial intermediary jobs. This sector lost about 8600 jobs or 17% of the sector in ’07, and are now back to early 2003 levels. Construction jobs were cut back by 6200 or almost 6% in ’07. More cuts in these sectors are inevitable and will lead to flat job growth overall for Orange County in ’08. Single-family construction will be cut to about 2000 units, with total supply of single-family and multi-family units of about 5700 or 0.6% of total stock and no new jobs. We expect occupancy will fall to 95%, with 2% rent growth, concentrated in north Orange County.  Los Angeles, particularly west LA and Long Beach has performed much better than the rest of Southern California. These areas have primarily multi-family housing stock, and there is virtually no exposure to single-family construction. These areas also have little exposure to credit in their intermediary jobs. The concentration of the single-family fallout in this market is in North County area, which is Valencia, Lancaster and Palmdale. We have no apartments in that area.  There will continue to be some lease-up competition in Woodland Hills, Pasadena. Overall we expect about 30,000 new jobs or 0.7% in 2008, and new total supply of 14,600 units or 0.4% of existing stock. And that’s total multi-family and single-family stock. Occupancy will remain at 95.5%, with overall rent growth of 3%, with stronger growth in the infill areas of west LA and Long Beach.  And finally, San Diego. That economy showed some resiliency in the second half of ’07. Construction jobs have fallen, and we expect that to continue to climb as residential constructional falls. Jobs outside these sectors grew at a healthy 1.9% in ’07, with strength across all the other sectors. In addition, most of the condo conversion projects have already reentered the market as rental, and we do not expect further erosion in occupancy as a result. We expect 2008 to be very similar to ’07, with market adding about 10,000 new jobs or 0.8%, and total new supply of 6200 units or 0.6%. We expect occupancy to remain at about 95%, with 2.5% rent growth.  Again, let me give you some sense of the affordability relative to single-families in this market. All of these markets had single-family prices actually drop in ’07, Ventura being the base of 5.5%, and everything else at 2.5-5%. In 2008, we see bigger price drops coming. We see in Ventura about a 12% additional drop, in LA about 10%, Orange 7.5%, San Diego 12.5%, which will result in median home prices ranging from $475,000 in Ventura to $639,000 in Orange, with the others in-between there. And that’s going to make rent as a percent of ownership cost range from about 48% to 59%. Again, the affordability is on our side. And if you look to what is rent as a proportion of the median household income, it’s at about 17% in Ventura, to as high as about 29% in LA; Orange, and San Diego being in the 21% range. Again if you put this into perspective on a historical basis, these are at about the historical levels that we’ve seen.  Finally, I’ll talk about cap rates real quickly. On our last call, we indicated that we believe cap rates increased by 25 basis points. Since that time, it has become more clear that cap rates are moving. I think depending on the property and the market quality, the increase has been 25 to 50 basis points on the west cost.  However, in our markets, I will tell you there has been very little volume in transactions, and you can’t really point to a lot of transactions to support these. However, the one interesting thing that’s happening now is, with the reduction in interest rates, I think you’re going to see cap rates staying flat from this point or maybe even ticking slightly down because there’s a potential for positive leverage.  The other point I would make is there is a significant number of new listings coming into our markets this first quarter and we expect this to lead to an increase in the number of transactions in the next three to six months which will bring clarity to the cap rate picture.  Let me turn the call over to John Eudy.
John Eudy : Thank you, Keith. In our last call I briefly touched on the market for land and specifically recycled opportunities resulting from the fallout of the condominium for sale market. The concern: Could there be a glut of development deals converting to apartments which could lead to an oversupply? We doubt it, for reasons of financial feasibility.  We have looked at several of these deals over the last year and in all of our markets and have not pursued a single transaction that was recycled in 2007 which meets apartment under-writing criteria. I suspect other multi-family rental developers that compete in our space are experiencing the same conclusion. With the large gap that still exists between bid and ask and with entitlements which are generally not conducive to apartment developments, specifically the designed unit-size, parking requirements, and type one construction in many cases as the drivers, the transactions are simply not being consummated, combined with the continuing challenges of additional financial burdens like increasing affordability requirements, inclusionary housing and city fees.  Overbuilding in our markets as a result of conversion of for-sale recycle land deals going into the apartment development pipeline is simply not going to happen to any significant degree. There will be some opportunities that pop up and become available. But they will be more the exception than the rule. One development cost component which appears to be going in our favor in the near term is a possible reduction in construction hard costs led by the labor side of the equation.  I have stated for the last several quarters we have seen the amount of subcontract bidding activity increase significantly in our Southern and Northern California markets, primarily due to the fall off of the wood frame home building business. We also see the very beginning signs of this starting to occur in the Seattle market as well. On the raw materials side of the equation, wood is at a seven year low, reflecting the domestic supply - demand imbalance and concrete and steel have stabilized over the second half of 2007. Both should trickle down through the system over the next several quarters. We do not expect to see overall construction costs come down as significantly as they have gone up the last three years, of course. But there is a much higher likelihood they will retract a portion of the gains over the near term in lieu of going up any further.  If we do see a reduction it will not be enough to significantly alter the economics to spur additional apartment development or close a bid-ask gap on the recycle condo land. But it will help on the margin on deals which we are currently in the process of buying out.  The following activities occurred in our development projects during the quarter. During the quarter we added 4th Street in Berkley, a 171 unit deal, which will start construction in April. We moved our city center deal in Moore Park from development projects to land held for future development. We have not concluded negotiations with the City on bond financing and tax credits and are clarifying some aspects of the development agreement. We have delayed the construction start until the negotiations are concluded.  Our land basis is at $7.9 million or just under $39,500 per unit, which includes a full set of working drawings and engineering, which is very attractive and gives us a lot of options.  Belmont Station formerly NorthWest Gateway in Los Angeles is two months behind schedule. We will be opening the leasing office and delivering initial occupancy in April followed by substantial completion the following month. Eastlake 2851 on Lake Union in Seattle will open a temporary leasing office this week and will deliver initial occupancy in the permanent leasing office next month, and substantial completion in April. The pre-leasing interest in this development has far exceeded our expectations to date.  The Grand in Oakland will top out the 22nd floor, that’s the top floor, next month and is on schedule for substantial completion in December 2008. Studio 41 in Studio City is scheduled for substantial completion in March, 2009, and Cielo in Chatsworth is scheduled for substantial completion in May of 2009.  In our pre-development projects pipeline the following activities occurred. We’ve added Main Street and Walnut Creek. This is an assemblage of 1.94 acres of land in the heart of downtown Walnut Creek which we just concluded and closed on December 18th of 2007. We’ve purchased a property in a joint venture with a retail developer and the property will be developed as a mixed used retail residential deal. On land held for future development, we have moved City Place in San Diego from the pre-development projects to land held for future development. We received entitlements late last year in the process of completing working drawings and bidding out the job. The property’s current leased month to month as a parking lot and we are bidding the construction costs at this time.  We anticipate a fairly dramatic drop in construction costs in San Diego due to market conditions, and if our assumption is correct, we plan on taking advantage of it. If we are correct in our assumptions, we should be moving this back into the development pipeline in the next few quarters and would deliver it into operations in mid to late 2010, a time frame we think the hang-over of any potential San Diego shadow pipeline will be over. On Park Boulevard, we are in the process of completing our entitlements and have entered into an agreement to sell the property for $10.9 million. Our current basis in $6.9 million. We have received a non-refundable option payment from the buyer in the amount of $436,000. In conclusion, development is not getting any easier in our markets, only more difficult and fraught with constraints from economic, political and geographic barriers to pencil a deal.  The average time from identification of the site to stabilization has increased from probably the mid four-year range to the mid five-year range in my opinion. In my 30 years in the business at no time has it been more difficult to get apartment development deals done from site identification to stabilization than today. Our barriers of entry are strong as they ever have been, and I doubt it will change in the near future.  On our greening efforts of our pipeline we have acquiesced to lean into the rapidly changing political environment, and are doing everything we can to label ourselves green, which are revenue neutral and are considering all of our options on a case by case value added approach.  The perception of green efforts by our society and specifically our current and future tenants, we believe will continue to evolve to save the Polar Bears in the future, and we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of the marketing edge it will give us.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mike Schall. 
Michael Schall:  Thank you John and thanks everyone for being with us today. Once again, as you know, we had a strong quarter operationally. As expected, Northern California and Seattle continue to produce superior results that were well above our 2007 guidance. In Northern California we had a 13.5% increase in property revenues and 2.3% sequential growth. In Seattle, we reported a 10.7% revenue growth and 2.2% sequential growth. In Southern California we continue to see deterioration in operating performance, attributable to increasing multi-family supply in several submarkets and moderating job growth, and a few examples of significant work force reduction. Countrywide and Amgen immediately come to mind. Overall, for the year we generated 6.5% revenue growth representing the high end of the original guidance range and 7.9% NOI growth for the same property portfolio. Operating expenses grew at 4.1% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date slightly above our guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. The expense growth above guidance was principally due to a $1.1 million or 6.2% increase in expenses for the year and $509,000 8.7% for the quarter in Northern California.  The increase above guidance was due wage pressures, accrual adjustments that affected the entire Northern California portfolio and assets specific issues at three properties dealing with estimates of repair and maintenance, cost, and property taxes. Before reviewing each market in greater detail, I’d like to highlight improvements in our operating platform. First, we continue to work on the migration of our GL and property management systems to Yardi. Currently over half our properties have been converted to Yardi versus 30% of the properties at the end of last quarter, and we still expect the primary conversion effort to be completed in mid 2008. In addition, we are now running YieldStar’s Price Optimizer at 17 properties.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. The conference will resume shortly. (Operator Instructions)
Michael Schall: Hi. This is Mike Schall again. Sorry about that. Not sure what happened. I’m not sure exactly where this, the conference got cut off. But I’ll go back and pick up from where I think it left off.  I was talking about operating improvements to our platform here and had commented that over half our properties have now been converted to Yardi, that’s our new property management accounting system, versus 30% last year. In addition, we are now running a price optimizer, YieldStar at 17 properties and we have implemented call center support that also is in operation at 17 properties at this point in time. Both of those are scheduled for company-wide roll out up this year.  We scaled back unit turns in the seasonally weaker fourth quarter and reduced average time it takes to rehab an apartment unit. As a result, the quarterly results reflect a reduction in rehab related vacancy to 394,000 for the quarter of which 122,000 was included in the same store results.  Loss to lease, which estimate the difference between market and in-place rents without regard to concessions, declined to $8.6 million. 2.3% is scheduled rent from $13.5 million or 3.5% as of September 30th, 2007. The reduction is largely attributable to weaker conditions in Southern California and seasonal weakness and its impact on rent at the end of the fourth quarter with the largest overall reductions in Seattle and Southern Cal.  Now I’d like to briefly review each major part of the portfolio, starting in the Northwest. Seattle, as you know, continued its strong performance and has probably one of the best multi-family markets in the nation. All submarkets are participating. Construction of new multi-family properties, both apartments and condos, remain our primary concern as some properties are now actively in lease-up. So far these lease-ups have had little impact on our portfolio, which is expected to continue as long as the current level of job growth is sustained. We improved financial occupancy in Seattle both sequentially and year over year by limiting lease explorations in December at most properties to 3%. Reflecting the strength of Seattle market physical occupancy as of January 28, 2008 in Seattle was 97.6 net availability. 3.3% home purchase activity in the Seattle area represented 18% of move outs for the quarter compared to 19.5% the prior quarter.  We reported the sale of our Portland properties in the fourth quarter, so I’ll no longer comment on that market. In Northern California, the portfolio led the company in the fourth quarter with 13.5% revenue growth in financial occupancy at 97.5%. This reflects the inclusion of our 697 unit Hillsdale Garden Property for the first time. That property is located San Mateo. It contributed a 29% increase in same property revenues for the quarter. So it helped move the overall result up.  All submarkets in Northern California continued to perform well. As of January 28, physical occupancy was 97.2% in Northern Cal, net availability at 4.5%. Home purchases represented nearly 16% of our turns for the quarter compared to 13% for the same quarter a year ago.  Now to Southern California, conditions have moderated in Southern California, reflecting limited demand growth, in many cases insufficient relative to the new supply. As stated before, development deliveries in Ventura County, Inland Empire, and certain parts in LA and Orange Counties are having difficulty reaching stabilized occupancy, pressuring rental rates and increasing concessions.  In total our Southern California portfolio generated 2.2% revenue growth in Q4 versus the prior year, and 0.6% sequential growth. Our Southern California results were impacted by a 0.6% or $369,000 drop in same property financial occupancy and $152,000 increase in same property concessions compared to Q4 2006. Physical occupancy as of January 28, 2008 in LA, Ventura, was 95.1 with net availability 6.3%.  In Orange County physical occupancy 95.1%, net availably 5.9% and in San Diego 95.6% physical occupancy; net availability at 8.2%. Move out activity attributable to home purchases increased modestly in each of our Southern California metro areas. I’d like to thank you for joining us and would like to turn the call over to Mike Dance. 
Michael Dance: Thanks Mike. My comments today will review our 2007 results, provide some color to the 2008 guidance and highlight the strength of our balance sheet and debt capacity.  In the fourth quarter we missed the First Call consensus estimate from funds from operations due to an impairment charge of $500,000 related to a loan for a condo conversion in Sherman Oaks. Even with this charged FFO we did exceed the low end of the guidance we provided on the third quarter conference call. Given the current over supply of unsold homes, slowing velocity and declining home prices we have postponed the construction of our two remaining condo developments until the housing market recovers.  We stopped occurring interest income on the loan to the condo converter in third quarter and discontinued interest capitalization on the 90 (Arch) and Viewpoint condo development in Q4. After excluding non recurring items such as impairments and other income and expense items, recurring funds from operations for the year ending 2007 was $5.20 per diluted share, an increase of 12.7% over the $4.62 reported in 2006.  The 2007 results were primarily achieved with the increase in net operating income from the same property portfolio of 7.9%. During 2007, same property scheduled grants improved by $20.4 million or 7.3% increase over 2006. The 2007 same property vacancy lost increased by $2.3 million, which included rehab vacancy from approximately 300 units taken offline during 2007 to renovate kitchens and baths. The 2008 guidance assumes a continuation of the strategic unit turned program and approximately $750,000 in rehab vacancy in the same store portfolio in 2008.  In 2007, the Southern California market saw an increase in rental concessions of almost $500,000 compared to 2006. The 2008 guidance assumes $1 million in rental concessions in the same property portfolio.  Our 2008 guidance uses published economic forecast of job growth and new housing supply to estimate rental demands and property rents by market. The 2008 growth in rental income for the same property portfolio is expected to increase by between to 3-4.5%. In 2007, the year over year same property operating expenses increased by 3.7%, slightly higher than the high end of the original guidance range of 3.5%.  The 2008 guidance assumes that property operating expenses will be between 2.5% to 4%. General administrative expenses in 2007, totaled 26.3 million or $2.3 million higher than our original guidance. The increase was a result of the primarily three items. One, we had a performance based cash bonus that I discussed on the last call that was paid based on the strong 2007 results. We had additional expenses associated with the granting of an equity based performance award. And we had a write off of several projects in the pipeline that were abandoned in the fourth quarter.  The 2008 guidance assumes no increase in general administrative expenses as the performance base cash bonus will be replaced by the out performance plan. And other increases in our G&A expenses in 2008 will be offset by allocations of property management overhead, the property operations in the form of additional property management fees, which are included in the guidance for 2008’s property operating expenses.  We are starting 2008 with over 96% financial occupancy with modest concessions in some markets and rents being flat in Ventura County and growing as high as 7% in Seattle and Northern California. We estimate that 2008 funds for operations per diluted share will range from $5.85 to $6.15.  The midpoint in our 2008 guidance assumes an increase in net operating income of 4.5%. To achieve the high end of the guidance, net operating income growth will need to be approximately 5.8% and we will need to generate additional non recurring income in addition to the other income of $0.23 per diluted share realized from a transaction that closed in 2008.  We’re assuming that any impairments on abandoned projects in 2008 will be insignificant to the 2008 results. The 2008 development activity is expected to be approximately $150 million, for both construction and land acquisition costs, which will be funded by our bank facility. An additional $50 million in development cost for fund two’s construction activities will use fund two as a construction financing.  We will not be providing quarterly guidance in 2008, but hopefully the following narrative will enable reconciliation between our fourth quarter 2007 results and what we expect the recurring funds from operations, without onetime items, will be in 2008. On S3 we have disclosed recurring funds from operations that $1.26 per diluted share. On S7, footnote one; we have disclosed supplemental property taxes that were accrued in the fourth quarter but related to prior periods of $1.1 million. We incurred a disproportionate amount of G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 that will be recognized ratably throughout 2008 which is a difference of $1,250,000.  As a result of restructuring our taxable re-subsidiaries, the fourth quarter tax provision of $400,000 is expected to be an immaterial accrual in 2008. Also included in other expenses in the fourth quarter is a $300,000 business tax, related to the sale of the assets at Lake Merit to a condo converter in 2005. These fourth quarter adjustments totaling $3 million will add $0.11 per share to the FFO run-rate of a $1.26 reported in the fourth quarter 2007 or a starting run-rate of $1.37 in the first quarter of 2008.  The mid point in guidance assumes a growth rate from recurring sources of funds from operations to increase by 11% over the 2007 results of $1.30 per quarter or an average of $1.44 per quarter during 2008 for total recurring funds from operations of approximately $5.77 per diluted share. In our 2008 guidance, we stated that the combination of the cessation of interest capitalized and the additional operating costs expected by the leasing up of the two development projects will result in a reduction to our 2008 FFO of approximately $1 million.  We expect this dilution or reduced FFO in the second quarter 2008 by $0.03 and by $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2008. These assets are expected to reach 95% occupancy by the end of 2008, so most of the external growth in the funds from operations run-rate are internal growth and external growth will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2008.  Over the last five or six months we have gotten a number of questions concerning our access to capital to fund our external growth. As of December 31, 2007 our debt to total market capitalization is about 36% using the stock price at year-end. Using debt to total market capitalization as one metric to measure our debt capacity, we can add an additional $400 million to our current debt and still have a strong balance sheet with debt to total market capitalization of 41%. We are well within all our cash flow and debt service covers ratios on the covenant for our $200 million unsecured bank facility and we can expand the accordion feature on that facility to $350 million.  In January 2008, we obtained $49.9 million of ten year fixed rate financing at 5.21% which is secure by our Southern California assets. About 30% of our non-operating income is currently unencumbered and we see $100 million of 2008 fixed rate debt maturities as an opportunity to refinance these assets at rates less than the current rate of 6.8%, and to either take out additional proceeds from this refinancing, or add additional assets to the unencumbered pool.  This concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call back to the operator for any questions.  
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan:  Thank you. I have a question about the impairment you took on the mezzanine note, maybe this also relates to the rest of the notes that you have on your balance sheet. What's next in this instance? What exactly happened there that you are writing it down and is it recoverable, do you go after the property? Can you just walk through what's next there?
Michael Dance: The next is, we are currently discussing the borrower a plan for them to exit in the best interests of both parties. They have some ability to sell units but the reason for the impairment is the slowing velocity and the marketing costs that are incurred as the units are sold. So, prices have held, it's just a slowing of velocity. But we're looking at alternatives such as maybe an auction or looking at marketing plans. There is a possibility of recovering some of it. But that would probably not be until 2009. 
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan: So does the impairment reflect in this instance reduction in what the face value was expected to be?
Michael Dance: It basically reverses the interest we accrued in first and second quarter of 2007. So we still expect to recover our total principal.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan: Okay, understood. Another question, moving into southern California. Can you talk about how, you mentioned I think in your commentary, that you've actually seen some weakness even in parts of Los Angeles. Can you elaborate on that and give us a sense of just how that market's holding up?
Michael Schall: Yeah, there's a couple of places in LA County that are weak right now and clearly Keith mentioned about the northern part of LA County that we're not in, Palmdale, Santa Clarita Valley, Valencia area. But in addition it's not just limited to that. I'll give you Woodland Hills for example, I've commented on before. Arch don't have the lease-up deal there, Morgan Group does. ABB had a deal coming online here very soon and there isn’t the demand to absorb those units in the very short-term and so you are in a concessionary one-two month concession type of market and temporarily until those units are leased up, which is expected to be a pretty significantly long period, I think those markets will be soft. So, LA County, having said that, LA County is a huge county. There is a lot of different separate sub-markets within LA County. Keith talked about the stronger ones. Certainly Westside, LA, but at the same time there are some weak parts of LA County as well. 
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan:   Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Litt of Citi, please proceed. 
Unidentified Analyst :  Hi, it's Greg (inaudible) here with John. The 2% job growth, sorry the GDP growth figure that’s underlying your assumptions seems a little high relative to some other expectations out there. How much does that impact the year specific market outlooks?
Keith Guericke: John is here and he can talk a little bit about how we got there. But I think, one of the things that we have going for us is that's the national GDP look and I think that we've got some markets, specially in Northern California and Seattle which are going to perform better than the national average. So, I think that we've taken into consideration the impact of the individual markets. For example, if you look at our forecasts we've got zero rent growth forecasts for Ventura County which is about 2200, 2300 units that we have in our portfolio. So, we've tried to be sensitive to the fact that each of our submarkets has different supply issues, has different job and growth issues and again the majority of the strength is coming from Seattle and Northern California. I don’t know if that answers your question exactly but the point I'm trying to make is that we're sensitive to the submarkets and we're not thinking that we're going to see great strength across the portfolio. 
Unidentified Analyst : And in terms of the 6.2% revenue growth in the fourth quarter versus the guidance from the full year next year of 3-4.5% how should we expect that year-over-year growth to trend in '08? Are we going to see a number in the fives in early '08 or is it going to come down pretty quickly in '08?
John Eudy: I wouldn’t expect it to - as you know this is a momentum business and things don’t change greatly from quarter to quarter. So, I would expect it to moderate a bit from the 6.2% in Q4. But in this business the first quarter tends to have a little seasonality to it so I would expect it to moderate a bit. And then hopefully we have a good summer and still, exactly how all that plays out, I can't predict to that level of certainty, so I expect it to be pretty flat throughout the year, bottom line. 
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of UBS. Please proceed.
Alexander Goldfarb - UBS: Good morning. I just want to go to the line of credit comments. If you could just remind us which one has the accordion to $350 million and then also any sense of the two lines of credit that are going to mature? I think one's in a few months and one's within the next 12 months. Any sense whether the terms on those credit lines may materially change?
Michael Dance: This is Mike. Hi, Alex. The line that has the accordion feature is the bank facility which is the unsecured line. The both lines come due in 2009, so the secured facility with Freddie, I think is a January 2009. We have started discussions with them as well as with Fannie. And we believe there to be some increase in the spread that we're currently. But not significantly be going from 55 to 75. And then the unsecured line with the bank group comes due in March 2009 but we can automatically extend that a year. 
Alexander Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. 
Keith Guericke: The 2008 maturity Alex is just a $10 million loan that's used temporarily, so it's not material. 
Alexander Goldfarb - UBS: Okay, so really, given the accordion feature you're not really 55% drawn. You've got more capacity. And then when you refinance that you'd be looking to increase it above the 350 or you think that 350 is a comfortable amount for you guys?
Michael Dance: Our philosophy is pretty much matching capital with our investments so we like the $200 million from a discipline standpoint of going out and finding secured financing like we did in January with the southern California mortgage, but we have the ability to increase it to $350 million which is the point I'm trying to make if we see opportunities in the market. 
Alexander Goldfarb - UBS: And then my second question goes to the Cap rate comment Keith, I think you were talking about. You commented about an increase of 25-50 basis points but at the same time commented that there is very little transactions going on. I just wanted to get a sense for how the increase in cap rates is - what's that based on?
Keith Guericke: Well I think it's based on partly our activity and what we're doing. We’ve actually done a transaction in the first quarter. It hasn’t closed and so we generally don’t comment on those, but the transaction that we've done and we've gotten contracted is at a cap rate that we would not have seen two quarters ago. That's evidence. The other evidence we have is that there are no transactions happening. So buyers and sellers, there is a disconnect between buyers and sellers and so clearly the things we are seeing is cap rates are slightly up and I think that there is not a lot of transactions in the marketplace but I think that part of the reason there aren’t is there is a disconnect in the cap rates and you're going to see that - we think that the buyers are going to demand a little bit higher cap rate and ultimately that's where it's going to shake out. 
Alexander Goldfarb - UBS: Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford of KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Hi, I have two questions. First is do you have any thoughts as to implications as to a potential Yahoo - Microsoft combination would have on jobs in any of your markets?
Keith Guericke: Right off the bat, no. There's no clear indication from either side whether there'd be cutbacks or not. We expect slight cutbacks at yahoo but not materially enough to slow down the (San Jose) markets. 
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Second question in your '08 guidance release you talked about making some dispositions between $100 and $200 million and using the proceeds to fund acquisitions in San Francisco and Seattle, and the stock repurchase. Can you just talk about given where pricing is and between those three options which - between Seattle, Northern California and the repurchases which you guys are targeting more these days. 
Keith Guericke: Again, I think we were not specific in our guidance because frankly we are going to do what's best for us at the time. If we could see our stock at levels that are where they are at, or below today, we will be more aggressive on the stock repurchase. If cap rates are 25-50 basis points better given the better growth in Northern California and Seattle, we're going to push on that. So, I think we are going to try and be as optimistic as possible which just means that we are going to have to evaluate our options as we go. But I think generally, what we've done in the stock repurchase program, if we can do that or slightly better, we will continue to maybe do another 25-50 million there but I think that's about as good as I'm going to do for you right now. 
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Biffert of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs:  Looking at your submarkets, I'm wondering if you are seeing any distressed opportunities on behalf of merchant builders and if you guys are going to set aside any capital? You had said before that you had added that accordion onto your line as well. Would you use that to invest in the distressed opportunities?
Keith Guericke: Well, I think, John Eudy in his comments talked about that we have not seen a opportunity to take a condo-deal and make it work on the apartment side. If you look at the real distress the homebuilders, and the majority of the big tracts of land that the homebuilders have and that you’re seeing talked about where they’re disposing those - those are generally out in the valleys around in Sacramento Valley, they're out in the Inland Empire, they’re out in the Valencia area. They’re in markets that we aren’t going to be in. So, those really aren’t going to - I don’t think we’re going to have a lot of benefits.  We continue to look at the infield situations and monitor them, but I think they were at such levels as John said we just haven’t been able to make any of those underwrite as an apartment. We continue to look at them and we continue to look at some broken condos we’re looking at those and unfortunately there aren’t a lot of those, fortunately or unfortunately, there’s not a lot of opportunities there, but we are looking at that with respect to existing product that’s been built, not sold, and especially if it's done as a separate phase where there aren’t a lot of owners involved, where we can get in and make the deal work, we’re looking at those. But again as I said the only market that there’s a lot of that in and there really isn’t much is San Diego. Northern California we don’t have a lot of exposure and generally in LA there’s not a lot of exposure. Seattle there’s been a significant number of condos done, but generally there hasn’t been any stress out there yet so we haven’t seen anything there.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Okay, so in your comments you had mentioned that in Seattle the single-family housing supply is actually shrinking. What’s driving that?
Keith Guericke: I don’t think I said it was shrinking, I think I said that the amount of new - that what’s happening with respect to the deliveries that the multi-family side has actually grown a little bit, but what we’re seeing is we’re seeing the deliveries on the single-family side fall back so even though that in Seattle we’ve got permits at about 1.3% on the single-family side we’re not going to see all of that delivered so that’s shrinking, so it’s the deliveries that are shrinking not the existing stock. 
John Eudy: And part of that is they’re approaching build outs in parts of King County so we’re not seeing any shrinking in the north end of Snohomish but it's in the builtup part of King County primarily. 
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and lastly your decision to pull out of the Portland market and I’m sorry if you already said this before, but I was just curious, you had mentioned that there was a portable housing coming into the market competing with your rentals and I’m wondering what that spread is, does that speak to the entire market or is that just the sub-markets that you guys are in?
Keith Guericke: I think it speaks to the entire market because even if you have a significant submarket, Portland Metro is not that big, so even if you have a specific area, we have more affordable housing, that’s going to have some impact to depress housing values overall. But if I go back, maybe speak about the original premise in Portland which is that it was, we believe, protected by an urban growth boundary and that as soon as most of the developable sites, housing sites, were built out within the urban growth boundary that the tree-hugging Oregonians would respect it and would take on more of a supply constrained market characteristics. So we understood that there was more supply in the Portland market but we thought that we would invest into that with the expectation of it becoming more like a California or a Seattle market over the long haul. And then I think it was what John said, maybe a year ago or so that rather than respecting the urban growth boundary they blew out, the grow out boundary expanded it and very significantly which sort of wrecked our investment thesis on Portland so then we, from that point, rents were extremely low at that point. I think there were one-bedroom rents were $499 as I recall at one point, so we wanted to let the market recover a bit before we exited. So, we looked for an exit at that point in time once our investment thesis on Portland was proven incorrect.
Mark Biffert - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzle with Banc of America please proceed. 
Dustin Pizzle - Banc of America Securities : Thank you, Keith just going back to some of your opening comments where you were referencing the rents and where they are now relative to the historic and median income, were you talking about your rents or the market rents?
Keith Guericke: I was talking about market rents but our rents are in the market, but that was a market rent comment.
Dustin Pizzle - Banc of America Securities: Okay, so, so given that and where your rents are relative to some of your peers. I mean I would argue they’re roughly 20% below in some cases, I mean how do you think that changes the competitive dynamic do you think it’s a benefit to you?
Keith Guericke: I think that our B product in A markets has been - over the long-term we’ve got a lot of demand because in the A markets, we define A markets as markets that are infield that are close to jobs, we’ve got a demand for those and we are, our pricing it as you say, less than some of our competitors. So I see that as a positive and I see that as strengthening our ability to move the rents that we’re talking about this year. 
Dustin Pizzle - Banc of America Securities : Okay and then just going back to the development pipeline quickly. Did you mention why the delay occurred at Belmont Station?
Michael Schall: No, I didn’t get into it. It's a high density 135 units of the acres deal and in working with the fire marshals and splitting the first base and the second there are some issues that we thought we could do to deliver units earlier in the first phase of 90 some odd units that we ended up not being able to execute on and just a complicated deal. I could go on for hours and I’d put more people on it and we’re there now for an April delivery.
Keith Guericke: So, it’s not so much that the project as a whole has slowed down we were going to be able to deliver the first phase and now we’re going to deliver this one phase as opposed to the two phases and that's the primary bugaboo. 
Dustin Pizzle - Banc of America Securities. : Okay, Makes Sense. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste of Green Street Advisors, please proceed.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors : Good morning. Keith in your comments about cap rates and positive leverage involvement, I wanted to get your current view on fund, a possible fund three.
Keith Guericke: We’re talking about it, we’re looking at it again it’s really an issue of having everything line up it’s having the leverage line up, the opportunities line up, and the expectations on the investors line up and I think that as you know the IR hurdles that we had in our fund, Fund I and Fund II were in the mid- to high-teens. We have a cadre of investors that we like and I would probably go back to them just because it would be simple to raise the fund. I’m not sure and we’ve talked to them - I’m not sure that their expectations for hurdles have come down much and I don’t know that we could necessarily deliver mid- to high-teens returns in today’s world so we continue monitoring that and when we can line up the opportunities and the expectations on the capital side we will probably pull the trigger on that.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors : Okay fair, enough. Quick follow up for John. You mentioned, that you expect construction cost to come down considerably in San Diego. What specifically are you seeing there. Could you give us more color on that thought?
John Eudy : Well we’re in the middle of buying out the deal down there and what we have found is the amount of sub-activity coming at us, people that are interested in the deal, is more than I’ve seen in the last five or six years in any home markets. And with lumber now at a seven year low and people very, very hungry in the constructions site cause what’s going in the home building business that usually leads to a very, very competitive environment. Labor side of the equation over the last three years was a bigger jump than the commodity side and because of that we believe there’s going to be a move in our favor. It’s the right time to buy a deal out donor. 
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors : Okay, guys that’s all I have thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets please proceed
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets : Thanks, Good Morning to you guys. Just a quick modeling question in the 500,000 impairment is that in the 800,000 other expenses? 
Keith Guericke: Yes, and the 300,000 I mentioned for the Oakland business tax that surprised us. 
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, I missed that. And what also contributed to the big ad backs this quarter in minority’s interest?
Michael Schall: The sale of Portland. Go to our S-13 and you’ll see it back there. 
Richard Anderson, BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Now the bigger picture question is on CapEx. You’re talking in your guidance of $950 a door. That sort of surprised me thinking that CapEx would be coming down. Could you talk about sort of what the change of heart is from a recurring CapEx standpoint. 
Keith Guericke: You know Rich, it’s just a continuation of some of things we saw last year which is we’re still - we fixed a lot of things in 2007, but we’re not done yet. So, we’re projecting that 2008 will be another stronger year in terms of CapEx just to continue to fix some portfolio and it reflects the fact that we just didn’t do enough in the three to four years preceding 2007.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and then just one quick one, you mentioned development costs in some cases looking like they’re reigning in a little bit. What gives you comfort that that won’t continue to go down such that some of your real-estate competitors' developers might be more inclined to add products say not maybe not immediately because of the high barrier to entry nature of your markets, but maybe a year or two from now you start to see an uptake in development. Is that something that you’re watching and concerned about?
Keith Guericke: We’re watching it closely, but the amount of the change that I was referring to is (deminimus) overall. Instead of going up it might go down 5 or 7% not enough to spur any real activity. It’s the point, was the increases that we’ve seen all in the last three years I think in the near term are evaded.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt (Dinchek) of Irving. Please proceed 
Unidentified Analyst - Irving: Hi, I want to follow up on Karin’s question I was curious in your estimation if you think that there’s a positive arbitrage between your targeted disposition mostly in Southern California and your share price?
Keith Guericke: Yeah, if you look at our guidance for ’08 at just the mid-point and you look at our current share price there’s an arbitrage there. And I think that some of the stuff we’re looking at selling - we’ve got one property listed right now that we expect to sell in the low five cap rate range, if we’re successful there would be a very large arbitrage in that situation.
Unidentified Analyst - Irving: Okay at these levels would it make sense to increase leverage at all to do more repurchasing?
Keith Guericke: You know we struggle with that. We’ve got an on going business to run, we are very sensitive to leverage and if our stock price goes to 85, heck yes, if our product stock price is at our current level I think we’re going to be more sensitive to looking at dispositions and repurchases.
Unidentified Analyst - Irving: Okay and I guess lastly, I was curious to post 2008, what do you think an appropriate normal CapEx for your portfolio? 
Keith Guericke: I would think it would be in the 750-800 range.
Unidentified Analyst - Irving: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird please proceed. 
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: Thank you very much. I’d like to understand a little bit better your description about what’s happening with G&A expenses, in particular the reasons that they were higher in the fourth quarter and if you expect that to be a sustainable run rate.
Michael Dance: Okay, in the fourth quarter the competition committee did approve an extra cash bonus and that will not reoccur in 2008 primarily cause in December we announced that our performance plan that would basically take what we booked in the fourth quarter and had it ratably accrue in 2008. Also we had a significant number of projects that had capitalized costs that we abandoned in the fourth quarter. That again typically occurs ratably but with our lower stock price things may have penciled with a higher stock price didn’t pencil with a $100 stock price, so we walked away from some deals. And then the other item if you look at we’re pretty transparent on what we take in G&A and allocate back to the properties in the form of management fees. That covers our some of our IT costs, HR and our regional portfolio managers.  If you look at what we do compared to our peers we’re only allocating at 1.5%. Over time, I see as we continue to add technology and other resources in the corporate office that the properties will benefit from to increase that over time. So in 2008 I think we can operate at the same level of G&A that we incurred in 2007, but it will occur ratably over the four quarters rather than all in the fourth quarter. 
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: That’s helpful thank you. Can you talk also about any trend differentiation you’re seeing across the markets in terms of the reasons for move out aside to home ownership?
Michael Schall:  We’ve studied that a bit. I don’t see any huge trends that have really emerged that are helping us. I mentioned home purchases; we track military exposure in San Diego, we track bullet employees, we track lots of different things, there’s nothing that you can really say “Oh G” this is an overriding factor that is having a dramatic impact on us. I don’t think that we see a change really in the business, the same dynamics continue that have continued last year, we’re still pretty strong in Seattle, in Northern California; Southern California has more moving parts. We track what’s going in Amgen for example, I don’t know what’s going to happen to Countrywide, that becomes a question mark for us. I don’t see any discernable patterns that are going to have and I can just say “hey this is a new thing that’s happening out here that’s going to have significant impact on the portfolio.” I just haven’t seen that. 
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and on some of the later stage development projects. Are you pleased or surprised by it in any way by the amount of pre-leasing activity that you’re seeing? 
Keith Guericke: So far the only one that’s actually at pre leasing activity that’s open is the deal in Seattle. It’s very, very strong.
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: Better than what you would’ve expected
Keith Guericke:  Yes
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: Lastly, I can’t let the save the polar bears comment go by.
Michael Dance : It was a little tongue in cheek. 
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: I loved it, it was great. I love to hear about what some of those efforts are in terms of helping label the company more green friendly. 
Michael Dance:  First off, let me give the reasons in a little bit more detail. Every city at least in California and the State of Washington in an agency that we deal with that gives entitlements has jumped on that band wagon big time. It’s really important for everyone to go in that direction because you’re going to be forced there in any event. We’re trying to be a little had that occurred. This has only really occurred in the last six to nine months for the velocity it has. It’s the reality we’re having to deal with, we’re embracing it.  As far as specifically what we’re doing, the practices in the field that you apply when you're doing the drawings that you can change to be more green than not, are really adapting your protocol more than you are actually spending money on anything. For the lack of better words, spinning it in the right direction. We have an internal guy, he’s just about to be league certified and he’s building green about to be certified so we’re following it in into the greenest revenue neutral, we’re doing everything possible into the degree that it's an active system, it costs money and we’re evaluating case by case.  But I think by the end of this year everything you’ll see we come out on the marketing side on the new developments will take that to heart. In those of you that have kids in their early twenties, you know what’s happening. it’s a total different look they perceive the green issues, than maybe some people who are old like myself, we think it's going to be a good marketing thing too.
Paula Poskin - Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Salinsky- RBC Capital Markets:  Good morning guys. Keith in your opening comments, when you’re talking about cap rates. I thought you had mentioned something that you expect a transaction activity to pick up in the later part of the year. What do you think is the driver behind that?
Keith Guericke:  I’m not sure but basically in preparation for the call I talked to - we have acquisition people in each of our markets. I talked to all of them, and they all see significant numbers of new listings hitting the marketplace which is factual. The types of things that are being listed are from many different sources, so I suspect there’s those who have a fear of what’s going to happen in the future and they’re looking for an exit. I suspect there are a number of fund assets that are owned out there that have an IRR clock ticking so if they could get out now and turn the clock off that’s beneficial to them. But I don’t think that there’s any one reason driving what’s going on. 
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Second. You took the impairment charge in Sherman Oaks and you also stopped capitalizing a number of projects there at the end of the third quarter. Is there any further risk for an impairment charge or expenses or anything like that?
Keith Guericke: Our bases on these are still pretty attractive, so it doesn’t - meaning that our total cost invested is a very modest amount, so we see them as land held, all well-located. They’re close to other assets and markets that we track and follow. So I think it’s just a matter of either seeing further declines in construction costs or recovery in the housing market. And basically, just keep it on the balance sheet because there will be a time where we can get significant return from it, just not right now. 
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And finally in your comments you mentioned that with the Yardi rollout and the YieldStar optimizer there that you’re rolling out, you had 17 properties. Can you talk about the performance of those 17 properties versus those of your core portfolio?
Keith Guericke:  We track it internally. We pick properties that are across the street from, or down the street from other non-YieldStar properties. We’ve conducted the price optimizer tests over probably better than a year now. So, big picture, they would tell you, the industry would tell you, or the marketers of those pieces of software would tell you that 2-3% revenue pickup. I would guess that - we haven’t factored that in, we think that’s probably a little aggressive, but we certainly think that 1-2% is definitely feasible. It just does a superior job of understanding by unit type the dynamics of both your inventory and your current vacancy occupancy situation. So there is definitely some advantage there. We’re thinking it’s 1-2%. 
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Then I think you’d mentioned too you had a transaction you were looking at in the first quarter of the year. On that, in your full-year guidance, I think it says 100 million. Is there upside to that? Am I reading that correctly?
Keith Guericke: You’re talking about on the acquisition side?
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: On the acquisition side, correct. 
Keith Guericke: That is a fairly small transaction. It’s about a $20 million transaction. Again, it’s a matter of cost of capital with other alternatives and opportunities we have. Given our share price, etcetera, I think we’re going to look at spreading our dollars between share buy back acquisitions and development, whichever is going to give us the greatest returns. Right now that’s how we’ve allocated - we think that’s what’s going to happen for the year. But if things change during the year obviously we can change those allocations fairly quickly. 
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please proceed.
William Crow - Raymond James Financial Inc.: Good morning guys. People generalize and say that half of your portfolio is within Southern California and that’s getting painted with an ugly brush these days. If you were to rate Southern California between the good markets, let’s call it west LA, and the really bad markets, Inland Empire, at the other extreme, and maybe in between is San Diego, what percentage in Southern California are in good markets as you look to 2008? What percentage is in bad markets?
Keith Guericke: Looking at our portfolio, you mean?
William Crow - Raymond James Financial Inc.: Your portfolio. 
Keith Guericke: Well, there’s a breakdown of units on S-8, for example, so I’ll use that as a guide. Ventura County looks pretty tough. And actually there’s some other data in here that gives you the market rent forecast, which is flat in that market. So Ventura I would say is flat. LA County I’d say our properties are two thirds roughly - I’m pulling this off the top of my head - two thirds strong, maybe one third not strong. The one third not strong would be the Woodland Hills area; more the Pasadena area has some lease up activity. Those would represent - maybe it’s not correct, maybe it’s 75%, 25%, that’s probably it, 75, 25 maybe. Orange County - North Orange is stronger than South Orange. I’d say we’ve got some properties in the beach communities which are strong, so I’d say we are probably two thirds good Orange County, two thirds to three quarters good, maybe one quarter not so good. San Diego County, I think is kind of all. I think all is pretty similar. I don’t think there’s more of a good-bad part of San Diego County. And then you just have pieces in others. Riverside County, that I would say is all not good. All of Riverside County is not good. All of Santa Barbara County is good. That’s only 200 units. Anyone else want to comment on that? No.
William Crow - Raymond James Financial Inc.: That’s all. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.
